1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,338
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,634
We're gonna have a baby.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,535
I know.

4
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,180
You're not going. I don't
care what Dr. Cruella says.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,248
- You must have impressed Albright.
- How?

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,131
You've been accepted
to surgical elective.

7
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:18,715
Really?

8
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,515
Because your husband's put
out a missing persons report.

9
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,520
I haven't seen her.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,818
I can see what's going
on, and it's pretty low.

11
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,258
How long before I'm walking
with my testicles in a jar?

12
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,192
- You tell me.
- Vicky, Vic, Vic.

13
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,390
Ooh. I love you.

14
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,900
We have no Attending. Clemente
hasn't showed, and can't be reached.

15
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:45,102
Intractable hiccups, on his way.
Self-tanner ingestion's waiting on tox.

16
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,646
Freaky nail-gun girl needs
Keflex and psych consult.

17
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:48,975
Freaky nail-gun girl?

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,311
Yeah, performance artist.
You do not wanna know.

19
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,044
Dr. Pratt, who's the lucky lady?

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,349
No, it's nothing like that. Just
a charity event I gotta attend to.

21
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,288
Don't you be coy, Pratt.
Chicago's 50 hottest bachelors...

22
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,860
are auctioned to benefit
Chicago Health Coalition.

23
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:02,711
Impressive.

24
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:05,124
I, the 51st bachelor,
didn't make the cut.

25
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,359
- How does Olivia feel about this?
- About what?

26
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,730
That someone's buying
a date with her boyfriend.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,737
I wouldn't put it that way.
It's a good cause, she's cool.

28
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,807
Really? Your
African-American girlfriend...

29
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,467
is cool with her boyfriend
being put up on the block...

30
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,510
for rich white women to bid on?

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,478
Take it easy, Angela Davis.

32
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,742
How do you know
they're all white? See you.

33
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,352
- Who's our Attending?
- Got a moonlighter, thank God.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,183
What? They're useless. They
never know how anything works.

35
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,520
Exactly. I conned the guy yesterday
into buying dinner for the staff.

36
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,322
- That eggplant was delicious.
- That's great. What else?

37
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,158
- Tape a "kick me" sign to his back?
- Wasn't that awesome?

38
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,765
Is Clemente ever coming back?

39
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,027
- He's missed, like, three shifts.
- Four.

40
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,034
- Hope he's okay.
- Hey, you met Jodie.

41
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,604
I bet he's more than okay.

42
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,209
He's probably just
on a little holiday.

43
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:55,179
Fourteen-letter word
for "no higher form."

44
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,410
No higher form.

45
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,512
- Quintessence.
- Shut up.

46
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,715
Quintessence. Go
ahead, try it, bet you.

47
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,453
Okay, Q-U-I-N-T...

48
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,894
- Essence.
- Oh, my God, you're so smart.

49
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,726
How did you know that?

50
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,868
It's Shakespeare,
baby. Shakespeare.

51
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,597
O that is too too sullied
flesh would melt...

52
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,032
Shh, shh.

53
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,541
I'm hungry. What time is it?

54
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,734
Whoa.

55
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,549
It's time to get a
new bed, obviously.

56
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,878
No, I'm serious.

57
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,386
Oh, baby. What do you want
me to do? It's dark out, huh?

58
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,750
Okay.

59
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:44,159
Eight letters for "great haste."

60
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,232
Great haste, great haste...

61
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,199
Alacrity.

62
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,895
Do you wanna see a movie?

63
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,468
Um...

64
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,908
Yeah, I was thinking more
like in a movie theater?

65
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,741
TV's good.

66
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,611
- Vickie, come on.
- What?

67
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,480
It's been a week.

68
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,780
I think we can go outside now.

69
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:14,594
We got everything
we need right here.

70
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,363
Okay, eight-letter
word for "brisk."

71
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,509
Brisk, let me see, brisk, brisk.

72
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,177
Brisk. How about spanking?

73
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,372
Ow!

74
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,680
Quintessence. I don't
think quintessence fits.

75
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,416
- Three hundred.
- Three hundred.

76
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,686
- Three-twenty-five.
- Three-twenty-five.

77
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,557
- Four hundred.
- Easy, ladies, it's only dinner.

78
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,251
- Four-twenty-five.
- Four-twenty-five.

79
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,198
- Four-fifty.
- Four-fifty.

80
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,547
- Four-seventy-five.
- Four-seventy-five.

81
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,039
Four-ninety.

82
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,539
Four-ninety, 490 is the bid.

83
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,301
Do I hear higher? Anybody?

84
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,179
Six hundred. Six
hundred dollars.

85
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,561
Hot off the presses. A missive
from the long-lost Carter.

86
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,969
- Carter? Really?
- Finally found a stamp, huh?

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,109
Does he say why we
haven't heard from him?

88
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,041
- He's happy, he's busy.
- Or he just doesn't miss this place.

89
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,292
- Hard to imagine. MARQUEZ:
What's it say? How's Kem?

90
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,414
- Hold on. MORRIS: It's
called the ER for a reason.

91
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,247
ER residents get to do chest
tubes and lines. End of story.

92
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,514
Until your hack jobs get stuck and
you call us to do damage control.

93
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,009
Dr. Kovac, I need the
force of your authority here.

94
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,217
I'll read it later.

95
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,259
You don't see me
running to my Attending.

96
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,378
What's the problem?

97
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:31,489
Dr. Stalin here is
invading our turf again.

98
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,930
Wow, Morris, you're so
versed in world history.

99
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,729
You know what? In college, I
spent a semester in Germany.

100
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,397
Where we studied Russia.

101
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,044
See? I know all about Stalin.

102
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,279
Look, how do you expect my
residents to clean up your messes...

103
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,245
if you don't let
them get training?

104
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,611
Training for what?

105
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,447
- Slicing hemorrhoids and doing boob jobs?
- Excuse me?

106
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,454
What he's trying to say is only a
small percentage of your residents...

107
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,559
are ever gonna need any
trauma skills after they leave here.

108
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,559
- Yes, whereas our kids...
- Residents.

109
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,359
Need to be able to handle whatever
comes through. They need the practice.

110
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,796
Well, I'm with you there.

111
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,928
Okay, you know what, no need to
get cold. That was cold, wasn't it?

112
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,767
Yeah, that was a little cold.

113
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,533
Don't be such a sissy, Morris.

114
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,971
You know what? I need to
kick out my meth-mom in four.

115
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:24,574
- Dr. Kovac, please, consider what...
- Why don't you two work this out, okay?

116
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,243
- I'll be covering for Clemente today.
- Again?

117
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,753
And I have to stay off my
feet as much as possible.

118
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,118
Hip still bothering you?

119
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,318
- Little bit. Page me if it gets busy.
- We'll be fine, Kerry.

120
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,826
Hi, Dr. Weaver. WEAVER: Abby.

121
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,091
I consented sickle crisis for the
pain study and heme's on his way.

122
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,667
- Okay.
- We must log ER procedures for ACGME.

123
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:46,637
- So you've gotta share, Red, end of story.
- We should have Weaver chat with her.

124
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,640
- One bitch to another. ABBY:
I'm getting really sick of this.

125
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,802
Why does female plus tough
have to equal bitch around here?

126
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,814
You know what, Abby? I don't need
you to defend me, thank you very much.

127
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,283
I don't mind that guys think
I'm a bitch. I kind of like it.

128
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,183
At least they respect me.

129
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:07,726
Uh-huh. So if they don't think I'm a bitch,
does that mean they don't respect me?

130
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,621
- I got a hot appy waiting to be seen.
- Bitch.

131
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,165
- Exactly.
- Morris.

132
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,667
- Morning, folks.
- So, what price did you pull?

133
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,637
- Excuse me?
- Last night at the auction?

134
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,674
We did a pool. I had you at 320.

135
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,938
Once again, you underestimate
me, big man. I went high, 600 bucks.

136
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,809
- Hey, pretty good.
- That's right.

137
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:33,044
There were of lovely ladies willing to part
with their cash for date with the doctor.

138
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,778
- Nice.
- Only problem is...

139
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,447
that the winning
bidder was a dude.

140
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,183
A what?

141
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,123
I'm having dinner with a guy.

142
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:44,956
Is he cute?

143
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,259
He didn't stick around long
enough for me to meet him.

144
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,366
Well, it's for charity.

145
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,701
Look at the bright side.
Maybe he'll buy dinner.

146
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,207
As long as he doesn't
assume that means anything.

147
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,175
No means no, Greg, okay?
- Very funny.

148
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:03,249
Impressive how you leap from
misogyny to homophobia in a single bound.

149
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,510
Hey, you were just
calling Albright a bitch.

150
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,813
After you did, and that's
not the point anyway.

151
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,923
The point is why is everybody...

152
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,992
- so bigoted around here?
- No more overnights for Abby.

153
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,560
Kovac, your woman's
starting to sound a little kooky.

154
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,257
Morris, I swear. If you ever refer
to me as someone's woman again...

155
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,333
I will slap you with
this hole-punch.

156
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,764
Don't you mean bitch-slap?

157
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,447
- Let's walk.
- I'm not kidding.

158
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,498
- I'm really not kidding.
- All right, they get it, they get it.

159
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,902
- You okay?
- Yeah.

160
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,568
No.

161
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:36,606
Coburn's office is calling
with the amnio results today.

162
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,549
When is that?

163
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,187
As soon as they open, I think.

164
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,286
Why don't you relax for a while.
We can do the call together.

165
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,086
Dexter Jenkins, 62, blunt
trauma to face, chest, abdomen.

166
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,786
Try not to hit Morris
with any desk tools.

167
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,431
Ray.

168
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,433
I'm not promising anything.

169
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,761
Sir, what happened?

170
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,766
Just dumb kids, they
don't know nothing.

171
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,462
They beat him up out in the
open. Witnesses called 911.

172
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,938
- At 8 in the morning?
- It's the breakfast special.

173
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,104
Sats, 99.

174
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,405
What do kids want with
a can opener anyway?

175
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,775
Still got their moms
cooking for them.

176
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,407
Distal pulse is two
plus. Your what?

177
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,886
EZ Squeeze, heavy duty
ergonomic handle. Hard to come by.

178
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,286
What's your plan?

179
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,654
CBC, trauma panel,
type and screen.

180
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,419
Some kind of stupid dare.

181
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,087
Okay, and add a CT
scan, he seems confused.

182
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,758
- I am not confused.
- What's the date today?

183
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,427
February ninth, and I
want my can opener back.

184
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,937
Hey, you gotta
have some of this.

185
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,840
- And this.
- Chocolate milk? Are you 12?

186
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,641
- Yes, I am 12.
- Oh, yeah?

187
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:43,973
Oh!

188
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,317
We gotta have some of
this too. I didn't see that.

189
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,423
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.
- Make some s'mores later.

190
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,987
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

191
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,321
Yo, dude, my bad.
I'll take care of it.

192
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,123
Hi.

193
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,699
We should wait until the end
of the shift, if it's bad news...

194
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,632
It's not. It's not bad news.

195
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,306
Chances of having abnormal
amnio are, what, one in a thousand?

196
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,033
Two hundred.

197
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,606
Still pretty good odds.

198
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,042
We'll be fine.

199
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,984
Hi, this is Abby Lockhart, I
think you have my amnio results.

200
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,358
<i>Oh, hold a minute.
I'll check for you.</i>

201
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,022
She's checking.

202
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,833
Hi.

203
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,439
That's great.

204
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,343
That's great. That's great.

205
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,681
That's great. Thank you.

206
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,232
Get down.

207
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,738
- Oh, yeah, kill me. Yeah.
- Come on, come on. Come on.

208
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,018
Oh, God, I gotta get
you a Velcro belt, huh?

209
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,746
Yeah.

210
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,013
Nice.

211
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:36,386
- Kiss your husband with that mouth?
- Oh, God, Bobby. Oh, my God.

212
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,498
Did you really think
it would be so easy?

213
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,099
Make yourself at home, man.

214
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,630
I asked you a question.

215
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,777
Yeah, well, it sounded
kind of rhetorical, you prick.

216
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,637
I wasn't talking
to you, my love.

217
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,316
I was talking to Vic.

218
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,285
Yeah.

219
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,917
You know, Bobby...

220
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,957
Bobby, I know we got a
lot to discuss, you know.

221
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,560
But breaking into my place
is not gonna get it done.

222
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,094
Because we're adults here...

223
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,164
Anyway, how did you
get in here anyhow?

224
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,063
I got lots of experience
getting into dumps like this, Vic.

225
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,295
- Oh, yeah?
- Because, you see...

226
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,599
I spend every day staying three
moves ahead of scumbags like you.

227
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,572
- Scumbags?
- Bobby, get the hell out of here.

228
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,178
Okay, this, all this?

229
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,281
Over, okay?

230
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:33,051
Button up, get your
stuff, and let's go.

231
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,482
Jodie, get your stuff.

232
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm not gonna go
anywhere with you.

233
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,200
Okay, listen, you and your wetback
boyfriend have had your fun...

234
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,964
You know what? You take
things too far. Now, you gotta go.

235
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,664
- Smart thing, chimichanga? Stay out.
- I'm in it now.

236
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,970
- Jodie...
- I filed papers.

237
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,075
You what?

238
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,149
I called my
lawyer, and I want...

239
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,084
I want a divorce.

240
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,388
A divorce?

241
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,885
Hey, imagine that.

242
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,030
Oh, come on, baby.

243
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:23,534
I flew all the way from
Jersey to fix this, okay?

244
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,331
I mean, I know I screwed up.

245
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,804
- I'm so, so...
- Don't, don't.

246
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,602
I'm so sorry.

247
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,343
It's too late now, so I don't...

248
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,745
Too late?

249
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,313
Too late?

250
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,354
You don't think I can just
leave you here like this, do you?

251
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,549
I think...

252
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,217
What?

253
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,228
I think that you're
gonna have to.

254
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,701
All right, Bobby, why don't
you just call her later, man?

255
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,567
And probably, she'll talk to
you then. Come on, let's go.

256
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,936
Come on, let's go.

257
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,440
Let's go.

258
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,460
All in all, it went
well, didn't it?

259
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,302
Yeah.

260
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,385
Frank, do me a
favor and call central?

261
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,454
Order me a new scrub top. I
spilled Betadine all over my shirt.

262
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,456
Scrub top? You can't wear
scrubs on your man-date.

263
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,321
Oh, no, no, you're
misusing the term.

264
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,623
A man-date is two hetero guys
hanging out for dinner and a movie.

265
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,288
See, this is a "date" date.

266
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,434
Keep it up, you're gonna
get smack-smacked.

267
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,729
Hey, I feel you, bro, I
dated this chick four times...

268
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,805
before I realized she
had an Adam's apple.

269
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,407
So how's Carter doing?

270
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,805
Same old. Saving the
world, counting the money.

271
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,640
I tell you, if I was rich, I
would be in Italy, not Africa.

272
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,247
It's for a good reason, Frank.

273
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,748
Think there are no hungry
kids on the Amalfi Coast?

274
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,517
Pratt, can you write for morphine
for the infected branchial cyst?

275
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,484
- Sure.
- Hey, she's still here?

276
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,422
Yeah. No surgical beds, Albright's
boarding her until the O.R. opens up.

277
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,855
Give me that.

278
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,586
Excuse me, doctor.

279
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,163
If the ER is gonna babysit
your surgical patients...

280
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,459
have the courtesy to
write the damn orders.

281
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,331
I don't have time now, I'm
late for a sympathectomy.

282
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,766
You're gonna be even later.

283
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm forbidding my residents to
write orders on surgical boarders.

284
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,270
- You can't do that.
- Oh, yes, I can. New policy.

285
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,847
Fine, have it your way.

286
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,244
Here. Your chief's
a little penis.

287
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,782
Don't let her talk
to you that way.

288
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,391
So, what do you think?
- About what?

289
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,857
The baby's sex is right
there on that amnio report.

290
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,793
Did you know that
the X chromosome...

291
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,559
carries three times as much
genetic material as the Y?

292
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,862
- And you didn't ask.
- Do you think that's why men are simpler?

293
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:16,567
Look, some nurse in Coburn's office
knows the sex of our baby and we don't.

294
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,870
- Isn't that weird?
- It's a little weird.

295
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,308
- So?
- So?

296
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,540
So? Coffee and
apple juice, please.

297
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,149
Two coffees, please.

298
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,876
I don't know.

299
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:30,183
It just makes it seem so real.

300
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,918
You're 16 weeks,
amnio's normal. It is real.

301
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,994
Is there anyone we have to tell?

302
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,167
You should probably
tell your mother.

303
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,205
Oh, yeah. I was thinking
I'd hold off on that.

304
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,569
- Until when?
- Until he gets...

305
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,820
Come on, Jodie. I need help. I
need help! Somebody, help me!

306
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,751
Fine, you're gonna be fine.

307
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,294
Must have lost
a liter in the car.

308
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,023
Why didn't you
call an ambulance?

309
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,398
It was faster this way.
- Can you hear me?

310
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,607
Caught us off-guard.
- Carotid's weak.

311
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:17,968
- What's open?
- I'm here.

312
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,571
Trauma 1. What happened?

313
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,906
Entrance wound is left chest,
lower right quadrant and flank.

314
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,135
Out of nowhere, I
wasn't expecting it.

315
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,973
Expecting what? Expecting what?

316
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,081
Stop the questions.
Get the resuss going.

317
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:33,515
Okay, Abby, take the head. Sam, get her
on a monitor and start working on access.

318
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,126
- Where's Vic?
- I'm right here. Right here.

319
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,760
He shot me.

320
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,337
What is that?

321
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,963
Morse Code for "get
me the hell out of here?"

322
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,769
Nervous habit.

323
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:00,471
Well, that looks like...

324
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,172
D, F, and B to me.

325
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,616
No, this is A and D minor.

326
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,285
What, are you a musician?

327
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,119
I got this...

328
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,957
Yamaha mini-keyboard I like to
tap things out on once in a while.

329
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,622
Found it on some heap one time.

330
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,464
Couldn't imagine why anybody
would wanna throw that out.

331
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,038
Gone for good now.

332
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,176
Little bastards
smashed it all up.

333
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,807
So, what kind of music you into?

334
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,574
I stay with what I
know mostly. Blues.

335
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,585
You any relation
to a Brick Jenkins?

336
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,379
He was a bluesman from the '60s.

337
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,751
Dad used to listen to
his records over and over.

338
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,655
Played with Muddy
Waters, BB King?

339
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,222
Even Big Bill Broonzy
right before he died.

340
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,923
Nice to meet you.

341
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,387
We take care of stuff like
this every day. Worse than this.

342
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,738
You think this is something?
This is nothing, baby.

343
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,068
- Go ahead, Abby, tell her.
- You need to make room.

344
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,242
Tell her she's gonna be fine.
- Liter of NS.

345
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,245
- Six units of O-neg and call the O.R.
- I'm so sorry, baby.

346
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,383
What?

347
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,014
Who shot her, Vic?

348
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,021
Who shot her? Her
husband shot her.

349
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,688
What, you think it was...

350
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,092
When she said he, she
meant her maniac husband...

351
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,595
who showed up with a gun.

352
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,633
- That's who she meant, didn't mean me.
- Where? At your place?

353
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,427
Yeah.

354
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,232
You don't believe me, do you?

355
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,270
Sure, we believe you.

356
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,775
Hey, tachy at 138.

357
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,436
Barely has a gag,
poor respiratory effort.

358
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,216
Sats aren't coming
up. She needs a tube.

359
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,284
Why don't you sit
down for a while? Hey.

360
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,889
Seven-five. Abby,
use a seven-five.

361
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,493
She's tiny, but she's got a huge
mouth and a small little airway.

362
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,389
- Okay, okay.
- I'll put it in.

363
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,790
You want me to put it in?

364
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,561
Systolic's only 72.

365
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,222
Here's the 10 blade. - Hey.

366
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,992
You're not working
right now. Hey.

367
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,606
- I heard what happened.
- Good, maybe you can explain it to us.

368
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,368
Where's the 10 blade? Tell
me, where's the 10 blade?

369
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,436
I gotta do something.
I gotta do something.

370
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,207
If it wasn't for me, she
wouldn't be in this kind of way.

371
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,412
Oh, man, you all right?

372
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,645
- I'm good.
- Hey, man, you're bleeding.

373
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,620
- Just a scratch. Everything's fine.
- Come, let's take a look.

374
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,088
- Come on, Vic.
- She needs me.

375
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,523
Come on, get on this gurney now.

376
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,026
- Sit down, sit down.
- Listen.

377
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:33,132
- Can you listen to me? Nobody's listening.
- I'm listening.

378
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,667
- They think I did it. They think I did it.
- Okay, all right.

379
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,965
- Look, you've been shot. Come here, man.
- Impossible, man.

380
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,540
Good distal pulses, wound
looks through and through.

381
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,177
- I need the infuser.
- Hey, go for it.

382
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,512
The bastard shot me,
Sam. He shot me too.

383
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,173
Sam, you believe me
now? Sam, you believe?

384
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,648
Suction and more cricoid.

385
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:56,186
- Sat is 74. Can you see the cords?
- Yes, I just can't get the tube to go.

386
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,721
She's bradying down, 58.

387
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,721
- Okay, pull out.
- I had it for a second.

388
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,972
- Come on, pull out.
- Why don't you try 7-0?

389
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,359
- Kovac, how about more...
- Seven-0, 7-0.

390
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,226
Somebody close
that door, please?

391
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,697
Remember I said to page
me if anything came up?

392
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,532
- This would fall under that category.
- Well, we got it under control medically.

393
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,400
What do you got? ABBY: Two.

394
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,405
Clemente's girlfriend,
Jodie Kenyon.

395
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,703
Multiple GSW's to
chest, abdomen and flank.

396
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,904
Attending next door
with a bullet in his arm.

397
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,743
Okay, I'm in.

398
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,345
PVCs.

399
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:29,250
Hang another unit of O-neg and rush the
blood bank. She needs type specific fast.

400
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,718
What she needs is the O.R.

401
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,088
- Paged them 10 minutes ago.
- When we need Albright, she's MIA.

402
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,729
Okay, page Dubenko.
We can't wait.

403
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,303
You wanna explain
what happened there?

404
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:41,423
I don't understand. I
didn't cut the nerve.

405
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,899
But you didn't look for
it either. You got lucky.

406
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,709
You were there
when I made the cut.

407
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,737
Don't be defensive.
Don't make excuses.

408
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,567
Nine-one-one page from
the ER. Can you hold it?

409
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:56,512
I heard Gallant got called
back by the Army again.

410
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,015
- That's gotta be hard.
- Actually, he didn't. He re-upped.

411
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,611
Oh.

412
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,519
Well, he's certainly got
a strong sense of duty.

413
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,714
Introducer.

414
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,917
Another 200 cc's
of blood on the floor.

415
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,927
- Sixty units of pack cells going up.
- Cordis is almost ready.

416
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,863
- Only 10. Can't get a BP.
- Come on, Thora-Seal and autotransfuser.

417
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,401
- What's going on?
- It's about damn time.

418
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,596
Double GSW. We can't
get a surgeon down here.

419
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,765
- We just got the page.
- We've been calling your chief resident...

420
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,605
- for 15 minutes. DUBENKO:
Go check out the other room.

421
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,111
You know what? Let's
focus on the patients here.

422
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,745
We'll deal with that later.

423
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,146
Hi, here for surgery.

424
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,287
Dr. Clemente.

425
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,288
- How's she doing? How's Jodie?
- Having trouble with her blood loss.

426
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,722
He's got a through and
through GSW to the deltoid.

427
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,954
- Oh, no.
- Neurovascular okay. He'll need angio.

428
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,495
- Hemodynamics?
- Fine.

429
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,155
- No occult injuries?
- No.

430
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,326
- You do a thorough head-to-toe exam?
- Yes, doctor, we did.

431
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,303
Tell the blood bank to send out
another 10 of packed cells, two of FFP.

432
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,106
Need your
portable defibrillator.

433
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,920
- She's coding? She's coding.
- Whoa, easy.

434
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,175
No, it's a precaution
for the trip upstairs.

435
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,476
- What are you doing for her?
- What we do for any trauma patient.

436
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,619
Fluid, access,
blood and pressors.

437
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,686
Platelets and calcium,
platelets and calcium...

438
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,315
Myocardium loves calcium.
Dubenko, give her calcium!

439
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,461
- Getting harder to bag.
- You hear me?

440
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,105
Up the rate, do
the best you can.

441
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,826
Best you can? Best you can,
my ass. They need me in there.

442
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,519
Let us take care of you. - Easy!

443
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,262
- I'm not gonna let her die.
- She's not gonna die.

444
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,667
You know you can't say
that. You know you can't.

445
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,434
Please. Try to relax.

446
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,208
I'm not perfect, I've
messed things up in the past.

447
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:36,839
- I know what to do with a shocky GSW.
- And so does Dr. Kovac, I assure you.

448
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:45,116
- I got to go, she needs me. I gotta go.
- Dr. Clemente!

449
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,522
I got to go! I got to go!

450
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,855
- She needs me in there!
- No! Hey, take it easy.

451
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,362
Settle down. Settle down.

452
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,000
I got to go, man!

453
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,035
Calm down.

454
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,370
- Settle down.
- No!

455
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,375
You're restraining me? We
don't use hard restraints anymore.

456
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:13,213
True, but since you're spraying blood
on my staff, I'm willing to bend the rules.

457
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,552
What are we looking at, Neela?

458
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,585
- Renal pedicle?
- That's a question, not an answer.

459
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,596
- Well, Neela?
- I don't know.

460
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,532
It's the renal pedicle.

461
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:34,104
Albright, decide to grace
us with your presence?

462
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,753
Sorry, got stuck in the ICU.

463
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:38,673
Metz. ALBRIGHT: What's
our next move, Neela?

464
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,110
Find the bleeder?

465
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,042
- Find the bleeder.
- Before that?

466
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,052
- Isolate the hilum?
- Before that.

467
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:52,952
I don't know.

468
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,959
- Intraoperative, IVP.
- That's correct.

469
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:58,893
Fifty cc's of contrast, get
the portable x-ray tech down.

470
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,632
- Hi, remember me?
- I'm busy, Morris.

471
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,566
Oh, you're busy, okay, all
right. Is this your writing here?

472
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,035
Sure looks that way.

473
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,756
Electrolytes, d-sticks
and neurovascular status...

474
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,209
every 15 minutes
on a branchial cyst?

475
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,260
I was making a point. - So am I.

476
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,884
My department doesn't
have time to carry out tasks...

477
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,579
- on patients who are only boarding.
- Let's talk later. We're busy.

478
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,587
Either scrub out to rewrite
orders or come do them yourself.

479
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,551
We've got a lady
open on the table.

480
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,973
This isn't the best time.

481
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,222
Neela? I can't hear
you, you're dead to me.

482
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,093
Lucien, please make it stop.

483
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,999
Oh, look at you, going to your
Attending like a little penis, punk, sissy.

484
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:42,266
Jessica, would you take care
of this? It's getting very annoying.

485
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,240
This is a complex anastomosis.
Don't you think I should stay?

486
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,812
We'll be all right
without you. Please, go.

487
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,310
Please.

488
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,253
All right, dissect
the mesentery.

489
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:59,449
I heard she tried to kill him and
he grabbed the gun away from her.

490
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,057
Well, his wound is definitely

491
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,289
self-inflicted. He's a
cagey little bastard.

492
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:06,762
- Think he shot her and covered it up?
- Oldest trick in the book.

493
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,264
I heard they were having sex.

494
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,529
All right. Come on, guys, we
all have our own problems, right?

495
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,638
- Right.
- You're right.

496
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,399
Hey, I'll come get you when
your boyfriend gets here.

497
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,703
- Where's Clemente now?
- I sent him up to angio.

498
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,369
- In restraints?
- We let him out once he shut up.

499
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,810
What do you think happened?

500
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,449
I think he's a complicated guy.

501
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,948
Hey, Ray.

502
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:29,316
Let's keep the chatter to a minimum
until we find out what went down.

503
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:30,820
- Yeah, sure thing.
- All right.

504
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,653
Hey, I picked this up in Trauma 1. I
think it belongs to one of your patients.

505
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,055
Who? Jenkins?

506
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,289
Yeah, you know, the old homeless
guy who got beat up by some kids?

507
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,434
Yeah, I got it. Okay.

508
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,571
- What's this, doctor?
- Expanding hematoma.

509
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:50,765
Lacerated vessels.

510
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,743
That's an ER answer. I want a
surgeon's answer. Which vessels?

511
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,676
Systolic's only 92.

512
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,740
Neela, which vessels?

513
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:02,652
The renal artery splits
into the anterior and...

514
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:06,019
Stop vamping, we don't have
time. You either know it or you don't.

515
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,431
Extravasating contrast,
left kidney's been hit.

516
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,119
We're aware of that, Victor.

517
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,630
With a hilar injury like this, sacrificing
the kidney is probably the way to go.

518
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,634
Is the hilum completely avulsed?
Because if not, you ought...

519
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,432
Please, don't tell me what
I ought or ought not do.

520
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,770
- Yeah, well, she's a friend, okay?
- You can watch from the Obs deck.

521
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,582
- A good friend...
- Obs deck now.

522
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,111
One peep and you're out.

523
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,019
So think you can
save the kidney?

524
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,889
She's young. We should try.

525
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,925
Mm-hm. What's your plan?

526
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,230
I don't know. I've
never done this before.

527
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,730
Look, it's just common sense. If I
weren't here, what would you do?

528
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:52,200
Lucien, I just wanna point out you
are here and you are the Attending.

529
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,169
Dr. Rasgotra?

530
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,308
Clamp the hilum for
a vascular exclusion.

531
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,243
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but
if you clamp the hilum...

532
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,415
you're gonna starve
the kidney of blood.

533
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,210
Please continue.

534
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,076
Find the bleeders
and seal with fibrin.

535
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,882
Repair the renal artery
with an omental patch.

536
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:15,084
How much time after clamping the
hilum before the kidney starts to die?

537
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,523
About 45 minutes.

538
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,188
No, no, no, it's not
about 45 minutes.

539
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,096
That's 45 minutes
tops. That's tops.

540
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,567
Go for it, she's all yours.

541
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,707
You're not gonna let an ER
resident go and clamp the hilum.

542
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,103
You will stop talking now.

543
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,267
- Or I'll remove you.
- She's not a surgeon.

544
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,244
- I'm working on that.
- You're gonna be working on that now.

545
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,281
Lucien, look, this
isn't a teaching case.

546
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,849
I want you to do it, Lucien!

547
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:45,423
I want you! Stop playing around,
man! Her pressure's gonna bottom out!

548
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,288
Hilum's clamped.

549
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,986
All right, 45 minutes.
The clock's ticking.

550
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,296
Change the orders.

551
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,867
This means war, you know.

552
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,368
Change the damn orders.

553
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,808
Nice work. She's been
driving us crazy all day.

554
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,140
Refuses to learn our
names, calls us all nurse.

555
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,942
She refuses to
learn our names too.

556
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,881
She's only interested in learning
the male residents' names.

557
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,078
I hate women like that.

558
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,487
Why are you still here?

559
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,151
My fridge at home's empty,
I was hungry. Want a bite?

560
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,388
Didn't I see you eating
one 20 minutes ago?

561
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,328
- This is my third.
- Third?

562
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,228
What are you, pregnant?

563
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,769
What? What are
you talking about?

564
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,569
- Oh, my God, you are.
- You're crazy.

565
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,972
- You are, aren't you?
- No.

566
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,806
You are totally pregnant.

567
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,448
- So what? You're in love with Albright.
- No, I'm not.

568
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,844
Oh, Morris. Come on.

569
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,678
- You shut up.
- You shut up too.

570
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,185
- You shut up first.
- Shut up about what?

571
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,852
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

572
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:55,823
This came back on our GSW.
Want me to send it up to the O.R.?

573
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,189
No, I got it.

574
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,854
Ray, help Morris clear the
board while I run upstairs.

575
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,665
- All right.
- Help me? What was that?

576
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,131
I need help all of a sudden?

577
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,999
No, it's not really
all of a sudden.

578
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,163
I'm taking Mrs. Irby
in to see her father.

579
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,468
Oh, okay. You
need help with that?

580
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,702
- No.
- Exactly, that's my point.

581
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,847
Your father's in here, ma'am.

582
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,717
You been doing some
snooping around, young blood?

583
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,582
Well, I thought your
daughter should know.

584
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,121
Congratulations, princess.

585
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,391
Sounded like a nice ceremony.

586
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,860
We wanted you to be there.

587
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,900
Didn't wanna show up for
your special day looking like this.

588
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,731
- I would have paid for a suit.
- I don't want that.

589
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,036
I don't want your money.

590
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,880
This doctor told me
what happened today.

591
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,574
Stupid kids.

592
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,687
He needs to have his
sutures removed in a week.

593
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,083
Come home until then, Daddy.

594
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,991
Nat and me, we got a
nice place over in Old Town.

595
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,127
You can have your own room.

596
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,393
That ain't me, Sarah.

597
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,938
Ain't never gonna be.

598
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,235
How's she doing?

599
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,971
That was the 12th
unit they've hung so far.

600
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,113
I looked for you in angio.

601
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,919
Well, you didn't miss much.
The bullet missed the brachial.

602
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,988
This came back on Jodie.

603
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,325
She's positive for
cannaboids and coke, Vic.

604
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,969
Well, you know, this is
irrelevant to her treatment.

605
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,004
I don't know why you'd send
this in. What are you, Big Brother?

606
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,005
Come on, standard trauma
labs, man. You know that.

607
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,440
- And you might have mentioned it before.
- Why?

608
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,672
Would it have affected the
resuscitation, changed your management?

609
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,680
- Let's be real.
- Maybe you should know...

610
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,116
that she's a Scorpio and she's
allergic to clams. Would that help?

611
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,415
So this why you didn't
want us evaluating you?

612
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,424
You were worried what we'd
find if we sent in your urine.

613
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,427
You know, you're a really
good guy, and I like you.

614
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,760
But right now, it's time
for you to shut the hell up.

615
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,870
I just hope your story's good.

616
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,335
Yeah? What story?

617
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:57,237
- The one about how you didn't do this.
- Why, you think I did?

618
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,177
It doesn't matter
what I think, Vic.

619
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:05,044
Only important thing is, is there
anyone who can back you up?

620
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,319
Yeah. She's down there.

621
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,634
Hey, catch.

622
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,603
- Cool.
- Got it at the Boston game.

623
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,871
- They killed us. KOVAC:
Oh, yeah, that kind of year.

624
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,210
I haven't seen you around.

625
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,875
My mom said I
was too distracting.

626
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,647
She wants you to study hard.

627
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,858
Yeah, she said I was
definitely going to college.

628
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,756
That's good advice.

629
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:51,692
Sounds boring.

630
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,458
Besides, I wanna drive NASCAR.

631
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,968
I'll tell her you're here.

632
00:33:58,737 --> 00:33:59,761
Thanks, Luka.

633
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:04,605
Hey, Chuny, let's see if we can
get a taxi voucher for Dexter Jenkins.

634
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,406
Oh, already gone. He left AMA,
didn't even sign his discharge.

635
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,775
He did?

636
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,281
Yep. What do you want
me to do with his chart?

637
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,275
Let's break it down, I guess.

638
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,889
Oh, Pratt, I forgot,
your date's out in chairs.

639
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,786
- He is?
- Been there about half an hour.

640
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,859
Oh, don't keep a
young man waiting.

641
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:25,361
And allow me to say, that's
the prettiest transvestite...

642
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,896
I've ever laid eyes on.

643
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,398
Transvestite?

644
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,793
Where?

645
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,464
Oh, that can't be him.

646
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,203
I had you guys going, didn't I?

647
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,657
Write post-op orders,
page me for evening rounds.

648
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,305
- How often we check renal function?
- BUN and creatinine BID.

649
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,610
Okay, go.

650
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,120
Just so you know.
That wasn't cool.

651
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,553
What?

652
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,217
You deal with ER scut, I
scrub in on traumas, got it?

653
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,922
- You weren't answering your pages.
- That cutesy shtick with Dubenko?

654
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,293
That isn't working either.

655
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,231
I write your evaluation. I'm
the one you've got to impress.

656
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,962
I'm not trying to impress
anyone, I'm trying to get...

657
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:11,405
You get this: You ever crowd me out
of the O.R. again, there will be payback.

658
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,067
This is crazy. I di...

659
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,445
Dr. Clemente.

660
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,774
Mind if I come in?

661
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,083
Yeah, sure.

662
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:43,341
Look, I wanna thank
you for taking care of her.

663
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,039
We did our best.

664
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:55,252
Yeah. I know you did.

665
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:02,221
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, I'm just trying to get out of here.

666
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:03,726
Alex is at the triage desk.

667
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,386
- Yeah.
- We chatted a little.

668
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,327
Oh, good.

669
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,165
Uh...

670
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:14,637
Hey, I just wanted to talk
to you about something.

671
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,206
Yeah?

672
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:20,072
Uh, about me and Abby?

673
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:24,347
Luka, I know about you
and Abby. Everybody knows.

674
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,350
And I really hope it works out.

675
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,318
Really, I want you to be happy.

676
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,924
There's a little more to it.

677
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,230
Abby and I, we're...

678
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,093
We're gonna have a baby.

679
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,369
- What?
- A baby.

680
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,066
Wow.

681
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,213
I just didn't want you to
hear it somewhere else.

682
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,248
I appreciate that.

683
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,679
When is she due?

684
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,319
July.

685
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,915
Wow.

686
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,058
Congratulations.

687
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,559
Thanks.

688
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,368
Hey, do you know
where the Reglan is?

689
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,972
Because we're out of Compazine, and
Chuny's mad at me for not restocking.

690
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,199
Not that you would know,
doctors never know...

691
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,865
Try the bottom shelf.

692
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,641
Right behind the...

693
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:30,407
Yes. Right.

694
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,245
I'll see you tomorrow.

695
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,645
Yeah. Have a good one.

696
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,346
Yeah, you too.

697
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,262
I remember now,
Jodes, I remember.

698
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,459
It was Hamlet.

699
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,863
You know the part
where he says...

700
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,803
that man is this...

701
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,100
and man is that.

702
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:05,681
Noble and intelligent,
like the best thing on Earth.

703
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,281
But then he says to his
two buddies, he says:

704
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:14,256
Yet what is it to me, this...

705
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,955
This quintessence of dust?

706
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,760
Like he's, you know...

707
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,559
lost.

708
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,397
I heard they were able
to salvage the kidney.

709
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:34,603
Yeah, but with the loss of blood
and the long anesthesia time...

710
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,973
You know how the brain is.

711
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:41,416
The police are here.
They went to your place.

712
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:47,518
The ICU Attending wants to keep
her intubated and sedated longer.

713
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,857
They found marijuana, cocaine,
some unprescribed medications...

714
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,932
We should keep her
02 consumption down.

715
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,932
They think you did this, Vic.

716
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,342
Did they find the gun?

717
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,048
No.

718
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,078
Am I fired?

719
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,048
Not yet.

720
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:32,168
Okay, why don't we start by you telling
me why in the world your friend Henry...

721
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,272
would think he has
to buy you dates?

722
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,670
I had a bad break-up
a few months back.

723
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:42,007
I think he got sick of
listening to my single-girl woes.

724
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,581
Plus, he figured I could
use a change of pace.

725
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,241
You mean you never
dated a doctor before?

726
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,852
Something like that.

727
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,922
- Good night, Pratt.
- Good night, Ray.

728
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,797
Figured you'd be long gone.

729
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,030
Good place to pick
up some change.

730
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,639
I'm not gonna talk you into
anything your daughter couldn't.

731
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,572
She's upset.
She'll be all right.

732
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,373
She figures this is
how it's gonna be.

733
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,311
Every few years, she'll get
a call from a hospital or cop...

734
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,883
get a quick "Hi",
"Bye" from her old man.

735
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:24,318
Until the last call comes
in, and it's the morgue.

736
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,223
Let me get you a
sandwich, at least.

737
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,420
Another couple hours,
I can buy my own.

738
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,122
Come on.

739
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:41,095
So how's a young fellow like
you know about Big Bill Broonzy?

740
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,832
Oh, I'm kind of a buff.

741
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:47,843
LPs, CDs. I got a big
collection of everything.

742
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,912
I used to be in a band.

743
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,274
So, what can I get for you?

744
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,010
BLT and a Coke.

745
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,848
All right.

746
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,615
Hey, Maggie. It's me.

747
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,919
I have some good news, Mom.
