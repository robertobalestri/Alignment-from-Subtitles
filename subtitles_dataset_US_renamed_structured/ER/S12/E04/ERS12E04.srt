1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,466
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,199
Oh, uh, Dr. Kovack,
I'm Eve Peyton.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,571
- Our new nurse manager.
- It's Kovac.

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,908
You can educate the nurses
about inferior alveolar dental blocks.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,572
What?

6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,583
Is there some sort of history
between you and Dr. Kovac?

7
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,389
It's not appropriate for
you two to work together.

8
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,677
That's two less than
I'm already doing,

9
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:28,120
which I can't afford.
I'll never see my kid.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,030
One thousand, two thousand,
three thousand, four thousand...

11
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,302
- What are you doing?
- Five... I'm counting.

12
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,968
Yes. That part, I get.

13
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,512
The time between the
lightning and the thunder...

14
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,309
tells you how far
away the storm is.

15
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,585
- Getting closer.
- That's great.

16
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,981
You're going outside?

17
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,385
Yep, drew the short
straw for the coffee run.

18
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,549
Where are you going?
We're getting slammed here.

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,524
I'm not on for six minutes.
I'm going out for coffee.

20
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,688
Then be a <i>Flower Drum
Song</i> and grab me a bear claw.

21
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,529
Hi, I'm Dr. Morris, chief resident.
What brings you here today?

22
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,103
- Some guy rear-ended me.
- Ew. Ouch.

23
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,833
- I hope you were driving.
- We're getting a little backed up here.

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,000
We can clear some of
these necks clinically.

25
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,443
We? Okay, I think it's best if we
left that decision to the doctors.

26
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,742
If patients meet all of
the NEXUS criteria...

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,248
What do you know about NEXUS?

28
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,506
As research
coordinator at Emory, I

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,850
enrolled 2000 patients
in the initial study.

30
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:33,016
That's really interesting. Maybe you can
bring it up at your next Nazi nurse rally.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,961
Dr. Morris, my knowledge
of the human anatomy...

32
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,598
is so extensive, I could
kill you with this finger.

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,529
Somehow I find
that hard to... Ow!

34
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,135
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

35
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,600
I saved your life. Been telling
them to keep these floors mopped.

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,790
Maybe it's time I
fired a janitorial staff.

37
00:01:47,814 --> 00:01:49,539
It's time you cleared
some patients.

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,542
Glad you're back in
the trenches with us.

39
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,647
Makes one of us.
What's the problem here?

40
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,907
We've had like 20
paramedic runs in the...

41
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,110
Every ED in the city is closed to
saturation, which means we're all open.

42
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,745
Fender-benders are clogging the hallways.
I'm not sure they all need a C-spine film.

43
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:06,451
Of course not. Get with it, Morris.
Half these patients don't need x-rays.

44
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:10,428
- Start clearing necks.
- All right, so they've...

45
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,507
What the hell's your problem? You
can't wait for a little break in...? Hey!

46
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,771
It's a crosswalk, you asshole!

47
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,729
Diverticulitis grandma is
being admitted to Medicine.

48
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,493
My mandible fracture's
going to the OR with OMF...

49
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,000
and Mr. McKay goes home
with rest and ibuprofen.

50
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,833
On that note, I'm out of here
with no pass-ons, thank you.

51
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,168
- Thought you'd help Neela clear necks.
- I did.

52
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,503
- Doc Rock will help you.
- I'm not working here today.

53
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,006
I start my Toxicology elective.

54
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,875
I picked Neurology,
didn't get an elective.

55
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,607
You need to complete Pre-Hospital
Care Training Requirements.

56
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,012
- My what?
- Your ride-alongs.

57
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,280
You never did them as an intern
and you've 24 hours in the field.

58
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,890
- I've been meaning to do that.
- Come see me when you do...

59
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:49,086
- then we'll discuss your elective options.
- Where'd you go for coffee, Milwaukee?

60
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,560
The donuts are soggy.

61
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,929
God forbid you don't get your
morning ration of deep fried fat, Frank.

62
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,230
Maybe I can dry
them in the microwave.

63
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,963
You okay? ABBY: Yeah.

64
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,301
Nothing a week in the Bahamas
wouldn't cure. What about you?

65
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:06,436
Eve stuck me on nights. Now I get less
sleep, less money and I barely see Alex.

66
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,775
I have to have a
babysitter spend the night.

67
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,748
What is it about rain that turns
residents of this city into idiots?

68
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,319
- Tell me about it. PEYTON:
Haleh, what are you doing here?

69
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,583
- Connie asked me to cover for her.
- I warned you about your overtime.

70
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,556
I'm just trying to help her out.

71
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,718
You should've told her
to call someone else.

72
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,591
You want me to go back home?

73
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,199
Unless you want
another letter in your file.

74
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,163
Have a great day.

75
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:33,831
Sam, can you cover for me
until I find someone else? Sam.

76
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,600
Why not? It's not
like I'm gonna be...

77
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,769
home in time to see my
kid off to school anyway.

78
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,174
- Who's this?
- Blaire Collins, 29.

79
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,582
Sent in from Lakeshore Gardens
for infection around her G-tube.

80
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,289
- Does this hurt, Blaire?
Ma'am? MEDIC: She's in a coma.

81
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,791
- Since when?
- Six years.

82
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,360
No, come on. No way. No
way, guys. We don't have room.

83
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,999
She doesn't need to be here.

84
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,625
They can give her IV antibiotics
and they can change her G-tube.

85
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,602
- What are we supposed to do?
- I just told you, take her back.

86
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,707
We don't get paid
for round trips.

87
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,036
Hey, guys. Hey!

88
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,041
What's wrong?

89
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,111
Nursing-home dump.

90
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,716
What else is new? Come on.
I think Trauma Two is open.

91
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,216
Check the lobby. We
could use a nurse in Triage.

92
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,618
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

93
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,155
No, this is ridiculous.

94
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,488
- Hey, Kerry? You gonna do something?
- About what?

95
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,527
The way she's
managing the staff.

96
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,860
If it's a nursing issue, it's Eve's
rice bowl. You two work it out.

97
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:38,869
- Morning rounds are at 10 a.m.
- Ten. Ten is good.

98
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,168
We discuss our toxicology
consultations from the entire county.

99
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,402
You will carry the
pager every third day...

100
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,412
and research conference
is Thursday afternoons.

101
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,752
Check it out. Is it poisonous?

102
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,949
Venomous? Yes. I'm studying
neurotoxic factors in crotalid venom.

103
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,889
How cool.

104
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,328
- Cool.
- Please, but... Don't do that.

105
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,764
Your main focus will be
our Poison Control Center.

106
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,064
Calls come in from both the
public and other health care facilities.

107
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,767
You have online access to an
international POISINDEX database...

108
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,241
and we're here to back you up.

109
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,877
You're number two.

110
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,276
Judy Anderson, 31, head-on
collision, auto versus cinderblock wall.

111
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,047
- My baby? Grace? Where is she?
- She's coming soon, ma'am.

112
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,383
- Any belly pain, Judy?
- It hurts when I breathe.

113
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,925
- Driver with chest pain, good vitals.
- Any victims in the second vehicle?

114
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,086
- Only one car.
- They forced me off the road.

115
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,891
- Who?
- They were driving like maniacs.

116
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,590
- They hurt my daughter. Where is she?
- Baby's with Rescue 73.

117
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,236
I'll take this one so
you can take the baby.

118
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,065
Sure.

119
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,604
- Nice work. Is that custom?
- Yeah, Spanish Revival.

120
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,210
Ancef's onboard.

121
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,904
- Watch it, this thing's attached.
- He missed the femur.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,276
He bagged the femoral
artery, got a cold foot.

123
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,816
Give him 50 of fentanyl
and we'll take him upstairs.

124
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,783
I'll be right back.

125
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,951
Dr. Dubenko. DUBENKO: Yeah.

126
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,560
Is everything else okay?

127
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,219
He should be back to
work in a few weeks.

128
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,957
- Well, I meant with you, actually.
- Oh.

129
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,163
I know this is none
of my business...

130
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,032
but I was up in oncology
last week with a patient and...

131
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,332
Oh, oh, oh.

132
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,635
I had my annual PSA screening.

133
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,771
Oh. Duh.

134
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,880
- Sorry.
- It came back 6.5.

135
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,242
- It's a little high.
- Needle biopsy...

136
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,444
showed a moderately
differentiated prostate cancer.

137
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,853
- I am so sorry.
- No. It's okay.

138
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:41,154
We caught it early, stage T-One.
Good prognosis with surgery.

139
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,432
I gotta get your ischemic
foot boy upstairs.

140
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,169
Um, Lucien?

141
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:54,838
If you want to talk with someone
or have a coffee or something...

142
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,975
Yeah, all right, maybe.
That would be nice.

143
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,011
Okay.

144
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,040
Hi, Frank. Anything
besides fender-benders?

145
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:08,313
Well, the guy in Number Four got
scalded while driving by the hospital...

146
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,219
by some crazy broad
who was throwing coffee.

147
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,393
He thought she was a nurse.

148
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,189
Probably someone from
ICU. They're wacky up there.

149
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,889
Abby! Chest pain.

150
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,557
- When did it start?
- Ten, 15 minutes ago.

151
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,897
- We came right in.
- What does it feel like?

152
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,663
Heavy, heavy... Here.

153
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,468
- Are you on any medications?
- Lipitor and aspirin.

154
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,234
All right. First
day labs, 12 lead.

155
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,241
- Lopressor and nitro.
- Got it.

156
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,779
- Is he having a heart attack?
- We have look at his EKG to tell you that.

157
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,348
Three-months-old passenger.
Multiple lacs to the head, face and chest.

158
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,284
- Looks like she was ejected.
- Car seat wasn't anchored down?

159
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,355
Looks that way.
Heart rate in the 160s.

160
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,220
- Access? MEDIC:
Tried twice. IV blew.

161
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,884
Are you good with tiny veins?

162
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,689
- Maybe. WEAVER:
I'll take that as a yes.

163
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,231
- C-spine's clear. Get her off the board.
- Pulse ox 97 on two liters.

164
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,132
When you say a truck, do you mean
they were driving an SUV or a pickup?

165
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,364
SUV. It was blue or black.
It was definitely black.

166
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,271
- Okay, Judy, we're gonna sit you up a bit.
- Ow, my chest.

167
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,309
Did you see the driver
or the passengers?

168
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:10,143
There were at least two of them.
The driver was a young teenager.

169
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:14,617
- White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, what?
- White. I'm not sure about the passenger.

170
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,656
- Lungs are clear.
- BP, 112 over 78.

171
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,190
It hurts when I breathe.

172
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,359
- Stop!
- I think you've broken your breastbone.

173
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,627
Add a sternal view, troponin,
CT of head, abdomen and pelvis.

174
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,603
- What can you tell us about their vehicle?
- There is a bike rack on the roof.

175
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,732
They tried to force me off the
road. They wanted to steal my car.

176
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,277
- Am I bleeding?
- You hit the window. It's not too bad.

177
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,937
- Will I need stitches?
- Yep.

178
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,208
Did either of them
have a weapon, ma'am?

179
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:47,015
I don't know. It happened so fast.
I just wanted to get out of there.

180
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,053
Enough for now.
She's had a concussion.

181
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,691
You need to let her rest
before she goes into the CT.

182
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,161
- We're working here. WEAVER:
Sorry, Luka. Got a trauma.

183
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,763
We need the room.

184
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,400
Hey, here we go. Gently.

185
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,100
I've got the neck.

186
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,866
On my count. One,
two, three. Here we go.

187
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,669
We're out of the
infant c-collars.

188
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,971
Luka, do you know if
we have infant c-collars?

189
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:16,276
- You can use towel rolls.
- I'm gonna ask Peyton.

190
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,121
Can't hear breath
sounds. Do we have a sat?

191
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,723
- Won't pick up. KOVAC:
Kid's pink, sat's fine.

192
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,954
Twenty-four gauge
going on in the right.

193
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,325
You want me to take
this? I don't mind.

194
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,897
Why, you think I'm rusty?

195
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:38,465
Superficial lacs, no step offs,
left frontal-parietal hematoma.

196
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,800
Call CT and let them
know we need a head.

197
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,465
Finally calming down.

198
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,102
Or going apnic. Come
on, baby, wake up.

199
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,607
Wake up.

200
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,147
All right.

201
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,548
Inez, miller one and a
four-0. She needs a tube.

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,452
The kid's screaming.
The airway's obviously fine.

203
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,788
She's got a good mechanism
for a head injury. She needs a CT.

204
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,123
You'll subject her to
the risks of intubation...

205
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,425
to make things easier
for the radiology tech?

206
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,625
- She'll settle down.
- She doesn't have time.

207
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,361
Agitation could be an
early sign of a head injury.

208
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,030
Or an appropriate response
to a stressful situation.

209
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,075
- Babies cry when they're scared.
- Thank you, Dr. Kovac.

210
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,680
But this is my patient and her
mental status is waxing and waning.

211
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,840
- She could go apnic in the scanner.
- Then you bag her through it.

212
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,216
Point five of versed and vec.

213
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:30,187
You lose your neuro exam if you
sedate. Observe until Trauma gets here.

214
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,793
And watch her bleed into her brain?
No, thanks. Push the meds, Inez.

215
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,361
Look at her. She's alert,
pupils equal, good tone.

216
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,623
- Do it now.
- Point five versed, going in.

217
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:43,494
Kerry, we've seen enough head trauma
to develop gut feelings about these things.

218
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,639
And my gut says
intubate. She needs a tube.

219
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,635
Giving the vec.

220
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,639
Suction.

221
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,704
The scope.

222
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,086
- Where are they taking my daughter?
- She's going up to the CT.

223
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,850
What are all those tubes?
Why isn't she moving?

224
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,357
The tube helps her
breathe. It's just a precaution.

225
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,792
Sometimes babies have to
be sedated for CAT scans.

226
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,432
It doesn't mean
anything's wrong.

227
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:20,373
- Have the police found anything?
- It's still early. They will.

228
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,407
I should have waited
until it stopped raining.

229
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,206
No one can control the weather.

230
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,077
The good news is that your
brain and belly CT are normal.

231
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,186
You've broken your breastbone
and we'll need to monitor your heart...

232
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:37,484
- to make sure it wasn't bruised.
- But I didn't have to go out.

233
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,888
I could have waited.

234
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,091
Grace was fussy all night.
Sometimes a car ride settles her down.

235
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm gonna numb up the cuts
on your face before I suture.

236
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,403
- What am I gonna tell my husband?
- You need a new car?

237
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,174
You're gonna feel a little pinprick
and then some burning before it kicks in.

238
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,284
You have a bunch
of phone messages.

239
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,016
No, no, no. Tell Kayson
to stop bothering me.

240
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,650
I'll call Anspaugh back
when I get a chance. Oh, crap.

241
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,320
Henry's got a birthday
party tomorrow.

242
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:23,198
Hey, Jerry. Could you go down to that
toy store on Michigan Avenue for me?

243
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,840
- You want me to go outside?
- Yeah, it's just a few blocks.

244
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,807
I need a King Funshine.
I'll write it down for you.

245
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,606
- In the storm?
- What, you afraid you'll melt?

246
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,715
What about the
lightning? I'm a big target.

247
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,943
Well, then I suggest you try
running in a zigzag pattern.

248
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:44,215
Dr. Weaver? The results are back
for that little girl ejected from the car.

249
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,653
- Is she awake yet?
- Not yet.

250
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,794
But I'm gonna double check.

251
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,656
- Hey.
- Hey.

252
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,561
Baby's head CT is negative.

253
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,534
- Just some soft tissue swelling.
- Is she awake?

254
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:02,005
- No, she is still sedated.
- Then you can't follow her neuro exam.

255
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,871
She'll wake up
and we'll extubate.

256
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,013
This is Bradley Anderson. His
wife and daughter were brought in.

257
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,240
The police said
there was an accident.

258
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,511
Yeah, they're doing well.
Come on, I'll take you to them.

259
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,383
Aren't you two supposed to
keep 50 feet apart or something?

260
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:20,015
- Bite me, Frank.
- Ask me, you're better off.

261
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,094
I didn't.

262
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,595
Second EKG is unchanged
and troponin is negative.

263
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,893
He's pain-free after
nitro and metoprolol.

264
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,558
So he's okay?

265
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:34,299
Well, doesn't look like a heart attack,
but I think he has unstable angina.

266
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,739
One of the arteries
may be closing down.

267
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,845
You have to stay in the hospital
for observation and more tests.

268
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,743
- For how long?
- Could be just a day or two.

269
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,481
- You okay with that?
- Like I got a choice?

270
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,184
You hang in there.

271
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,654
I'll stop by later if I can.

272
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,884
Um, excuse me.

273
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:58,628
Excuse me, hi. It might
be better if you stayed.

274
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,289
The cardiologist
is gonna have...

275
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,969
questions and instructions
for you and your husband.

276
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,298
I'm not Lee's wife.
I'm his therapist.

277
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,666
Are you a doctor?

278
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,509
I am his satisfaction
facilitator.

279
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,940
What is that exactly?

280
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,909
I have a select group
of clients like Lee...

281
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,349
who require something
they're not getting at home.

282
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,514
Something sexual?

283
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,686
I provide the one
thing that's missing.

284
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,591
Which allows them to live
happily ever after with their wives.

285
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,528
- Really?
- I help women too.

286
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,165
- You call me if he needs anything.
- Okay.

287
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,638
Sixty cc's of gastrografin
and check KUB.

288
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,300
What's this?

289
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,775
Nursing-home dump.

290
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,746
I'm changing G-tubes
on comatose patients now.

291
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,476
- How's your MI?
- Unstable angina.

292
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,283
Just out of curiosity, what type of
guy hires a satisfaction facilitator?

293
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,087
I believe that's the politically
correct term for call girl these days.

294
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,491
A smart one? We
have a saying in Croatia:

295
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,324
You know, if it
floats, flies or...

296
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,368
- Fornicates?
- Rent it.

297
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,334
- Hey, Dr. Kovac.
- Hello. Hello.

298
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,031
I thought I might take you
up on that offer for coffee.

299
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,475
- If you've got a minute.
- Sure. Page me if you need me.

300
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,881
How many stitches?

301
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:27,213
Let's see. There's seven on
the forehead. Five on the cheek.

302
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,548
That's 12 altogether.
That's not so bad.

303
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,318
Neela, this is Brad,
Judy's husband.

304
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,629
Hey, baby.

305
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:42,301
- Honey, I'm so sorry.
- Come on, it wasn't your fault.

306
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,438
The police told me what happened.
The bastards should be shot.

307
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:49,736
- I tried to get away and I lost control.
- You did everything you could.

308
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:53,073
Don't worry. The cops
will get these guys.

309
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,739
- Have you seen Grace?
- She looks good.

310
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,351
- They think she's gonna be okay.
- Really?

311
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,748
We have to run a few tests.

312
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,752
Everything looks good,
but soon as I can...

313
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,788
I'll bring her down so
you can be with her.

314
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,357
Thanks.

315
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,756
I'm gonna go back and stay with Grace
until they're ready to bring her in here.

316
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,669
- I love you.
- I love you too.

317
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,074
Your husband
seems like a great guy.

318
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,188
- It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.

319
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,823
Okay, well, the Venus
Fly Trap is non-toxic...

320
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,521
so it's not a
lethal if ingested.

321
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,224
However, the larger ones
are extremely dangerous...

322
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,361
and have been known to
devour pets and small children.

323
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,440
No, no, no, I made
that last part up.

324
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,237
Uh...

325
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,440
I'm sorry. Ma'am, I...

326
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:09,956
You're absolutely right.
This is not a venue for humor.

327
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,354
I understand. I apologize.

328
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,585
You too.

329
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,032
Do you need any
help with the snakes?

330
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,606
- We could have gone to the cafeteria.
- This one. Their coffee sucks.

331
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,021
You didn't mention seeing me upstairs
to anyone else by any chance, did you?

332
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,591
No.

333
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,227
I mean, I...

334
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,023
I wouldn't have said
anything to you...

335
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,133
but I thought you might wanna
talk to someone or something...

336
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,997
- Yeah, no, I appreciate the gesture.
- Okay.

337
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,269
- So, what are your treatment options?
- Well...

338
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,174
I've opted for a
radical prostatectomy.

339
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,612
My urologist, Dr. Peter
Singh. You know him?

340
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:11,807
No.

341
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,648
He does a bilateral
nerve-sparing procedure...

342
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,790
for patients with
low volume disease.

343
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:21,189
- That's great.
- Even in the best of circumstances...

344
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,456
there's a 25 percent chance
of loss of erectile function.

345
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:30,336
Yeah. Then you're looking
at penile injection therapy...

346
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,304
intraurethral pharmacotherapy,
vacuum erection devices...

347
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,672
or a penile prosthesis to
achieve an adequate erection.

348
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:45,344
Well, I... Then the good news is that
there's 75 percent chance of success.

349
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,511
Well, the procedure also
eliminates the ability to ejaculate.

350
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:49,978
Uh-huh.

351
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,318
But the chance of urinary
incontinence is low...

352
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,586
so I won't be wearing a diaper
or need an artificial sphincter.

353
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,162
Well, there you go.

354
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,960
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

355
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,840
It is... It's just...

356
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,808
It's rather daunting, knowing
that you may never have sex again.

357
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,104
Well, it sounds like
you're in good hands.

358
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:16,645
Yeah.

359
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:23,086
Look, I know this is rather unconventional
and under different circumstances...

360
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,783
I certainly would have employed
a more traditional approach...

361
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:31,090
with regards to courtship
and romantic methodology...

362
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,631
and assuredly enjoyed
all the ritual of that.

363
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,759
But given the
time constraints...

364
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,201
and obviously what I'm
potentially faced with...

365
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,670
You know, you might
just wanna kind of take...

366
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,275
Look.

367
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:49,081
If I'm going down, I
wanna go down swinging...

368
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,581
and I'd like it to be with you.

369
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:58,246
So you want me
to sleep with you?

370
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,555
Yeah.

371
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,288
Well, that's
something. That's...

372
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,499
I'm flattered, I think. But I...

373
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,136
- I can't do that.
- No, no. I understand.

374
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,372
- Nothing personal.
- No, I understand.

375
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:26,876
I was asking purely
from a scientific approach.

376
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,115
What about after?

377
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:32,917
- After what?
- The surgery.

378
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,492
To see if anything still works.

379
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,959
I'm gonna have to
take a pass on that too.

380
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,954
Yeah.

381
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,794
Abby, you want this?
GSW to the upper chest.

382
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,131
I gotta... I better go
back. You wanna hop on?

383
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,071
I mean, are you coming?
To the... For the...

384
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:53,372
Place the chest tube, call me if
the initial output is over 500 cc's.

385
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,316
How's Grace?

386
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,581
We moved her to one of our
exam rooms, so we'll take you too.

387
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,385
I've brought some mug
books for you to look through.

388
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,661
It all happened so fast, I'm not
really sure what I remember seeing.

389
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,027
Take a look, maybe a
face will jog your memory.

390
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,998
I can't.

391
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:21,099
- Why don't you give us a few minutes?
- Sure.

392
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,707
I don't wanna look
at those books.

393
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,903
You might identify the
men who drove you off...

394
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,479
I can't.

395
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,676
- Why not?
- It was pouring rain.

396
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,584
I could barely see
out the window.

397
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,755
Car started to skid,
and I don't know.

398
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,419
I saw the wall coming, and I
didn't stop. I just kept driving. I just...

399
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,260
What are you saying,
Judy? What happened?

400
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,597
I didn't know that Grace's
car seat wasn't clicked in.

401
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:57,368
I would never do
anything to hurt my child.

402
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,540
Did you do this on purpose?

403
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,421
Sometimes, I...

404
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,150
I can't help it. Sometimes...

405
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:18,662
It's like I don't know
how to snap out of it.

406
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:24,333
It's like everything's coming at me at
once and I just want it all to go away.

407
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,301
- Judy, did you try to hurt yourself?
- I just wanted it to stop.

408
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,152
- Do either of you have a moment?
- Shoot.

409
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,016
My MVC mom's suffering from
severe postpartum depression.

410
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,850
- Dr. Weaver?
- Just one second.

411
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,186
- It's the baby, Grace Anderson.
- What about her?

412
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,351
She's waking up. You
might wanna extubate.

413
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:54,057
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- What are her symptoms?

414
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,828
She drove head-on into a
wall with her baby in the car.

415
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,904
I think it was intentional. I'd
like to put her on a psych hold.

416
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,700
- Dr. Rasgotra?
- It's the husband.

417
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,867
Get Psych down here.

418
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,036
Can my wife go home now?
- Not yet.

419
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,842
You moved Judy out of the trauma room.
I thought that meant she was good to go.

420
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,314
We needed to clear the room.

421
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,350
We have to rule out
a cardiac contusion.

422
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,183
We need to monitor her heart
to make sure it's not bruised.

423
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,382
For how long?

424
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,186
I'm not sure. It
could be a while.

425
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,992
Mr. Anderson...

426
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,031
Does Judy drink alcohol?

427
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:33,402
No. I mean, she has a glass
of wine now and then. Why?

428
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,272
What about drugs?

429
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,610
No. What's this all about?

430
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,945
Just routine questions
for her chart to avoid...

431
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,515
any drug interaction,
that sort of thing.

432
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,885
Have you noticed any
change in her mood lately?

433
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,818
Like what?

434
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,550
- She seem depressed?
- No.

435
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,359
Any loss of appetite
or trouble sleeping?

436
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,123
You're kidding, right? We
have a three-month-old baby.

437
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,894
When Gracey doesn't
sleep, none of us do.

438
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,800
The sooner I can get them both home,
the sooner they can start getting better.

439
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,376
I don't want to send her home
until I'm sure there's no danger.

440
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:14,240
No, of course. You're
right. Thank you.

441
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,542
Dr. Kovac, could you
help me clear some beds?

442
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,516
- I thought I was.
- If we work together...

443
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,679
Look, what's going
on in Exam Two?

444
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,257
DUB needs an ultrasound
to rule out fibroids.

445
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,417
Good crits, vitals stable.

446
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,859
How about an outpatient
scan and GYN referral?

447
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,967
- Well, if you can get her in this week.
- Done. Okay, next. Buster Freeman?

448
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,103
Dirty puncture wound to
the foot, waiting on IV Ancef.

449
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,399
Can he sit in a chair for
that? It frees up a bed.

450
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,906
- Crystal Marranachio?
- Waiting on an ortho consult.

451
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,137
She's been cleared.
I called the attending.

452
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:46,671
You what?

453
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,814
It's a new policy. When
we call for a consult...

454
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:53,112
the resident has 60 minutes to respond
to the page or we call the attending.

455
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:57,916
All the department heads signed off
on it except Psych. Crazy bastards.

456
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:03,320
- Blaire Collins has been here forever.
- I've called the nursing home twice.

457
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,430
They were supposed
to send a ride for her.

458
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,260
Well, if they're not here in
10, I'm putting her in a cab.

459
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:12,565
- She's comatose.
- I was kidding, Dr. Kovac.

460
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,477
Frank, call Blaire Collins'
nursing home again...

461
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:22,240
and tell those idiots she's been
ready to go home for the last four hours.

462
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,645
- Tell them yourself. I'm busy.
- Dr. Kovac?

463
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,251
I think I'm one of those idiots.

464
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,785
Trish Gorham, assistant
director from the nursing home...

465
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,651
- that's been caring for Blaire Collins.
- I didn't mean that.

466
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,350
It's our policy to check
on patients prior to transfer.

467
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,156
- I gather she's well enough to return.
- Yes, she's right over here. This way.

468
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,391
To be honest with you, all she
needs is a course of IV antibiotics.

469
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:44,127
And the G-tube could have
been changed at your facility.

470
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:48,104
We're not staffed well and the
gastroenterologist doesn't come out.

471
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,004
The earliest I could get anyone
to see her was in two weeks.

472
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,338
- She have any family?
- No.

473
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,708
Her mother died from
the crash that did this.

474
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:59,181
There was a boyfriend, but he
stopped coming around years ago.

475
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,917
He didn't even try to stop.
Somebody call my son.

476
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,717
A 47-year-old, victim
of auto vs. pedestrian.

477
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:09,487
I just ran out to get the kids some
pizza. He didn't even slow down.

478
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,029
Systolic's only 80 after a liter.
Pulse, 140. Pale and diaphoretic.

479
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,190
Ecchymosis across
the abdomen and pelvis.

480
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,700
Four units of O-neg and
prime the rapid infuser.

481
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,065
Am I dying?

482
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,036
No, but you may have
some internal bleeding.

483
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,040
Resps are shallow.
Let's set up for intubation.

484
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,372
- How often are you sad?
- Not often.

485
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:31,916
- What makes you happy, Judy?
- Being with my baby, my husband.

486
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,019
Why are you asking me all this?

487
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,916
We ask all patients
these questions...

488
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,922
to assess mental status
following a head injury.

489
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:43,828
Well, my mental
status is fine. Really.

490
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,690
Any thoughts about
wanting to hurt yourself?

491
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:54,062
Not unless you count wanting
to take a carving knife to my hips.

492
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,535
Do you ever think about
wanting to hurt your baby?

493
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,435
Of course not.

494
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,207
What did you tell him?

495
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:07,978
Judy, you said you were upset
and that you couldn't snap out of it.

496
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,916
What are you talking about?

497
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,684
You felt like everything was coming
at you and that you wanted it all to stop.

498
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:19,423
No, no, I said that I lost control
of the car and I couldn't stop.

499
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,964
You're putting
words in my mouth.

500
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,568
It's not uncommon for new
moms to have bouts of depression.

501
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,034
The first year with your
baby can be very stressful.

502
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,141
I'm not stressed and I'm not
depressed although I will be...

503
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,470
if I have to spend
any more time here.

504
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,408
So stop accusing me of
being crazy and let me go.

505
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,481
Nobody's accusing
you of anything.

506
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:40,050
We have to be extra careful
whenever there's a child involved.

507
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:47,117
Look, I don't know. I
appreciate your concern, really.

508
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,692
There's nothing wrong with me.

509
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,963
I've had a rough day...

510
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,464
and I just wanna take my
baby home and get some rest.

511
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,763
Well, I hope you have a
speedy recovery, Mrs. Anderson.

512
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,613
So are we good to go?

513
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,410
Not quite, but you can go
back inside now. I'll be right in.

514
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,152
She's changed her story.

515
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,256
There are no vegetative
symptoms, no anhedonia.

516
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,359
She doesn't have a depressed
affect. She's in good spirits.

517
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,963
Something's going on. She as
much as confessed to crashing her car.

518
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,970
- But she's not saying that now.
- She's lying.

519
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,624
She's a prime
candidate for severe...

520
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,292
I wanna be sure
she doesn't have...

521
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,439
postpartum depression
just as much as you do.

522
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,506
But it can be
difficult to diagnose.

523
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,166
If the patient is in complete
denial or lying to me...

524
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,211
not only can I not tell,
but I cannot hold her.

525
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,817
I gave her every opportunity
to let us know. I'm sorry.

526
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,980
Whoa.

527
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,886
- You need a hand?
- I need eight.

528
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,959
- God, it hurts.
- What's this?

529
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,096
Driver of our auto
versus pedestrian.

530
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,664
The guy ran out in front of
me. Please, give me something.

531
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:05,668
No neck pain, no chest pain, good vitals,
but complains of bilateral thumb pain.

532
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,272
Look at this, I can't
even make a fist.

533
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,671
- We're out of beds.
- I'll see what I can do.

534
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,573
Dr. Weaver, Psych's refusing
to admit Judy Anderson.

535
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,873
- Psych?
- Her collision was a deliberate act.

536
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,984
I know you suspect postpartum
depression, but did she admit it?

537
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,518
Practically. She drove
head-on into a wall.

538
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:25,089
The baby's seat wasn't properly anchored.
She's obviously overwhelmed at home.

539
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:31,327
ER, please hold. Please hold.
Please hold. Has anybody seen Jerry?

540
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,897
I sent him out on an errand,
but he should be back by now.

541
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,399
- You sent him out?
- You don't send Jerry out in the rain.

542
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,901
- I've heard that too.
- Maybe I should get DCFS involved.

543
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,734
Have you talked to the husband?
Maybe he can convince her.

544
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:44,240
A voluntary admission
would be better.

545
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,107
- I'll try.
- Frank, where's Jerry?

546
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,216
- Dr. Weaver sent him on an errand.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

547
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,578
What's the big deal?

548
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:54,743
Big man does not do
well in the wet weather.

549
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,411
What the hell does that mean?

550
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,853
Excuse me. Could you
help us find our dad?

551
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,119
- Lawrence Digby? He was hit by a car.
- The doctors are treating him.

552
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,854
- He got hit while crossing the street.
- Yeah, he was...

553
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,556
Guy was talking on his cell
phone, wasn't paying attention...

554
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,328
went right through the
crosswalk. I'll take you back to him.

555
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,437
You can go home. I
got a float from the ICU.

556
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,436
I'm gonna stay and
help with this guy's kids.

557
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,166
You're welcome to do
so, but you're off the clock.

558
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,471
- Fine with me. Come on, you guys.
- Can I take her home now?

559
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,511
We'd like to keep her overnight.

560
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:27,585
- Oh, come on. Overnight? Why?
- I think your wife needs some help.

561
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,086
I've tried to talk her
into getting a nanny...

562
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,350
but she doesn't want another
woman raising her daughter.

563
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,324
It makes her feel like she's
less of a mother or something.

564
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,330
I don't mean that kind of help. I think
Judy needs some psychiatric help.

565
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,531
- What?
- Mr. Anderson...

566
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:48,173
Brad, why don't we sit down?

567
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,778
It's not uncommon for new
moms to get overwhelmed...

568
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,349
with all the challenges of child
care, especially in the first year.

569
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,646
So why are you making
a big deal out of this?

570
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,621
Usually, it's short-lived and goes
away after the baby falls into a routine...

571
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,726
and the mom's
hormones stabilize.

572
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:12,456
But occasionally, it lasts
longer, becomes more severe...

573
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,130
and develops into something
called postpartum depression.

574
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,860
Yeah, yeah, but that's not Judy.

575
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,868
Judy's not depressed.
Not like that.

576
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,804
I mean, sure, she's
anxious to get back to work...

577
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,536
and sometimes she's a little
down about that, but that's normal.

578
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:31,044
Purposely trying to hurt
herself and your baby isn't.

579
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,549
What are you talking
about? She had an accident.

580
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,455
Some creep tried to
run her off the road.

581
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,280
I don't think she was
forced off the road.

582
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,982
Dr. Rasgotra. Nosebleed
on Coumadin in Two.

583
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,424
Okay. Please, talk to your wife.

584
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,598
Ask her yourself. Ask her
what really happened in the car.

585
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,000
- Sux onboard.
- Yankauer.

586
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,197
- Assist ventilations.
- O-neg's going on the right antecube.

587
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,933
- We're going to need rapid infuser.
- Curtain four.

588
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,580
- They did an in-service. I got it.
- Okay, let's take a look.

589
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,341
- Sats down to 92.
- Turn on the suction.

590
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:05,916
- It's on.
- No, it's not.

591
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,417
- I have it on high.
- I'm not getting anything here.

592
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:12,115
Inez, why don't you go next door and
help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube?

593
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,260
I'm not allowed to work
with any of the nurses now?

594
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,419
Patient is paralyzed,
I can't see the cords.

595
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,258
- I need suction.
- Hold your horses.

596
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,196
The suction container
wasn't sealed properly.

597
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,633
- You're welcome.
- Tube.

598
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:30,037
- I found it. KOVAC:
Two units on the infuser.

599
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,178
Set up for a subclavian.
Okay, bag him.

600
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:39,810
- End tidal CO2 is yellow.
- Yellow is good. I'll be right back.

601
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,113
All right, hook me up.

602
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,420
O-silk is next.

603
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,289
- O-silk. Come on.
- Here you go.

604
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,125
- I wanna auto-transfuse this guy.
- Okay.

605
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,290
You need a side
collector on the thoraseal.

606
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,561
Just go help Dr. Kovac
with the rapid infuser.

607
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,762
No problem.

608
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,299
- What do you need?
- Central line, supraumbilical DPL.

609
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:08,140
- Rapid infuser and a TPOD.
- What's a TPOD?

610
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:11,306
- Fine, I'll get it. Again.
- What do you want to do first?

611
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,679
- Prime the O-neg.
- Everything okay in there?

612
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,487
For the time being. Call
for four units of type specific.

613
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:21,650
- As soon as I get this up.
- Hey, Sam.

614
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,657
Hypotensive pelvic
fracture. He needs the works.

615
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,822
- Those are his kids out there.
- Hey, Frank.

616
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,763
Bring those guys
to the family room.

617
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:33,030
- Sure, come on, kids. This way.
- I'll be right in.

618
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,502
Great.

619
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,370
- Guidewire.
- I'm getting error signal.

620
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,034
That's because there's not
enough water in the warmer.

621
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,339
- Thanks.
- Cordis inducer.

622
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,442
Stitch.

623
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,726
- Where's Dori with the TPOD?
- TPODs are in the bottom shelf.

624
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,953
Update his vitals.

625
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,324
- Okay, infuser is on.
- Looks good.

626
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,559
- Cath... INEZ:
Pressure's up to 95 palp.

627
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,066
- No gross blood. PEYTON:
Where do you need me?

628
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,268
- We're all set.
- She's good.

629
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,812
Thanks, Sam. We'll
take it from here.

630
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,944
- I'll go check on his kids.
- She's really not sure...

631
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,145
what happened. She gave
herself a good whack in the head.

632
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,223
We can't do anything if she
doesn't identify her assailants.

633
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,190
That's okay. Like I said, she's
not sure what she remembers.

634
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,421
She's not even certain
it was intentional now.

635
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,065
Fine. Let me know if
she changes her mind.

636
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:39,204
You did the right thing.
Next is get your wife help.

637
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,397
No, the next step is
for me to take her home.

638
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,042
My wife is not crazy. She
had an accident. It happens.

639
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:48,340
I'd rather she chose to stay than
have Psychiatry put her on forced hold.

640
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,778
She's gonna be with
me. She's gonna be fine.

641
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,817
Just leave us alone. I mean it.

642
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,749
Pressure's up to
100 systolic, crit's 28.

643
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,086
Send another four units to angio.
- Daddy?

644
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,057
Your dad has a broken pelvis...

645
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:06,096
which are the ring of
bones around his waist.

646
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,460
Some of his blood vessels
have also been damaged.

647
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,932
He's bleeding inside.

648
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,435
Can you fix it?

649
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:17,235
We're gonna try, but he's
lost a lot of blood already.

650
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,378
It's very serious.

651
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,611
It was supposed to be me.

652
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,910
I was supposed to get the pizza,
but I didn't wanna go out in the rain.

653
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,713
It's not your fault and
it's not your dad's fault.

654
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,412
- Hey, jerk-off.
- Jason.

655
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:34,855
I can't drive for a week. Not that
I could anyway. My car's totaled.

656
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,486
What's so important you
had to be talking while driving?

657
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,098
- What was so damn important?
- Hey, that's enough.

658
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,633
- Hey, get that guy away from me.
- Shut up.

659
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:47,637
Jason, I know you're mad, but
your father's condition is very serious.

660
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:50,970
And your brother and sister
need you right now, okay?

661
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,480
Come on, Jason, I'll take
you to the family room.

662
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,449
Dr. Kovac, one of your
patients is getting agitated.

663
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,088
- Which one?
- The girl from the nursing home.

664
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,123
- She's in a coma, Inez.
- Not anymore.

665
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,660
- Blaire?
- Where...?

666
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,425
I'm Dr. Kovac.

667
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,331
Where's my mom?

668
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:27,468
Okay, keep your hands
up as if you're holding a tray.

669
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,315
What's wrong with me?

670
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,587
What's the last
thing you remember?

671
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:53,666
My mom and I were going to
the mall and it was snowing.

672
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,505
And...

673
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,803
Were we in an accident?

674
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,005
Is she okay?

675
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,519
I didn't treat her, but...

676
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,625
Let me see what I
can find out. Okay?

677
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,054
Okay.

678
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:26,132
- How is she?
- She doesn't remember anything.

679
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,337
What are you gonna tell her?

680
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't know. Your mother's dead
and you've been in a coma for six years?

681
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,712
- How are those kids doing?
- They're hanging in there.

682
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,978
I got ahold of an aunt and
uncle. They're with them now.

683
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:45,749
- Inez, walk with me.
- Do I have to?

684
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,088
- You have fantastic potential.
- I better get into this.

685
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,128
But in every spare moment,
you've got to be honing your skills.

686
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:53,560
- Got a second?
- Not really.

687
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,597
If you're so concerned
with efficiency...

688
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:59,260
then allow those of us who work
well together to continue to do so.

689
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,930
If you want us to act like professionals,
then you need to treat us as such.

690
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,508
You saw me with Dr. Kovac
and how well we worked together.

691
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,771
If that doesn't prove we
can work the same shift...

692
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,472
then you don't know your
job as well as you think you do.

693
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,080
Feel better?

694
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:19,516
FYI, I already changed the schedule.
You're back on your old shifts next week.

695
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,021
Thank you.

696
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,594
When I first started, I
could barely hook up an IV.

697
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,289
It's all muscle memory.
You'll get it. I know you will.

698
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,129
I felt like an idiot. I didn't
even know what a T-POD was.

699
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,965
Everybody needs help with
stuff. When you do, come find me.

700
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,367
Thanks.

701
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,810
- Page me when he's out of surgery.
- Will do.

702
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,372
- You're back.
- Had a cancellation.

703
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,605
He's this way.

704
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,681
I tried Lee's cell but
he wasn't answering.

705
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,613
- Is everything okay?
- He's doing great.

706
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,276
We're just waiting for them
to take him to the cath lab.

707
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:50,649
That sounds ominous.

708
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:54,657
They're going to do angioplasty, which is
a procedure where we insert a catheter...

709
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:58,024
into a blood vessel in his leg,
thread it up to his coronary artery...

710
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,995
which inflates a balloon
that will open up the blockage.

711
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,327
Guess those cheese
steaks caught up with me.

712
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,561
I've been telling him
to eat better for years.

713
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,001
Lee?

714
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,505
Hey, you. Hey.

715
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:13,110
This is my wife, Viv.

716
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,776
- Hi.
- Hi.

717
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,245
I'm Dr. Lockhart. I've
been treating your husband.

718
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,682
- Hi.
- Everything's okay.

719
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,688
I've got a little blockage,
but they're gonna fix it.

720
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,419
I didn't get your name.

721
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,292
Shawna. Hi.

722
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,794
And you are?

723
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,826
Therapist.

724
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,299
From cardiology.

725
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,296
Really?

726
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,371
Your husband has to
undergo an angioplasty.

727
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,205
We insert a catheter into
a blood vessel in his leg...

728
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:51,440
and use it to inflate a balloon that
will hopefully open the blockage.

729
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:58,718
- Oh, okay.
- Well. Good luck, Mr. Rappaport.

730
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:03,224
I have to get back to my other
patients. It was nice to meet you.

731
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,556
Excuse me for just one second.

732
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,962
That was close.

733
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,695
Thanks, I really owe you one.

734
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,303
Hey, listen. If you ever
need a sex therapist?

735
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,344
I think I'm good.

736
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,475
But now that you mention it, do
you ever do any pro bono work?

737
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,246
I spoke to your resident. He
felt a hold was unnecessary.

738
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,888
I disagree and all I'm asking...

739
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,422
is for a second assessment
from another attending.

740
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,753
Watch it. No,
Dr. Wakita, not you.

741
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,192
Where have you been?
I was worried about you.

742
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:42,095
Everyone was acting as if
I'd sent you out in a hurricane.

743
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,800
Are you okay?

744
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,276
What the hell happened
to King Funshine?

745
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,607
Did you get hit
by lightning again?

746
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,683
He didn't get hit by lightning.

747
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,918
Here's your change.

748
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,619
Okay, let's get you
on a cardiac monitor.

749
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:13,788
CBC, chem panel, EKG, CPK,
troponin, UA and myoglobin...

750
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,197
I realize that, I'm sure he is. But
this isn't about me or him, or you.

751
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,962
It's about the welfare of
a mother and her child.

752
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:24,269
You will? Great.
Thank you so much.

753
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:26,536
Psych attending will
assess Judy Anderson.

754
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,374
If Dr. Wakita asks, you agree
with my assessment, right?

755
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,776
Yeah, you got it.

756
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:38,652
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,
I have some good news.

757
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:40,985
One of the attendings
agreed to speak with you.

758
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,492
- I've seen enough doctors today.
- We're going home.

759
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,892
- He's on his way down.
- We've been here for hours.

760
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,192
- This will only take a few minutes.
- I'm tired.

761
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:52,235
I just wanna go home and have a dinner
and a bath and put Grace in her own crib.

762
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,236
- You want what's best for baby, so do I.
- Then leave us alone.

763
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,375
- Speak to someone.
- She just needs to rest.

764
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,637
You don't wanna hurt yourself or
Grace. You need professional help.

765
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,576
- Do you have children?
- No.

766
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,841
- Then how do you know?
- I'm a doctor.

767
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:07,281
- But you're not a mother.
- Judy, listen to me.

768
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,750
Please, don't go.

769
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,822
My wife has a touch of the baby
blues and you wanna lock her up.

770
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:15,118
No one's locking anyone up. Just
want her to get the help she needs.

771
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:16,591
- By giving her drugs?
- Maybe.

772
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,662
Ignoring it is not
gonna make it go away.

773
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:21,731
It needs to be treated the
same as any other disease.

774
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:25,768
Now, this could happen again.
Only next time, it could be worse.

775
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:31,433
Judy, Judy, please. You could
die, Judy. Your baby could die.
