1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,865
<i>Previously on ER:</i>

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,407
You ever come near my
daughter again and I'll kill you.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,011
When I said we can't see
each other, I really meant that.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,619
Just because my dad's a jerk
doesn't mean we can't keep going.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:15,874
I got my ass kicked once.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,075
<i>Michael and I love each other.</i>

7
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,489
Anyway, his tour's over.

8
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:21,745
What if he gets stationed
in, like, Romania?

9
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:24,255
He's hoping to finish in
a stateside Army hospital.

10
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,824
- I need a few weeks off.
- Why?

11
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,484
My band got a recording deal.

12
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,823
- Resignation accepted.
- What?

13
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,193
Kind of decided the band's
gotta make some changes.

14
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,665
I want us to have this baby.

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,902
Our ice fishermen are on nebs
waiting for a respiratory therapist.

16
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,272
Morgue picked up the nun.

17
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,744
Our puking boy went
home with a liter of saline...

18
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,783
a Compazine suppository
and two very angry parents.

19
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,579
What about the
post-op cellulitis?

20
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,779
Surgical floor. Lucien
was feeling generous.

21
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,651
She threatened to hurt me.

22
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,156
You see that? Overnight
shift has no pass-ons.

23
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,794
Gold stars all around.

24
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,691
We have no Attending
for the day shift.

25
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,991
Clemente hasn't showed
up and can't be reached.

26
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,192
Once again, that's a problem
for the Chief of ER, and that's you.

27
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,633
- You can't cover until he shows up?
- No, I can't.

28
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,968
I got physical therapy upstairs
and I'm supposed to stay off my feet.

29
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,473
After that, I am out of here.

30
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,133
I could stay for
a few minutes...

31
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,473
- if you have to leave.
- There you go.

32
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,679
Hey, Barnett. What the
hell are you doing here?

33
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,649
- Uh, working.
- You quit.

34
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,255
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

35
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,949
Remember, you came to me
and you gave me an ultimatum.

36
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,560
Said you needed time off to
cut your album or you'd quit.

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,462
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

38
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,260
Your band, Skunk Hollow.

39
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,800
Oh. I'm sorry, but
I'm not in a band.

40
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,371
I swear. Look, Dr. Weaver, you were
pretty doped up the last time we talked.

41
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,513
- Maybe you were just tripping a bit?
- I don't trip.

42
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,674
Well, if you say so.

43
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,849
- Is she coming?
- No.

44
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,049
- But she is watching me, isn't she?
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,324
- Now?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,021
Wait, now. Now she's going.

47
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,899
Well, congratulations, Dr. Rasgotra.
You must have impressed Albright.

48
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,233
How so?

49
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,842
You've been accepted
into the surgical elective.

50
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,876
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,105
Oh, my God, thank you.
Thank you very much.

52
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,283
I hope you feel the
same way in three weeks.

53
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,248
Well, I'll certainly try. I'm
gonna go and phone Michael.

54
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,684
So you and Mikey are gonna
get your own place now?

55
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:39,122
Michael. We'll be out of your hair soon.
We're looking for a place this afternoon.

56
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,591
Dr. Barnett, do you know
a girl named Zoe Butler?

57
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,590
No. Maybe.

58
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,361
Yeah, well maybe she's
here looking for you. Exam 2.

59
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,935
I...

60
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,599
Zoe, what are you doing?
I told you not to come here.

61
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:59,440
You know I can't see you as
a doctor or as anything else.

62
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,095
Ow, ow.

63
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,002
Sorry, you're gonna
have some bruising...

64
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,336
but at least your eye
socket isn't fractured.

65
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,139
- Arm films are back.
- Oh, thanks, Inez.

66
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:10,307
We're gonna clean up the cuts on your
face and then I'm gonna stitch you up.

67
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,782
Will I have scars?

68
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,753
Well, maybe some discoloration,
but it should all fade with time.

69
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,485
So it looks like
you broke your ulna.

70
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,322
Which is the bone right in here. We
like to call this a nightstick fracture.

71
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,432
We often see it in people
who try to protect themselves.

72
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,098
So do you wanna tell
me what really happened?

73
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,832
I told you, I fell.

74
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,266
I was running to catch the
bus, I tripped on the curb.

75
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,870
It's true.

76
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,208
Okay.

77
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,874
Okay, I'll call your father
and let him know you're here.

78
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,184
- Wait, Ray.
- What?

79
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,947
Don't call him.

80
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,156
Why not?

81
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,429
You gotta talk to me, Zoe.

82
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,431
He's the one who did this.

83
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,733
Yo, Dr. M. Got your
breakfast and your threads.

84
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,741
Thanks. Did they get the
chocolate sauce out of the tux shirt?

85
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,846
I don't know. But here are
the magazines you asked for.

86
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,572
What do you think you're doing?

87
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,580
- You talking to me?
- To both of you.

88
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,618
You're here to work as a
volunteer, not his personal assistant.

89
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,049
I was just going up...

90
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,282
Just about to give me some lame
excuse and I don't want to hear it.

91
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,723
Get your butt over to the Admit
desk and check in with Jerry.

92
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,387
He's a good kid.

93
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,355
- Bagel?
- Look, man.

94
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,398
Stop using him as
your own personal valet.

95
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,561
Buying your lunch and
your dirty magazines.

96
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,606
Hey, take this and could
you just pick these up...

97
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,373
and put everything in the
Doctor's Lounge? Thank you.

98
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,345
Greg, wait up.

99
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,916
Wait up, I need some advice.

100
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,485
- Stop smoking dope, slow down on porn.
- Serious.

101
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,918
- I am serious.
- I got a date, her name is Tamara.

102
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,455
I met her online.

103
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:01,322
No, it's not like that. She's
smart, beautiful, funny, black.

104
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,953
Sorry, African-American. But
I've never dated a sister before.

105
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,657
- Please don't say that.
- What, "sister"?

106
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,327
- Dr. Pratt? Were you looking for me?
- Yeah, Penny. Take it easy, relax.

107
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,440
I just heard a good teaching
case came in. Come on. Let's go.

108
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,442
- Well, are you gonna help me out or not?
- You need professional help.

109
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,337
You sure you're
gonna be all right?

110
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,780
We got in this fight
a few days ago.

111
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,952
He hit me so I took off.

112
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:35,122
I was staying at my
friend Laura's house...

113
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,996
and he was waiting for
me outside my school...

114
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,361
and he made me come back home.

115
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,469
Then he did this.

116
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,100
It's not the first time.

117
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:53,171
Is there anyone else I can call?
Like an aunt or an uncle or something?

118
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,842
- No.
- Well, what about your sister?

119
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,620
Jen lives in San Francisco.

120
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,019
My dad doesn't
know about it, though.

121
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,989
I swore I'd never
tell him where she is.

122
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,693
He beat her so bad one
time, she missed her midterms.

123
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,003
I think... Ow.

124
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:22,309
I think there's something
really wrong with him.

125
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,142
Like he can't help himself.

126
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,481
Well, he's not gonna be
beating anyone else up...

127
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,881
once the cops get
through with him.

128
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,885
Oh, no, no. You
can't call the police.

129
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,187
I came here because
I knew you wouldn't.

130
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,690
He assaulted you,
Zoe. I have to call them.

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,595
No, you don't. It
just makes it worse.

132
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,358
I called them once and they didn't
arrest him. It just made him madder.

133
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,665
Trust me. They'll
arrest him this time.

134
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,737
Well, then what?

135
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,671
What happens when he gets
out? He'll come looking for me.

136
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,642
Zoe...

137
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:00,976
Can I move in with you?

138
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,818
I have nowhere else to go.

139
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,381
We got an open fracture in 4.

140
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:15,757
Some sort of parasitic infection
in 1 and a foreign-body inhalation.

141
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,727
It looks like a roach clip,
according to one of the nurses.

142
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,834
- I'm a little busy here.
- And we're a lot backed up out there.

143
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,494
It's gonna get worse unless
you start signing these...

144
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,539
and a half dozen discharges
waiting for your John Hancock.

145
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,610
- All right, I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

146
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,246
No.

147
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,375
- Urine looks like pea soup.
- Bingo. Send off a culture.

148
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,984
Heard you had a good one for Penny.
- Urosepsis.

149
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,383
- What's the antibiotic of choice?
- Levaquin.

150
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,080
- Ceftriaxone.
- Okay, fine.

151
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,591
In vitro, ceftriaxone might give
you a better gram negative coverage.

152
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,026
- I'll mix up a gram.
- Ma'am, how you doing?

153
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,461
- Ma'am?
- She had a subarachnoid three years ago.

154
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,260
- So this is her baseline?
- Yep.

155
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,598
Penny, what do you know about
early goal-directed therapy of sepsis?

156
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,297
Attempts to balance oxygen
delivery with oxygen demand.

157
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,534
And decreases mortality
through a multi-pronged approach.

158
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,872
She doesn't seem like
a candidate for therapy.

159
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,811
We need to review her chart.
Talk to her primary physician.

160
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,610
If we pursue goal-directed
therapy, where will we start?

161
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,777
- Get her BP up?
- Right, tip of the iceberg.

162
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:18,448
We want MAP above 65, the CVP
over 10, urine output over 5 cc an hour.

163
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:23,928
02 sat above 93, the crit above 30,
most importantly the SVC O2 above 70.

164
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,896
- You'll need a central line.
- With an oxygen-sensing tip.

165
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,298
Okay, hold up. She can
be a DNR for all we know.

166
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:33,304
- I mean, look at her.
- Well, what are you suggesting, Dr. Pratt?

167
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,635
I'm suggesting that we
treat her conservatively.

168
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,744
We give her a couple
of liters of saline...

169
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,903
antibiotics, oxygen,
and see how she does.

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,914
Well, okay, fine. And
dopamine for pressure support.

171
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,951
- Come on. Dopamine?
- Yes. Dopamine. Low dose.

172
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,349
Okay, I'm gonna see if
I can pull an old chart.

173
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,787
You don't have to
stay here for this.

174
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,824
Does that go for me too?

175
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,767
Are you awake?

176
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,933
Barely.

177
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,812
I can't sleep.

178
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,176
Difficult to sleep
when you talk.

179
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,085
- I keep thinking about stuff.
- Then stop thinking about stuff.

180
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,160
Don't you wanna know
what I'm thinking about?

181
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,859
- Mm?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

182
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,831
I'm thinking about what everybody's
gonna say when they find out.

183
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,872
I think they'll be
happy for you.

184
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,373
- Us.
- Mm-hm.

185
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,874
But still, I don't think we should
tell anybody for a couple of weeks.

186
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,809
Uh...

187
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,250
I might have mentioned
something to my father.

188
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,722
You might have mentioned
something to your father?

189
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:01,123
He's in Croatia.
Who's he gonna tell?

190
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,196
- You mention something to your mother?
- Oh, God, no.

191
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,699
- I need to build up to that one.
- Ah.

192
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,066
I'd like to wait until at
least he's in high school.

193
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,866
- He?
- Or she.

194
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,602
Except I think I'd be better with a boy
because the mother-daughter dynamic...

195
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,337
really just scares
the hell out of me.

196
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,674
We're gonna have a baby.

197
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,044
I know.

198
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,550
It's so crazy.

199
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,920
- Where you going?
- I can't sleep.

200
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,360
- You should sleep. You need your rest.
- I'm too wired.

201
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,526
- And I want something to eat.
- Again?

202
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,101
- Just something little like a Pop-Tart.
- No. No more Pop-Tarts.

203
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:52,041
I'll get you something. I'll make
you some breakfast or something.

204
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,774
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

205
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,249
Sats 91 on five liters.

206
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,321
- Change her to a non-rebreather.
- At what point would you intubate?

207
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,888
- Never.
- Where's Clemente?

208
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,491
- Good question.
- Hasn't shown up.

209
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,955
Okay, who's the Attending?

210
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,561
- You're looking at him.
- What? What do you want?

211
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,461
I got a battered teen who doesn't want
me to call the cops on her abusive father.

212
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,569
Okay. Well, call social work.

213
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,135
- I don't think that's a good idea either.
- Reporting is mandatory.

214
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,299
Dr. Dubenko, migraine mom is
banging her head against the wall.

215
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,069
The Alzheimer lady is missing.

216
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,737
There's a homeless guy in
Triage that just puked up...

217
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,146
something that looks like a human
finger. And her husband is here.

218
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,479
Okay, okay, I'll be
there in a minute.

219
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,454
- Could somebody locate Clemente?
- I'll page him.

220
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,953
Mr. Venema, I'm Dr. Dubenko.
I've been treating your wife.

221
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,031
- How is she? How is she doing?
- Not so good.

222
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:51,000
- How long has she been like this?
- Almost, uh, three years now.

223
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,505
We were on the Amalfi Coast
in Italy. She got a bad headache.

224
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,644
I thought it was too much wine.

225
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,177
By the time we
found a hospital...

226
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,607
ahem, she couldn't talk
and she couldn't move.

227
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,754
She bled into her
brain from an aneurysm.

228
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,287
- A subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- Yeah.

229
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:14,692
I thought when we got her to
the hospital, she'd be all right...

230
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,489
but she never woke up.

231
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,326
Does she ever open
her eyes and look at you?

232
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,165
No, not really. But,
uh, she knows I'm here.

233
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:26,704
It's a shame too.
Beautiful blue eyes.

234
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:31,174
That's what got me the first time. She
caught me staring at her in math class.

235
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,137
You've known each
other a long time.

236
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,216
Yeah, well, we
started dating in '49.

237
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,080
Fifty-second wedding
anniversary coming up in March.

238
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,517
Wow, congratulations.

239
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,820
I know she's sick.

240
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,554
But I'm not ready to lose her.

241
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,191
No, uh...

242
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,666
Um, I understand, Mr. Venema.

243
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,396
We'll, um... We'll do
everything we can.

244
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,405
- Thank you.
- Any word on Clemente?

245
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,374
Dude's a no-show.

246
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,673
Okay, set me up with
a cordis introducer...

247
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,043
an art line and type
and cross for four units.

248
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,583
- Excuse me?
- Set me up with a cordis introducer...

249
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,745
No, I heard the orders. I just...
Are you sure you wanna do that?

250
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,756
We're pursuing early
goal-directed therapy of sepsis.

251
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,417
- Ever put in a subclavian line?
- No, I'd like to learn.

252
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,893
Prep the collarbone, we'll
do it. Number 8 gloves.

253
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,292
You should run it by Pratt.

254
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,457
Attendings don't run
things by residents.

255
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,263
- Generally, you're not the ER Attending.
- Okay.

256
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,272
I need to identify the junction of the
median and middle third of the clavicle.

257
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,808
What's up? How's her
pressure? What are you doing?

258
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,106
Subclavian line. Call the
ICU for an SVC O2 catheter.

259
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,081
- We agreed not to do invasive procedures.
- That's her husband out there.

260
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,044
All right, look.

261
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,486
You're a surgeon and you like to
cut and paste everything together.

262
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,956
But sometimes the best thing is
not what we do, but what we don't do.

263
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,426
You know, she's not a
DNR. He wants everything.

264
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,430
Did you explain to him that
she's never gonna get better? Hm?

265
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,830
Did you explain that
she has no quality of life...

266
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,632
and that this bacterial infection may be
nature's way of saying it's time to let go?

267
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,310
Did he use anything
to hit you with?

268
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,319
Just his fists.

269
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,049
Did he, at any point,
threaten to kill you?

270
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,655
Uh, maybe. I don't
really remember.

271
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,596
Okay, I'm gonna take a couple
Polaroids of your injuries, okay?

272
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,331
- Okay.
- Hi, I'm Liz.

273
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,835
I'm with the hospital's
Social Services Department.

274
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,066
- I didn't call you.
- Dr. Dubenko said you needed a hand.

275
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,509
Dr. Dubenko is a surgical
Attending who belongs in the OR.

276
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,478
I'll be right back.

277
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,344
- Her boyfriend do that?
- Father.

278
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,079
- Sexual?
- No. Look, I've got this covered for now.

279
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,349
- She have other family?
- I'm working on it.

280
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,925
If you can't find anyone, I'll
place her in a group home.

281
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,552
- What? They're nightmares.
- Just till foster custody can be secured.

282
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:10,299
- What's to stop him from finding her?
- She's a minor, has to go somewhere.

283
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,371
- Like I said, I'm working on it. Okay?
- Work fast.

284
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,475
I'm not leaving today until
she's placed somewhere.

285
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,801
I sent a squad
car to his office.

286
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,743
- I'll let you know once we get him.
- Great, thanks.

287
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,644
Where have you been?

288
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,713
I watched the Weather Channel...

289
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,355
sorted through the mail,
cleaned some dishes...

290
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,990
refilled the ice-cube trays.

291
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,353
- You're lucky I'm in such a good mood.
- Mm.

292
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,291
- And why's that?
- I got the surgical elective.

293
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,397
Are you kidding?

294
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:42,399
Wow, congratulations.
My wife, the surgeon.

295
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:46,039
And you start by next
week as the new R-2.

296
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,674
- Get out.
- Weaver told me this morning.

297
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,572
I say we go to the Ritz and go
and celebrate with mimosas...

298
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,009
and lobster eggs Benedict.

299
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,172
How about we
go out for dinner...

300
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,580
to celebrate tonight and
you go home and sleep?

301
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,743
We're supposed to go
look at that apartment.

302
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,583
- I'm not tired.
- Of course you're not.

303
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,249
I promised a buddy, Rogan, that
I'd stop by, visit him at the hospital.

304
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,861
- He'll be disappointed if I blow him off.
- Then, go.

305
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,363
- We can run and see him before we leave.
- No, he's at the VA hospital.

306
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,059
He just got transferred
from Walter Reed.

307
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,034
- And I haven't seen him since I left Iraq.
- I'll go with you.

308
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:23,666
I wanna meet your friend. And then
you and I are gonna go and celebrate.

309
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,573
Okay.

310
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,271
I can't believe you put a
central line and an art line.

311
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,687
Don't look at me. SAM: Or me.

312
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,580
I am just trying to give her
the best chance of recovery.

313
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,745
Did you read her chart?
What's her condition, Dr. Pratt?

314
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,949
Chronic vegetative state with
no chance of meaningful recovery.

315
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,559
She can't go to the
medicine floor with an art line.

316
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,958
So pull it.

317
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,562
Do it, Dr. Pratt.

318
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,133
- Iris scissors.
- Wait.

319
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,396
- I said pull it.
- I said wait.

320
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,906
She's not going upstairs, Dubenko.
We have limited resources in the ICU.

321
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,943
We treat the sickest patients
who have a chance for recovery.

322
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,239
We don't flog people
who are going to die.

323
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,907
- I never have enough beds as it is.
- All right, all right, fine. I'll do it.

324
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,816
Dr. Pratt, the cops brought in
some guy who is asking for you.

325
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,556
Yo, Greg.

326
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,463
- What are you doing here?
- Said I ran a red, but it was yellow.

327
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,499
He almost ran over a traffic
cop and he smells like a brewery.

328
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,762
A bag of groceries fell off the
front seat and beer bottles broke.

329
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,099
I can't get the smell
out of my floor mats.

330
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,970
I need you to draw a blood
alcohol for a suspected DUI.

331
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,111
DUI? Come... Would
you talk to him?

332
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,007
- Look, I can vouch for this guy.
- That's great.

333
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,013
But I don't need you to vouch
for him. I need you to draw a BA.

334
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,090
Is K.J. around? I can't
let him see me like this.

335
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,987
Should've thought before
you started drinking and driving.

336
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,957
I only had two
beers, I swear to God.

337
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,256
But what if I don't pass
this? They'll bust me.

338
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,798
I'll lose my license. I'll lose my
job. You gotta help me, Greg.

339
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,301
I've been trying damn
hard. For me, for K.J.

340
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,344
Inez.

341
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,175
- I need you to take Darnell and Officer...
- Hollis.

342
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,543
Hollis, to the Suture
Room for a blood draw.

343
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,151
Sure. This way.

344
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,019
Morris.

345
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,785
You seen K.J. around?

346
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,624
That a trick question to see
if I have him washing my car?

347
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,197
Which was one time only, okay?

348
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,392
It's not like he detailed it or
anything, just hand wash, hand wax.

349
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,060
You're gonna take a Porsche
through a machine service?

350
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,137
I still gotta talk to
you about my date.

351
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,871
What's that?

352
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,411
A list of things I need to
do before the baby comes.

353
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,242
- What have you got to list?
- There's a lot of stuff to do.

354
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,715
- There's a ton of things to get.
- Baby monitor?

355
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,821
Yeah, so you can hear the baby
when you're not in the same room.

356
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,321
I know what it is. This
apartment isn't that big.

357
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,755
If that baby's
awake, you'll know it.

358
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,988
- Maybe it's not for this apartment.
- Well, yours is even smaller.

359
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,429
Sorry, but it is.

360
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,090
How's your breakfast?

361
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,169
Thank God the human species
has a nine-month gestation period.

362
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:09,536
Can you imagine if we were rats, and I
was gonna pump this out in six weeks?

363
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,271
- Isn't that scary?
- No.

364
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,914
But you're scaring me.

365
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,872
Really?

366
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,714
- No, come on, don't you dare.
- Don't I dare? Are you daring me?

367
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,618
- What is it with you?
- I don't know.

368
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,123
I don't know. It's like
a hormonal surge.

369
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,125
I can't sleep, I
can't stop eating, I...

370
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,094
Maybe I'm nesting.

371
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,265
Do you think I'm...?

372
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,336
No, I just think I
need to get ready.

373
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,467
- We still have plenty of time.
- You say that, but it's gonna go fast.

374
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,544
I think, I don't want to jinx anything,
but maybe we should look at some things.

375
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,079
Not to buy, but to do
some comparison shopping.

376
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,944
- Wanna go shop?
- I wanna go looking.

377
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:55,145
- Baby monitors?
- Yes. Monitors, cribs, car seats.

378
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,954
Maybe a little mobile of
famous Croatian diplomats.

379
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,590
It's a joke.

380
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:15,441
Stat D-5. Half at 125 an hour.

381
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,141
- You took out her tubes.
- Yes.

382
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,781
That's a good sign.

383
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,110
We pulled out the
invasive monitoring lines...

384
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,186
because she's not going
to the Intensive Care Unit.

385
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,356
She's getting better?
The medicine must...

386
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,083
No, no. She is
not getting better.

387
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,123
Why'd you unhook her?
If she's not getting better...

388
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,994
The hospital has limited
resources for our sickest patients.

389
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,698
- Resources.
- Beds, doctors, nurses...

390
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,133
You're talking about money.

391
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,607
It can cost up to $20,000 a
day to keep a patient in the ICU.

392
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,177
The most difficult decision
we make as doctors...

393
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:58,443
is deciding who will benefit
from critical care and who will not.

394
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,912
And you've decided
my wife won't?

395
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,317
No, we will continue
to care for your wife...

396
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,117
She's not worth $20,000 a day.

397
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,954
She will be admitted
and given antibiotics.

398
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,857
Even though she needs
a lot more than that?

399
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:14,524
We will provide your wife
with the care that's best for her.

400
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,130
But not the best care, huh?

401
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,441
Hey, doc.

402
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,550
- Are you playing me here?
- What?

403
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,584
You stalling so your buddy's BA
drops low enough to squeeze by?

404
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,481
Because I can demand another doctor.
Hell, I could get a nurse to do this.

405
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,319
It's nothing like that. Like
I told you, I know this guy.

406
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,552
Yeah, yeah. We've
established that.

407
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,761
Okay, look. His son
works here as a volunteer.

408
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,400
He's a good kid, trying to
make something of himself.

409
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,935
How many teenage boys you
know volunteer at the hospital?

410
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,266
I don't want him seeing
his father like this.

411
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:58,069
Give me a few minutes to get rid of
him, then I'll do the blood draw myself.

412
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,440
Now, you got five minutes
before I grab a nurse.

413
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,343
All right, deal.

414
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,462
All right, let's do this.

415
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,629
Hey, thanks for waiting,
man. I really appreciate it.

416
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,934
- Did you see K.J.?
- Yeah, I sent him on a run.

417
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,782
All right.

418
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,718
All right, man. You're
gonna feel a little stick here.

419
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,560
- Okay.
- You need to initial the vial.

420
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,361
Could you hand me my pen?

421
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,725
Thanks.

422
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,130
Okay.

423
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:05,210
I think you're gonna like
Rogan. Crazy dude from Chicago.

424
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,245
Talks a mile a minute and knows
more dirty jokes than anybody.

425
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:11,179
- What happened to him?
- A little roadside bomb.

426
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,843
Took some shrapnel. He was
one of our supply-truck drivers.

427
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,752
Although he'd tell the female nurses
that he was a terrain transport pilot.

428
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,984
And what did you
tell the nurses?

429
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,222
- I told them I had a girl back at home.
- Good answer.

430
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,700
Take it up to 3.

431
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,574
So where's the party, man?

432
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,509
Mike.

433
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,912
I figured you'd have a
nurse on each knee by now.

434
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,144
What, you're losing your touch?

435
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:53,151
- Ahem, this is my wife, Neela.
- Hello.

436
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,956
I got married. Can you believe
it? And what, we did it in a day?

437
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,028
They won't let me go back.

438
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,568
You're a doctor. Can
you talk to them, Mike?

439
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:15,578
Can you tell them
I need to go back?

440
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,610
I need you to help me.

441
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,919
Yeah, man. What...

442
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,447
Whatever you need.
Whatever you need.

443
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:33,223
Okay, we have Jell-O,
yogurt, soup, french fries.

444
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,731
- Wow.
- And ice cream.

445
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,563
Looks like it comes from the
bottom of the healthy food pyramid.

446
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:41,264
- More like the basement.
- I'll stick with the ice cream.

447
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,931
Okay.

448
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,567
Now, I got you vanilla because the
chocolate dispenser is broken so...

449
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,738
That's okay.
Chocolate gives me zits.

450
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,011
Yeah. It used to be
french fries for me.

451
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,923
Listen, Zoe.

452
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,222
Your father's not at work.

453
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:08,829
And the police are out looking for
him. So are you in touch with your sister?

454
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:13,631
Um, yeah, we send e-mails. I'd call
her from Donna's house sometimes.

455
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:17,868
- Do you think you could stay with her?
- I have no way of getting out there.

456
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,138
You let me deal with
that. Now, let's call Jen...

457
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,442
and ask her if you
can live with her, okay?

458
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,517
You probably wish you
never met me, right?

459
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:29,986
No.

460
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,987
Although it would have been easier if
I met you four or five years from now.

461
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,824
So crib, cradle, changing table.

462
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,525
Do you really need a special
table for changing a baby?

463
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,161
Why can't we change
him in the crib? What?

464
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,966
- Stroller, we need two car seats.
- Two?

465
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,738
- Yes, one for your car, one for mine.
- Oh, right.

466
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,074
Oh, wait. We need
two of everything.

467
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,750
We need a crib for your
place and a crib for my place.

468
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,376
- And a changing table for your place...
- I can still change him in the crib.

469
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,150
Yes, but what if she pees while you're
changing her and soaks the mattress?

470
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:11,855
Okay. So if we have twins, we're
gonna need to have four of everything?

471
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,328
I'm not having twins.

472
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,628
Uh, identical twins
run in my family.

473
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:23,703
- Are you kidding me?
- Well, I mean, chances are really small.

474
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:28,814
If your mutant Croatian seed
causes me to have twins...

475
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,678
Look at it from the sunny
side. If we have a custody fight...

476
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,580
each one of us is
gonna take a kid.

477
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,016
Identical twins.

478
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,720
Hey, exactly the same?

479
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,627
Got it, yeah.

480
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,290
Morris says he needs help with an
LP. Disimpaction is still waiting in 3.

481
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,697
I swear the kid in Curtain
2 looks like measles.

482
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,566
- My dislocated shoulder is still in the...
- Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

483
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:57,699
At the very least, you have to prioritize
for me when it's this insane in here.

484
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,903
You're kidding. It's dead in here.
We haven't had a single trauma.

485
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,412
- Dr. Dubenko.
- Mr. Venema? What's this?

486
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,484
- It's for my wife.
- We'll see if Morris can do some of this.

487
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,678
But he's not an Attending.

488
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,553
No, Mr. Venema. This
isn't exactly what I meant.

489
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,854
You said $20,000 a
day for the ICU, right?

490
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,827
That's a check for $87,000.

491
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,365
It's all I have, but it'll buy
my wife four days, right?

492
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,266
- I can't take this.
- Why not? It's a cashier's check.

493
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:30,102
It's not just about the money.
We can't put your wife in the ICU.

494
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,439
There are patients who need
the ICU more than she does.

495
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:36,776
What are you saying? There's
not enough money to save my wife?

496
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:41,114
I'm terribly sorry, I can't take your
money and there's nothing more I can do.

497
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,629
I need you to sign off
on a diverticular abscess.

498
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,300
What was that all about?

499
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,094
Nothing.

500
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,139
So, what's the verdict?

501
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,965
- His blood alcohol came back negative.
- That's what I've been telling you.

502
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:09,012
I've been doing this a long time. I'm
not usually wrong about these things.

503
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,480
Make sure you pay that ticket.

504
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:17,312
- Thanks, man, I owe you.
- You need some help.

505
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,823
You did help me, man. I appreciate
it. It won't happen again, I promise.

506
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:24,395
It won't because you're gonna stop
drinking and get yourself in a program.

507
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,499
- A program?
- You need some help, D.

508
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:31,501
- Look, you almost hit a cop.
- Hey, I got your truffles.

509
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,969
- What you doing here?
- I was in the neighborhood.

510
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,335
- Doing what?
- I asked him to stop by.

511
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,468
- You get something while you were out?
- Yeah, I stopped by the food court.

512
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,844
Check in at the Admit desk. See if
they need you to make any lab runs.

513
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,245
I'll take that.

514
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,715
I'll pick you up after work, okay?
- All right.

515
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:52,085
There's an AA meeting every night at
the community center where Olivia works.

516
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,659
- Just go down there, okay? Promise me.
- All right, I will.

517
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,228
- All right? All right.
- Yeah.

518
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:03,001
Yo, Pratt. Please, man, I need this. I
haven't been with a woman in months.

519
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,262
I'm not giving you tips
on dating black chicks.

520
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,339
I'm not asking you because you're
black. You're the coolest guy I know.

521
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:13,036
- And you're my friend and...
- And what?

522
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,442
It's just not easy for me
when it comes to women.

523
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,174
Especially once it gets
going, because of my condition.

524
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,251
- What condition? Stupidity?
- No, I have...

525
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:23,878
- I have supernumerary thelium.
- What?

526
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,716
Morris...

527
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,359
Wait. What are you doing, man?

528
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,528
- You got extra nipples.
- Yes. Shh.

529
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,899
Red hair, porcelain
skin and four nipples.

530
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,540
You know what gym class
was like for me growing up?

531
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,473
"Hey, Nipple Boy.
Here, here, little piggy.

532
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:48,011
Look, it's the Ugly
Suckling." I heard them all.

533
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,740
- What, we don't knock?
- On a curtain?

534
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,079
- What are you doing with my patient?
- Nothing.

535
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,118
Morris was showing
me his extra nipples.

536
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,917
Oh, my God, I can't believe you just
violated my doctor-patient privilege.

537
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,062
I'm not your doctor and you
sure as hell ain't my patient.

538
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,756
Whoa, look at those. That is freaky.
You should get them all pierced.

539
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:10,664
Wear them like chain mail. Guys, I
need your help. I need some money.

540
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,570
- How much?
- Whatever you got. I'll cover it.

541
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,004
I walk into the supply
tent one night, right?

542
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:19,110
And he's filling an inflatable
sex doll with helium.

543
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:23,339
I look up and there's a bunch of
them already floating on the ceiling.

544
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,950
How or where he got them into
the country, I don't even know.

545
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,988
But in true Rogan
fashion, he recruits me...

546
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,349
and we let them
launch at the first light.

547
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,789
A dozen naked sex dolls floating
out over the desert at dawn.

548
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,193
We're supposed to be
at the apartment at 3.

549
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:52,374
Hey, man, listen. I
gotta get going, okay?

550
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,613
Okay, Rogan?

551
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,476
I'll swing by in
a couple of days.

552
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:02,184
Why do I have to do this?
Why can't you try it yourself?

553
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,050
Here, turn around.

554
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,388
Just play with your toy.

555
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,185
Can I help you?

556
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,229
- Oh, no, we're just looking.
- That's really cute, isn't it?

557
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,660
Yeah.

558
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,700
So are you looking for
a gift, or is this for you?

559
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,702
It's for me. Us.

560
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,306
We're having a baby. Together.

561
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:24,102
Is this going to be your first?

562
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,376
Yeah.

563
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,675
It's got two bedrooms, two
underground parking spaces...

564
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:38,654
washer-dryer, storage facilities, and
there's a workout room in the building.

565
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,651
You don't like it?

566
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,662
How can I not like it? I
haven't even seen it yet.

567
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,140
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

568
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:58,207
If you don't think Rogan's
getting the best care...

569
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,710
maybe you could arrange for one
of the county neurologists to see him.

570
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,373
Yeah. Um...

571
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,647
It's not Rogan. It's me.

572
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,590
I wanna go back.

573
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,286
To the hospital?

574
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,559
To Iraq.

575
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,255
What?

576
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,892
You're joking, right?

577
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:28,230
Michael, I know it's difficult seeing
your friend and those soldiers like that...

578
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,274
but going back is not gonna
change what happened to them.

579
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:35,710
No, but I can help prevent other
guys from ending up like that.

580
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,577
- Or worse.
- Okay.

581
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,877
We'll talk about this
after you think about it.

582
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,714
I've already been thinking
about it for weeks, Neela.

583
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,481
Well, without
bothering to tell me?

584
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,454
Listen, I left people over there,
okay? People who need me.

585
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,256
Well, I need you.

586
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,425
Not like they do.

587
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,169
Oh, my God, Michael, I can't
believe we're having this conversation.

588
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,772
- Mr. and Mrs. Gallant, right?
- Yep.

589
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,967
I'm Dorothy. Come in, come in.
You're going to love this place.

590
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,441
It's perfect for newlyweds.

591
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,845
I understand your wife is a
doctor, Michael. That's exciting.

592
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:16,250
- What do you do?
- I'm, uh... I'm a doctor as well.

593
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,851
- In the Army.
- The Army? Really?

594
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,819
This place won't last long.
So, what do you think?

595
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,424
Why don't you kids take your time
and call me after you've talked it over?

596
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,595
Just close the door
behind you when you leave.

597
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,513
Wow, look at these.

598
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,280
If I get this big, I think
I'm gonna, like, kill myself.

599
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,980
Women look their most
beautiful when they're pregnant.

600
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,217
- You're such a liar.
- No, I'm serious.

601
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,659
Crap.

602
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,590
What?

603
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,136
It's Debbie Dockins
from the pharmacy.

604
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,836
- Who?
- Don't look.

605
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,034
If she spots the two
of us in a baby store...

606
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,202
holding bags, she's
gonna tell everybody.

607
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,473
- I don't know who she is.
- She knows you.

608
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,911
- I don't think so.
- Oh...

609
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,348
Every woman that works in the
hospital knows who you are, trust me.

610
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,681
Okay.

611
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,116
Let's go.

612
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,723
I'm trying these on.

613
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,493
Her back is bothering her.

614
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,674
- How long are we gonna stay in here?
- Just until she leaves.

615
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,503
When will that be?

616
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,201
I don't know. Shh.

617
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,711
- Don't "shh" me.
- Shh.

618
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,282
- Don't "shh" me. We're hiding here.
- Shh.

619
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:55,153
Mmm.

620
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:03,354
- We should stop.
- No. You started this.

621
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,726
- Hey, wait a minute. Hold it.
- No, no, no.

622
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,892
- What are you doing?
- It's okay, Mr. Venema.

623
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,935
No, it's not. I told
you not to do this.

624
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,369
It's okay. We're
moving her to St. Rafe's.

625
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,136
It's a private hospital. They've
agreed to treat her sepsis.

626
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,903
- In the ICU?
- Yes, yes.

627
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,743
They have an excellent reputation
and I've spoken with the Attending there.

628
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,181
- Who do I give my check to?
- They'll bill you.

629
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,784
Really?

630
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,219
Ahem. How can I thank you?

631
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,052
I...

632
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,319
Enjoy the time you
have left with your wife.

633
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,634
You're a good doctor
and a good man.

634
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,895
Okay, well, you should
go because they're...

635
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,938
They're gonna have a lot of
forms for you to fill out there.

636
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:51,076
- I hope that's homework.
- It's not.

637
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,905
- You need a ride home?
- No, my dad's coming to pick me up.

638
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,481
He said he may be running a
little bit late. He's got some meeting.

639
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:01,086
Good. Well, it's good that he
called to tell you he's gonna be late.

640
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,715
Thanks for helping him out
today. I saw him with the cops.

641
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,785
Whoa, K.J., wait.

642
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,553
It was a misunderstanding.

643
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,758
Always is.

644
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,537
- You look like you need some help.
- I'm looking for Archie.

645
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,802
Oh. Well, what was
he brought in for?

646
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,537
No, he works here. I think
he's in charge of everything.

647
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,147
Tamara?

648
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,806
- Hey.
- Hey.

649
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,112
- I'm sorry, I know I'm way early.
- No, no, it's okay.

650
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,255
It's nice to finally
meet you in person.

651
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,080
Wow, you're tall.

652
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,628
But, no, it's cool. I like tall.

653
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,430
Oh, I'm sorry, this is,
uh... This is my dog, Pratt.

654
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,392
What? It's Greg.

655
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,296
Nice to meet you, Greg.

656
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,531
So, um, do you wanna hang out in
the Doctor's Lounge while I finish up?

657
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,676
Or I can take you on
a tour of the place?

658
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,333
A tour would be nice. - Great.

659
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:02,413
Yeah but, Archie, I mean, what
about your supernumerary thelium?

660
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:05,916
Sounds serious.

661
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:10,084
You know, I can come back later
if you've got surgery or something.

662
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:16,156
Um, no, no, it's not a patient.

663
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,955
It's, uh...

664
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,033
It's me.

665
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,472
I'm sorry, I don't
wanna waste your time.

666
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,731
I should have said
something earlier...

667
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:35,813
but I didn't wanna scare you
off and it's always awkward.

668
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,340
What the hell. You
know, I have extra nipples.

669
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,787
- Okay? There, I said it.
- Excuse me?

670
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:46,948
Yeah. One, two, three,
four. There you go.

671
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,459
Really?

672
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,059
Yeah.

673
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:56,733
I have six toes on my left foot.

674
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,427
Get out.

675
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,905
- Let me see.
- You gonna show me your nipples?

676
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,069
Ohh. I like the way you think.

677
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,746
If you need to remove your
cast, any ER can do that.

678
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,647
There's an electronic ticket
waiting for you at the airport.

679
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,152
It's an Alaskan Airways
flight that leaves at 7:30.

680
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,416
What about my clothes?
What about my school?

681
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,652
- You have the keys to your house?
- Yeah.

682
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,558
Give them to me. I'll pack up
and send them to your sister.

683
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,164
Once you get to San Francisco...

684
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,426
contact your school so they
can transfer your grades and stuff.

685
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,503
But won't my dad
be able to find me?

686
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,265
Have everything sent
to me and I'll forward it.

687
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,137
Here's some cash for the cab...

688
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,802
and something
to get you started.

689
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,749
- Ray, I can't take your money.
- Sure, you can. Besides, it's nothing.

690
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:49,149
Not all of it's mine. I convinced
some of the richer docs to pitch in.

691
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,813
Hey, hey, hey,
it's gonna be okay.

692
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:56,086
You're going to live with your
sister, and Frisco is a great city.

693
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,695
Come with me.

694
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,790
Zoe, you know I can't do that.

695
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,535
I'll be 18 in three years.

696
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,536
Yeah, and you'll have
forgotten all about me.

697
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:11,806
No, I won't. MR. BUTLER: Zoe.

698
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,113
- Zoe, get in the cab.
- Zoe. Honey, no, no, no, wait.

699
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,579
I just wanna talk
to you. Zoe, I just...

700
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,083
- Come on. Open the door, I wanna talk...
- Come on, man.

701
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:26,481
- Zoe! Zoe, wait! Zoe!
- She's gone.

702
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:30,155
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I don't think so.

703
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,660
The first one was free, pal.

704
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,298
Your daughter's gone and
she ain't ever coming back.

705
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,195
If you bother me or her again...

706
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:40,537
I'll have to use my extensive medical
knowledge to mess you up real bad.

707
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:41,968
You got that?

708
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:55,351
I thought you joined the Army so
that they'd pay for medical school.

709
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,217
I did. I did.

710
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,415
And you put your time in.

711
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,026
Yes, I put my time in,
but there's more to it.

712
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,457
More to what?

713
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,423
Look, Neela, I don't
expect you to understand...

714
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,967
Then explain it to me, Michael,
because I really want to understand this.

715
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,865
Something happens
over there. I just...

716
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,205
I had a purpose over there.
My life had some clarity.

717
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:25,339
- I just cannot abandon those guys.
- But you can abandon me?

718
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:33,048
Look, I understand there's a
camaraderie with those you serve with.

719
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,558
And I respect that, I do.

720
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,959
If you still feel the need
to experience that...

721
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,725
you can volunteer
at the VA hospital.

722
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,164
It's not the same thing.

723
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,129
Neela, there is a war going on.

724
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:51,606
People might like to
forget that, but I can't.

725
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:57,808
And I can't live with
myself if I don't go back.

726
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,180
Well, then we'll both go. I'll
volunteer with an NGO or something.

727
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:05,079
Neela, it is too
dangerous over there.

728
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,748
It's too dangerous for
me, but it's okay for you?

729
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,053
- What a load of crap.
- I am a soldier, remember?

730
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,663
And you're also a
husband, remember that?

731
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,731
You asked me to marry you.

732
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,273
You looked into my eyes
and asked me to be your wife...

733
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:27,435
and to share a life together.
We took vows, Michael.

734
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:30,878
I mean, what the hell
was all that? A whim?

735
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:35,242
That was not a whim.

736
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,114
I thought I could
do this, Neela.

737
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:45,127
I thought of nothing else but coming
home and making a life with you.

738
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:50,458
And I have tried to
make it work, but I just...

739
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:57,236
I just can't stay here, knowing
what's going on over there.

740
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,873
Neela, I am sorry.

741
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,174
And you...

742
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:10,212
You know how
much that I love you.

743
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,653
You know, if you did...

744
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:14,754
you wouldn't do this.

745
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:23,393
And if you loved me, you
would understand that I have to.

746
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,399
Yeah, well, maybe
that's the problem.

747
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:30,907
I love you, but I
still don't know you.
