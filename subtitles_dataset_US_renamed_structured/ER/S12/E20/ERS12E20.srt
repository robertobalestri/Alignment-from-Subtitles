1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,067
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,210
- Sending me to Africa?
- You can use a change of perspective.

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,277
Mouthwash? You
got to be kidding me.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,175
You're a weird dude, Pratt.

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,776
- Debbie and Dakarai, huh?
- Yeah. They're an item.

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,353
We're on our way to Dumtala Camp
to help sick people. We're here to help.

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,458
They do not hurt doctors. One
never knows what might happen.

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,617
Janjaweed.

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,762
Welcome to Darfur.

10
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:45,109
Your government promised $50
million in aid only to pull it away.

11
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,272
Yeah, well, we got our own
problems. You ever heard of Katrina?

12
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,941
If the U.S. does not lead
the way, who else will?

13
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:00,116
Without international intervention,
nothing will change here.

14
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,287
Zahra, ask him if he's
been taking the amoxicillin.

15
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:07,361
Listen, even with intervention,
a year after us being here...

16
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,003
the world will be screaming
for us to get out of Sudan.

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,537
Oh, Pratt, I expected so
much more from you. Ah.

18
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,369
- Why? Because I'm black?
- No, because you are smart.

19
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,976
Yeah, well, I'm also American.

20
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,739
I did not realize these things
were mutually exclusive.

21
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,143
- He says, yes, he's feeling better.
- Okay, good.

22
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,718
Listen, all I'm saying is that it's
a lot more complicated than that.

23
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:29,015
We been too quick getting in
the middle of other people's fights.

24
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,093
Fine. When the solution does come
to Darfur, it is not going to be quick.

25
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,322
Yeah, well, where I'm from,
gangs, they get into it all the time.

26
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,160
All the cops can do is step
back and wait for it to end.

27
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,529
Step back and wait?

28
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:45,070
That sounds like an excellent foreign
policy while people are suffering.

29
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,036
Dakarai, stop
ragging on my country.

30
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,006
There's plenty of Americans
helping. You see me here, right?

31
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,874
Yes and quite frankly, I'm
beginning to wonder why.

32
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,048
- What?
- She says the baby wasn't moving.

33
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,709
Okay, just show me where.

34
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,515
And you are moving
pretty fast for an isolationist.

35
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,591
They told you a brother was
coming, you expected Marcus Garvey?

36
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,024
We don't have more in
common than you and Carter.

37
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:12,189
I don't. In fact, I think Carter
is more African than you are.

38
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,906
How long has he been like this?

39
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:29,708
Um, has he had
a fever? Diarrhea?

40
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,314
Baby no cry.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,313
Yeah, he's too sick to cry. Listen,
we need to bring him back with us.

42
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,484
Look, your baby needs medicine.
We have to get him to the hospital.

43
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,062
Where is that other doctor?

44
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,396
- Tired.
- Tired?

45
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,265
Okay, wait right here.

46
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,100
Dakarai, what are
you doing, man?

47
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,071
Whoa. What the
hell? You all right?

48
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,644
- Varices.
- Varices?

49
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,577
Getting worse.

50
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,582
You told me your IV was
for a little stomach virus.

51
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,583
Scarring in my liver.

52
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,086
Schistosomiasis
when I was a child.

53
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,987
Damn. Well, congratulations.

54
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,993
You just became the proud
winner of a bed in tent number three.

55
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,277
Rashida Fallad.

56
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,044
She's 26 weeks pregnant
and she has hepatitis E.

57
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,188
Hepatitis E? I thought
our water was clean.

58
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,950
They go outside the camp, drink from
other sources. It shouldn't be long now.

59
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,186
I think you're overreacting.
Mortality rate for hep E isn't high.

60
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,421
It is in pregnant women,
especially in Darfur.

61
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,125
Over 30 percent of people
who contract the disease will die.

62
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,200
Rashida.

63
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,393
Rashida.

64
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,732
The encephalopathy is worse.

65
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,733
She's pretty jaundiced.

66
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,275
Scleral icterus.

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,208
She's in hepatic coma.

68
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,146
Ask her if, um, she's
been eating or drinking.

69
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,596
Tell her we've been giving her antibiotics
and glucose through an NG feeding tube.

70
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,602
What did she say?

71
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,305
She wants to know if...

72
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,939
her daughter will die
today or tomorrow.

73
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,744
Tell her I'm not sure.

74
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,824
She wants to know
if we need the bed.

75
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,596
No. No.

76
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,528
Got a minute?

77
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,138
Mm-hm.

78
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,340
So this baby I brought in
yesterday, she's not doing so good.

79
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,948
I'm having trouble finding an IV
site and this kid is getting pretty dry.

80
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,549
- Stop trying to be so tough.
- I am tough.

81
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,347
- I'm just trying to look out for you.
- I don't need a wife, already had three.

82
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,014
- Steven, you feeling any better?
- I don't want to be babied. I'm fine.

83
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,456
- Stay in bed a little longer.
- I'm ready to work.

84
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,688
- You have paracentesis. Don't be an idiot.
- Sound medical advice.

85
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,958
She has no bedside manner.
- Talk to him.

86
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,127
Stay in bed until I
sign off on your chart.

87
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:08,465
When?

88
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,002
- When I get to it.
- This is why people hate doctors.

89
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,572
- He needed a paracentesis?
- Took five liters off his belly.

90
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,971
- Five liters?
- Had him on Lasix all night.

91
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,508
We have to limit his sodium.

92
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,374
That man shouldn't be working.
He shouldn't even be here.

93
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,539
- Dr. Dakarai is very committed.
- Uh-huh.

94
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,850
This is Mahdi,
his mother, sister.

95
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,319
I'm Dr. Carter. Can
you tell her that we're

96
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:30,418
gonna try to give
some fluids to her baby?

97
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,556
Dr. John, they're bringing
a man from outside.

98
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,061
They say he's been shot.

99
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,394
Okay, 20 gauge on the femoral, I
want you to call me if you need me, okay?

100
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,338
Ishaak. PRATT: What?

101
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,734
His name is Ishaak.

102
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,500
Why won't you get this treated?

103
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,556
- What happened?
- Two GSWs, chest and leg.

104
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,612
I'm going to help. - We got it.

105
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,579
- We handle gunshots differently...
- We know that. Get back in bed.

106
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,550
An entrance wound, right chest.

107
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,190
Okay, belly seems clear.

108
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,292
Ishaak, you left the compound.

109
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:10,396
Just to the perimeter,
to help a family get water.

110
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,123
He's got strong carotid.
Okay, try for the BP.

111
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,464
Men on horses. They shot me.

112
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,038
Let me guess, Janjaweed.
Through and through left calf.

113
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,697
One hundred over 60.

114
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,572
- Why are you always where the trouble is?
- I try to help.

115
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,144
- Ishaak is a sheik.
- Like, with a harem?

116
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,544
No, like a leader.

117
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,481
He is recognized as someone
the other IDPs can look up to.

118
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,917
Trying to make a difference,
get people together.

119
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,648
- Yeah, well, he should stop that.
- Why say such a thing?

120
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,486
It's making people
wanna kill him.

121
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,753
Give me two liters
of saline, wide open.

122
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:46,593
Okay, I got a good vein in the
antecube. I'm going in with the 18.

123
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,065
Ishaak, we need
to move you to town.

124
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,466
You need more surgery
than we can do for you here.

125
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,937
I... I can't breathe.

126
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,134
Do we have the oxygen extractor?
- Yeah, on its way.

127
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,125
Treating a man with a gunshot
wound? Ishaak Alazhari?

128
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,694
I'd have to check with the
doctors. You can't just come in.

129
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,694
As long as there is
no violation, we'll leave.

130
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,145
Officer, please, please, wait
outside. I'll look around for you.

131
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,282
- We'll look for ourselves.
- You cannot be here with those weapons.

132
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,282
You know the agreement the
Alliance has with your government.

133
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,852
We'll go where we need to
go, do what we need to do.

134
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,990
Look, the NGO rules
apply, even in Darfur.

135
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,488
Debbie.

136
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,295
Ishaak, this is oxygen.
This should help you breathe.

137
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,125
- How are you doing, man?
- Feeling pain when I breathe.

138
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,893
This man's been shot.

139
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,496
- Yeah, that's right.
- He's bleeding internally.

140
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,504
He needs immediate care and
transport to a surgical facility.

141
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,041
- Did you report this to my office?
- Come on. He can do that later.

142
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,406
Without a form eight,
he's got no right.

143
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,979
He's gotta fill out a form?

144
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,310
It's not gonna help
much if he's already dead.

145
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,717
- Come on. PRATT: Wait
a minute. Take it easy.

146
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,721
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing? Are you nuts?

147
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,859
What's the matter with you?
- He'll die.

148
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,722
Guilty, form-eight violation.
Requires gunshot injuries...

149
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,730
- He's here now. Please, don't do this.
- If you are going to do this...

150
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,835
- Steven! PRATT: You
can't come in here... Unh.

151
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,597
I'll send you a document
re-clarifying the regulation...

152
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,330
so this does not happen again.

153
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,338
Good day, doc.

154
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,776
Okay, okay. Let's see.

155
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,174
Damn.

156
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,351
How does that feel?

157
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,853
Feels like I got hit in
the head with a rifle butt.

158
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,289
Better to be hit with
one than shot with one.

159
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,861
- You want something for the pain?
- No, I'll be fine.

160
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,725
I've had hangovers
worse than this.

161
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,423
Perhaps you should
drink less mouthwash.

162
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,036
What's gonna happen
to the guy they took?

163
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,696
They'll probably bring him back
when they are finished interrogating him.

164
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:10,969
- He could be dead by then.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure they are aware of that.

165
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,075
Hey.

166
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,791
- You should go back to the compound.
- No, I'm okay.

167
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,952
It's almost quitting time.

168
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,229
He's bradycardic, 58, 0.5 epi.

169
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,891
He's already had two doses.

170
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,099
He's not responding.

171
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,935
Because he's
hypoxic and acidotic.

172
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,169
All right, give him another
bolus and find me a bag mask.

173
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,643
Nope.

174
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,243
He'll turn around once
the antibiotics kick in.

175
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,843
I can bag him through this.

176
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,251
By yourself? All night?

177
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,792
- It could take days.
- Pulse is down to 50.

178
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,428
I'm doing compressions.

179
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,500
Are we just gonna watch him die?

180
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,231
No, that's what his mother does.

181
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,135
We have other patients.

182
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,676
That's messed up.

183
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,857
Would you please tell
her that we're very sorry.

184
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,764
Tell her that I know how
difficult it is to lose a child...

185
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:49,841
that my own son died when
he was very young in a hospital.

186
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:14,900
She finds it hard to believe that
babies die in Western hospitals.

187
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,447
You should not have
let them take him away.

188
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,048
- We didn't have a choice.
- Hey.

189
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,774
- Ishaak's wife, Sittina.
- Hi.

190
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,248
You treated my husband?

191
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,944
Tried, but they took him,
he didn't fill out some form.

192
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,580
No, they took him away
because he tells people the truth.

193
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,159
That it is not safe to
go back to their villages.

194
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,593
- The people listen to him, he's... Ah.
- Whoa.

195
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,323
You okay? Maybe
you should sit down.

196
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,059
Are you having
contractions? How far apart?

197
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,005
She's eight centimeters.
One hundred percent effaced.

198
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,290
She's definitely
having this baby tonight.

199
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:56,336
It'll be dark soon.

200
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,673
- Take her to the residential compound?
- She can't have it here?

201
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,816
She can, but we can't stay with her.
There's electricity back at the compound.

202
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:08,182
The only place I am going is to
the police station to get my husband.

203
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,414
Do you want the police
to deliver your baby?

204
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,923
- Unh. But Ishaak...
- Let's worry about the baby.

205
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,254
Ibrahim, bring the truck.
- Here we go.

206
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,108
- I'll grab the OB pack.
- Passing through.

207
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,591
Here we go.

208
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,606
I got it.

209
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,109
Go ahead.

210
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,773
Okay.

211
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,222
You're late.

212
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,399
It's cinema night. We're
moving to the rec room.

213
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,057
Gregory wants us to
watch <i>Deuce Bigalow</i> again.

214
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,794
Keep everybody in there
for a little while, all right?

215
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,065
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

216
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,136
They turn the generators
off in the compound at night.

217
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,838
The only power in the
clinic is used for cold storage.

218
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,213
She would have to deliver
the baby alone in the dark.

219
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,018
Try and relax, huh?

220
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,591
You okay?

221
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,892
She's progressing very well. She
can start pushing within the hour.

222
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,432
I'm talking about you.

223
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,400
I am tired. Been
on my feet all day.

224
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,832
- You are not tired?
- I'm tired.

225
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,236
Tired of you lying to me...

226
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,208
ignoring a life-threatening
illness which needs to be treated.

227
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,110
Hey, hey. I promise...

228
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,275
if I get any worse, I will do IV
diuretics and sodium restrictions...

229
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,615
- and I will dry out my ascites.
- It's not good enough.

230
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,782
You need the procedure.
Carter, what is it he needs?

231
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,360
A, uh, transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.

232
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,627
Well, interventional radiology is hard to
come by if you don't have x-ray machines.

233
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,531
You need to go to
Khartoum, Nairobi.

234
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,434
When I'm in bed, who's going
to take care of my patients?

235
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,303
Don't know. Who's gonna take
care of them when you're dead?

236
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,319
Long day, huh?

237
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,391
Only thing longer than
the days here are nights.

238
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,807
I'm okay, Carter. Really.

239
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,035
You could have fooled me.

240
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,080
This is nothing.

241
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,839
It's my weekly ritual.

242
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,612
Only way to get through the
suffering that surrounds this place...

243
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,588
is to allow myself a good
cry every now and then.

244
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,588
Feel better already.

245
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,796
So this has nothing
to do with Steven?

246
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,799
Steven makes me angry,
he doesn't make me cry.

247
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,309
You tell me, you're a doctor.

248
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,609
What happens if he
doesn't get treated?

249
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,476
His condition is
gonna get worse.

250
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,448
It's already worse.

251
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,836
It's the police.

252
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,596
- Hide her.
- What? Where?

253
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,034
- What's going on?
- It's the police. Gotta hide her.

254
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,232
- Unh, unh!
- Whoa.

255
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,569
Contraction? DEBBIE: Where?

256
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
Let's go to the bathroom.

257
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,739
Are these the men
that took my husband?

258
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,406
- I don't know.
- Unh. Ask them.

259
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,848
- I want to know what they've done.
- Keep her quiet.

260
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,381
Okay. Just breathe.

261
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,426
What's going on?

262
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,159
He is searching
for Ishaak's wife.

263
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,531
I told him come in the
morning, search the camp.

264
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,841
He thinks we brought her here.

265
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,946
No, we don't treat patients here.
- I told him that.

266
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,708
Now he wants to
search the house.

267
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,751
No. A housing
unit, that's off-limits.

268
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,422
It's off... Hey,
come on, you guys.

269
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,561
You know what time it is?
Everybody's sleeping inside. Okay.

270
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,956
Hey, hey, hey.

271
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,525
- They're in the house.
- No!

272
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,067
Shh. You have to keep her quiet.

273
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,602
I can't. She's in labor.

274
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,741
Try to breathe through
the pain, Sittina, good girl.

275
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,308
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

276
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,475
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

277
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,604
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

278
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,426
Hey, what's up, fellas?

279
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,324
Whoa, whoa. Sorry, I'm next.

280
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,556
And I don't think it's gonna
leave a scar. Thanks for asking.

281
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,810
Look, I've been standing
out here for 20 minutes, okay?

282
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,913
Pratt!

283
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,017
All right.

284
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,598
What the hell are
you doing? Get out!

285
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,038
Get out!

286
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,108
Your superiors are
gonna hear about this.

287
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,552
Something is wrong.

288
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,283
- Hang in there. You're doing great.
- I feel the head.

289
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,157
- I see thick meconium.
- Deceleration. A long one.

290
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,662
- How low?
- Low.

291
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,033
I think the occiput's posterior.

292
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,403
We don't have time
for this baby to turn.

293
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,067
- Prep for c-section?
- Are you out of your mind?

294
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:39,211
All, right, Sittina, your baby is
showing signs of very serious distress.

295
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,314
Vaginal delivery is too dangerous.
We need to do a cesarean.

296
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,973
No, please, unh, save it.

297
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,881
I'm gonna put some
anesthesia in your back.

298
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,818
- You'll lose feeling from the waist down.
- Okay, come on.

299
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,821
Oh, Ishaak.

300
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,482
Aah! Ishaak!

301
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,621
Give me more counter pressure.
- Yep.

302
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,561
Debbie, can you get a blanket?

303
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,598
Okay, I got it.

304
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,793
Unh, here we go.

305
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,742
- Got it.
- It's a girl, Sittina.

306
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,902
Allah has blessed
you with a healthy child.

307
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,103
Get my husband.

308
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,506
Yeah. DEBBIE: Okay.

309
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,741
Oh, oh.

310
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,581
- There's blood in the pelvis.
- Try uterine massage.

311
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,417
I am. I got no suction, I can't
see where she's bleeding from.

312
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,058
Oh, Ishaak.

313
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,425
Give me some sterile
four-by-fours and keep them coming.

314
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,159
If they find out who
we are, they will kill him.

315
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,462
- Who you are?
- We helped to form the HRD.

316
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,161
What's she talking about?

317
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,971
HRD. It's a human rights
group based in Khartoum.

318
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,940
Human Rights for Darfur.

319
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,979
They will kill him if
they know. Please.

320
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:51,481
Oh, man, she's bleeding out.

321
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,054
This was a bad idea. No blood,
no pressors, no pit, not Methergine.

322
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,822
What are we supposed to do
now? She needs a hysterectomy.

323
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,823
Bring her to the
hospital in Al-Fashir.

324
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,326
It's too late to drive.
She'll have to go tomorrow.

325
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,988
Because of a bunch
of thugs on camels.

326
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,827
And they also have
trucks and guns.

327
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:11,979
Lots of guns.

328
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay, I can tie off
the uterine arteries...

329
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,109
buy us time. Give me O chromic
on the longest needle we got.

330
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,303
Not enough time. Couple hours,
the uterus will become ischemic.

331
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,608
That is the best
chance we got right now.

332
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,312
I grew up in Detroit, I can
be in Al-Fashir in two hours.

333
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,978
You didn't wanna bring her.
- I made a mistake.

334
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,785
If we'd left her, she'd never
be able to deliver safely.

335
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,859
- This baby would have died.
- Slow down, Pratt.

336
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,023
Okay, the uterine
artery is tied off.

337
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,725
- Only chance she's got, you know it.
- She may not survive the trip.

338
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,134
Yeah, but she's
dead if she stays here.

339
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,605
If she dies making the
journey, well, at least we tried.

340
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,536
Okay.

341
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,537
Okay, I'll go with you.

342
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:58,206
No, John, you and Debbie
should go to the police.

343
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,213
Find Ishaak. You have a much better
chance of getting him out of there.

344
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:05,881
He and I, we'll close and then
we will bring her on to the hospital.

345
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,428
- All right.
- Okay.

346
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,922
We'd like to see
Ishaak Alazhari.

347
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,432
No, you can't see him.

348
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,865
Why not?

349
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,868
He's under arrest.

350
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,208
On what charge?

351
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,981
He's been shot. He
needs medical attention.

352
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,414
I'm a doctor. I would like to
evaluate his medical condition.

353
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,759
How's she doing back there?

354
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,890
She is breathing.

355
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,828
What the hell is that?

356
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,570
Janjaweed. Let's go back.

357
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,142
Oh, we got a traffic jam.

358
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,482
If we stop, they will take the
truck, leave her to die, or worse.

359
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,951
Okay, all right,
then we don't stop.

360
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,487
Just cover her up and hold on.

361
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,152
- Now, hold on, Dakarai.
- But...

362
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,419
Hold on!

363
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,664
Get down, Dakarai.

364
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,837
Did you tell him that
we work for the Alliance?

365
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,470
- Dumtala camp.
- Mm-hm.

366
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,149
All right, look, is it money?
Because I can get some.

367
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,387
- You must leave now.
- No, I would like to speak to your boss.

368
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,989
Very busy.

369
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:22,527
Should I tell him you walked in on this
American woman while she was bathing?

370
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:27,190
Or should I tell the consulate that an
American woman's privacy was violated?

371
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,028
How much money?

372
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,695
Ishaak? Ishaak, can you hear me?

373
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,068
I need to see him.

374
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,040
No, I need to go in there.

375
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,054
Not responding.

376
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,805
He's dead.

377
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,787
The tire is flat.

378
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,084
Yeah. I think they hit the
oil pan and the radiator too.

379
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,386
She's getting pretty hot.

380
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,097
What is that? Lasix
for the ascites?

381
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,099
Prozac. Keep driving.

382
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,736
How fast can a
horse go with a rider?

383
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,100
I don't know, maybe
30 miles an hour.

384
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:48,278
Okay, well, we've been going 45 miles
an hour, maybe 40, our tire blew out, so...

385
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,144
- It's more like 50.
- Okay, good.

386
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,648
We've done enough time.

387
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,080
For what?

388
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,119
To change the tire.

389
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,984
Maybe somebody in that
village can help us out over there.

390
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:06,161
Maybe. Aah! If there
was somebody living there.

391
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,802
Lord.

392
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,813
You all right? DAKARAI: Yes.

393
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,827
What...?

394
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,487
The people we treat every day...

395
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,201
it is places like this
from which they come...

396
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,167
before the Janjaweed
burned them out.

397
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,398
Huh.

398
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,997
- Agonal respirations and a thready pulse.
- He's alive?

399
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:25,303
- Barely. Ready to lift? One, two, three.
- Don't tell the police.

400
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,912
Zahra, get an IV started
and get him back on oxygen.

401
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,879
- What can I do? CARTER:
Transfer O-neg from the fridge.

402
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,985
And when she's done, you
can squeeze in a liter of saline.

403
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,748
He's got decreased
breath sounds on the right.

404
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,391
Possible hemo-pneumo.
He's gonna need a chest tube.

405
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,427
Where do you keep them?
- We don't.

406
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,064
Uh, we're gonna
have to improvise.

407
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:50,402
Get me a scalpel and a
curved Kelly and a NG tube.

408
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:55,098
When the blood compressing his lung is
removed, his pulse should get stronger.

409
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,936
- Bleeding?
- It should stop.

410
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,907
If it doesn't?

411
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,548
Why don't you see if
you can radio Dakarai?

412
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,081
They should be in
Al-Fashir by now.

413
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,750
Do we have any extra water?

414
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,254
No.

415
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,449
- What about saline?
- Four liters.

416
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,218
All right, toss me one.

417
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,869
I gotta say, this is the first time I've
ever given a bolus to a truck before.

418
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,904
Take it easy, man.

419
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,657
We just wanna get her to
the hospital. Tell him that.

420
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,260
I'm trying.

421
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,758
Aah! PRATT: No.

422
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,784
Oh, man.

423
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,950
His friends will
not be far behind.

424
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:29,427
If you try and save him, we
will never get away from here.

425
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,800
There is nothing you
can do for him now.

426
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,105
Come on, get up.

427
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,215
Come on. Watch your step.

428
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,215
- Okay.
- All right, go.

429
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,691
- Aw, damn!
- What?

430
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,700
The engine is seized.
We're gonna have to hoof it.

431
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,370
- Gotta walk from here.
- I can't.

432
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,871
- Why the hell not?
- I don't think I can walk.

433
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,704
- And I will only slow you down.
- I can't leave you here.

434
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,368
- You have to.
- No way.

435
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,377
Why don't you
leave me the rifle...

436
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:19,006
and perhaps I can occupy his
friends while you get to Al-Fashir.

437
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,048
How far away is
the city from here?

438
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,850
It is still several miles.
But you can get there.

439
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,188
- You really think she's gonna make it?
- She will die if you don't.

440
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,023
You ever fire one of these?

441
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,223
- I've never held a weapon.
- Just point and shoot.

442
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,495
Okay, Sittina, we're gonna go
on foot patrol from here on in.

443
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,401
I'm gonna give you a little
something for the pain, okay?

444
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,583
Wha...? What the
hell is she saying?

445
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,916
She called us angels.

446
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,919
I said there are no angels here.

447
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,689
Speak for yourself.

448
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,894
You ever been to
Mozambique, Sittina?

449
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,734
Yeah, they got
great beaches there.

450
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,598
White sands, cool waters.

451
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:51,403
Yeah. Definitely gotta
get me to Mozambique.

452
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:04,748
Okay, either those are the
good guys and we're saved...

453
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,585
or the bad guys and we're dead.

454
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,456
Either way...

455
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,124
I'm done walking.

456
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,713
Very sick?

457
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:33,943
That's right.

458
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,488
- I tell him faster.
- Good.

459
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:43,356
You English? James
Bond, 007? Do-doo-do-doo?

460
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,158
- No.
- Do-doo-do-doo?

461
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,361
American "Rambro"?

462
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,701
Yeah, "Rambro."

463
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,998
Good stuff.

464
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,049
Help me. Please. Please.

465
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:17,628
I need a doctor. Please.

466
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,170
Please.

467
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:30,833
She needs saline, blood,
antibiotics and a surgeon.

468
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,534
Hurry.

469
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,408
Good stuff.

470
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,776
Yeah.

471
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,913
Good stuff.

472
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,464
Ishaak's doing much better.

473
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,990
Bleeding stopped.

474
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,364
Good.

475
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,968
Keeps asking for Sittina.

476
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,365
No word yet.

477
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,800
Did you try the radio?

478
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,964
They stopped answering
the radio hours ago.

479
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,734
- Still...
- There's no signal, John.

480
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,708
And they haven't resorted
to sending smoke signals yet.

481
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,009
Okay.

482
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,015
Sorry.

483
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,993
Come on.

484
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,238
Let's go introduce
him to his daughter.

485
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,096
Whoa. Stop! Stop! Stop!

486
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,904
Dakarai.

487
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,252
Dakarai.

488
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,059
Dakarai.

489
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,759
Come on, let's go.

490
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,096
Go.

491
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:57,347
We had hoped to be back in
our village before the child came.

492
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,986
To be born in this place...

493
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,718
it wasn't what we
wanted for our child.

494
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,664
Now I can only hope that
before she's grown up...

495
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,527
we can go back to our village.

496
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:20,138
Ahem. We tried calling
the hospital in Al-Fashir...

497
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,797
but we haven't been able
to find out anything yet.

498
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,368
She's there. I'm sure of it.

499
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,342
Dr. Carter.

500
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,642
Greg, you gave us quite a scare.

501
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,849
Van broke down.

502
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,653
Turns out even in Africa
cabs won't stop for a brother.

503
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,684
Sittina...?

504
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:43,388
She'll be okay. They're
working on her in town.

505
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,360
She should be ready to
come back in a few days.

506
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,203
- Allah is with her.
- You guys fixed him up pretty good.

507
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,201
Nice job.

508
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,067
Greg, where's Steven?

509
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,380
He couldn't keep going.

510
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,546
And Sittina, she...

511
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,787
Tell me.

512
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,689
I left him on the road.

513
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:16,384
- Where?
- At a burned-out village.

514
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,894
I went back for him, but
by the time I got there...

515
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,396
I could tell the
Janjaweed had been there.

516
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,135
They torched the truck.

517
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,764
Here, his medicine.

518
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,606
- We need to go out and look for him.
- No, it's too late.

519
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:37,715
It'd be dark by the time we get there.
I'll take you first thing in the morning.

520
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,578
Debbie.

521
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,247
We didn't have a lot of options.

522
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:50,054
I mean, if we'd stayed, we'd all
be dead. He made me keep going.

523
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,288
You did what you had to do.

524
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,958
So did Dakarai.

525
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:00,133
Can you work?

526
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,604
- Yeah, in a minute.
- Okay.

527
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,409
Did you name her yet?

528
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,480
Yes. Amala.

529
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,482
That's beautiful.

530
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,423
It means hope.

531
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,036
After they had burned the truck,
I saw no reason to stick around.

532
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,140
Anyway, it was safer to walk,
especially after all of your driving.

533
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,714
Ah, I'm glad you
made it back, brother.

534
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,686
- You all right?
- I am now.

535
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,843
Why didn't you go to
Al-Fashir, you dummy?

536
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,214
They could have
treated you there.

537
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,883
Maybe next week, huh?

538
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,390
Ibrahim, let's take
him to the clinic.

539
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,961
Tell Zahra to get him started
on lactulose and saline.

540
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,781
He's one stubborn
son of a bitch.

541
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,888
I know the type.

542
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,924
You know, Carter, I got
my own way of being.

543
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,162
But it damn sure doesn't mean
I don't see or feel everything...

544
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,633
that's going on around me.

545
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:58,575
To tell you the truth, I never wanted
to be around this type of suffering.

546
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,609
I mean, who would?

547
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,645
I'm glad I came here.

548
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,118
I'm glad you came too.

549
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,585
Because I am not gonna
take the blame for that van.

550
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,917
Oh, gee, thanks.

551
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,151
That's okay. They'll take
it out of your paycheck.

552
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,921
What do you mean? We
actually get paid for this?

553
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,394
Whoa. Hey.

554
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,366
Okay, where are we going?
