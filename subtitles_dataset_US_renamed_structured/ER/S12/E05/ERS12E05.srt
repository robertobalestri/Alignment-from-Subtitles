1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,441
I saw Charlie Pratt at CeaseFire.
He said he stopped by here last week.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,942
- How did it go?
- Quick.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:15,412
Did the oncologist you spoke with mention
anything about prophylactic surgery?

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,175
You mean having
my breasts removed?

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,617
There have been advances in
reconstructive surgery. Protect yourself.

7
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,279
You promise giving up my
breasts would protect me?

8
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,255
I had my annual PSA screening.

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,395
Needle biopsy showed a moderately
differentiated prostate cancer.

10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,929
- I'm so sorry.
- Does this hurt, Blaire?

11
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,778
She's in a coma, Inez.
- Not anymore.

12
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,926
- What's the last thing you remember?
- We had an accident.

13
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:45,303
The reason I'm calling, Dr. Clemente,
is that you were supposed to start today.

14
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,108
So unless your plane went
down or you got hit by a bus...

15
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,377
you'd better get in here as
soon as you get this message.

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,817
Luka, I need you to wait.
Pratt's running behind.

17
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,455
The new Attending is a no-show.

18
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,454
Think he'd wanna
make a good impression.

19
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,719
- You never did.
- Page me if he doesn't show.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,159
Morris, run through
the moonlighting list.

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,390
See if we can find
someone to come in.

22
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,297
- Whoa. Where are you rushing off to?
- Upstairs.

23
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,300
Why? Uh... Never mind.

24
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:15,002
Last time I reached out to someone,
Dubenko tried to make me his concubine.

25
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,337
Hello, my people.

26
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,571
- You're late.
- Not according to me.

27
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,874
According to me, I got
20 patients on the rack.

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,677
Chest pain, I need
a monitored bed.

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,910
Don't have one.
12-lead in the hallway.

30
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,579
- Is Dr. Lewis coming in?
- Dr. Lewis is never coming in again.

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,992
She took a tenured
track position in Iowa City.

32
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,629
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

33
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,129
That's why Dr. Clemente
is supposed to be here now.

34
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,766
Who's this Clemente guy, anyway?

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,700
He was residency director at Jacobi in
the Bronx and he did a stint in Newark.

36
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,736
Is he gonna be the
new department chief?

37
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,465
We're forming a
search committee.

38
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,405
The guy must be
angling for it, right?

39
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,772
Abby, vomiting blood.
- My favorite.

40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,140
Ray, nosebleed.

41
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,713
Sorry, I'm on my tox elective.

42
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,749
I was just rolling down here to
remind everybody about my gig.

43
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,911
- Oh... Pogo Lounge.
- Isn't that a strip club?

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,081
It's behind the Lava Lounge,
which used to be the Aqua Lounge.

45
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,520
Roomie, are you gonna come?

46
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,025
That's why I wake
up in the morning.

47
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,859
Okay, med students. Burning
urination, seafood allergy.

48
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,524
- We're not really doctors.
- That never stopped Morris.

49
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,169
Roswell and Marshall are premed.

50
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,204
They're working for my grant
tracking patient throughput time.

51
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,070
If we don't start moving the
meat, they'll be unemployed.

52
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,235
You want me to supervise everyone
and take on three new patients?

53
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,971
You're an R-4, stop whining.

54
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,139
- Where are you going?
- To the Weaver Lounge.

55
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,582
To work on my presentation. Anything
short of a meteor crash, don't bug me.

56
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,086
Pratt.

57
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,250
EKG looks good.

58
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,086
All right.

59
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,926
Where's your pain, sir?

60
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,730
It's not a pain. I just
feel something right here.

61
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,163
- BP 124 over 78.
- What's it feel like?

62
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,099
It feels really heavy, like a
boulder. I can't breathe, doc.

63
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,434
Say no more. Sir, would you
do me a favor and open up?

64
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,406
No, no. I did two
lines of coke last night.

65
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,774
- What?
- Yeah, and a bottle of tequila.

66
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,143
- You did?
- Yeah, not to mention three Viagra.

67
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,049
- Why didn't you say something?
- Aren't you supposed to take my history?

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,118
- Who are you?
- Victor Clemente. Your new Attending.

69
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,419
And congratulations,
doc. You just killed me.

70
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,247
Usually, Dr. Pratt
is very thorough.

71
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,507
We're getting slammed.

72
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,344
It's okay, death becomes me.

73
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,214
I've got a Q&A upstairs, but
maybe I should stay down here.

74
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,481
No, go ahead, take it. Dr. Kevorkian
and I will hold down the fort.

75
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,680
Hey, Jerry.

76
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,724
You know where to find me?
- Mm-hm.

77
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,820
You know how to
make an entrance.

78
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,057
I was just trying to
get the lay of the land.

79
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,428
You take it too far.

80
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,038
You should have seen me at St.
Mary's. I took it all the way to a rectal.

81
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,105
She was cuter than you, though.

82
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,765
Look at that. You guys
still using x-ray film?

83
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,434
I thought everybody
was digital by now.

84
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,475
- Oh, hey. Nice job shaving my chest hair.
- No problem.

85
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,677
Now, it took 24 minutes to get
my vitals. Twenty-four minutes.

86
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,981
Come on. I know we
can all do better than that.

87
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,126
Yes, we can. Yes, we
can. It's totally what I think.

88
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,557
Archie Morris, chief resident.

89
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,165
It usually takes me about 10 minutes
to figure out who the kiss-ass is.

90
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,459
At least we're breaking
records somewhere, huh?

91
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,332
Now, the EKG was prompt, but
the resident's evaluation was sloppy.

92
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,733
You know we were busy.

93
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,808
It's always busy, it's always
chaos, always out of control.

94
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,877
I know you don't have enough
hours to spend with every patient.

95
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,243
But our job is efficiency and
excellence. We're marksmen.

96
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,011
We hone in on what's important, hit
our target with one shot and move on.

97
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,047
We should call
Psych on this guy.

98
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,920
And who are you?

99
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,626
Abby Lockhart. R-2.

100
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,287
Oh, yeah. Weaver was
talking to me about you.

101
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,866
I'd like to say it was
all good, but it wasn't.

102
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,940
- Can we start by clearing this stuff?
- Okay, in Trauma 1, we have...

103
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,908
Grease board? God, I haven't seen one of
these since the '80s. That's pretty cool.

104
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,947
Look, unless anybody has any
objections, I prefer walking rounds.

105
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,141
We all learn. Okay? Let's go.

106
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,786
He's kind of hot.

107
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:56,151
- I thought you had a boyfriend.
- He's at war, and so are my hormones.

108
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,087
Come in.

109
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,697
How are you?

110
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,964
This toothbrush feels like
a hundred-pound weight.

111
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,368
Well, it's normal after
such prolonged bed rest.

112
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,166
Please tell me you brought
rocky road and a cheeseburger.

113
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,775
I just came by to test
your muscle tone again.

114
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,638
So no fries?

115
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,712
Well, at least you're
not Dr. Schulansky.

116
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,850
He brings tours here like I'm a
freak from the wild animal park.

117
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,484
He's excited that you're awake.

118
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,677
She's alive. She's alive.

119
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,287
Squeeze my hand.

120
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,821
Okay. That feels a little
stronger than last week.

121
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,088
Try to lift up your leg.

122
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,455
That's good. Very good.

123
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,632
Ugh.

124
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,430
Well, it's more than you
could do the last time.

125
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:49,473
That's thanks to three hours a day
with Helga, the therapist from hell.

126
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,635
Well, I see you
had some visitors.

127
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,804
Yeah, that was my
best friend from college.

128
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,847
I haven't seen her
since graduation.

129
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,612
I asked her for a joint and
she brought me a teddy bear.

130
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,848
Good for her. The last thing you need
is anything interfering with your recovery.

131
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:08,120
I need, heh, to
take the edge off.

132
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:12,255
Waking up and finding out that
your mom's dead, your fiancé's MIA...

133
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,166
and you've literally slept through
your 20s, it's just a little stressful.

134
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,867
Has Dr. Schulansky said
anything about the accident?

135
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,173
All I know is you and
your mom were driving...

136
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,873
and there was some
kind of traffic collision.

137
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,542
Yeah, that much I remember.

138
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,417
We were on our way for my
final fitting for my wedding dress.

139
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,416
It was strapless
with a tulle skirt.

140
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,331
I wouldn't even
let Jason see it.

141
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,129
- Your fiancé?
- Mm-hm.

142
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,831
Have you spoken to him?

143
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,031
Oh. That would fall
under the heading...

144
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,040
of "Scared as hell, don't
know how to do that one."

145
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,906
Lowered tidal volume
of 6 cc's per kilo...

146
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,210
decreased mortality from
40 percent to 31 percent.

147
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:07,218
You twirl a knob,
you're gonna save a life.

148
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,219
Okay? All right, let's go.

149
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,352
Those are cool shoes,
man. Are they Adidas?

150
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,053
Get laid, Morris.

151
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,723
Boris Nadinovitz, presenting with
fever, lymphadenopathy and night sweats.

152
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,232
No obvious source.

153
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,374
<i>Ya bolen,</i> doctor.

154
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,909
So, what's your
diagnostic approach?

155
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,574
Skin test for TB
and cocci histo?

156
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,550
Good, good, good.

157
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,054
Dorsey Watson.

158
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,987
Greg Pratt.

159
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,227
Man, what's it
been, like five years?

160
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,493
Six. I was in second
year when you graduated.

161
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,694
- Wow. What are you doing here?
- I work here. What's your excuse?

162
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,397
I heard you were in Winnetka
doing lipo on rich chicks.

163
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,768
Still am, man. Still am.

164
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,276
But one of my patients got a half-price
tummy tuck from a hack, landed upstairs.

165
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,470
Hey, killer, come on.

166
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,275
We got patients
to clear. Let's go.

167
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,716
- I gotta roll, man.
- Hey, do your thing.

168
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,378
- I'll holler at you before I go.
- Definitely.

169
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,324
Be relaxed. Try to sound calm.

170
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,121
It will be weird
for him at first.

171
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,025
You think?

172
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,625
- It's ringing.
- Okay, take a deep breath.

173
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,732
What's going on?

174
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,971
Oh! Hi. Is this
Jason Clark's house?

175
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,873
She's calling her fiancé.

176
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,981
Blaire Collins. I'm an old
friend of his from the Art Institute.

177
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,344
- She's doing great.
- I'm amazed by her progress.

178
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,454
I've been trying to help her for over
four years and all of a sudden, this.

179
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,547
Yeah, it's really me.

180
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,192
What were you treating her with?

181
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,260
Most recently, an
experimental cocktail.

182
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,023
Fluoxetine, Sinemet
and dextroamphetamine.

183
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,167
- Is she still on them?
- Not anymore.

184
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,528
I know. It's weird.

185
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,035
She's asked me about what
happened, how she got hurt.

186
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:14,076
Um... I think it's better not
to talk to her about it yet.

187
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,716
Is there something
she shouldn't know?

188
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,216
The accident was
violent, to say the least.

189
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,214
Blaire and her mother were
carjacked. Her mom was raped.

190
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,915
And shot?

191
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,152
Blaire tried to fight
and was pistol-whipped.

192
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,661
They would have killed
her, but someone pulled up.

193
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,231
Still, she has
the right to know.

194
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,426
She's in a fragile state.
Telling her could set her back.

195
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,202
Let's get her healthy first.

196
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,931
She needs to hear this
from someone close to her.

197
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,702
- She has no family.
- She'll be told, doctor.

198
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,709
All in good time.

199
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,643
A 22-year-old female presenting
with recurring headaches.

200
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,285
- No history of migraine...
- Right.

201
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,354
But there is a history of
idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

202
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,616
They usually take out
a bunch of spinal fluid.

203
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,019
We don't do that anymore.

204
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,216
- We don't?
- No.

205
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,693
Now that we know that IIH is
caused by sagittal sinus thrombosis...

206
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,459
resulting in a decreased CSF
reabsorption at the arachnoid sinuses.

207
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,693
I didn't know that.

208
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,895
- Heparin is the treatment of choice.
- Here you go, doc.

209
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,404
I'm just gonna place a
drop in your eye. Lean back.

210
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,304
She still needs an
LP for diagnosis.

211
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,240
Hey, hey, not so
fast, not so fast.

212
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,813
<i>Annals of Emergency
Medicine,</i> May 2000.

213
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,206
- 2000...?
- Five?

214
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,216
- Nope.
- Three?

215
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,048
- Nope.
- Four?

216
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,450
Ten points for the winner.

217
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,620
Intraocular pressure correlates
with intracranial pressure.

218
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,160
Fifty-four. Diagnosis made,
and you don't get a spinal tap.

219
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,298
Abby, Oncology's on the phone.

220
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,093
If you ever say he's hot
again, I'll kneecap you.

221
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,365
Some patient of
yours is freaking out.

222
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,198
- In Oncology?
- Mm-hm.

223
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,866
- Who is it?
- Stephanie Lowenstein.

224
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,841
She's upset because we
couldn't do the reconstruction.

225
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,071
- Why not?
- They found an enlarged lymph node.

226
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,580
We told her pathology
isn't back, she won't listen.

227
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,184
She says it's all your fault.
She smashed the mirror.

228
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,184
- Stephanie.
- I don't want you here.

229
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,272
I just wanna help.

230
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:04,415
You call this helping?
This is not helping.

231
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,959
- Okay, I understand how you feel.
- You have no idea how I feel.

232
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,595
Miss Lowenstein, wait.

233
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,960
You just have to let the doctors
get the results back from the tests.

234
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,600
We'll figure out how to proceed.

235
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,760
To do what? To cut me up some
more? To hell with your damn tests.

236
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,168
Stephanie, listen to
me, please. Just listen.

237
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,172
- You ruined me.
- I know you're scared.

238
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,605
Is that what I am?

239
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,235
Just because they found a node
doesn't mean you have cancer.

240
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,439
I need a cab. Where's a cab?

241
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,676
You need to come
inside and let us treat you.

242
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,377
I have money. Where's
my stupid book?

243
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,150
- Oh!
- Listen.

244
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,416
Everything you're
feeling right now is normal.

245
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,719
- It's just gonna take time.
- I don't have time.

246
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,657
That's not true.

247
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,261
Who's gonna marry someone
who could need chemo for 10 years?

248
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,061
Someone who could die before
the kid goes to high school?

249
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,501
If they had trouble making a
diagnosis, it may not be cancer.

250
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:56,370
And if it is, because you had
the surgery, they caught it early.

251
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,306
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

252
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,004
You did what you had to do
and it was incredibly brave.

253
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,706
- Then why do I feel like this?
- Because it's scary.

254
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,847
It's scary, but you don't
have to go through this alone.

255
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,148
- Get the hell away from me.
- Stephanie, please.

256
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:13,316
Just let me take care of those
cuts. Just come inside with me and...

257
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,362
Stephanie, please.

258
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,862
I've tried all the
Internet dating sites.

259
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:29,738
I rewrote my profile so many times,
you would have thought it was my thesis.

260
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,706
What happened to Lou?

261
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,912
- I liked Lou.
- Ah.

262
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,688
I don't think he
could handle this.

263
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,918
He said he would come
back after the surgery, but...

264
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,956
I never liked Lou.

265
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,295
Guy's a jerk. It's a good
thing you found out early.

266
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,065
I don't wanna freeze my
eggs or buy milk on the Internet.

267
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,436
I wanted to breastfeed.

268
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,542
This is a little
bit of Neosporin.

269
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,852
Aren't you afraid you'll
wind up the auntie?

270
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,983
Be forced to adopt
some kid from Cambodia?

271
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,418
I think Cambodian kids are cute.

272
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,458
You know what I meant.

273
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,626
Stephanie, if all goes well,
you'll get the reconstruction.

274
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,858
You'll have an uneventful
recovery and a perfectly normal life.

275
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,526
That's doctor talk.
You don't get it.

276
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,241
My mother's sister
died of breast cancer.

277
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,505
So did my grandmother.

278
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,775
And you?

279
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:50,614
I have never even
had a mammogram.

280
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,158
Tony Dejesus, single stab wound to
the neck, vitals stable, good airway.

281
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,956
Having trouble breathing? - No.

282
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,291
Time of arrival, 1442.

283
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,729
- This gang-related? TONY:
My old lady stabbed me.

284
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,301
- Why did she do that?
- Because she's a psycho bitch.

285
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,371
Where are my residents? This
is a great case. Get my residents.

286
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,843
Hey, who are these clowns? We
are not putting on a show for you.

287
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,672
What the hell is wrong with
you? Get the hell out of here.

288
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,723
The woman who answered
Jason's phone was his wife.

289
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,129
Six years is a long time.

290
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:36,133
Ha. You know, the thing
that's so hard about all of this...

291
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,965
is that everything has
just gone on and I still feel...

292
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,472
like Jason and I were just
finalizing our wedding list yesterday.

293
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,040
I'm sure he stayed by
you as long as he could.

294
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,704
He came by twice.

295
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,043
Schulansky told me.

296
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,045
No wonder he wanted
us to write our own vows.

297
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:59,056
He probably planned on omitting the
whole "in sickness and in health" part.

298
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,559
Did you want him to spend the
rest of his life hoping for something...

299
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,255
everyone said wouldn't happen?

300
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,342
Maybe I can be his mistress.

301
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,948
Which anatomic landmarks
define zone two of the neck?

302
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,556
The cricoid cartilage to
the angle of the mandible.

303
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,283
Very, very, very good.

304
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,327
Because management of zone
two injuries is very controversial.

305
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,557
Actually, some people advocate
surgical exploration for everything.

306
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,065
I'm pretty sure surgeons
would not wanna explore...

307
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,636
an asymptomatic patient
with a superficial wound.

308
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,433
Can you guys hurry up? My
old lady's gonna burn my truck.

309
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,406
Maybe next time, you won't
double dip at your mom's-in-law.

310
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,477
You seen my wife's mother?

311
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,244
- Then don't criticize.
- My bad.

312
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,444
I'm sure you guys are aware of all the
indications for immediate exploration.

313
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,814
Right, Dr. Morris?

314
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,923
Airway compromise, severe
hemorrhage or expanding hematoma.

315
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,286
- He has none of those.
- Good, so then let me go.

316
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,759
Right, but we can always
learn from every case, Dr. Pratt.

317
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,490
Talk to me about
management with neck injuries.

318
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,100
- What?
- Brother, keep it short.

319
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,930
Don't go Al Sharpton on his ass.

320
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,334
Duplex scan, endoscopy,
gastrograffin swallow...

321
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,633
which you would only
do if he had symptoms.

322
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,105
Well, slow your roll, bro...

323
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,713
because what proportion of zone
two vascular injuries are asymptomatic?

324
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,110
Dr. Rasgotra?

325
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,480
With a significant injury, he might
have signs of bleeding or a hematoma.

326
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,212
- The guy is stable.
- Maybe, maybe.

327
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,823
But nine in a hundred times,
asymptomatic patients...

328
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,084
have lesions that
require surgical repair.

329
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,990
How about that, Dr. Pratt?
How about that? Talk to me now.

330
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:47,293
You know what? How about I go
check on my asthma patient in Curtain 2?

331
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,526
There's no asthma
patient in Curtain 2.

332
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,165
Yeah, well, maybe he
went out for a smoke.

333
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,936
I'll go find him.

334
00:17:56,108 --> 00:18:00,341
Yes, Eve, I did. I
put up the sanitizer.

335
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,210
No, I didn't hand out pens.

336
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,976
I am putting up the
poster as we speak.

337
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,816
Yes, that special tape
that won't ruin the walls.

338
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,882
Okay, bye-bye.

339
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,960
Don't tell me. Eve?

340
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,392
It's her day off
and she still calls in.

341
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,864
Here. She wants everyone's hands to
be sanitized before they touch a patient.

342
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,230
"Scrub or rub"? It sounds kinky.

343
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,871
- We should be so lucky.
- Heh-heh.

344
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,500
I was thinking we could
get something to eat.

345
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,735
You know, maybe catch
a movie or something.

346
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,210
No, I haven't seen that one yet.

347
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,850
All right, cool. I'll
meet you out front.

348
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,920
Hey. How are you doing, Greg?

349
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,155
What, you're stalking me now?

350
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,655
No. I'm here for...

351
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,559
A sick friend.

352
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,559
Sure you don't have another
illegitimate kid up in there?

353
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,929
We need to talk. What
are you doing after work?

354
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,400
I've got a date.

355
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,868
With Olivia Evans?

356
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,701
Nice girl. I've known her
since she was in high school.

357
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,069
That's great.

358
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,905
What about tomorrow?
Maybe we can have dinner.

359
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,310
You like gumbo? I know a
great place on King Drive.

360
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,917
And down the street,
there's a cat with a pool hall...

361
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,849
Listen, we're not eating any
gumbo together or playing pool.

362
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,250
All right?

363
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,058
Then what would you like to do?

364
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,390
I would like for you
to leave me alone.

365
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,327
For real. We're done.

366
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,829
Okay. You don't wanna
have anything to do with me.

367
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,661
- What about your little brother?
- Don't use him like that.

368
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,269
- He'd like to get to know you, Greg.
- He just met me.

369
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,963
I don't know what your
mother told you about me.

370
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,405
But I have an idea
it wasn't everything.

371
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,373
- Come on, man.
- I could explain...

372
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,446
- but only if you give me the time.
- I do not have the time.

373
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,245
I'm trying here.

374
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,549
Then stop.

375
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,682
Fine.

376
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,451
If you wanna drop it
forever, that's your call.

377
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,325
But you'll have to live with it.

378
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,798
Your choice.

379
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,151
I never got the whole
marriage talk from my mom.

380
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,087
But the moment that I told her that
Jason proposed, she pulled out this trunk.

381
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,590
She had every detail
of my wedding planned.

382
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,456
It was crazy.

383
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,529
Oh, my God. Stop, stop.

384
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,529
She wasn't gonna pressure you.

385
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,997
Yeah.

386
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,199
She wanted it to be special.

387
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,105
Which way is Lake Michigan?

388
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,678
That way. You can see it from
the other side of the hospital.

389
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,339
- Can we go?
- I shouldn't even have you out.

390
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,883
- Please?
- No.

391
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,610
Come on.

392
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,279
What does a girl have to
do to get a break with you?

393
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,019
I hope Clemente doesn't
become chief of the department.

394
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,289
- You liked him.
- I did until I had to present.

395
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,729
Patient doesn't have
flesh-eating bacteria now...

396
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,528
but what symptoms might he have?

397
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,830
Is that muscle spasm in
the jaw? Acute tetanus?

398
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,200
I'm all for teaching, but
this guy doesn't stop.

399
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,500
Yeah, he's annoying.

400
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,870
You said you liked his
bloody shoes, you wanker.

401
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,013
Just because he's annoying,
doesn't mean I can't like his shoes.

402
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,675
- Are you going to Ray's gig?
- To hell with Ray.

403
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,215
He's upstairs having a blast.

404
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,013
Jerry, it's Ray. Save
me. I'm bored stiff.

405
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:31,419
Try picturing every woman up there
naked. That always works for me.

406
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,219
Oh, come on. Are there
any drug cases down there?

407
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,793
Couple of traumas rolling in.

408
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,863
Lola Simon, 7-year-old
with crush injury. BP 70 palp.

409
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,466
- What crushed her?
- Your next patient.

410
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,899
Seven-year-old
girl, no sign of drugs.

411
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,129
Yeah! I'm king of the world!

412
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,338
Looks like you
forgot how to fly, king.

413
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,706
Tommy Bonetti, stood up on the
Tilt-A-Whirl at the St. Ignatius fair.

414
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,279
- Is he on drugs?
- He might have just hit his head.

415
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,609
Sounds like drugs.
I'm on my way down.

416
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,912
- Move away from the light.
- We're trying to take care of you, man.

417
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,055
You look like an
alien. Don't probe me.

418
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,717
Please sedate him.

419
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,859
I have to assess
his neural status first.

420
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,890
Taking the HemoCue.

421
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,190
Gaaah!

422
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,198
Process the spinal films
before you take the rest.

423
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:19,105
- Hey, I'm rolling out, man.
- What, you scared of a little blood?

424
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,365
- Squeeze my hand.
- Systolic's 65.

425
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,102
All right, no fluid in the
abdomen. Pericardium is clear.

426
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,406
Looks like spinal shock
with a high thoracic injury.

427
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,174
Am I right?

428
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,217
I'm way out of my league, man.

429
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,047
Don't you remember Bartlett's
lecture on blunt trauma?

430
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,157
Sweetie, listen, I'm gonna poke
you. Tell me when you feel this.

431
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,089
Start dopamine at 5 mics,
900 of methylprednisolone.

432
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,558
Ow!

433
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,094
Sensory level at T4.

434
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,298
How you doing, Lola?

435
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,696
- That's a big bug.
- You just killed our mascot.

436
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,568
- Here she goes.
- Log roll. Keep her on the backboard.

437
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,600
Suction.

438
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:02,077
Look, some of the old U of I crew's
are hooking up at Cherry Red tonight.

439
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,477
You got plans?

440
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:06,448
- Pratt, we need you in here.
- I'm gonna try to roll through.

441
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,646
- Pratt, now.
- Go see what's up. I'll intubate.

442
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,293
You don't stay still, I'll put
this needle through your heart.

443
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,326
- Can we sedate and paralyze?
- He took his IV out.

444
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,695
Since when did Alfred E.
Neuman become a doctor?

445
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,770
- What about I.M. Versed?
- Gave him five. It's not touching him.

446
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,999
- What did he take?
- Maybe ice, coke. Tracheal 140.

447
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,439
- What the hell are you on?
- Her in a minute.

448
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,839
I can't find the vein.

449
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,776
- How about Haldol?
- No, he could seize.

450
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,381
Morris, let me try the line.

451
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,744
Dr. Pratt. PRATT: Go
ahead, push the sux.

452
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,183
This guy's unstable as
hell. We can't get a line.

453
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,787
- I'm tied up.
- We need help.

454
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,821
You gotta get Clemente.

455
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,619
- Is there another Attending on?
- Clemente's the only one.

456
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,728
No, we can handle this
ourselves. I'll do a femoral cutdown.

457
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,866
- Are you serious?
- He needs access.

458
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,057
Pulse keeps going up.

459
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,963
Mix up esmolol,
slow down his rate.

460
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,866
- Ten blade.
- We got sugar in here?

461
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,865
Oh, wow, we got a
trauma. I didn't know.

462
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,534
Pager's probably not working.
No, my pager's working.

463
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,203
Twenty-foot fall complicated
by unknown intoxication.

464
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,009
- What are you guys doing?
- A femoral cutdown.

465
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,379
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
everybody take a deep breath.

466
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,020
Take a deep breath.

467
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,520
Get my briefcase under admit.

468
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,625
- Banana cheese.
- Banana cheese.

469
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,488
- What did he take?
- He won't say.

470
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,562
Tachy with mydriasis. My
guess is sympathomimetic.

471
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,931
Bad, bad guess.

472
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,431
Skin and membranes are dry.

473
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,336
It's an anticholinergic.
Electrolytes back yet?

474
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,766
Right here.

475
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:39,378
Hyperchloremia. Anion gap is
minus four. How could that be?

476
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,742
Skittles, people, skittles. Very
popular with the kids these days.

477
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:49,047
It's cold pills with
dextromethorphan hydrogen bromide.

478
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,247
The lab analyzer thinks
bromide is chloride.

479
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,289
- You get a reversal of the gap.
- Aaah!

480
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,893
Anything to calm him down?

481
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,757
- Two mics of I.M. physostigmine.
- He still needs access.

482
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,058
- Here you go.
- I'm Rick James, bitch.

483
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,726
Close your eyes. Go to
your happy place, son.

484
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,699
What time did the
chem panel come back?

485
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,204
He's got weird anatomy. We
couldn't find the subclavian.

486
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,905
There it is, there
it is. Right there.

487
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:21,076
See, the probe allows us to cannulate
the vein under direct visualization.

488
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,115
That's very cool.

489
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,388
- You carry that with you all the time?
- It's just a demo.

490
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,961
I ran the phase-three trials.

491
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:36,526
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

492
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,933
Heart rate's down to 80.

493
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,034
I guess we didn't need
the beta blockers, did we?

494
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,637
I trust you guys can
finish without me.

495
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,610
No problem, boss.

496
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,746
Hey. Even if you think
I'm a pain in the ass...

497
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,186
it should never get in
the way of patient care.

498
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,950
You with me?

499
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,894
Good.

500
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,296
Dr. Lockhart?

501
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,993
Hey.

502
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,999
What's up?

503
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,732
Well, everything. And
almost twice a day.

504
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,173
Congratulations. I hear
you're getting out today.

505
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,006
If you thought it stunk to
work here, try being a patient.

506
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,705
By the way, thanks for the date.

507
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,179
- She told you?
- I had to pay her.

508
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,878
- It was supposed to be a freebie.
- Just the first time.

509
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,719
Initially, it kind of turned me off when
I learned that she was a professional.

510
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,385
But then when I thought
about it, it turned me on.

511
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:38,929
We're both professionals.

512
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,033
So you didn't need me after all.

513
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,102
Well, I guess not.

514
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,533
Hey. I don't remember your name.

515
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,765
Abby. And you're
a little late, Lou.

516
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,705
I came to see how
Stephanie was doing.

517
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:54,040
She had her breasts removed.
Pick up a pink ribbon on your way out.

518
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,011
- What? She did?
- Yeah, she did.

519
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,241
What are you talking about?

520
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,184
Stephanie says you
disappeared on her.

521
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,049
She told the nurse
not to let me in.

522
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:06,056
And every time I called, she
wouldn't say why she was here...

523
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,784
and kept going on about...

524
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,397
how she couldn't handle
dating anyone right now.

525
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,926
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know.

526
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,728
All I know is I can't
stop thinking about her.

527
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,166
And I'm a little worried.

528
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,441
Come on, come
on. Do it, do it, do it.

529
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,272
Dr. Clemente.

530
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,277
- Oh, damn it.
- Do you have a moment?

531
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,479
You should really consider
getting one of these.

532
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,381
It might keep you from
hacking up the patients.

533
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:38,354
I'm sorry I didn't call you in
earlier. Bonetti's gone up to the ICU.

534
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,390
We've got to consider
preemptive orders.

535
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,187
It was really
unprofessional of me.

536
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,921
Nurses transporting patients?
What a waste of resources.

537
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,929
- Are you listening to me?
- Actually, no.

538
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,433
I lost. Okay, look.

539
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:55,005
A femoral cutdown has to be a
last-ditch effort in a peri-arrest patient.

540
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,338
- And skittles boy wasn't quite there yet.
- Well, I thought he was.

541
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,211
Oh, you thought he was.

542
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,774
Look, I know. I was a resident too, I
thought I had the keys to the kingdom.

543
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:09,149
But the great thing is that we can
always learn. That's why I'm here.

544
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,290
Well, sometimes you
wanna do it yourself.

545
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,517
Sometimes your ego does, but
the patient would rather that I do it.

546
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,492
- Believe me.
- You're right.

547
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,689
You know what? It's
not about being right.

548
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:24,664
Okay, look, I consider you, Pratt, Morris,
every resident, every student here...

549
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,464
an investment in the future.

550
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,507
My dividend comes when something that
I've taught you saves a life. That's it.

551
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:33,612
You should really consider
surgery as an elective.

552
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,478
Well, why do you say that?

553
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,743
Because you're quick to cut and you
like to use a scalpel more than your brain.

554
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,014
Come in.

555
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,150
- Hi.
- Hey.

556
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,262
I brought you some company.

557
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,495
Lou.

558
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,870
I heard what happened.

559
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,832
Hi.

560
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,938
Come in. Sit down.

561
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,482
Chocolate.

562
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,828
Hi. I'd like to schedule an
outpatient mammogram.

563
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,801
Sure. Patient's name?

564
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,030
Abby Lockhart.

565
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,535
First you missed
morning rounds...

566
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,341
and now they tell me you're
avoiding Poison Control.

567
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,507
No, I got stuck with a consult.

568
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:49,121
Look, a bunch of Zen monks made
tea from this plant in their garden.

569
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,120
Now they have
vomiting, diarrhea.

570
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,818
Some are tachycardic, some bradycardic,
some hypotensive, some hypertensive.

571
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,005
Not a clear toxidrome.

572
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,929
I haven't identified
this on the Internet.

573
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,328
I even sent digital photos to
the Botany Department, but...

574
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,632
It's not jimsonweed, not
foxglove, not oleander.

575
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,336
Well, maybe it's <i>tabaco gigante.</i>

576
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,742
You know something?
You may be right.

577
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,248
I saw this once in
Mexico. It's a tobacco plant.

578
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,353
Your patients have
nicotine toxicity.

579
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,012
- Oh.
- Good call.

580
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,454
<i>Thank you.</i>

581
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,894
Dr. Clemente.

582
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,762
Why are my research assistants
sitting in the waiting area?

583
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,402
The parking garage is too cold?

584
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,697
They're collecting data for me.

585
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,204
The looky-loos were
getting in the way of the work.

586
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,104
Then you just tell
them to step back.

587
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,905
I didn't wanna overstep. Maybe
that should come from you.

588
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,207
Overstep? You pulled
the plug on my study.

589
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,907
Look. I meant it as more
as a time-out kind of thing.

590
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,383
You told them that
my study was useless.

591
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,954
Look, I know what
happened in Newark.

592
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,523
And I really do not want
a repeat here, okay?

593
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:07,824
All right, look. Bottom line, you hired
me to make this place more efficient.

594
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,299
And that's what I am trying to
do. And if and when we start...

595
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,871
bedside registration is
gonna make your study...

596
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,200
I don't know, irrelevant?

597
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,003
I've got a $100,000 grant
that says that it won't.

598
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,304
You've got $100,000,
why don't we go digital?

599
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,414
Listen, I run this hospital.

600
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:25,278
If we start bedside registration,
that goes through me.

601
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,147
If you put my students on a
time-out, that goes through me.

602
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,813
If you wanna wash the floors
differently, that goes through me.

603
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,754
Do I make myself clear?

604
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,561
I got one more question for you.
Does my answer go through you?

605
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,331
My mom loved seeing the lake.

606
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,005
Look at the water.

607
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,206
At least some
things stay the same.

608
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,411
We should really get back.

609
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,279
Have you always
been such a worrier?

610
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,616
I've always had
things to worry about.

611
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,866
Do you think this was God?

612
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,435
What?

613
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,036
Me waking up.

614
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,234
I don't know.

615
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,645
You think it was
science, don't you?

616
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,980
I've seen deeply religious
people come into the hospital.

617
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,518
Prayer did nothing for them.

618
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:39,347
And then I've seen
plenty of skeptics...

619
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,884
experience
miraculous recoveries.

620
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,324
So you think it was fate?

621
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,066
I think...

622
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,572
I'm glad we're both here
able to wonder about it.

623
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,047
Yeah.

624
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,287
How you gonna punk me like that?

625
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,719
What's up, little man?
You know where Olivia is?

626
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,825
- Yeah, she's down the hall.
- Thanks.

627
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,496
I hear you, fellows.

628
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,066
But you sound like a
bunch of knuckleheads.

629
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,465
Hey, all I'm saying is, you can't
feel nothing with no jimmy on.

630
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:27,599
Get used to them.
There's no alternative.

631
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:32,510
Getting a girl pregnant
is 18 years of lockdown.

632
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,305
Half your check
going to Uncle Sam.

633
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,643
- The other half going to your kid and...?
- The baby's mama?

634
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:40,445
And what happens if you
miss a child support payment?

635
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,884
Who's gonna be
blowing up your pager?

636
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,283
My baby's mama.

637
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,358
Having a kid at your age...

638
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,791
ain't what you wanna do.

639
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,791
Trust me.

640
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,965
Do you miss Croatia?

641
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,470
I have family there.

642
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,304
But there are more
opportunities for me here.

643
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,503
I like Chicago.

644
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,046
Except the winter sucks.

645
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,480
Yeah, you can always
go inside and warm up.

646
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:23,560
You know how I keep
asking you about the accident?

647
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,899
It's because I keep having
these flashes that don't add up.

648
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,403
What kind of flashes?

649
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,398
I remember being scared.

650
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:44,215
We had just gotten coffee and I
remember seeing my mom's face.

651
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,580
Her eyes were petrified.

652
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,853
And I hear her screams, but her
screams are muffled by the radio...

653
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,896
and there's blood and laughter.

654
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,862
Lots of laughter, and at first I
thought it was just a dream...

655
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:10,475
but the images are so vivid.

656
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,077
- They're so clear.
- Sit down.

657
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,908
Sit down.

658
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,512
Something else
happened that night.

659
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,451
And not knowing
what it is is killing me.

660
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,929
But I need the truth.

661
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:40,539
- Blaire.
- I want to be out...

662
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,635
- Figure it...
- Blaire?

663
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,336
Come on, Blaire. Stay with me.

664
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,110
Hey, I need a monitored bed.

665
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,546
- Trauma 1. What's going on?
- Page Schulansky in Neurology.

666
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,118
Hey, I'm Dr. Clemente.
So, what's the problem?

667
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,549
She's not talking.

668
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,054
Get me an Accu-Chek, a
HemoCue and a pulse ox.

669
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:02,092
- She doesn't need that.
- Can we have her friend wait outside?

670
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,162
- I'm not her friend.
- This is Dr. Kovac, one of our Attendings.

671
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,198
Hey, doc. I'm
sorry, I had no clue.

672
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:12,003
- Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me?
- Her name's Blaire.

673
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,366
- Can you hear me? MALIK:
Schulansky's at the VA.

674
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,099
Damn it. Gaze is
fixed to the right.

675
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,934
I need a CBC, chem
panel and a head CT.

676
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,671
No, she needs fluoxetine,
Sinemet and dextroamphetamine.

677
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,782
I don't know what
you're talking about.

678
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,282
Abby, run up to the
pharmacy and get the meds.

679
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,978
There's an approach dealing
with altered mental status.

680
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:33,284
This is not a standard patient.
She's been on experimental cocktail.

681
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,654
Abby, fluoxetine, Sinemet
and dextroamphetamine.

682
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,022
Abby, please go.

683
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:48,540
Hey, hey. I need some help.

684
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,073
Hey.

685
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,409
What's up?

686
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:56,105
Fluoxetine, Sinemet,
dextroamphetamine.

687
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,876
Yeah, write it up. Hey,
what are you doing?

688
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,814
Are you crazy? You
can't go back here.

689
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,318
Crit's fine. Sodium
and potassium normal.

690
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,616
- I told you that.
- CT is ready.

691
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,658
Okay, let's move her now.
- She needs the meds.

692
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:11,160
We could be missing a
brain bleed or a mass effect.

693
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,389
- I know.
- We don't have time to screw around.

694
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,193
The meds woke her
up from the coma.

695
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,029
If they did, we'd have coma
patients waking up everywhere.

696
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,934
- All I know is they worked for her.
- Got them.

697
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,507
You're not gonna
actually let him do this?

698
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,076
Are you confident these
meds are gonna work?

699
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:32,273
If not, there's gonna be
a tall guy in a cheap suit...

700
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,214
from the state asking questions.

701
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,320
It's worth a try, Kerry.

702
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,562
Right. Hold the scanner.

703
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,823
I'll give him five minutes.

704
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,595
You know what? Don't sweat it.

705
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,738
Dr. Kovac, you're the
physician of record.

706
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,930
I'm not on the chart
when the family sues.

707
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,042
Well, I'm in luck.
There is no family.

708
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,074
And fluoxetine in at 2019.

709
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:02,913
Let's get her up to CT.

710
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:05,414
As soon as I get
a portable monitor.

711
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,849
Blaire? Blaire?

712
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,182
Eyes opening to pain.

713
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,687
- Incomprehensible verbal activity.
- You got a GCS of 2, 2, 4.

714
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,523
Check her gag. WEAVER: Whoa.

715
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,029
She's seizing. Two
mics of Ativan now.

716
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,259
One hundred percent
oxygen, non-rebreather.

717
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,869
- She has a history of seizures?
- No.

718
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,939
Well, any of the meds you
pushed could have caused this.

719
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,804
So could falling drug
levels, so could withdrawal.

720
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,444
Another round of Ativan.

721
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,915
Heh. I really liked
that last one. Is it new?

722
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,212
Yeah. It's called "Blood Wine."

723
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:44,447
Oh, "Blood Wine." How
did you think of that?

724
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,490
I cut my finger opening
a bottle of merlot.

725
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,228
So you and your
friend headed home?

726
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:53,964
I don't know what she's doing.

727
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:55,623
Do you know what you're doing?

728
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:59,562
- Yeah, I know what I'd like to do.
- Hold that thought.

729
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,400
I'll settle with the boys. I'll be back.
- Yo, Ray.

730
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,543
You guys are late. We
were the opening act.

731
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:08,407
Clemente had us pull journal articles
to justify the treatment of every patient.

732
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,548
You wanna get something to eat?

733
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:15,078
- I have plans.
- Do your plans have friends?

734
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,317
Let's see.

735
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,749
- Zoe.
- Yes?

736
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,258
- This is my boy, Archie.
- What up, ladies?

737
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,420
- You guys hungry?
- We wanna meet the band.

738
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,326
I play drums.

739
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:30,666
Heh.

740
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:31,928
Yeah, I'm serious. Like:

741
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,407
That's my marching band.
We won the nationals.

742
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,710
Turning into pooh,
pooh, pooh, and then we...

743
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,776
Guys? Ray!

744
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,685
Blaire?

745
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,287
Blaire, open your eyes.

746
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,255
Maybe she's postictal.

747
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,864
Or the Ativan didn't wear off.

748
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,298
Or I shouldn't have
pushed the meds.

749
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,794
You don't know why
she had a seizure.

750
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,731
Maybe we overloaded her sinuses.

751
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,243
Luka, there is no way to
know why she fell back into this.

752
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,683
Yeah.

753
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,487
I have to go. Are you okay?

754
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,935
The state conservator agreed
to admit Blaire to the hospital...

755
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,765
for two days to see if
there's any improvement.

756
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,704
If not, she'll go back
to the nursing home.

757
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,247
<i>I could have been a
doctor But why poetry?</i>

758
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,014
<i>Why I? Why me? Why I?</i>

759
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,623
<i>I could have been a
lawyer But why poetry?</i>

760
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,694
<i>Poetry. Why?</i>

761
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,591
<i>Poetry.</i>

762
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:06,787
Thank you.

763
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:15,034
- Where's our waitress?
- To hell with her. What do you want?

764
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,606
Uh... Light beer.

765
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,743
Lipo doctor's scared
of getting handles.

766
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,378
Don't hate. I look good.

767
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,507
I'll be back.

768
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,445
Excuse me.

769
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:29,450
Hey, what's up, bro? I'll
get two beers, one light.

770
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,321
- You want something?
- A conversation would be cool.

771
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,982
- You haven't said anything to me.
- We can barely hear.

772
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,685
You could hear everyone
just fine. What did I do, Greg?

773
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,627
- Tell me what I did.
- You should've told me he was in there.

774
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,131
- You want me to survey the building?
- Yes, I do.

775
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,202
Look, he's down there
helping those kids.

776
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,862
And who sews up those kids
once they leave your place?

777
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,531
Your father tries to help
them before they get to you.

778
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,700
I see. Charlie Pratt
may be a lot of things.

779
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,403
But he's not my father,
my dad or my pops.

780
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,412
He's just a guy who
got my mom pregnant.

781
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,916
So basically, he made the same
mistake he's warning those kids about.

782
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,553
Greg, wait. Uh...

783
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,258
You wanna hate him, I can't
stop you, but Charlie's a good guy.

784
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:11,294
Twenty hours a week with the
kids, runs a basketball league...

785
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,489
- rehab houses for poor people.
- Yeah, see, that's the problem.

786
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,492
I've waited my whole life
to spit in my old man's face.

787
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,102
He's not lying in the gutter...

788
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,570
- People change, Greg...
- He's building houses for people for free.

789
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,544
- No. No.
- Greg.

790
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,964
Ah!

791
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,120
Blaire, I hope you can hear me.

792
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:16,157
On that night, you and
your mom were driving.

793
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:18,796
You stopped at a red light.

794
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:22,161
Another car pulled
up next to you.

795
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,602
There were three men inside.

796
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:32,737
They pulled a gun...

797
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,470
and dragged your mom...
