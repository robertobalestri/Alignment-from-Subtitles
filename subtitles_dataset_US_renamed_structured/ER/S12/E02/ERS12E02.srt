1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,434
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,700
Don't go away mad, Jake.

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,207
But do go away.

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,540
I don't wanna
have any more kids.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,914
I'm done.

6
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,051
You're responsible for
everything the intern does.

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,417
But you question the history,
they get all testy on you.

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,884
Sounds like you had a great day.

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,249
You told me to step it up.

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,618
Yeah, but your job isn't to
just move the meat, Abby.

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,918
You're a resident now.

12
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,459
Your name is Charlie Pratt?

13
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,097
Yes, who is it?

14
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,395
- Is there a problem?
- Are you Charlie?

15
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,102
Yeah, I'm Charlie.

16
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,350
Is Alex still here?

17
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,077
No, he just left. Why?

18
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,684
You were up early.

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,159
Yep.

20
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,460
Everything okay?

21
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,757
Oh, I just couldn't sleep.

22
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,258
Uh...

23
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,767
I've been thinking about...

24
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,967
Hello?

25
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,869
This is Sam.

26
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,912
Yes, I did. Uh-huh.

27
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,538
When?

28
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,811
Okay. Sure.

29
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:28,055
If I come by in 20 minutes, is
someone still gonna be there? Great.

30
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,383
Okay. Thank you.

31
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,491
Sorry. What were you saying?

32
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,828
My father's been
bugging me to visit him.

33
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,769
I haven't been home in a long time
and I have some vacation coming up...

34
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,702
so I was thinking about
making a trip back to Croatia.

35
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,505
It would only be
for a couple weeks.

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,578
It might be good for us if
we spend some time apart.

37
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,682
Alex and you can hang out and...

38
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,463
You know...

39
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:58,648
I already started
looking for a new place.

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,513
- New place?
- For me and Alex.

41
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,351
What, you're moving out?

42
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,520
You said it'd be good
for us to spend time apart.

43
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,992
That's not what I meant.

44
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,132
Well, I was gonna tell
you. I just think that it's...

45
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,531
- I need to think things out by myself.
- Where are you going now?

46
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,672
- I'm looking at an apartment before work.
- So, what, that's it?

47
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:22,332
- We don't talk about this?
- Never seemed to do us any good before.

48
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,806
Oh, did he really? Oh, my God.

49
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,211
You gotta tell me later.
Okay. I gotta go. Bye.

50
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,817
Let's go.

51
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,352
Wait!

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,816
Hey. Hey. Can
you hold the doors?

53
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,458
Hey! Can you hold the door...?

54
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,989
Thank you.

55
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,131
Hey. ABBY: Hi.

56
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,826
- Good morning.
- Well, maybe for you.

57
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,132
I was up half the night writing a
paper on paintball injuries for Morris.

58
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,642
Are they talking about us?

59
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,246
Can we help you?

60
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,987
We were just wondering
where you got your shoes.

61
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,554
They look very comfortable.

62
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,024
They match your backpack.

63
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,758
Just ignore them.

64
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,397
They're on a bulimia high.

65
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,063
I don't understand what
she said, but it was like...

66
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,298
Ah! WOMAN: Oh, my God!

67
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,704
- Oh, my foot!
- Are you okay?

68
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,539
- Can you stand on it?
- No!

69
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,075
- Call 911. NEELA:
Should we check her out?

70
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,773
No.

71
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,147
- Don't touch me.
- Try not to move.

72
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,315
I'm a doctor. You may
have broken your ankle.

73
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,753
If you're a doctor, I
want a second opinion.

74
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,521
Okay.

75
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,165
Dr. Lockhart, would you
care to give a second opinion?

76
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:56,292
Sure. Your ankle may be
broken, and you're a bitch.

77
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,322
All three of them are
a liability. Look at them.

78
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,858
Huddled together like prairie dogs.
This is the best we have to work with?

79
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,724
- Should've made me chief long ago.
- And why's that?

80
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,696
For one, I'd be a little pickier
in choosing our residents.

81
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,097
- What are you talking about?
- Abby, Ray, Neela.

82
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,101
No brain, no courage, no heart.

83
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,934
- They need a trip to see the Wizard.
- Who's the wizard? You?

84
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,042
That's why they pay
me the big bucks.

85
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,542
Officer on deck.

86
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,073
Me. I'm the chief.

87
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,442
- Yeah, Chief Pain-In-The-Ass.
- Ha-ha.

88
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,380
Oh, Abby, if only you were
as talented as you are funny.

89
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,781
At least I'm funny.

90
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,355
If making jokes at the expense of
those with Native American heritage...

91
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,718
is humorous to you...

92
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,190
Yeah. I happen to be
one-sixteenth Choctaw Indian.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,693
Hey, Jake sent us a
postcard from San Francisco.

94
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,695
- Right on.
- How's he doing, Abby?

95
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,098
Great.

96
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,202
I think he really
likes it there.

97
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,563
Yeah. Not according to this.

98
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,366
Guys, you know our new interns.

99
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,566
Clemons, Munson and Babinski.

100
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,904
Abby, Neela and Ray.
They'll show you the ropes.

101
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,570
I'm Dr. Morris, but everybody
calls me chief, because?

102
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,410
Anyone? No? Well,
I'm the chief resident.

103
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,917
You present to the
residents, they to Pratt and me.

104
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,817
- They present to the attending.
- That's a lot of presenting.

105
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,117
Dr. Kovac, you got a
patient in the cath lab?

106
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,455
- Yeah, why?
- I think he might have died.

107
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,256
If you'll step over
to the board...

108
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,456
I'll show you how I
like things done here.

109
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,101
This applies to you as well.
I'm implementing changes.

110
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,260
I'd like to stick an
implement in his eye.

111
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:11,803
- Pick a number, 1-10.
- Why?

112
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,567
- Neela?
- Seven.

113
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,069
- Four?
- So close, it was six.

114
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,611
- Neela chooses, Munson or Babinski.
- Babinski!

115
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,179
- Wait a minute.
- Who's up?

116
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,146
- Clemons, you're with me.
- I am?

117
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,581
I trust you, girl. Just
don't let me down.

118
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,386
Claire Jansen, 24. Unrestrained
driver. Rear-ended at moderate velocity.

119
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,819
Term pregnancy. Good vitals.

120
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,984
Definitely having contractions.
Fetal heart rate looks good, 160.

121
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,595
Okay. Any pain when I push?

122
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,856
- Not now.
- HemoCue, 14.1.

123
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,558
- Pretty normal.
- I don't think you're bleeding internally.

124
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,034
I should hope not. Yeah,
I think my water broke.

125
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,365
- Premature rupture of membranes.
- Is that bad?

126
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,634
No, but there's a good chance
you could be having your baby today.

127
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,801
Oh, I wanted to have
another home birth.

128
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,676
- This is your second pregnancy?
- Yeah. Zoe's 2. This one's a boy.

129
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,876
- You want me to call your husband?
- No, there's no such creature.

130
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,284
But you could call Toni
Stillman. She's my friend.

131
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,822
She needs to be here. - Ray?

132
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,358
Twenty-four-year-old.
G-Two P-One, 39 weeks.

133
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,894
Prommed after a TC.
Normal vitals and crit.

134
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:14,763
Ultrasound and send her up
to OB for sterile spec exam.

135
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,167
Do you have a minute?

136
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,037
Uh, no. Not really.

137
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,698
I got to get labs
off, do a cathed UA.

138
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,209
Assist Ray with the pelvic
and find an ultrasound.

139
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,006
Can you do some of this?

140
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,509
Me?

141
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,911
No, she can't.

142
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,015
Sorry, Inez. This is Dr. Kovac. I'm
helping her get the lay of the land.

143
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,714
- When you're finished?
- Sure. It might be a while.

144
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,489
- Welcome to County, Inez.
- Thank you.

145
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,661
Sit tight, Claire.
You're doing great.

146
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,892
We'll have you upstairs
before you get comfortable.

147
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,435
I feel it'll be several hours
before I'm comfortable.

148
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,004
Okay. Clemons, what's next?
- A bimanual exam?

149
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,869
- Not before the ultrasound.
- Why not?

150
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,442
Third trimester. You rule
out previa before the exam.

151
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,445
Most important thing to remember in the
ER is if you don't get it, just fake it.

152
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,378
Not enough time to
ask all the questions...

153
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,917
and patients don't wanna
see you scratching your head.

154
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,555
So in the meantime, can you
go get me some Nitrazine paper?

155
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,021
Come on. Go, go.

156
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,396
Excuse me. Dr. Barnett wanted
me to get some Nitrazine paper.

157
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,691
- But I don't know what it is.
- You didn't ask?

158
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,527
He said if I didn't
know something...

159
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,297
Listen, number one rule of the ER
is if you don't know something, ask.

160
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:29,068
Okay? You're not gonna learn this stuff
by yourself and that's why we're here.

161
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,642
What do I do with the...?

162
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,541
Dr. Rasgotra, can you tell me
how to use a Nitrazine paper?

163
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,444
Not until I finish suturing
a very fidgety 6-year-old.

164
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,211
You're an intern now. If
you don't know something...

165
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,617
- I know, fake it.
- What? No, of course not.

166
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,950
- I already asked...
- Look things up yourself.

167
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,094
When someone gives you the
answer, you forget five minutes later.

168
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,660
Read it and it sticks.

169
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,922
Your primary responsibility,
educate yourself.

170
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,929
No one else is
gonna do it for you.

171
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,658
Thank you.

172
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,106
- How's it going?
- Fine.

173
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,465
Great.

174
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,305
- Do you have any questions?
- No.

175
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,450
Terrific. Uh...

176
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,280
- Anything to present?
- I'll let you know.

177
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,285
Okay. Can I make a suggestion?

178
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:21,485
Unless your patient has situs
inversus, her heart should be on the left.

179
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,755
- Just came back from the girl in 4?
- Yeah.

180
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,092
Looks like she's gonna
need amphotericin B.

181
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,634
- Your intern picked up histoplasmosis?
- Yeah. He just doesn't know it yet.

182
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,431
How's he doing?

183
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,164
- I don't think he likes me.
- Everybody likes you.

184
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,174
Not this guy. He's acting like
I killed his dog or something.

185
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,606
Probably he's just nervous.

186
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,338
I don't think I'll be real
great at teaching the interns.

187
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,540
Yes, you will. You did
a great job with Jake.

188
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,810
- Too bad he didn't match here.
- Yeah, too bad.

189
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,147
Dr. Pratt, can you
get on the MICN.

190
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,722
Paramedics need you to
pronounce a GSW in the field.

191
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,290
Sure.

192
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,132
Abby! Got one.

193
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,029
Munson, we're up!

194
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,059
Unidentified kid.
Looks about 10.

195
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,501
Found down at the food
court at City Center Mall.

196
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,005
- Munson!
- Still hypotensive after 500 cc's.

197
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,201
- Mental status waxing and waning.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

198
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,141
Can you tell me your name?

199
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,078
- He alone?
- His buddies split when we got there.

200
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,081
- Sats only 92.
- What's your plan?

201
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,686
- CBC. Chem-7. Tox screen?
- And?

202
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,815
- Head CT?
- And?

203
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,351
- Try to find next of kin?
- ABG. LFT's.

204
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,222
Oxygen. Normal saline,
activated charcoal. Let's go.

205
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,954
Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.
- I know.

206
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,465
Okay, 57. I concur.
We can pronounce.

207
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,864
What's the status on number two?

208
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,573
All right, sounds good. We'll
be waiting for you. County clear.

209
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,004
- Dr. Pratt.
- Yeah?

210
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,372
Guy out there says he knows you.

211
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,010
- Which guy?
- Sitting next to the old lady.

212
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,188
He a friend of yours?

213
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,991
- Not really.
- So you want me to bring him in or no?

214
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,093
No. He can wait.

215
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,265
This is Dr. Pratt.

216
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,428
I need this Trauma
Room in a couple minutes.

217
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,834
How are we doing in here?

218
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,171
I don't know about you,
but I'm having contractions.

219
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,609
Nitrazine is positive. Which
means your water did break.

220
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,045
- Follow it caudad.
- Okay.

221
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,280
Is everything okay?

222
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,655
Looks like a
breech presentation.

223
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,719
Dr. Barnett, can I get
your advice on something?

224
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,794
This doesn't feel any different
from my last pregnancy.

225
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,920
The baby's been active.

226
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,465
You're doing good, Claire. The
baby's heart rate is right on target.

227
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,638
Dr. Pratt, could you come
and take look at this, please?

228
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,803
Doctor Pratt.

229
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,973
What is it?

230
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,946
It looks like you've
delivered the feet.

231
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:55,944
But that's okay, right?

232
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,947
I have a friend who delivered
breech and her baby was okay.

233
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,278
Page OB and get them
down here right now.

234
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,157
Don't worry. I'll take good
care of you and your baby.

235
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,759
Dr. Kovac, this
is Toni Stillman.

236
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,828
She's here to check on Claire's
condition. The pregnant MVA.

237
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,760
Somebody said she
was in a car accident.

238
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,764
- Yeah, but she was uninjured.
- Thank God. What about the baby?

239
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,267
- A family friend?
- She's our gestational surrogate.

240
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,871
She's lived with my husband,
Rod, and me for six weeks.

241
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,008
- She's having your child.
- Yes, we had IVF.

242
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,111
She was implanted with our embryo.
So is our baby gonna be okay?

243
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,737
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
Not without Claire's consent.

244
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,574
- She is carrying my baby.
- Sorry, I need the patient's consent.

245
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,621
- We're best friends. She'll see me.
- Sam. This is Toni Stillman.

246
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,884
- She's a friend of Claire's.
- Right. I spoke with you on the phone.

247
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,187
I'm Sam. Come on in.
She's been asking for you.

248
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,298
- Sam, how's she doing?
- Pretty good.

249
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,126
- Uh...
- When I get a chance, okay?

250
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,131
I was so worried about you.

251
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,205
- I'm fine.
- But you shouldn't be driving.

252
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,810
- I can take you anywhere you need to go.
- It was just a tiny fender-bender.

253
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,139
- Sam, you have activated charcoal here?
- Yeah. Bottom shelf.

254
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,193
- There's a guy in the waiting room...
- Yeah. I know him. Thanks, Malik.

255
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,883
Claire? Claire, are you okay?

256
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,714
- What's happening?
- Another contraction?

257
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,321
- What is...? She's in labor?
- Yup.

258
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,549
But are you gonna stop it? Because
she's not due for another week.

259
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,320
But she's 39 weeks. Junior's
ready to make an appearance.

260
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,997
- His feet are already popping out.
- Feet? He's breech?

261
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,998
- You'll do a C-section?
- We're waiting an OB to weigh in.

262
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,691
GSW's two minutes
out, Dr. Pratt.

263
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,304
Come find me when they
get here. You, you're with me.

264
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,837
Go ahead. I got it.

265
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,505
- Have you been in a GSW Trauma before?
- I grew up in the Bronx.

266
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,613
- Dr. Pratt, can we present? PRATT:
Not now. I got a trauma rolling in.

267
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,578
Okay. What's next?

268
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,479
Exam 3. Possible talar fracture.

269
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,882
I should warn you she
already took my head off...

270
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,215
for how long she's had to wait.

271
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,923
Oh, God. Can this
day get any worse?

272
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,460
This is Drew Filmore.

273
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,530
We've met.

274
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:59,035
- Greg.
- You figured me out, huh?

275
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,333
Five minutes after you
left, I knew it was you.

276
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,873
I can't talk to you right now.

277
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,670
- Looks like you're busy.
- I am.

278
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,170
What do you want?

279
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,414
I don't know.

280
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,345
What were you looking for
when you came to find me?

281
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,483
I guess I just had
to see for myself.

282
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,250
And now I have.

283
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,991
- So how do we do this?
- We don't. I'm sorry I bothered you.

284
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,761
I had no idea you
were in Chicago.

285
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,929
- I heard you were still in Detroit.
- I'm not in Detroit no more.

286
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,938
I can imagine what
you think about me.

287
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,838
There's a lot of things that you
probably need me to explain.

288
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,205
No.

289
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,610
I don't need anything
from you. I never have.

290
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,047
I made a mistake going to see
you that night, so forget I came by.

291
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,413
Don't come back anymore.

292
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,750
Hold on. I can understand you're
mad, but I can accept some of that.

293
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,084
- Some of it?
- Hey.

294
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,592
You have a half-brother and
sister and they are your family too.

295
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,230
Now family's important to you.

296
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,231
Single GSW left chest
during a carjacking.

297
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,234
Jocelyn's at U of I. Chaz
is a senior at South Geary.

298
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,872
BP 100, systolic. Decreased
breath sounds on the left.

299
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:10,100
He'll probably get a scholarship from
Loyola if he wins at the swim meet.

300
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,040
Entry wound left
parasternal. No exit.

301
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,840
I need intubation tray, 32
French. Let's notify the O.R.

302
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,506
I'm sorry I walked away.

303
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,209
Don't make the
same mistake I made.

304
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,416
CT's good. No
blood, no mass effect.

305
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,354
- Barbecue's ready.
- What?

306
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,222
Charcoal's in.

307
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,862
Resps down to 14.

308
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,294
Shallow but clear.
Another 0.5 of Narcan.

309
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:37,028
I'm sorry, can you repeat
that? Is that 140 or 114?

310
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,398
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

311
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,302
If you do that, we'll have
to restrain you, okay?

312
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,942
Malik, give him two of Ativan.

313
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,402
Wait a minute. Are you sure?

314
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,309
I thought benzos could
cloud the neurological picture.

315
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,279
Yeah. Fine.

316
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,782
Soft restraints then.

317
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,045
- Narcan's in.
- Come on. Talk to us, doctor.

318
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,222
- White count is 12.3...
- You guys still in here?

319
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,950
I got a GSW to the chest. I
need you out of here now.

320
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,392
- This kid's ready to go to PICU.
- He's not. He's getting worse.

321
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,658
Head CT's fine, labs, normal.
From ER standpoint, workup's done.

322
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,995
Could have encephalitis.
We should tap him.

323
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,728
- They can do it upstairs.
- Sounds good to me. Let's go.

324
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,100
Put him in sutures till I
can get PICU. Come on.

325
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,573
- Need a hand?
- Not yet. I'll let you know.

326
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,309
- Did I do something wrong in there?
- No.

327
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,078
Am I not handling
this patient correctly?

328
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,720
Nope.

329
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,090
Are you okay?

330
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,058
Sam's moving out.

331
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,592
Oh.

332
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,427
Why?

333
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,033
I've got a feeling it's a
communication problem.

334
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,963
Well, if you're not
sure, it probably is.

335
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,606
Sorry.

336
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,436
- If you wanna talk about it...
- No.

337
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,842
And if I wanted to talk about it,
Sam probably wouldn't be moving out.

338
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,886
Thanks, Luka.

339
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,514
I always thought it was my fault that
things didn't work out between us...

340
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,659
but now I know it was you.

341
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,389
Hey. No problem.

342
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,567
She's gonna need a C-section.

343
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,638
Oh, I don't want surgery.
My friend Julia had a breech.

344
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,299
- Probably a frank breech, which is butt...
- You've got a footling breech.

345
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,003
If your cervix doesn't dilate
enough, the head can get stuck.

346
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,341
Umbilical cord will compress
with each contraction...

347
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,983
jeopardizing the oxygen supply.

348
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,310
- You need to do what's best for the baby.
- What happens if I don't have surgery?

349
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,083
We allow the baby to be
delivered up to the umbilicus...

350
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,919
to give the cervix
time to dilate.

351
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,425
Then use maneuvers to
deliver head and shoulders.

352
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,188
Then let's do that.

353
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,830
That's not a good idea.

354
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,662
Right, with a footling breech, there's a
25 percent chance of major complications.

355
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,929
It's less than 2 percent
with a C-section.

356
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,699
That's a 75 percent chance
that the baby will be born...

357
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,536
without any problems.

358
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,806
Okay. We can wait
while the labor proceeds.

359
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,849
But if the baby's heart rate gets too
low, you may still need a C-section.

360
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,310
I don't want surgery.

361
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:12,381
I'll send somebody down as
soon as we have a room ready.

362
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,287
Can you please find Toni for me?

363
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,957
You know what? I'll get her.

364
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,630
Dr. Coburn, are you really
not gonna consent for surgery?

365
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,236
I can't do it against her will.

366
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,873
What if the baby's in trouble
midway through labor?

367
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,134
- I still can't do it.
- Are you kidding me?

368
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:33,211
What about the intended
parents? This is Toni's baby, isn't it?

369
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,042
She's the genetic mother
and the intended mother...

370
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,617
but it's still Claire's body, and
she has the right to refuse surgery.

371
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,662
- Abby! PICU on line three.
- What?

372
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,302
What's the status on that
kid brought in from the mall?

373
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,962
I'm hoping this is the
PICU calling for him. Why?

374
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,870
- His buddies are asking about him.
- Don't let them leave.

375
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,637
Yeah, this is
Abby... Dr. Lockhart.

376
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,571
Okay. Great. We'll send
him right up. Thanks.

377
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,413
- Is he okay?
- No.

378
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,519
He's not okay.

379
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,984
Did he take something?

380
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,555
You guys, you need to tell
me if he took something, okay?

381
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,195
- I gotta go.
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Chuny!

382
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,797
Wait a minute. Not so
fast. Hold up. Hold it.

383
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,695
- Hold on. Let me grab him.
- Let me go.

384
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,199
Settle down, here. Sit down.

385
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,267
Your friend is very
sick. What's his name?

386
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,535
Liam.

387
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,480
- And what did he take?
- Nothing.

388
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,445
- No drugs?
- No.

389
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,211
Then why did you run away
when the paramedics showed up?

390
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,049
- We were skipping school.
- Has Liam been sick?

391
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,487
He hasn't been in school much.
- Why not?

392
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,685
His parents are getting divorced
and he has to go back and forth.

393
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,853
That's why we ditched,
so we could hang out.

394
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,125
Does he have any
medical disorders?

395
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,632
- Like what?
- Anything.

396
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,263
His family are vegetarians.

397
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,007
- Was he acting different today?
- Not really.

398
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,478
He was kind of bummed maybe.

399
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,116
He ate two jumbo cheeseburgers.

400
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,845
- I thought he was a vegetarian.
- Abby! He's getting worse.

401
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,587
- What's this?
- Kid's backpack. Find out what's in it.

402
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,949
- What's going on? MALIK:
He seems pretty unresponsive.

403
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,372
Okay, check his gag reflex.

404
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,256
Liam? Liam?

405
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,828
Hold it. Liam?

406
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,763
- You gotta wake up, big guy, okay?
- He moved his hand a little bit.

407
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,903
- Barely has a gag. ABBY:
All right. This way. Okay.

408
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,504
You know the VITAMIN mnemonic?

409
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,607
- Vitamins?
- Yes, for altered mental status.

410
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,675
V is vascular. Strokes or clots.

411
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,277
We ruled that out with CT.

412
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,606
I is for...?

413
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,579
Infection. What, this
game's only for interns?

414
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,616
Infection. No pneumonia.

415
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,777
Normal white
count. Urine's clean.

416
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,752
- We're waiting on the cultures. T?
- Trauma.

417
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,951
Toxins. Utox is negative, doesn't mean
he didn't take something we can't test for.

418
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,996
- What am I looking for?
- I don't know. Drugs. Meds.

419
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,962
- Wait.
- What?

420
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,728
It's M. Sorry. Sorry.

421
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:14,533
M. The M in "VITAMIN"
stands for metabolic.

422
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:19,372
This kid could have a metabolic disease
that keeps him on a restricted diet.

423
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:22,014
- What diet?
- His buddy...

424
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,746
told me that he
was a vegetarian.

425
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,683
- What buddy?
- Then today, he had two cheeseburgers.

426
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,850
- I'm lost.
- We need to get this guy upstairs, Abby.

427
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,459
No, what we need is an
ammonia level. Go get some ice.

428
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,823
Ammonia has to go
to the lab cold. Run.

429
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:41,032
- That's my frappuccino.
- They could do this upstairs, Abby.

430
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:45,295
Yeah. After they do their assessment,
review labs and repeat x-rays.

431
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:49,474
Meanwhile, his brain is being pickled
by whatever metabolite is going in there.

432
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,843
Okay. Get that to the lab. Go.

433
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,748
- Hang in there, Liam.
- Good signal. Fetal heart rate 158.

434
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,319
- Well, that's still good, right?
- For the time being.

435
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,321
But if your baby gets in trouble
and is deprived of oxygen...

436
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,719
every second counts.

437
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,325
But that's not happening.

438
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,724
Not yet. CLAIRE: Are
you trying to scare me?

439
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,792
No. I'm just trying to prepare
you for what might happen.

440
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:16,834
Listen, thousands of C-sections are
performed in this country every day.

441
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,197
It's a simple procedure.

442
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,568
I wanna have more kids of
my own one day. Naturally.

443
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,074
And lots of women go on to have
vaginal births after having Caesareans.

444
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,213
Excellent variability
of the FHR.

445
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,878
Could I consent, but
only as a last resort?

446
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,813
Only if the baby's
in serious danger?

447
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,113
Absolutely. Sam has a
consent form right here.

448
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,356
Okay, but only as a last resort.

449
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,122
You need to be made
aware of the risks.

450
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,222
- What sort of risks?
- Sam.

451
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,623
- Bleeding, infection, paralysis, stroke...
- Sam!

452
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,896
These are minimal risks.

453
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,832
Can I speak with
you outside, please?

454
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,404
- I don't want this.
- No, just...

455
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,905
Look, think about it, okay?

456
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,976
What is going on in there?

457
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,207
She needs to be aware of the risks.
That's why it's called informed consent.

458
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,503
- You made it sound like Frankenstein's...
- You made it sound like a pedicure.

459
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,289
It's not your job to
explain the proced...

460
00:23:09,313 --> 00:23:10,313
No, that's your job.

461
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,756
Look out!

462
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,916
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

463
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,425
- Jeez. PRATT: How are
we on the packed cells?

464
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,030
Units five and six, infusing.
- What about Kovac?

465
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,860
- No, I got this.
- Okay. What can I do?

466
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,730
Nothing. Internal paddles
again, charge to 30.

467
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,202
You're shocking asystole?
- It's fine V-fib.

468
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,273
- Clear.
- How long has she been down?

469
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,080
Resuming compressions. - Greg.

470
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,762
Hang another unit,
charge the paddles.

471
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,089
Shouldn't we save the blood
for someone who's got a chance?

472
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,514
- Probable great vessel injury.
- She's down too long.

473
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,844
What, now that you're
residents, you're experts?

474
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,049
If we restore her
volume, we'll be able...

475
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:42,147
It's time to call it.

476
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,092
Call it. SACKOWITZ: Me?

477
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,592
Call it.

478
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,392
Death at 1440.

479
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,462
What's the survival
rate in patients...

480
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,165
who reach this hospital alive
after penetrating chest trauma?

481
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,979
When you two can answer that,
you can start second-guessing me.

482
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,246
You wanna do something,
notify her next of kin.

483
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,345
Abby, sats are down to 76.

484
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,720
Can't get a good seal. He needs a
tube. Get me a miller tube and a 65.

485
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:23,225
- What? What's wrong?
- What's going on?

486
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,559
- Hypoventilating at a rate of six.
- Is this the mall kid?

487
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,994
- I told you to send him to PICU hours ago.
- Suction.

488
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,968
- Abby.
- I wanna check one more thing.

489
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,165
Great, so you kept him down here
just long enough for him to crash.

490
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,945
Tube. I got some history
that suggested further workup.

491
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:43,708
- You should give it to the team upstairs.
- I'm in.

492
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:53,052
- Good chest rise. ABBY:
Equal breath sounds.

493
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,558
Ammonia's back.
Two-fourteen. You were right.

494
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,259
The kid has a metabolic
disorder, some protein intolerance.

495
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,629
Okay. Run to the pharmacy, see if
the sodium phenylbutyrate is ready.

496
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,770
- Sodium what?
- It's a nitrogen scavenger.

497
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,406
It'll help bring down ammonia,
reverse encephalopathy.

498
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:08,802
Got it.

499
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,007
The kid's family are
strict vegetarians.

500
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,577
His friends told me today
he had two cheeseburgers...

501
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,408
because he was depressed.

502
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,682
Because his parents
are getting a divorce.

503
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,252
So it was probably some
sort of fast-food rebellion.

504
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,753
Only he can't handle protein.

505
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,415
- Any family members to confirm this?
- Chuny's still trying to track them down.

506
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,789
Can you switch him to
D10 half at 150 an hour?

507
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,260
You got it. MARQUEZ: Luka?

508
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,264
- We got a hot MI on its way in.
- Be right there.

509
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,629
So lower the ammonia...

510
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,966
get him out of his catabolic
tailspin, he'll wake up, right?

511
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,801
Nice pick-up.

512
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,877
Lockhart comes up big.

513
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,222
You call that a jump shot?

514
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,453
Hey, Luka.

515
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,791
- I hear your mom's looking at apartments.
- Yeah.

516
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,954
Who knows? Might be even
close enough to walk to my place.

517
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,025
It's not. It's only a
few blocks from here.

518
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,133
Oh.

519
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,104
You know it's not my idea.

520
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,805
Back to work.

521
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,475
We'll still go camping
again on your birthday.

522
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,877
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

523
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,653
- Dr. Rasgoata?
- Rasgotra.

524
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,820
- Rasgotra.
- Neela's fine.

525
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,558
Filmore's freaking out about how long
she's waited to have her ankle splinted.

526
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,668
Maybe you could
help with this one.

527
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,006
How are we doing, Drew?

528
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,142
I've been here for six hours.

529
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,674
Is there anybody here who
knows what the hell they're doing?

530
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,577
- Yes.
- Then what the hell are you waiting for?

531
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,582
I've got a national sales
conference I'm supposed to be at.

532
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,014
I'm sorry you had to wait.

533
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:04,588
Sometimes we lose track of time
when we're trying to save people's lives.

534
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,154
Is that sarcasm?

535
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,125
Because I don't need
that. I'm a customer here.

536
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,026
If I'm not happy with the
service or the way I'm treated...

537
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,191
I will go to your supervisors.

538
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:17,965
We have a contract.

539
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,766
- I didn't agree to surgery.
- You agreed to consent...

540
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,205
to all medically necessary procedures
associated with the pregnancy.

541
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,607
- What's going on?
- This is my husband, Rod.

542
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,371
- Are you the OB?
- No. ER.

543
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,642
She needs a C-section and I have
a legal document permitting to do so.

544
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,786
Can we go out to discuss this?

545
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,047
If you don't do this it's a breech
of contract, you won't get paid.

546
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,623
Look, I just wanna
have the baby naturally!

547
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,919
I'll get a court order forcing
her to get a C-section.

548
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,814
- I don't think you can do that.
- Watch me.

549
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,296
She's endangering
our unborn child.

550
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:48,957
I'm doing everything I can to convince her
to get the surgery, but I can't force her.

551
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,796
She's carrying our baby.

552
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,734
We've been trying to
have kids for five years.

553
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:57,934
We spent a fortune on three tries
at IVF, and every time I miscarried.

554
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,306
We gave the last of
my embryos to Claire.

555
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,677
I'm sorry, but we can't do it like
this. Let me go talk to her again.

556
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,750
Fine. I'm still
getting a court order.

557
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:08,080
Ray, she had a late decel.
- How low?

558
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,653
- Hundred and eight.
- That means?

559
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,312
- Get an OB.
- What's happening?

560
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,824
- You guys need to wait outside now.
- We're taking her to Labor and Delivery.

561
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,757
- How are we doing?
- Are you moving me?

562
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,124
Yup, we're going upstairs.

563
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,857
- Inez, go hold an elevator.
- Okay.

564
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,902
Baby's heart rate dropped
in the last contraction...

565
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,266
which could mean a
sign of cord compression.

566
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,634
The baby could be in trouble.

567
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,003
- What's the heart rate now?
- One-twelve.

568
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,008
But that's still
okay though, right?

569
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,340
- Claire?
- We're doing okay.

570
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,846
Fifteen liters by mask.

571
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,778
You need to have a
C-section, Claire. You know that.

572
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,115
You have to trust me.
I know my own body.

573
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,847
We wanna go with her. - No!

574
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,958
We wanna be there
when our baby is born.

575
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,856
No! I don't want
them to be there.

576
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:55,962
Dr. Pratt, this is Karen
Simms. You treated her mother.

577
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,693
- GSW.
- Oh.

578
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,838
Right. Thanks, Chuny.

579
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,697
No one will tell me what
happened. I mean, what's GSW?

580
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,173
Is that gastro
something? Is she okay?

581
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,575
- Would you like to sit down?
- I...

582
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:12,376
Okay. GSW stands
for gunshot wound.

583
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,147
Your mother was shot
during a robbery attempt.

584
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,649
She was shot?

585
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,882
Yes.

586
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,425
We gave her blood
transfusions, emergency surgery...

587
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,660
Everything we could to save her.

588
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,162
She's dead?

589
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:33,668
I'm afraid that her injuries
were too severe. I'm very sorry.

590
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,370
How did you find me?

591
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,939
We found your name
in her address book.

592
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,641
Did she say anything?

593
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:45,082
Well, she talked a little
when she was brought in...

594
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,185
but she'd lost a lot of blood...

595
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,117
and lost consciousness as
we were trying to save her.

596
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,388
Would you like to see her?

597
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,188
Too late.

598
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,194
We haven't spoken
in a long time.

599
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,130
We had a falling
out a while back.

600
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,771
We were both waiting for
the other one to give in...

601
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,271
and admit they were wrong.

602
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,141
I guess I win.

603
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,047
I need to push.

604
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,450
No, not yet. Just breathe,
you're doing great.

605
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,557
FHR's 120. Where's Pedes?
- On their way.

606
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,716
Oh, God, it wasn't
this hard the first time.

607
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,987
- Take a rest.
- Umbilicus past the perineum?

608
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,557
Yep. Good news, Claire.
The baby's hips are out.

609
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,563
- You get to push next time.
- Oh, yeah.

610
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,430
Okay. I told you
I could do this.

611
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,434
Sterile towel.

612
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,969
Some gentle traction can
help us get to the axilla.

613
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,168
Okay. Baby's heart
rate's below a hundred.

614
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,904
Ninety-seven, 90, 85...

615
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,414
We need to put on 100
percent 0.02 non-rebreather.

616
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,348
- What's wrong? He okay? RAY:
Baby's heart rate's dangerously low.

617
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,421
The umbilical cord compressed,
he's not getting enough oxygen.

618
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,024
- Sixty-eight.
- It should rebound between contractions.

619
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,627
- But we can still do a Caesarean, Claire.
- No.

620
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,320
We can push him back in,
in two minutes, start surgery.

621
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,466
- He's almost out.
- But we don't know that.

622
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,123
His head could be entrapped.

623
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,165
Okay. This is it.
Big push, Claire.

624
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,171
Between two and five minutes of
low oxygen could be the difference...

625
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,172
between a normal and
a brain-damaged baby.

626
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,776
Consent to the C-section.

627
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:25,346
- I'm trying. I'm really trying.
- Yeah, okay. The head is stuck.

628
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,281
We need to pull
him out with forceps.

629
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,546
Okay. Sling a towel
under his body.

630
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,784
- Hold him up, here. NURSE:
Forty-eight on the monitor.

631
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,551
Open the intubation tray.

632
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,955
Okay, Claire. Once more.

633
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,495
One big push.

634
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,963
Pretty cyanotic.

635
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,170
Clamps and scissors.

636
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,472
Okay, come on, baby,
just give us one little cry.

637
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,310
He needs a little stimulation.

638
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,983
No respiratory effort. Bag him.

639
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,383
No femoral. Starting
compressions.

640
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,693
Three and a half uncuffed.

641
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:13,324
Can you please tell Rod
and Toni that he's out?

642
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,892
I'm in.

643
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,004
Epi 0.04 by ET.

644
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,035
How is he?

645
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,541
He doesn't have a pulse
and he's not breathing.

646
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,841
- So, what does that tell you?
- Okay. That's it. You're out of here.

647
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,756
I thought I could do it.

648
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,245
<i>Swimmers, on your board.</i>

649
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,448
Chaz! Let's do this!

650
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,651
<i>Set.</i>

651
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:42,415
- Have you been in to see the baby?
- They're still doing tests on him.

652
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,919
It's been over an hour.

653
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,758
It was a hard delivery.

654
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,129
What aren't they telling us?

655
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,102
Your son was deprived
of oxygen during the birth.

656
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:05,675
But he's gonna be all right.

657
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,813
We'll know more in a few days.

658
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,775
There's a good chance that
he suffered neurologic damage.

659
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,153
Well, did he or didn't he?

660
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,020
I think that he probably did.

661
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,704
Come on, let's go.

662
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,168
- Go where?
- Home.

663
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,004
But what about our son?
I'm not gonna leave him.

664
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,669
Pediatrician will see you,
he'll have more answers.

665
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,974
You already gave us the answer.

666
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,880
We didn't pay to have
a brain-dead baby.

667
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,652
He is not brain-dead.

668
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,516
- Rod.
- He's not normal.

669
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:54,558
Which he would have been
if you had done the C-section.

670
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:14,539
We were gonna call him
David after Rod's father.

671
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,342
Toni, you still can.

672
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,847
Let's go.

673
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,933
Hey, Liam, how you feeling?

674
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:37,364
Cruddy.

675
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:40,767
Your parents are on their way.
They were very worried about you.

676
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,305
Good.

677
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,543
I'll send them to the PICU
as soon as they get here.

678
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,941
You'll like it up there.
They have video games.

679
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,882
My friend thinks you're a MILF.

680
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,608
Shut up.

681
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,977
- Excuse me?
- It's a Mother-I'd-Like-to...

682
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,453
Oh. Well, I'm not a mother.

683
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,887
I'm a doctor.

684
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,592
Guess that makes you a DILF.

685
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,730
Okay. See you later, Liam.

686
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:09,193
Stay on your diet and wear
your medic alert bracelet.

687
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,811
Am I supposed to
pretend I didn't see that?

688
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,913
See what?

689
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,806
Okay.

690
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,109
Well, come on. I don't hear from
him, he sends the ER a postcard.

691
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,416
You practically chased
him out of town with a torch.

692
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,149
Where's Pratt? ABBY: He left.

693
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,260
Must be nice working
banker's hours.

694
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:42,757
No. This is incomplete. You didn't
document the distal neuro-vascular exam.

695
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,102
Let me see. Ten
millimeter kidney stone.

696
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,772
No. Urology needs to see
this guy prior to discharge.

697
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,809
This looks good.

698
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,744
- Write the CBC and Chem-20 results.
- Lab slips are on the back of the chart.

699
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,180
Not good enough. Transcribe
them to your H and P.

700
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:02,784
- Since when?
- There's a new sheriff in town, ladies.

701
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,390
All right. Let's see if you can do
better than one-for-four, Lockhart.

702
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,961
- You need me to sign off on some charts?
- No.

703
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,529
- You said you had stuff for me to sign...
- That was Neela.

704
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,699
Aren't those your charts?

705
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,500
Could somebody show me
how to do a filiform and follower?

706
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,834
- Where's Ray?
- Still at Labor and Delivery.

707
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,639
Probably stayed upstairs
to hit on the OB nurses.

708
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,509
Come on. I'll show
you how to do it.

709
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,566
How's his muscle tone?

710
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,829
Well, it's not too good.

711
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,041
Is he over-breathing the vent?

712
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,443
No.

713
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,376
Hypoxic brain injury.

714
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,515
The chance for complete
neurological recovery is slim.

715
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,355
Has his mother
been in to see him?

716
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,960
No.

717
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,838
Claire doesn't
consider him her child.

718
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:34,072
And the Stillmans don't
want a ventilator baby.

719
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,376
There's nothing else
you can do for him.

720
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,856
Little guy's had a rough day.

721
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:54,931
And I don't think he should
spend his first night all alone.

722
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,656
Hey, Chaz.

723
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,491
Yeah, talk to you guys later.

724
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,922
- Bye.
- All right.

725
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,323
Bye, Chaz.

726
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,760
Congratulations, man.
You swam a good race.

727
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,432
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

728
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,597
I'm Greg.

729
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:37,307
Yeah, I remember you. You
came to the house a few weeks ago.

730
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah.

731
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,439
So did your dad say
anything about me?

732
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:44,109
No.

733
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,112
He didn't?

734
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,947
No. But he's here with my
mom and my sister. If you want...

735
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,453
No. No. That's cool. I...

736
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,150
Actually, I just wanted
to introduce myself to you.

737
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,233
Your father and my mother...

738
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,703
I'm your half-brother.

739
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:12,342
- Get out of here.
- No, it's true.

740
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,441
I'm just surprised your
dad didn't mention it to you.

741
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,313
I've heard family
rumors and stuff, but...

742
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,819
Wow, this is trippy.

743
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,160
Good to meet you, man.

744
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,032
You too.

745
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,197
Come on, Chaz. I'm starving.

746
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,206
Hey.

747
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,105
Hey.

748
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,680
So you two met.

749
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,015
Yeah.

750
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,022
Good.

751
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,292
Yeah. That's good.

752
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,886
We're gonna get a bite
to eat. You wanna join us?

753
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,362
No, not tonight. I just...

754
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,592
Wanted to introduce
myself to Chaz. You know.

755
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,702
Yeah, I'm glad you did too.

756
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,360
Yeah.

757
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,570
- Well, I gotta go.
- Wait, Greg.

758
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,110
Whatever you guys
wanna eat is fine with me.

759
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,010
This is my wife, Evelyn.

760
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,549
My daughter, Jocelyn.

761
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,048
This is Greg.

762
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,020
My son.

763
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,233
Nice to meet you, Greg.

764
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,629
Likewise.

765
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,828
Come join us.

766
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:49,297
I can't. I gotta get
back to the hospital.

767
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,274
Maybe another time. It
was nice meeting all of you.

768
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,440
It was nice meeting
you, too, Greg.

769
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,411
- Bye.
- Come on, Chaz.

770
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:59,414
Yeah, hold up.

771
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,424
You know this is hard.

772
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,287
For all of us.

773
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,125
So come on, man.

774
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,266
Give it a chance.

775
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,765
This is your family.

776
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,764
No, this is your family.

777
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,715
Sam?

778
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,291
Alex?
