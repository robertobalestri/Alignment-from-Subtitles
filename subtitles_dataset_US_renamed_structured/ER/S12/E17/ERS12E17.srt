1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,101
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,764
Anything for my roomie.

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:08,965
Congratulations.

4
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:10,911
- Thank you. It was
supposed to be a secret.

5
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:14,071
Everybody was saying you were
getting puffy. I had to defend you.

6
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,479
It's a part-time job.
Flexible hours. Good pay.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,109
You and Alex would be more than
welcome to come live with me. Move in.

8
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:24,486
You'll need to undergo an, uh, evaluation
by the Impaired Physician Committee.

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,956
You're serious.

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,118
- Yeah, well, I don't need that, okay?
- I do.

11
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,379
Oh! Don't shoot.

12
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,521
Sorry, did I wake you?

13
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,816
I, uh, couldn't find my laser
pointer, I had to root around a bit.

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,960
Yes, I ate all your cereal at 4 a.m.,
and, no, there's no milk left either.

15
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,620
- I'm a terrible roommate.
- It's gonna be fine.

16
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,164
I've known about this
conference for two months...

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,929
so the fact that I'm this unprepared
two hours before is quite unsettling.

18
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,471
You don't wanna over-rehearse your talk.
You should just wing it, keep it fresh.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,132
Wing it? This isn't
open-mike night, you know.

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,178
- Crap! You know, I blame this on you.
- Me?

21
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,838
If you hadn't made me watch
every horror film from the 1970s...

22
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,608
I might've gotten
some work done.

23
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,878
Not every horror film,
just the devil ones.

24
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,989
- You're a bad influence.
- Oh, thank you.

25
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,818
Hey, come here.
You got a little...

26
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,015
On your...

27
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,752
You know, I haven't pulled
an all-nighter since... Ever.

28
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,194
- I've never pulled an all-nighter.
- It's good for a person now and then.

29
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,925
Not for me. I'm used to being
in control of these situations.

30
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,697
- What situations?
- I'm usually so organized.

31
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:52,404
Uh, Dubenko's
gonna kill me if I'm late.

32
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,375
Well, um, don't worry
about the cereal.

33
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,222
Okay, it's not about
God, it's about tradition.

34
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,188
Religious tradition.

35
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,260
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

36
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,896
If you're religious,
but I'm not religious.

37
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:14,296
- Okay. You ever been to a baptism?
- Yes, I have. I thought it was weird.

38
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,959
- Weird?
- Yes.

39
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,799
The ritualized, spiritual purification
of a baby kind of freaks me out.

40
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,033
You thought that was
bad, you should see a bris.

41
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,643
- Hey, Rodney.
- Hey, you.

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,370
And you, I heard the
good news, congratulations.

43
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,878
Thank you. Two coffees, please.

44
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:31,246
- You want decaf, right?
- No. Regular, black.

45
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,446
Look, I was baptized, so were my
brothers, my cousins, my parents.

46
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,954
Baptism's what we do in Croatia.

47
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:40,288
But it's an initiation into a
club I don't wanna belong to.

48
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,361
- It would mean a lot to my father.
- Thank you.

49
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,088
Thanks.

50
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:48,860
There's no evidence that a moderate
amount of caffeine will harm the baby.

51
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,473
- American Academy of Obstetrics says...
- Please. Stop changing the subject.

52
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,575
Yet people feel the need to curtail
my caffeine intake. Why is that?

53
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,042
It's a little water, a prayer, and a
chance to make other people happy.

54
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,443
- I don't know. There's something so...
- What?

55
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,243
So <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> about it.

56
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,390
Victor Clemente.

57
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,099
All these people here
for drug testing too?

58
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,101
Oh, yeah, you can't tell me that.
Of course you can't tell me that.

59
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,938
- Midstream, in the cup.
- All right. Thanks.

60
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,945
Sample collection
has to be witnessed.

61
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:38,449
- I'm not trying to pull anything fancy.
- Sample collection has to be witnessed.

62
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,246
What are we, in fascist Germany?

63
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,089
All right, fine. Witness this.

64
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,696
It's okay, honey. You
know you wanna look.

65
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,846
I have a budget committee meeting
until 9:30, page me if we get a trauma.

66
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,115
What? Carter called?

67
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,192
Yeah, you were with an
epistaxis. I didn't wanna bother you.

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,261
It's a nosebleed. You
could've pulled me out.

69
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,260
He'll call back. Didn't
seem that important.

70
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,399
If you're not sure,
transfer calls back.

71
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,967
- I'll decide what's important.
- Oh, hey, Luka.

72
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,934
- Sign Kerry's card for me.
- How's she doing?

73
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,425
Good. A little stir-crazy,
she's starting rehab soon.

74
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,169
- I'm sending flowers from the department.
- Nice.

75
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,369
I need someone to
<i>parlez-vous</i> a little <i>Español.</i>

76
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,313
Inez is off, Marquez isn't in yet. Goiter
girl's been waiting for a translator.

77
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,746
Get Clemente.

78
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,887
- He's back?
- Yeah. Should be.

79
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,420
If he's not here in
10 minutes, call me.

80
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,217
Hey, I heard they sent
Clemente to Atlanta for diversion.

81
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,883
- Let's hope.
- He's on house arrest.

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,757
- They're letting him come to work?
- Special arrangement.

83
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,196
- It's his first day, he's already late.
- Ten bucks says he doesn't show.

84
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,767
Okay, pirate guy with
testicular pain, Ray.

85
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,633
Abby, you get fever-rash, I
will take dog bite to earlobe.

86
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,900
Wait. Switch that. No, you
take dog bite, I'll take the rash.

87
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,356
We wouldn't wanna risk our
baby getting a TORCH infection.

88
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,535
What?

89
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,681
- TORCH infection. Herpes...
- I know what it is.

90
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,216
- It wouldn't be good for our baby.
- Why do you keep calling it our baby?

91
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,148
I don't mean our
baby, like you and me.

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,916
I mean, like, our baby. All
right? Like an ER mascot.

93
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,226
- This baby isn't anyone's mascot.
- Come on, don't go away mad.

94
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,828
Good morning.

95
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,825
Bagels anybody?

96
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,830
- Hey, Dr. Clemente.
- Excuse me.

97
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,302
- Excuse me. Anybody?
- Come on. Let's clean the board.

98
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,205
Hello.

99
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,305
Um, I think I've just
committed suicide.

100
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,139
A little stick here.

101
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,681
A gun's certainly the most reliable
method, but it's against my politics.

102
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,115
Overdose just seemed
like the way to go.

103
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,216
Slow, tidy, not a lot of fuss.

104
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,119
I suppose I have to be
placed on a three-day hold now.

105
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,996
I don't get it. If you're trying
to die, why come in at all?

106
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,029
Who wants to die alone?

107
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,800
All right, Mr. Sadler.

108
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:51,069
Let me get you an acetaminophen
antidote and call a psychiatrist, okay?

109
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,179
That sounds great.

110
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,842
- Yikes.
- No kidding. Some real pathology there.

111
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,115
- He's so calm it's scary.
- Hmm. More like sociopathic.

112
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,931
You guys got one to present?
- We're good.

113
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,997
- Mucomyst, charcoal, waiting on a tox.
- I'll page Psych.

114
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,928
All right.

115
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,533
Twenty-one-year-old,
discovered near UIC.

116
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,729
- Multiple stab wounds neck and shoulder.
- Vitals?

117
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,978
Pulse, 97, resps, 32, sat, 93.

118
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:23,309
- I came to pick her
up, found her bleeding.

119
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,503
- Sam, what's open?
- Trauma 1.

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,945
Oh, well, well. If it
isn't the elusive Dr. K.

121
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,516
Vic, we'll have to catch up
later. Abby, come with us.

122
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,244
Hey, you're busy. Don't worry.

123
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,321
- Stay here and run the board.
- Got it.

124
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,151
- What happened?
- Knife wound, lacerated trachea.

125
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,056
Hi. I'm Dr. Lockhart. Can
you tell us your name?

126
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,755
Nimet. Please, I can't breathe.

127
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,059
Hang in there, we're
gonna take care of you.

128
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,134
- Frick.
- I'm here. Everything's gonna be okay.

129
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,569
Abby, you take the airway. Sam, get
another line. Ready? One, two, three.

130
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,402
I'm scared.

131
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,204
Don't try to talk. Just let
the doctors take care of you.

132
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,437
Sats only 84.

133
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,480
Zone three stab wounds with
clear tracheal penetration...

134
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,311
and an adjacent pulsatile mass.

135
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,508
The police are here.

136
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,313
- How's she doing?
- Not right now.

137
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,922
Stridor with what appears to
be an expanding hematoma.

138
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,490
- Haleh, can you stay?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,889
- You know her?
- Oh, she's my girlfriend.

140
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,586
- I need to take a statement.
- Now? Can't this wait?

141
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,392
Just tell them what you
can. It won't take long.

142
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,001
- She's hyperventilating.
- Pulse is taking a dive.

143
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,330
Nimet. SAM: Sats only 78.

144
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,564
- She was just talking.
- What do you guys want?

145
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,336
Okay, uh, 75 ET, mac
two, etomidate and sux.

146
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,502
No paralytics, could
be a tough intubation.

147
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,545
Are you trying to make it tougher?
- No.

148
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,012
If you can't get the tube...

149
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,811
it'll be hard to bag
through a lacerated trachea.

150
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,614
- I'll get the tube.
- Systolic's 81.

151
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,249
<i>Hey, baby, does
this look infected?</i>

152
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,917
Tote bag? NEELA: Uh, no.

153
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,859
That's a wrong
answer. You want this.

154
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:56,060
- Okay.
- Nineteen, twenty, twenty-two. Yeah.

155
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,432
Come demo the
LifeWind. Free trip to Miami.

156
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,200
Uh, no. Thank you.

157
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,971
Um, excuse me. Can I
get a nonfat latte, please.

158
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,614
Coming up.

159
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,512
- You familiar with the Violet 4000?
- Excuse me?

160
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,812
It's a new cataract emulsifier
for use in the operating room.

161
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,952
Foam?

162
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,888
Never mind.

163
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,120
- More cricoid.
- I'm pressing as hard as I can.

164
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,855
All right, towel roll. The
cords are too anterior.

165
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,228
Okay, let me get that.

166
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,232
Haleh, suction.

167
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,740
You want suction or
cricoid? I can't do both.

168
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,470
- Let me take a shot.
- No, that's all right. I'm in.

169
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,378
- I don't think you are.
- Oh, come on.

170
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,519
- Sat's only 72.
- Abby.

171
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,685
- Call Surgery, she needs a trach.
- Paged already.

172
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,181
- Page again. I almost got it.
- Heart rate's dropping.

173
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,986
Damn it.

174
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:56,155
- Where's the defibrillator?
- Counter.

175
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,992
- I got it. It's heavy.
- I got it. I'm already...

176
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,760
- Pulse, 23.
- Atropine, one mg now.

177
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,870
Starting compressions.

178
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,329
Hey, if you want me to jump in.
- I'm fine.

179
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:09,635
- You don't have to do that.
- Enough. I'm having a baby, get over it.

180
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,211
Let me do my job.
Amp of epi, right away.

181
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,382
Seen the Wood's lamp? These Morgellons
are supposed to be autofluorescent.

182
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,019
What? Are you speaking English?

183
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:24,681
My patient thinks some fiber-producing
bug's crawling on her. She brought some.

184
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:28,295
- It's lint.
- It's fibers produced by the Morgellons.

185
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,522
Delusional parasitism. DC her
home with a referral for counseling.

186
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,099
There might be therapeutic
benefit to looking at them.

187
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,236
Make her think I'm taking
her complaint seriously.

188
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,806
It's schmootz, okay? It's schmootz.
Spend time on patients that you can help.

189
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,944
What? Hey, guys. Guys, okay.

190
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,807
Okay, look, I know my time
off left you short-handed.

191
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,211
Hey, no worries.

192
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,648
Okay, I'm sensing, uh...

193
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,617
If there's anything you wanna
ask, you wanna get off your chest...

194
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,882
- It's all good, really. MARQUEZ:
Chest pain, need a doc.

195
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,821
Exam 3's open.

196
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,155
Holy crap, it's
like I'm in a vise.

197
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,162
- Vitals?
- Pulse, 92. BP, 110/65.

198
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,526
Five of MS, get him on O2.

199
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,419
- You forgot the 12-lead.
- Getting to that.

200
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,400
Aspirin, oxygen,
beta-blockers, morphine.

201
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,062
- It's cookbook.
- Did somebody say morphine? Unh!

202
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:17,540
- Call the cath lab.
- Yeah. This isn't our first MI.

203
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,821
- Any word from Surgery? SAM:
Trauma's still in with the liver lac.

204
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,714
What about
Cardiothoracic? Try them?

205
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,583
- They're doing a triple A.
- What, and that's all we have in-house?

206
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,817
Big surgical conference this week,
skeleton crews at all the hospitals.

207
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,087
- Here's your tube.
- Come on, Nimet.

208
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,992
Abby, your GI bleeder is
altered and the crit's down to nine.

209
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,897
Two units of O-neg, and tell GI
to scope him before he codes.

210
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,595
- Okay.
- This guy needs central access.

211
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,766
Go ahead. I mean, if you
want. We're okay here.

212
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,306
- Sats are coming up.
- Hold compressions.

213
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,177
- Back in sinus, 72.
- Is she gonna be all right?

214
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,219
This tube is helping
her breathe right now...

215
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,548
but she's gonna need
surgery on her airway.

216
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,557
- Have we tried Head and Neck Service?
- I'll give them a call.

217
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,991
- The girl's mom and brother are here.
- Oh, Nimet.

218
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,893
I'm Dr. Kovac.

219
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,570
What's he doing here?

220
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,569
- Hey, let's just be cool, all right?
- Get out.

221
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,379
Get the hell off of me! - Hey!

222
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:32,645
Settle down, guys. Settle
down, guys. Settle down. Hey.

223
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,921
How dare you come here?

224
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,653
You're not family. Stay
away from my sister.

225
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,592
Please, for Nimet's
sake. Show some respect.

226
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,134
How's your first day back going?

227
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,429
It was great. Well,
good. Really, really good.

228
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,469
- My day pretty much sucked.
- Yeah?

229
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,733
I pretty much lost it
in a code this morning.

230
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,308
Isn't it funny that one
minute your whole life...

231
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,241
everything is in order
and then wham...

232
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,644
split-second event and the whole
thing just starts to spin around?

233
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,841
I know exactly what
you're talking about...

234
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,147
People at work, I mean, they see
this sliver of what you're about...

235
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,187
and make it all
about that one thing.

236
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,518
I know. They jump to
all sorts of conclusions...

237
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,422
They don't know
what I'm going through.

238
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:18,190
They're making all these assumptions,
but they only see what they wanna see.

239
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:27,806
Why must men always resort to
violence to settle their differences?

240
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:33,106
My son idolizes his sister, but he's
never liked this boyfriend of hers.

241
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:41,281
Our surgical team is working on another
critical patient now, but Nimet is next.

242
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,653
- Trauma Room. MAN: <i>I'd
like to speak to Sam Taggart.</i>

243
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,224
This is she.

244
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,727
Yeah? Who's this?

245
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,990
Yeah, well, where the hell do you get
off calling me here? I'm working, idiot.

246
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,894
Uh, since when did we get personal
calls transferred back to the trauma rooms?

247
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm sorry, that might be
my fault. Is everything okay?

248
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,635
Yeah, nothing that winning
the lottery couldn't help.

249
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:10,045
Sorry about that. I'm going
to clean your son's cuts now.

250
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,048
Thank you.

251
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,020
Don't worry, <i>küçhük hanim.</i>

252
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,281
I won't leave until we
can walk out together.

253
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,523
Her name, Nimet,
it means blessing.

254
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,032
It's lovely.

255
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,767
Her father called her Madame
Curie, because when she was born...

256
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:38,037
she was looking at us so intensely,
like she was studying her parents.

257
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,147
We thought she might
grow up to be a scientist.

258
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,812
Is he coming in?

259
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,008
He died when Nimet was 5.

260
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,089
He was a reporter
for the newspaper.

261
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,782
Kidnapped and shot by
the Turkish Hezbollah...

262
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,986
while I was pregnant with Mahir.

263
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,630
I had to leave.

264
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,766
Had to raise my
children in a country...

265
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,699
where they wouldn't be
killed for speaking the truth.

266
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,369
I understand.

267
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,139
I only spoke a few words
of English when we arrived.

268
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,207
Had to work two jobs.

269
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,816
Well, I know how that is.

270
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,317
Trying to adjust. To fit in.

271
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,514
It was worth it. She thrived.

272
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,320
Earned a full
scholarship at UIC.

273
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,054
Journalism, like her father.

274
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,561
You've done well
by your children.

275
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,360
I've tried.

276
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,900
Neela.

277
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,208
"The utility of the seat belt sign
in predicting mediastinal injury.

278
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,748
Neela Rasgotra, M.D., 3
p.m., the Sunflower Room."

279
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,250
Sunflower Room. Sounds happy.

280
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,446
Ha, ha. Holds 200 people.
There's a lot of interest in your talk.

281
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,090
Lucien, hello.

282
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,249
Tim, hi. Nice to see
you. How are you doing?

283
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,328
I'd love to catch up, but I've
gotta go mediate the trauma panel.

284
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,078
Looks like an interesting
group this year.

285
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:07,228
Very. And wait...

286
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,898
Now, why aren't you on it?

287
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,369
That's weird. Too bad.

288
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,133
Ha, ha. Timothy Weisner.

289
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,768
There's always one ass in the audience
determined to look smarter than you.

290
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:23,713
He's that guy. You have his paper,
right? He's gonna ask you about it.

291
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,512
- Okay.
- Yeah, not enough love in the sandbox...

292
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:30,020
needs to hear his own work
cited in other people's talks.

293
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,784
What? Relax, you'll be fine.

294
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,487
I, uh, played a tangerine in a
Christmas play in primary school.

295
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,564
Lost my footing and rolled off
the stage. I'm having flashbacks.

296
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,726
Oh, no. Just relax. Read your
slides, don't go too fast, and...

297
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:48,068
Well, memorize table three of the
Weisner paper and you'll do just fine.

298
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,176
Oh, I brought you this.

299
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,642
Take one of these.
It's a beta-blocker.

300
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:57,250
It's okay. I always take one before I talk.
Takes the edge off the catecholamines.

301
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,114
Go on.

302
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,489
I told you, over-golding is
hazardous to your health.

303
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,718
Your skin will never heal if you
don't give it a chance to air out.

304
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,988
I did like you said, I
kept it off for a week.

305
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,326
- Make it a month this time.
- Ray. Neela called, said it was urgent.

306
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,593
Another week of Keflex,
give the bling a break.

307
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,363
- I gotta be me, man.
- Yeah.

308
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,531
Neela wants you to go to her
locker and find the Weisner paper...

309
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,627
in the February 2005
issue of <i>Trauma Annals...</i>

310
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,543
and fax it to her at this number.
She said you'd know what it's about.

311
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,806
I do, and I do.

312
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,780
She said if you do this, she'll
watch any '70s movie you want...

313
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,216
even the extended version
of <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

314
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,583
And this came back
on your overdose.

315
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,885
- You're sure this is right?
- I even had them repeat it.

316
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,225
- How you feeling, Mr. Sadler?
- About the same.

317
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,299
But I suppose I won't feel
much till most of the liver dies.

318
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,894
That's not gonna happen.

319
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,970
Your acetaminophen
level is almost undetectable.

320
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,831
That's strange. I
know that's what I took.

321
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,903
Could there have been
anything else in the bottle?

322
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,477
No.

323
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,273
But, uh, that doesn't
change the course of action.

324
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,144
You still have to
keep me on a hold.

325
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:08,049
- At least until Psychiatry sees you, yeah.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

326
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,054
So, what happened in there?
- Nothing.

327
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,420
That wasn't nothing.

328
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,293
She shouldn't be
with someone like that.

329
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,068
- He seems like an okay guy to me.
- He's a jerk.

330
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,494
He lives in Dorch...

331
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,268
it's the jock dorm.

332
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,335
Something bad
happened there last term.

333
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,206
What do you mean something bad?

334
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,943
A girl got gang-raped.

335
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,884
It was in the news.

336
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,512
They never figured
out who did it.

337
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,451
And you think
Frick was involved?

338
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,592
They all knew what was going on.

339
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,252
I'll be right back.

340
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,101
Where's the boyfriend?

341
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,965
Uh, staying away for now,
out of respect for the family.

342
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,437
Her brother doesn't think
he's such a good guy.

343
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,544
Well, I'm sure the police are
investigating all possibilities.

344
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,405
The phone call before?

345
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,815
Oh, it's nothing. Uh,
Surgery's still tied up?

346
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,349
Yeah.

347
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,319
- Anything I can do?
- No.

348
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,656
I enrolled Alex in this tutoring
program where they, you know...

349
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,230
help with homework in the afternoons
and then keep him out of trouble.

350
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,794
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, it's...

351
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:33,599
You have to pay for the whole term
upfront, so I maxed out my Visa and...

352
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,908
Now I'm a little
late on my rent.

353
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,604
- Do you need...?
- No, it's, uh, okay. We're fine.

354
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,409
We're gonna be okay. But thanks.

355
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,757
This thing has been transmitting
for 20 minutes. Is this normal?

356
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,760
The machine is archaic. It
prints on rolls instead of sheets.

357
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,228
And forget about confirming
if it's been received.

358
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,094
This is just press and pray.

359
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,361
Yeah, right. Okay, could you send
this from the department office?

360
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,598
- It's important.
- I'm not your personal secretary.

361
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,505
Please. I have six patients ready to
dispo, I haven't presented any of them yet.

362
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,703
Fine. I'll have a turkey
club for lunch. Thank you.

363
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,940
- Thank you.
- Hey, you need to present?

364
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,210
Oh. It's okay. That's cool.

365
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,617
No, what do you mean? I just
heard you say you needed to present.

366
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,850
Right, and I already started
with Kovac, so I'll just wait for him.

367
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,555
Okay.

368
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,224
Okay. X-Ray, I'm not
feeling the love, man.

369
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,265
- What's the problem?
- No problem.

370
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,699
No, seriously. What's
the deal? What's going on?

371
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,806
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yeah, you do.

372
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,637
You've been giving me attitude all day,
and it's getting a little old, frankly.

373
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,939
So what? I had a messy situation
with a girl, and that's all it was.

374
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:52,848
- So can we leave it in the past?
- Your personal life? It's your business.

375
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,013
Oh, you wanna know
the whole story, huh?

376
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,314
Mm.

377
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,151
Okay, here it is. Here it is.

378
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,451
I had the weekend off,
we went a little crazy.

379
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,492
There was some weed,
there was some blow.

380
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,653
You're a musician,
you know what it's like.

381
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:08,232
- No, actually, I don't.
- So, what are you, in a Christian band?

382
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,631
Just forget it, okay?

383
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,501
I'm not gonna let you forget
it. Let me tell you something.

384
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,575
I want you to know that I never
showed up to work high once.

385
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,838
- Not once. Do you understand?
- Want a medal for that?

386
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,811
Where do you get off
being so self-righteous?

387
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,577
I've seen you stumble
out of Ike's plenty of times.

388
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,591
So, what? It's cool to be obliterated
on ETOH but change the chemical...

389
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,189
all of a sudden, I'm a scumbag?

390
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,450
You're right. It's not fair.

391
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,357
Listen, let's me and you
get something straight, okay?

392
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,364
I've been evaluated by the committee.
And you know what? I'm in the clear.

393
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,297
Like it or not, I'm
back at County...

394
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,597
I'm your Attending, and you better
start showing me some respect.

395
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:50,539
Take the history, examine that patient,
and present to me in 10. You got it?

396
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,782
He's definitely got some axis two stuff
going on, but he's not actively suicidal.

397
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,753
- I'm sending him home.
- You're kidding.

398
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:08,292
No. Negative tox screen, doesn't
seem to have any plan to try it again.

399
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,723
It's <i>a la casa.</i> Bye-bye.

400
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,761
- You're comfortable discharging him?
- No.

401
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:15,299
Not exactly, but the psych
ward is full, and I can't hold him.

402
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,902
- I'll put a formal consult in the chart.
- Excuse me.

403
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,130
You will refer him for
outpatient counseling.

404
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:23,435
Sure, but the next available
appointment is in 14 weeks.

405
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,939
Excuse me. Sir?

406
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,105
What can I do
for you, little lady?

407
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,945
We're looking for a doctor
named Archibald Morris.

408
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,212
And who is we?

409
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,788
Type and cross the
thalassemia kid...

410
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,226
I want post-reduction films on the
tib-fib before the ketamine wears off.

411
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,228
You got it.

412
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,230
So how's it going?

413
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,434
Oh, it's going great.
Going real great.

414
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,736
I just wanna thank you for making
the effort and easing my reentry.

415
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,804
- Good to have you back, Vic.
- Glad to hear it.

416
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,449
If I didn't know, I would
think you're avoiding me.

417
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,642
I'm not avoiding you, I've
been bouncing all day...

418
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,014
between patients and
administrative crap.

419
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,520
- Budget committee, admission...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

420
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,589
You're important.
I get it, I get it.

421
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,638
Sorry we didn't roll out
a red carpet for you...

422
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,229
Nimet's tanking again.

423
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,492
Right.

424
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,795
Can't get the sat above 80, and
she's getting really hard to bag.

425
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,998
Suction. Zone three
stab wound to the neck.

426
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,904
- Systolic's only 72.
- Will someone explain, please?

427
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,170
Can't ventilate at all.

428
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,372
Hematoma's expanding. It's
dislodged the tube. Let's crike her.

429
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,572
No, no, too dangerous.

430
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,946
Lesion's low. If we cut
into it, she can bleed out.

431
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,281
Good point. Let's go to Plan B.

432
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,446
- Sam, call the perfusion team.
- What?

433
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,286
- Heart rate's dropping.
- What does that mean?

434
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,059
Putting her on a
cardio-pulmonary bypass.

435
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,492
You need an O.R. and a
surgeon. We don't have either.

436
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,759
- We're gonna cannulate, we'll bypass.
- You can't do that.

437
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,928
If we work quick, we'll get her on before
she suffers permanent hypoxic damage.

438
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,663
- Get a Resident.
- I'll find Abby.

439
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,439
- Tell me what's happening.
- The bleeding is blocking her airway.

440
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,044
- We can't get oxygen into her blood.
- Oh, God.

441
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,239
We'll get her on a heart-lung
machine so we can buy more time...

442
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,578
before we can get
her into an O.R., okay?

443
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,243
- Whatever you think is right.
- Brady to 45, lost the pulse.

444
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,913
- Starting compressions.
- Mahir, you should wait outside.

445
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,059
- Mom.
- Go.

446
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:25,888
Nimet. Nimet, you're a
strong girl. You're a brave girl.

447
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:29,661
Don't leave me. Don't give up.

448
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,600
Okay, what's this about,
kids? I'm a doctor, very busy.

449
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,708
- You're Archibald Morris.
- Yeah. What do you need?

450
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,071
You better have a seat.

451
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,541
Here's the deal.

452
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,776
We four live with different parents,
but we all share the same dad.

453
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,149
We're not supposed to be able
to find out the identity of our father.

454
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,485
But the Donor Sibling Registry allows
us to find out the identity of each other.

455
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,786
So I got in contact
with them via e-mail.

456
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,022
And it actually turns out that little
Max here is actually a computer genius.

457
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,794
- What's up?
- What's up?

458
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,095
He hacked the system at the sperm
bank and found our father's name.

459
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,532
Archibald Morris.

460
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,573
So are you donor 140
from the Chicago CryoBank?

461
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:10,971
Huh?

462
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:14,238
Did you donate any sperm
between 1991 and 1996?

463
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,882
Ha. Did I ever. Heh.

464
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,227
Oh, my God. I'm...
I'm your daddy.

465
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,023
Mr. Sadler.

466
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,600
Being a sitter for crazy people
seems like a really boring job.

467
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,431
Well, guess what, Barry.

468
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,403
- You and the sitter can both go home.
- What?

469
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,099
You convinced the psychiatrist
it's safe to discharge you.

470
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,767
- No.
- You're free to go.

471
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,106
Well, what about these?

472
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,739
Mr. Sadler, you took what?
Three, maybe four pills?

473
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,113
- Two.
- Two.

474
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,279
Yeah, but a gesture is a
gesture. I was suicidal when I did it.

475
00:25:57,456 --> 00:26:00,483
The psychiatrist is convinced
you're not gonna try it again.

476
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,562
What if I'm homicidal? You have
to keep me if I wanna kill people.

477
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,427
Barry, ha, what's going on?

478
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,103
The thing is...

479
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:17,466
I, uh... I need to stay here. I
can't go home this weekend.

480
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,407
- Why not?
- I just can't.

481
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,105
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

482
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,756
I'm in love with
my best friend's girl.

483
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,757
Ha. It happens.
You'll get over it.

484
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:38,489
They're getting married tomorrow.
I don't trust myself not to...

485
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:41,293
- To what?
- Object.

486
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,026
Or worse.

487
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,133
Lock me up till the
wedding's over, please.

488
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,676
I'm begging you.

489
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,480
I'll talk to Psych again,
see what I can do.

490
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,188
Barry...

491
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,051
- does she know?
- Who? Helen?

492
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:08,854
Yeah. Have you
told her how you feel?

493
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,189
God, no. That would be crazy.

494
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,390
Still in PEA. Resuming
compressions.

495
00:27:16,414 --> 00:27:18,398
It's okay, Nimet. It's
gonna be all right.

496
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,266
Got a flash. ABBY: Introducer.

497
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,441
- You ever done this before?
- Nope.

498
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,577
All right, give us
some room. Come on.

499
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,042
I'll be right here.
Just listen to my voice.

500
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,078
It seems a little
unconventional.

501
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,377
- Okay. Fine, what's the alternative?
- Somebody call Surgery again.

502
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,020
Still working in an open
chest five minutes ago.

503
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:39,386
Did I tell you Mrs. Kalter's daughter
has 14 bridesmaids in her wedding?

504
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,398
We'll oxygenate her
blood till Surgery's ready.

505
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,620
- It'll be awesome.
- If she doesn't bleed out.

506
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,230
- Threading easily.
- Nine yards of silk organza.

507
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,562
- Hook me up, Lockhart.
- Does Surgery know we're doing this?

508
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:53,433
- They're not available. We can't wait.
- Silk flowers all around their neck.

509
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,336
You must get better so you
can help me with the embroidery.

510
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,501
- PH is only 7.02.
- Yeah, well, we got nothing to lose.

511
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,805
Okay. Good flush.

512
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,415
You're such a good
girl. Such a help to me.

513
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,017
Sat's hanging in the 60s.

514
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,417
Come on. This is taking too long.
- 0 silk.

515
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,455
Okay.

516
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,058
Unclamping venous.

517
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,926
Unclamping arterial.

518
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,272
Ready.

519
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,567
Okay, mark the time.

520
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,276
Okay. Pump is on,
four liters per minute.

521
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,644
Okay, you can stop.

522
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,590
Color's better already.

523
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,252
Full flow, baby. Sweet. Ha, ha!

524
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,222
Sat's coming up. Ninety-two.

525
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,627
Is it working?

526
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,298
Her oxygen level
is improving, yes.

527
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,598
Thank you. Thank you for
saving my daughter. Thank you.

528
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:10,644
Up to 15 percent of all deaths
following motor vehicle collisions...

529
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:15,151
are caused by injury
to the thoracic aorta.

530
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,687
I... Uh...

531
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,791
We set out to
document the incidence...

532
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:32,029
and utility of the seatbelt
sign in predicting...

533
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,847
Is there anyone from
audio-visual support here?

534
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,551
<i>Unseen they suffer.
Unheard they cry.</i>

535
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,989
<i>In agony they
linger. Alone they die.</i>

536
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,720
<i>Rats have rights.
Rats have rights.</i>

537
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,888
- I would like to point out...
<i>- Rats have rights.</i>

538
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:04,901
<i>- Rats have rights. Rats have rights.</i>
- That our study didn't involve any rats.

539
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,040
<i>Rats have rights.
Rats have rights.</i>

540
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,640
<i>Rats have rights.</i>

541
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,245
<i>Rats have rights.
Rats have rights.</i>

542
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,443
- Ray, meet my kids.
- Your what?

543
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:21,280
Yeah, I needed cash in
college, donated to a sperm bank.

544
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,580
Best job I ever had.

545
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,019
I'm Hana. MORRIS: My eldest.

546
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,456
Stole her mom's car, drove 60 miles
without a license to get everybody here.

547
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:32,064
Michael is the regional "Dance
Dance Revolution" champion.

548
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,224
Melia is a professional jump roper,
and my boy Max is a computer whiz.

549
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,664
What's up?

550
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,931
- It's nice to meet you all.
- Yeah, I'm just giving them the tour.

551
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:44,076
All right. Uh, these, uh,
are the trauma rooms, okay?

552
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,303
This is where Daddy saves lives.
- Cool.

553
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,108
- Abby, come meet my children.
- Not now, Morris.

554
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,511
Okay, she hates kids.

555
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,017
- How's she doing?
- Stable for now.

556
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,707
- Where'd the family go?
- I made them get something to eat.

557
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,349
- It's gonna be a long night.
- Yeah.

558
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,625
Uh, okay, I kind of
snapped this morning.

559
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,928
- It's okay. It's hormones.
- No, I hate that excuse. I just...

560
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,200
I just wanna say that I know you
were trying to help, and I apologize.

561
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,637
Apology accepted.

562
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,440
It's just strange
being pregnant.

563
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:24,276
It's so weird having such a
personal thing be so public.

564
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,419
Well, for me, being pregnant was
something everyone was ashamed of.

565
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,183
My parents didn't want
me to leave the house.

566
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:36,823
I think it's nice that everybody
wants to share in this with you.

567
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,536
Luka.

568
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,276
Excuse me. Excuse me.

569
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,470
- Tell us what's happening.
- Seventh unit, platelets, FFP going up.

570
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,978
Wide open at the femoral.

571
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,447
Somebody explain.
What has gone wrong?

572
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,280
- Heparin's off, right? Heparin's off?
- It's off.

573
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:04,355
- Okay, one gram of protamine.
- Please, you have to help her.

574
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:05,889
Can't get her mean above 30.

575
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,151
She's losing blood
faster than we can put in.

576
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,158
In order to put Nimet
on this machine...

577
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,456
we had to give her a
medicine that thins her blood.

578
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:16,466
A side effect is internal bleeding.
That might be what's happening now.

579
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,501
If you stop the
medicine, she'll be okay?

580
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,799
- That's what we're hoping, yes.
- Whoa, acidotic, 6.8.

581
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,872
Try one amp of bicarb and one
gram of calcium. Let's go. Go, go, go.

582
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,812
Pupils are fixed and
dilated. No corneal, no gag.

583
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,851
Why? There's no head trauma, and
no reason for a spontaneous bleed.

584
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,048
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
can cause acute intracranial hemorrhage.

585
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,557
She's been on heparin
for less than an hour.

586
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,661
It doesn't make sense.
Does it make sense?

587
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,661
Check the oxygenator.
Get another ACT.

588
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,493
Volume's too low. No flow.

589
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,532
She's lost some basic
neurologic reflexes.

590
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,315
- What does that mean?
- We think that she's bled into her brain.

591
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,741
Stop it, Mahir. I can't hear
the doctors. Can you fix this?

592
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,079
No, we can't.

593
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,452
Her brain is gone...

594
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,716
and as soon as we turn the
machine off, her body's gonna die too.

595
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,953
Come back. Nimet is
strong, she can fight.

596
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:18,291
Stop, Mahir. Stop right now!

597
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,463
This never would've
happened if she stayed at home!

598
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,567
- You should have made her stay.
- Enough!

599
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,670
Please! There must be
another machine or something!

600
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,328
I'm sorry.

601
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,841
I'm sorry.

602
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,670
I'll give my own blood.

603
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,552
It was a good idea, Vic.

604
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,395
Yeah. Yeah, if it
had worked, right?

605
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,932
You gave her the only
chance she ever had.

606
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,366
Yeah. Yeah.

607
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:07,304
I'm sorry about the beta-blocker.
Ten milligrams was probably a bit much.

608
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,209
The fainting part just
makes for a better story.

609
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,611
You know...

610
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:17,552
I once ate a hash brownie before
giving a big talk in Amsterdam.

611
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,318
I mistakenly thought that it
would take an hour to kick in.

612
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:26,021
Suddenly, I was up on a stage,
completely out of my head...

613
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:30,134
lecturing to a roomful of
biochemists in a faux French accent.

614
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,533
Okay. I feel better.

615
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:37,473
Today was a complete disaster,
but at least I didn't bring it on myself.

616
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,305
No, no, no. You
were the victim...

617
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:45,781
of a truly astounding confluence
of technical problems...

618
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,149
miscalculated pharmaceuticals,
and rat activists.

619
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:53,088
As crazy as that sounds, that's totally
in sync with my life at the moment.

620
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,643
Well, your life sounds
pretty interesting.

621
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:56,160
Oh, no.

622
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,127
I know I may appear
to be this kind of wild...

623
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,630
spontaneous girl who
plans a wedding in a day...

624
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,929
and sits here getting drunk
with her Attending in a hotel bar.

625
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,629
But I'm not.

626
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:11,874
I'm boring, really boring.

627
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,273
All I wanna do is hang out
at home with my roommate.

628
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,883
Your roommate? Dr. Barnett?

629
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:21,212
- Yeah, Ray.
- Well, that's nice.

630
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,651
It's good the two of
you get along so well.

631
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,022
Yeah, we do.

632
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,024
Maybe that's what I need.

633
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,959
You know, I was
thinking of getting a dog...

634
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,294
but a roommate's probably
easier to housetrain.

635
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,335
Are you ready for another round?

636
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:42,406
Uh, no. No. Thank you, I, uh...

637
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,370
I should get going.

638
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,548
- It was worth a try.
- Yeah.

639
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:01,417
I need to go over organ donation
and explain about the coroner.

640
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,562
- I don't wanna rush her.
- No, of course not.

641
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:09,266
This might take a while. Maybe you
should go home. Don't wait for me.

642
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,164
Um...

643
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,896
I've been thinking, and if it's
that important to your family...

644
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:17,633
I'm fine with the baptism.

645
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,979
A little holy water never
hurt anybody, right?

646
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,923
Well, Archie, this was
fun. I'm glad we came.

647
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,432
Wait. You're not
leaving, are you?

648
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,571
I was gonna take you all
out for burgers and shakes.

649
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:47,762
Sorry, can't.

650
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:51,603
I gotta get everyone home before
8 or our parents will start to worry.

651
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,439
Well... I mean, what's next?

652
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,111
Now, I wanna take you guys
to ball games, Millennium Park...

653
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:01,742
movies your parents won't
let you see, there's so much.

654
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,287
Perhaps. Um,
we're all pretty busy.

655
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,187
I don't know when I'll be able to
steal my mom's car again, so...

656
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,725
Somebody hid the
digital on the code cart.

657
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,590
Oh, great. Frank, thank you.

658
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,732
- I wanna take a picture.
- Really, we gotta run.

659
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,458
Please, two seconds.
Come on, please.

660
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,263
Okay, everybody say freak.

661
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,981
- Samantha.
- Hey.

662
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,959
I'm glad you called.

663
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,421
Where's all your stuff?

664
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:50,398
Oh, I thought we were gonna
conduct an interview first.

665
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,931
I thought we already did.

666
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,842
- Hey, how was it?
- Endless.

667
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,816
Well, I'm making a
stir-fry. Beer or wine?

668
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,480
Neither. I'm exhausted
and already drunk.

669
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,125
All right. Here.

670
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,819
Taste this. Fresh
water chestnut.

671
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,697
Crazy, huh? Thought
they grew in cans.

672
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,894
All right, well, I rented <i>The Omen,</i>
and I was too scared to watch it alone.

673
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,834
- Ray...
- It's better than <i>The Exorcist.</i>

674
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,304
I promise it's a classic.

675
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,340
That's what you said
about <i>The Exorcist.</i>

676
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,034
- True, but...
- Ray.

677
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,009
- I know, you're tired.
- Ray.

678
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,514
Okay, look. I know you
don't like devil movies.

679
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:43,121
- It's the last one, I promise.
- I think I should move out.

680
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,054
- Why?
- I think we both know why.

681
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,903
Where's Mahir?

682
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,905
I don't know.
I'm afraid for him.

683
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,867
He just needs some time.

684
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,981
I'm sorry to bother
you with this...

685
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:14,483
but, uh, you need
to sign for her things.

686
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:35,206
This is the hardest thing
for any parent to experience.

687
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:40,609
How do you protect them
from all the evil in the world?

688
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:48,284
You can't. No matter
what you do, you can't.

689
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:55,216
Mahir was beaten up at school
after 9/11 for being Muslim.

690
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,089
They called him a terrorist.

691
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:00,528
Ever since then, he became
very strict about his prayers.

692
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:05,767
He cut himself off from everything
except his fundamentalist friends.

693
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:08,406
He wanted the same
thing for his sister.

694
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:16,411
There's a park down
the street where we live.

695
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:22,145
I close my eyes, and they're
just little children on the swings.

696
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,452
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

697
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:38,502
I brought them to this country
to find justice and freedom.

698
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,299
But I lose two children today.

699
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,637
- Two children. Oh, God.
- Mahir... Mahir will be all right.

700
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:50,805
I can't pretend that I don't
know what I know in my heart.

701
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,780
He loved his sister.

702
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:57,980
But he thought she was disgracing
the family, disgracing herself.

703
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,920
Oh, God.

704
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,560
Doctor, doctor, doctor.

705
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:08,188
Doctor, tell the police
to search my house first.

706
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:10,995
They should look into
Mahir's room for the knife.

707
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,268
Oh, God.

708
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,376
This was an honor killing?

709
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,883
Yes. Yes.

710
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,548
That's what they call it.

711
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,389
But there is no honor here.

712
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,670
What the hell are you
still doing here, man?

713
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,715
Downloading the picture of
my kids from the ER camera.

714
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,715
Really photogenic,
aren't they, huh?

715
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:05,246
I'm gonna use this one
for my Christmas card.

716
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,086
I don't know. I hate
Christmas cards, man.

717
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,989
Hey, you wanna go grab
some dinner together?

718
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:13,598
Uh, no. My oldest boy, Michael,
DJs an online radio show.

719
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,005
- I wanna check it out.
- Why don't we listen to it here?

720
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,966
No, I can't. After that I
gotta brush up on my trig...

721
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,777
so I can help Melia
with her homework.

722
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,305
She's 10 years old, she's
smarter at math than I am, huh?

723
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:28,139
- Family really keeps you busy, huh?
- Yeah, but it's worth it though, right?

724
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,113
So you, uh, heading home?

725
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,011
I heard your apartment
got pretty messed up.

726
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:36,587
No, it's fixed. I mean, that's finally
what it took the landlord to paint it.

727
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,527
Okay, then. Cool.
Welcome back, Vic.

728
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,994
- You have a good night.
- You too, man.
