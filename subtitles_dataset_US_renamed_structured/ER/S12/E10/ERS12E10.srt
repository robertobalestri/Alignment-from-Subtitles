00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,500
I'm not saying he's not a great
guy. He is. But do you know him?

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:14,011
Under what circumstances would a prisoner
be transferred from one state to another?

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,410
Your ex?

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,246
- I'm gonna be the new ER chief.
- When I withdrew, I hoped they'd pick you.

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,218
I'll make sure you work
harder than any other volunteer.

7
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,722
No more going out for
doughnuts and chasing skirts.

8
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,986
Gotta stay in the
game, K.J., or they win.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,026
Would you like to...?

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,057
Here's to discretion.

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,393
- Propriety.
- Maturity.

12
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:34,901
Well...

13
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,140
How's it going, Louie?

14
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,977
I got two more sidewalks to
clear and a Furby doll to find.

15
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,181
Hey, Louie.

16
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,787
No way.

17
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,324
- Merry Christmas, buddy.
- Thank you.

18
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,962
- Hey, Doctor Kovac.
- How's your mom doing?

19
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,189
One more treatment,
then she's out.

20
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,528
Well, maybe this
will cheer her up.

21
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,334
Thank you.

22
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,972
Ho-ho-ho.

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,338
I want one.

24
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,141
You look like
you've been naughty.

25
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,841
No? There you go.

26
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,180
Ho-ho.

27
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,219
Well, look what the
reindeer dragged in.

28
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,050
This is for you, Frank.

29
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,215
The last time I got a
present in this hospital...

30
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,588
was when that
helicopter fell on Romano.

31
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,855
- For you.
- Oh, wow, a neon stethoscope.

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,259
Thanks, Santa Kovac.

33
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,058
What about me?

34
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,736
♪ NSYNC's greatest hits. You
didn't. I mean, I was hoping you didn't.

35
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,704
I love this love. Bears
tickets. Thanks, man. Just one?

36
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,673
- Looks like it's you and me, man.
- Okay, and now the bonus.

37
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,609
Since it's Christmas Eve, we
only need skeleton crew tonight.

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,047
So I'm letting three support staff
and one resident home with pay.

39
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,677
- Well, I did the manual disimpaction.
- I did a pelvic on a 300-pounder.

40
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,381
I débrided maggots out of a
diabetic ulcer, you wankers.

41
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,959
This is gonna jinx us
into a night of trauma hell.

42
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,527
Okay, Rock, Paper, Scissors.

43
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,721
Neela and Morris, you first.

44
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,230
No, no, this is sheet metal.

45
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,892
Morris, you're out. Pratt.

46
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,733
- Ray.
- All right.

47
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,403
You suck.

48
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,204
Thank you, thank
you and thank you.

49
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,906
Michael and I are going to Jamaica
and I have tons of packing to do.

Somebody giving lap
dances? I wasn't even invited?

51
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,916
Santa's sending people home.

♪ NSYNC. I didn't
know you were gay.

53
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,391
- Evil elf.
- It's the thought that counts.

54
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,652
Maybe you could think
about calling Jodie back?

55
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,921
- Get her off my back.
- She did not call again.

56
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,894
Eight times.

57
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,669
Look. Is there any way to,
like, change the main number?

58
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,896
Maybe you could work from
somewhere with a different extension...

59
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,268
like Cambodia.

60
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,347

- Ah! Hi.

Okay.

68
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,172
- Are we spending Christmas together?
- That's what you said last night.

69
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,773
No, I didn't.

70
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,107
You probably don't
remember other things either.

71
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,442
Shut up.

72
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,352

00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,083
We should?

75
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,455
Okay.

76
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,223
- I should change.
- I'll help.

Is Alex playing hockey again?

78

They don't just move you
from another state for no reason.

79
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,546
Make sure that coach doesn't
bench him, because he's got skills.

80

81
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,050
Yes. I need to see him, Sammy.

Do you still have the
guitar that I gave Alex?

86
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,437
- Yeah.
- The DVD player, camcorder?

87
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,129
Yes.

88
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,070
People might come
looking for those.

89
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,372
People with warrants.

90
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,947
Unbelievable.

91
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,082
You are such a piece of crap.

92
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,517
- I'll explain everything to Alex.
- No, you won't.

93
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,882
Don't call and don't write.

94
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,752
I've changed, Sammy, I
really have. God is helping me...

Do you remember what happened?

102
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,462
- Other driver skidded on black ice.
- Let her tell me.

103
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,691
Tamara? Tamara?

104
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,199
She's seizing.

105
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,530
- Two of Ativan.
- Could be an intracranial bleed.

106
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,141
Let CT know we'll be up
there as soon as seizure stops.

107
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,469
I need background
singers for the party tonight.

108
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,906
I'll do it.

109
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,309
I want someone to have
my back, not stab me in it.

110
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,742
Baby, I got your back.

111

I'm looking for somebody

112
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,945
I can "sing" sing.

113
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,953
Seriously, I got
soul. I'm super bad.

114
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,216
Haleh takes her Christmas

- Yeah.

118
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,326
For the 10th year in
a row, I think I'll pass.

119
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,729
Seventy-five-year-old
male, cough times two days.

120
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,270
No significant history,
afebrile, vitals normal.

121
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,737
- Exam?
- Good breath sounds, unremarkable.

122
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,673
- X-ray?
- Normal heart, lung fields clear.

123
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,507
- Your dispo?
- I was about to send him home.

124
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,275
But he started complaining
of severe epigastric pain.

125
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,281
Did you check an
amylase and a lipase?

126
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,680
Yeah. Not back yet.

127
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,947
All right. Let's see
how he is doing.

128
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,923
Doc, am I gonna lay here all
day just like a piece of herring?

129
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,687
Well, I sure hope
not, Mr. Goldstein.

130
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,195
I'm allergic to pickled
fish. Dr. Clemente.

131
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,028
Oh, doc, do I look
pale? I feel like I'm pale.

132
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,194
You know, let me check you out
so you can go home right away.

133
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,931
See if my cell count is back
on my lizard breeder's LP.

134
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,043
- Sure. RAY: Pupils
equal and sluggish.

135
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,942
Tamara, you were in a car
accident. Do you know where you are?

136
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,310
- A hospital?
- Heart rate's 127.

137
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,611
Okay. Hang a liter of NS.

138
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,550
Tamara, can you
tell me today's date?

139
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,553
- Chest wall stable.
- Christmas Eve.

140
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,157
Good.

141
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,557
December 24th. Chicago.

142
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,060
Breath sounds okay.

143
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,289
Nineteen eighty-six.

144
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,694
Still postictal.

145
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,564
Tamara, do you have any
medical disorder? Seizures?

146
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,031
Tamara?

147
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,404
Tamara? Tamara?
She's not responding.

148
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,044
Could be a subclinical
seizure. Another two of Ativan.

149
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,580
Radiology says CT's
negative. Sats only 86.

150
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,048
- Okay, crank up the O2.
- Guys, she's hyponatremic.

151
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,709
Hypertonic saline, 25 cc's.

152
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,253
I don't keep that in here.
Go to the drug lockup.

153
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,857
- Go get it, then.
- I can't leave, I'm the only nurse.

154
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,256
- Guys, she's going apneic.
- Bag her through it.

155
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,124
- You guys need an extra hand?
- Where are the other nurses?

156
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,425
We're a little light. Seems
Santa sent half of them home.

157
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,497
Hey. You're out of here?

158
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,903
I'm a little nervous.

159
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,044
It's a honeymoon.
You're gonna have fun.

160
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,736
I'm not worried about that.

161
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,040
- Right, you hate to fly.
- It's not that either.

162
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,878
- I've got my Xanax and sleeping mask.
- So, what is it?

163
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,714
We're stopping at his parents'
for Christmas dinner before we go.

164
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,015
Ah. Do they know you're married?

165
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,454
- I heard Michael tell them on the phone.
- And?

166
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,887
Then I heard a dial tone.

167
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,427
- We need to confer.
- Confer?

168
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:54,591
I have some department chief
business to go over with you in lockup.

169
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,794
I'm checking LP
results for Clemente.

170
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,166
Clemente can wait.

171
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,966
- You guys seem cozy.
- Yeah.

172
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,112
- We're spending Christmas together.
- Really?

173
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,646
Look up. You got to kiss.

174
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,808
- Kiss?
- Britney and Madonna did it.

175
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,716
Perverts start young these days.

176
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,481
Hyponatremia is the
condition in which...

177
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,592
the sodium concentration of
the blood is abnormally low.

178
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,320
It does weird things to the
fluid balance of the body...

179
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,761
that can cause serious
problems, like seizures.

180
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,161
How did she get this?

181
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,131
Well, a lot of
things can cause it.

182
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,328
- Any vomiting, diarrhea?
- No.

183
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,838
- Do you take diuretics, laxatives?
- No.

184
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,170
Okay. Creatinine's normal.

185
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,175
Kidneys seem to
be working all right.

186
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,836
How long before I can go home?

187
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,482
Oh, you're not going home.

188
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,618
I mean, at least not tonight.

189
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,309
But I'm fine.

190
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,718
You need to be admitted.

191
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,159
I got two kids who are expecting
gifts under the tree tomorrow.

192
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,855
I understand, but we need
to work this up to find out...

193
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,798
why your sodium is so low. So
that this never happens again.

194
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,597
No. I can't do this to my kids.

195
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,702
So whose kitchen are
we dirtying up tomorrow?

196
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,277
Mm. I don't know. I hadn't
really given it much thought.

197
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,471
- Guess what I got you.
- Give me a hint.

198
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,240
Um...

199
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,844
- It's small.
- Small.

200
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,486
A necklace.

201
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,083
It's not jewelry.

202
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,850
Hey, our hyponatremia
lady is signing out AMA.

203
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,516
- She can't.
- Maybe you wanna come and stop her.

204
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,990
Okay. I'll be right out.

205
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,756
- Luka.
- Yeah. What?

206
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,359
You're gonna
love what I got you.

207
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,164
- You didn't get me anything.
- I did.

208
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,636
- No, you didn't...
- I did too.

209
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,708
- Keep guessing.
- All right, not jewelry. Spark plugs.

210
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,107
- Right.
- A glass frog.

211
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,871
- How did you know?
- Not even close?

212
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:51,142
- Listen, page me when you have a clue.
- Okay.

213
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:00,025
Just come over when you're done
with your mother's. I don't care how late.

214
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,786
You know, I got
a stocking for you.

215
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,487
Actually, I have two. They're
fishnets, and I'm gonna...

216
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,550
I gotta go, I'll call
you later. You're late.

217
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:07,224
I got tied up.

218
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,700
- Uh-huh. The phones still work.
- I had to drop my kid off at a friend's...

219
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,204
- and take care of personal stuff.
- Get in line. My linebacker called.

220
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,208
He was supposed to spend
the weekend. I think he's flaking.

221
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,346
- Linebacker, huh?
- He plays for Cincinnati.

222
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,142
- Our ice skater's back from Radiology.
- All right, I'll pick up her films.

223
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:27,048
Six-year-old female, GSW to abdomen.
Shallow resps, tachy at 150, BP 50 palp.

224
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,916
- Access? EMT:
I/O in the left tibia.

225
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,922
- It hurts.
- Please, you gotta help her.

226
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,855
Good breath sounds.
How'd this happen?

227
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,258
We were buying garlands
and a bullet came through.

228
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,330
- There's a dead guy at the scene.
- Mommy.

229
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,592
- Seven hundred cc's en route.
- What's her name?

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,099
- Danielle.
- Danielle, we're gonna fix you up, okay?

231
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:47,070
- Lost the carotid. No pulse. NADINE:
Does that mean...? Is she dying?

232
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,269
Satinksy.
Cross-clamping the aorta.

233
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,610
Four hundred cc NS bolus and
call for two more units of O-neg.

234
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,945
- Cordis introducer.
- Chest is dry.

235
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,318
Hold compressions.

236
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,856
Still no pulse.

237
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,855
Another epi, get
ready with atropine.

238
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,790
CBC, trauma panel,
type and cross for four.

239
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,430
Belly's full of blood.

240
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,088
Notify the O.R.

241
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,793
- Subclavian's in, treat it easy.
- Check for pulses with compressions.

242
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,767
She's got a carotid.
She needs a Foley.

243
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,270
O.R.'s ready.

244
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,438
I've got blood bank. Two units?

245
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,376
Make it four. Tell
them to rush it.

246
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,676
Hey, Chuny, page Olivia Evans.
She's at the social worker party.

247
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,648
See if she can come
down for this woman.

248
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,488
Eight candles.

249
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,824
And we get gifts with each one.

250
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,366
What the hell is Kwanzaa anyway?
Some made-up thing like Flag Day?

251
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,332
Who are you calling
made-up, fat boy?

252
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,369
Her husband is
okay with her leaving?

253
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,871
I get the impression she
generally makes the decisions.

254
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,634
I never heard that one before.

255
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,869
Repeat electrolytes
aren't even back yet.

256
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,537
- How about the UA?
- Well, it's normal.

257
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,650
But we still don't
know what the cause is.

258
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:09,846
Mrs. Gordon, you understand you'll
be leaving against medical advice?

259
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,357
Honey, why don't you go get
the car? I'll meet you out in front.

260
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,721
It's okay. Just go.

261
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,523
- You shouldn't go home yet.
- But I feel much better.

262
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:21,031
Hyponatremia is serious. You
need to stay here and be monitored.

263
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,034
I thought you had fixed
me with that saline stuff.

264
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,105
- No. The fix could be temporary.
- If your sodium falls again...

265
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,038
- you could have another seizure.
- Or worse.

266
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,376
It's Christmas.

267
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,346
Severe hyponatremia can cause a coma,
permanent brain damage, even death.

268
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,048
We got an MVA rolling in.

269
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,618
Ray, I'll meet you in a second.

270
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,220
Okay.

271
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,291
We need to figure out
why this is happening.

272
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,122
That's the only way
for us to help you.

273
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,922
You can't help me.

274
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,095
Three months ago, I went to
the doctor for a stomachache.

275
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,437
I walked out a cancer patient.

276
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,537
Ovarian.

277
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,806
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,848
Had already spread to
the liver and the lungs.

279
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,086
Five-year survival,
less than 5 percent.

280
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,585
All the more reason for you
to stay. You can't fight this...

281
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,783
if you don't take
care of yourself.

282
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,422
I don't wanna fight this.

283
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,431
Treatment means surgery,
chemo, months in a hospital bed.

284
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,467
I don't want that.

285
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,663
I don't want my kids
remembering me...

286
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:39,608
as this weak, bald, dying woman.

287
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,241
I can devote my
remaining time...

288
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,944
to some futile fight...

289
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,286
or to my family.

290
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,116
I'm choosing my family.

291
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,026
What does your husband want?

292
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,126
He doesn't know.

293
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,965
Look, after the
holidays, I'll tell him.

294
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,338
But right now, I'm going home.

295
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,515
- I already told you. It happened so fast.
- So no license plate, nothing?

296
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,380
- No.
- Why don't you give her a break?

297
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,784
- We'll call you if anything changes.
- Sure.

298
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,184
Thanks.

299
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,883
He asked me if I saw the
guy's face, and I didn't, so...

300
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,823
It's okay. It's okay.

301
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,726
They're stabilizing her. We
wanna get her to Surgery.

302
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,297
Oh, good. That's good.

303
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,458
And here are her things.

304
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,171
I told her Santa wouldn't bring her
anything unless she wrote it all down.

305
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,343
We're doing everything we can.

306
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,212
Neighborhood's
always been dangerous.

307
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,353
When I moved to New York, I
asked my mom to come live with us...

308
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,885
but she wouldn't.

309
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,888
Do you want me to call her?
Arrange to have her meet you here?

310
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,185
Her diabetes, she
can barely walk.

311
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,521
Well, is there someone
else? A friend or family?

312
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,890
My husband.

313
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:08,159
He's flying in tonight, but
he doesn't know about this.

314
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,471
Is there anything I can get you?

315
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,533
I should try Jason again.

316
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,540
Maybe I can catch
him on the layover.

317
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,701
Thanks.

318
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,613
This is Dr. Kovac from the ER
looking for a repeat sodium level...

319
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:33,089
- on a patient, Tamara Gordon.
- Dr. Kovac, are you auditioning today?

320
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,522
I'm not sure yet.

321
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,027
Hey, schizo. Mickey
Goldstein's labs are back.

322
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,722
What about you,
Dr. Clemente? Are you a singer?

323
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,566
Very nice. Abby's short on baked
goods, maybe you can help her out there.

324
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,398
Okay, good news.

325
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,409
All your blood tests came
back completely normal.

326
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,810
Yeah, bad news. I feel like
there's a truck parked on my spleen.

327
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,745
You can go home
now. Merry Christmas.

328
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,977
Wait a minute. What
about this terrible cough?

329
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,280
Don't worry. It's
probably just a little virus.

330
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:06,085
A virus? Well, can a
virus cause chest pain?

331
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,953
- What chest pain?
- A terrible massive pressure right here.

332
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,656
- Oh, the pain.
- Why didn't you tell the other doctor?

333
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,461
It just started a
little while ago.

334
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,600
You still stuffing that suit?

335
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,675
I went to buy
some kente cloth...

336
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,972
but the salesgirls used
it all to wipe themselves.

337
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,478
That's why I kicked your ass.

338
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,776
How did you guys get
started in this, anyway?

339
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,045
Some employee complained that our
company only celebrates Christmas.

340
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,553
So the boss decided to
throw a PC holiday party...

341
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,190
to show how we all get along.

342
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,620
That sounds like a plan.

343
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,125
Santa, how do you handle
one of those on your lap?

344
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,321
Oh, we break out the
big Santa for that one.

345
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,126
- That's enough.
- Maybe I should bring a leg tomorrow.

346
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,496
- If you don't stop, I'll shove a leg up...
- Eve.

347
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,661
You're a real nutcracker.

348
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,829
You wanna help
me jingle my bells?

349
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,339
Instead of pissing all
over everyone, piss in that.

350
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,171
I'm in too much pain to walk.

351
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,835
I need a urine sample now.

352
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,344
- Crit's 31.
- Hold compressions.

353
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,543
- Got a weak pulse.
- That's what I wanna hear.

354
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,381
Let's get a BP.

355
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,249
All right. Tube
position looks good.

356
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,154
- What's the delay?
- Surgery's here.

357
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,692
- Where's Dubenko?
- On vacation.

358
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,887
- I'm Dr. Albright. I'm covering for him.
- Bullet in upper quadrant.

359
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,226
Cross-clamp the aorta
for traumatic full arrest.

360
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,494
You told us an hour ago you were
redlining this patient to the O.R.

361
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,365
We got a team,
scrubbed and waiting.

362
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,372
- She hasn't been stable enough to move.
- We had no pulse.

363
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,407
Be discriminating
when you say "redline."

364
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,738
We hear it, drop everything,
and run to the O.R.

365
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:36,849
- You don't redline a pulseless patient.
- Important thing is she has a pulse now.

366
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,746
- So let's go.
- She's bradying down.

367
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,386
And we just lost that pulse.

368
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,748
Resume compressions.

369
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,015
You have a real
three-ring circus in here.

370
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,752
Dr. Albright, I don't think we've
met. I'm Dr. Weaver, chief of staff.

371
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,456
Oh, Dr. Weaver. I'm the
surgical chief resident.

372
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,188
Just got back
from a VA rotation.

373
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,061
Good for you. Epinephrine, 0.2.

374
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,134
Type-specific blood is up.
- Hang a unit.

375
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,238
- Call us when you know what's going on.
- I know what's going on.

376
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,102
- We can't hold the O.R. for a dead kid.
- She's not dead.

377
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,936
Uh-huh.

378
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,080
- What the hell?
- She's a bitch, but she's right.

379
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,546
Let's get the mom in here.

380
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,912
All right. I'm going
with an atrial line.

381
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,213
Fourteen-gauge
and four more units.

382
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,391
- Hey.
- Merry Christmas, doctors.

383
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,659
- Merry Christmas.
- You letting them go home?

384
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,429
- You saw her sodium level.
- She needs to be home.

385
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,732
She could develop
central pontine myelinolysis.

386
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,240
- She could start seizing again.
- We'll recheck her level in the morning.

387
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,938
She promised to come back
after her kids opened their presents.

388
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,948
You're not gonna believe this.

389
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,914
Joe just called. He wants to
spend Christmas at his mother's.

390
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:49,021
- That could be fun.
- Without me.

391
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,248
Well, maybe it's
a family tradition.

392
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,985
- You can spend New Year's together.
- I guess.

393
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,428
Isn't this cute?

394
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:07,301
Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder,
Roy Orbison, together at last.

395
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,771
What did you just say?

396
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,968
My bad. Roy Orbison wasn't
blind, he just wore the glasses.

397
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,478
You sit down. I'm not
gonna tell you again.

398
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:19,949
- You're ruining our performance.
- No, you guys sound great. Keep going.

399
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,487
And don't yell at me again, or you
won't see any gifts under the tree.

400
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,488
Oops! My bad. You
won't see them anyway.

401
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,657
Ho, ho, ho, you piece of crap.

402
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,707
Resume compressions. Another
atropine and stand by with epi.

403
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,638
She's had eight
rounds of meds, Pratt.

404
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,038
Bring her mom in.

405
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,681
Five more minutes. Cardiac line might
help us catch up with her blood loss.

406
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,476
I'm getting her now.

407
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,481
No, I'll go get her.

408
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,385
- Mrs. Hopkins.
- Is she okay?

409
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,494
I'll let you guys talk.

410
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,195
Would you like to come
in and see your daughter?

411
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,497
Are you finished?

412
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,562
- How is she doing?
- Danielle's condition is very serious.

413
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,740
But you're helping
her. I can see that.

414
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,375
We've given her fluids.
We've given her medicines.

415
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:20,570
We've even opened up her chest, but
her heart's just not beating on its own.

416
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,276
What are you saying?

417
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,976
- Nadine, please...
- No. Just go back in there and help her.

418
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,879
It'd be good for her
to have you there.

419
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,315
Just hearing your voice.

420
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,327
Okay?

421
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,500
Sats are not coming up.

422
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,539
- It's getting harder to bag her.
- Up the rate. Watch her pressures.

423
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,335
It's okay. You can get close.

424
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,180
Hey, sweetie.

425
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,548
You have been so strong today.

426
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,694
Is she responding
to the calcium?

427
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,292
We've given her medications
to try to restart her heart...

428
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,830
but nothing's working.

429
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,061
She's lost too much blood.

430
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:22,974
They've been working
real hard to keep you here.

431
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,215
Remember how I told you
God does things for a reason?

432
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:34,280
Well, maybe he just wants
you with him real bad right now.

433
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,783
I want you to know...

434
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:46,393
I want you to know
that it's okay to let go.

435
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:50,468
You see, God doesn't want you to be
in any pain, and neither does Mommy.

436
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:57,599
Daddy and I, we
love you so much.

437
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,637
We will always love you.

438
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:07,447
So don't be afraid.

439
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,613
Don't be afraid.

440
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,225
It's all right.

441
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,294
- Rate's coming up.
- She's got a pulse.

442
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,932
Epi infusion, 0.1 cc per kilo.

443
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,125
- What's happening?
- Her heart's beating.

444
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,463
Package her up. Let's go.

445
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,038
- I want her fired. SAM:
Things got a little out of hand.

446
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,505
- She poured pee on me.
- At least it was your pee.

447
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,610
You think that's funny?
These guys saw it.

448
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,646
Saw it? We can still smell it. What did
you have for lunch? Asparagus fries?

449
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,377
We didn't see it, Santa.

450
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,983
No, but you heard it.

451
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,017
Yeah. And it sounded
good, you fat bastard.

452
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,686
- Dr. Clemente.
- Yeah, what's up?

453
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,450
Nice going, Santa.

454
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,823
That nurse boss you got there
threw urine on me. I want her fired.

455
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,794
- Eve did what?
- Yeah. These guys were out of control.

456
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,457
Eve told them to be quiet,
but they wouldn't listen.

457
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,034
So she pours pee on me?

458
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,966
- I want her fired.
- Oh, crap.

459
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,170
Hey, you listening to me?

460
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,534
Dr. Clemente?

461
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:08,173
- Your East Coast squeeze is here.
- Just tell her I'm with a patient.

462
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,576
She's kind of a looker...

463
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,344
- in an interstate off-ramp kind of way.
- Please, Frank. Please, please.

464
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:17,521
Hey, I need some help with
this. Where are you going?

465
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,057
Take it to Kovac.
He's the boss, right?

466
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,763
I talked to the cops. The
store owner ID'd the kids.

467
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,594
He's seen them around before.
They're gonna pick them up.

468
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,202
You're supposed to be holding
a room open for my GSW.

469
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,168
Tell her this kid can't wait.

470
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,501
Yeah, I don't care.
The kid can't wait.

471
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,405
Her chest is open.
She's got a pulse.

472
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,772
Two minutes and that's it.

473
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,544
O.R.'s full. They'll
take her soon.

474
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,517
Now. They'll take my child now.
Move her to another hospital.

475
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,179
- She's not stable enough.
- Call Shriners, Children's.

476
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:55,727
If they don't call back within 2 minutes,
I'll take her up myself. I promise, okay?

477
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,357
What did...? How did it go?

478
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,263
- Remember Debbie Allen from <i>Fame?</i>
- Yeah.

479
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,870
Well, Haleh makes her
look like Mother Teresa.

480
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,835
Next!

481
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:21,104
- You punched a patient.
- He's lucky I didn't have a gun.

482
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,044
- You can get suspended.
- He's a moron.

483
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,150
He's a moron who
wants to call his lawyer.

484
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,980
Good, I'll punch him too.
Now, keep the splint dry.

485
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,180
Watch for any pain,
numbness, discoloration.

486
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,655
Remember, just because
Santa's reindeer can fly...

487
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,488
- doesn't mean you can, okay?
- Eve.

488
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:36,856
I'm busy. Walk with me.

489
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,156
- Eve, hold on.
- What?

490
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,162
You need to go over
there and apologize.

491
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,325
You want me to say sorry to some
jerk who was teasing blind kids?

492
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:46,062
I want you to apologize so
we can salvage this situation.

493
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,036
- And if I don't?
- You can lose your job.

494
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,473
You may have gotten a gold star
and become chief of the department...

495
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,236
but I hate to break it to you.

496
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,677
Only the nursing
supervisor can fire me.

497
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:01,915
Okay, well, you got no signs of
ischemia, or LVH or arrhythmias.

498
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,384
So, what have I got?

499
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,581
You've got absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

500
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,658
- What about the headache?
- What headache?

501
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,057
- The terrible pounding between my eyes.
- Pounding?

502
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,993
- Yeah. It keeps me awake all night.
- Mm-hm.

503
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,224
- And it's worse during the day.
- Right.

504
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,096
- I'm starting to smell something.
- Yeah, I smell something.

505
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,567
- Yeah, me too.
- What is that?

506
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,069
- Bull crap, maybe?
- Oh, jeez.

507
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:23,266
First you say it's your stomach,
then your heart, then your head.

508
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,434
Look, I just can't go home.

509
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,340
Well, you got no choice, okay?

510
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,539
I need these beds
for really sick patients.

511
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,206
Look, I need this bed.

512
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,409
Yeah, well, you've
wasted enough tax dollars.

513
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,054
Just go home to
your wife. Just go.

514
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,456
My wife died about
four years ago.

515
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,717
So you're tired of
spending Christmas alone...

516
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,055
watching <i>Miracle on
34th Street</i> by yourself?

517
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,787
Yeah, especially
in living color.

518
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,456
- Right.
- How long you gonna keep me waiting?

519
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,866
I got a patient here, okay,
Jodie? Please, do you mind?

520
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,633
Yeah. You're signing him out.

521
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,277
No, I'm not signing
him out. He's really sick.

522
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,710
He's got Ohniatis
Muchgotow. He got it in Brazil.

523
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,543
- Right, Mickey?
- Yeah, right, Brazil.

524
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,146
I never heard of that.

525
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:09,914
Because you're an ICU nurse, that's
why. And this is a toxicology problem.

526
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,580
In fact, he needs to be
admitted and watched tonight...

527
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,226
and especially tomorrow.

528
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,555
Haleh. Haleh, please.

529
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,754
- Yeah. I've called you 20 times.
- Right.

530
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,662
And I haven't answered
you back for a reason.

531
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,301
- What's up?
- That's why I'm here.

532
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,302
- Because I wanted to see you in person.
- Breathe normally.

533
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,099
Okay, go back.
Go back to Jersey.

534
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,333
Go back to your husband.
Just leave me alone.

535
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,104
My husband is not gonna
find me, so just relax.

536
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,180
Your husband's a cop,
okay? Don't tell me to relax.

537
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,340
Dr. Clemente, do you need me?

538
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,076
Haleh, yes, I do.

539
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,347
Mr. Goldstein needs to be signed
in and needs to be observed for...

540
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:47,015
- Systemic Ponderosa.
- Systemic Ponderosa.

541
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,456
- What?
- What? You heard me.

542
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:53,189
Just write it down. I'll
explain it to you later.

543
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,095
Jodie, please.

544
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,463
Come on. Hurry up.

545
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,937
Have you witnessed
violent behavior before?

546
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,099
I never said she was violent.

547
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,801
Angry?

548
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,473
She's very good at her job.

549
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,816
- Today was just a hard day.
- Ms. Taggart...

550
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:15,318
Look, I don't feel comfortable
evaluating her. She's my boss.

551
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,978
That's part of management, Sam.

552
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,647
That's what everyone tells
me, but I don't understand...

553
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:23,318
why you can't just bring her in here
instead of talking behind her back.

554
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,556
I will talk to her, but we
believe in 360 evaluation here...

555
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,166
from supervisors,
peers and subordinates.

556
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,066
So I expect you to
be honest with me.

557
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,469
After she punched Santa and poured
the urine on him, what did she do?

558
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:37,768
She went to lunch.

559
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:43,640
Okay. Thank you for
your time, Ms. Taggart.

560
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,647
So, what happens now?

561
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,013
Well, this is grounds for
immediate termination.

562
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,151
Oh, come on. You can't
fire Eve on Christmas Eve.

563
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,853
Look, it was good between us,
okay? Actually, okay, it was great.

564
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,224
But that was for a while.

565
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,389
God, you look good.

566
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:04,400
You're married, which is something
you deliberately omitted when we first met.

567
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,538
- You knew.
- No, I didn't know.

568
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,571
Okay, at first, at first...

569
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,174
Okay, but you know what?

570
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,835
It doesn't matter now, because
I can't stop thinking about you.

571
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,913
Jodie. Jodie.
Jodie, stop it, stop it.

572
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:19,074
I want you to hop on the first
plane and get the hell out of here.

573
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,243
Before your husband
puts a bullet in my ass.

574
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,786
Just tell me the truth.

575
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,082
- Don't you miss it?
- Nope, not at all.

576
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,749
You never think about it?
You never think about us?

577
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,258
No, I don't think about us.

578
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:34,230
See, I think that whenever I
called, you wanted me to call.

579
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,630
- That's such bull.
- I think...

580
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:41,239
that whenever you heard my
voice, you sprung to attention.

581
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,238
Oh, come on.
Don't be ridiculous.

582
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:47,869
And you went into a room and
you saluted your little soldier.

583
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,440
- Big soldier.
- I know.

584
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,848
But, see, I'm here now, baby.

585
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,765
- Systolic's up to 83.
- The art line's a little hinky.

586
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:10,095
If the waveform looks
blunted, try repositioning.

587
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,948
This is probably
a waste of time.

588
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,165
But it's good for Residents and
students to get a look at young organs.

589
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,933
This is a child.
Keep that in mind.

590
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,408
I'll see you. They're
taking her up to Surgery.

591
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,309
Anesthesia will have some
more questions for you.

592
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:25,974
Danielle's a fighter. They're
gonna take good care of her.

593
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,279
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

594
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,622
- Hey.
- Hey. Is she gonna make it?

595
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,785
Not sure yet. Did they
find those shooters?

596
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:40,421
Still looking. I'll come back
later. I need to go out for a while.

597
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,295
Where are you going?

598
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,196
Come see.

599
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,702
When they find these jerks...

600
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,307
the cops should make them come
here, make them see what they've done.

601
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:57,112
- What's all this?
- It's a vigil for Danielle.

602
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,615
- But she's not dead.
- They're praying to keep her that way.

603
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:03,517
- Really?
- Really.

604
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,888
Not bad, Olivia. Not bad, baby.

605
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,290
Pratt. Our little girl bradied down
in the elevator, lost her pulse.

606
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:13,557
- Brought her back to Trauma 1.
- Tell them to keep praying.

607
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,853
Hey.

608
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,721
I just can't believe it.

609
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,519
On Christmas.

610
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,857
Yeah, I know. I'm so sorry.

611
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,664
I just tried so hard, you know.

612
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,302
Now it's all nothing.

613
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,698
You're gonna be fine.

614
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,396
Don't talk like that. You
know how hard it is out there.

615
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,542
Yeah, but you're experienced.

616
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,143
Hospitals are always looking
for good nurse managers.

617
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,979
What?

618
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,706
What are you talking about?

619
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,551
What are you talking about?

620
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,646
My boyfriend just dumped me.

621
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,058
Oh.

622
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,750
Wait a minute. What did you...?

623
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,224
Am I getting fired?

624
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,929
I didn't say that.

625
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,725
Answer me. Am I getting fired?

626
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,901
I gotta get back to work, okay?

627
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:30,736
What? Ugh.

628
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,377
Of course. What did I expect?

629
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:34,410
Come on. I'm setting
up a new life here.

630
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:38,107
I want as little drama as possible.
You can understand that, can't you?

631
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,683
Bobby hit me.

632
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,578
- What?
- Broke a rib.

633
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,589
I'm sorry, I didn't know,
but you didn't say anything.

634
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,590
Look, why didn't
you go to the police?

635
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,561
He is the police. All they would have done
is come over, give Bobby a high five...

636
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:56,862
and then had a beer
with him. I left him.

637
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,661
Vic, I'm not going back.

638
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:05,968
Now, I'm at the Marriott.

639
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,610
If you wanna call me, do.

640
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:14,409
And if you don't, then you
can have a nice holiday.

641
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,760
At least she's saving on long distance.
- Come on, Frank.

642
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,399
- Was that Jodie?
- How do you know her name?

643
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,768
She calls Frank about eight times
a day and I talk to her about three.

644
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,841
- That's great.
- Must have been.

645
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,340
- Your fly is down.
- Hey, Abby.

646
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,979
There's a snowplow
accident coming in.

647
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,480
I'm making Croatian bread and
a turkey. What are you cooking?

648
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,915
Cooking? Do you have amnesia
from the last time we dated?

649
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,656
I thought that little girl
was gonna die hours ago.

650
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,124
I guess she's not
ready to go yet.

651
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,695
- Is that them?
- We got confessions.

652
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:00,923
Thanks for bringing them.

653
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,826
- Hey, what are we doing here?
- Taking us to the morgue or something?

654
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,336
Somewhere even better. This way.

655
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,508
- What happened?
- She was fine until we tried to move her.

656
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,617
Holding compressions.

657
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,987
She's down on the
right. Tension pneumo.

658
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,555
Chest tube tray and
14 French for Dr. Pratt.

659
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,522
- I got the heart.
- What's happening?

660
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,355
Her lung collapsed. We're
inserting a tube to reinflate it.

661
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,020
- Nadine?
- They found them?

662
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,360
They're outside. Is it
okay if we bring them in?

663
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,469
I don't wanna be in here for
that. I need to see my daughter.

664
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,574
Go through there and wait in the
hall. I'll come and get you in a minute.

665
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,401
- Hey, nice shot, guys.
- We didn't shoot no girl.

666
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,810
You didn't mean to. Your bullet
went through that guy and landed here.

667
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,644
- No, dog.
- Yeah, dog, right into her belly.

668
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,548
Ripped through her liver, her
intestines and her spleen too.

669
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,021
Took out countless veins and arteries,
caused her abdomen to fill up with blood.

670
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,888
- We had to crack her chest open.
- Yo, get us out of here.

671
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,327
No, no, stay. Admire your
work. You know, your one shot...

672
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,435
is probably gonna kill this little girl.
And if she lives, well, think about it.

673
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,503
What if this was
your sister lying here?

674
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:16,574
Have to have her intestines removed and
crap into a bag for the rest of her life?

675
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,437
- Answer me.
- Come on, man.

676
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,377
While you're in jail, I want you to
remember what you did to this little girl.

677
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,949
And for what? A dime bag? Because
somebody looked at you wrong?

678
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,380
Let's get them out of here.

679
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,851
Her name's Danielle
Hopkins. She's 6 years old.

680
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,222
Hey. You got me fired?

681
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,364
I have nothing to do with you.
Check with the nursing supervisor.

682
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,729
She said I had to clear out within
two hours. You know it's Christmas?

683
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,425
You'll be missed.

684
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,770
- Bite me.
- Don't make me call security.

685
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:51,569
No, it's fine, I'm leaving on my own.
But I tried to do something good here.

686
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,302
I tried to elevate
this stupid ER.

687
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,913
Instead of getting praise, I
get fired on Christmas Eve?

688
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,449
- Screw yourselves. You all suck.
- Come on, calm down.

689
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,779
Oh, you, behind my
back, trying to get my job.

690
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,615
Merry Christmas, Judas.

691
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,836
They've controlled the
bleeding. Vitals are good.

692
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,529
Looks like she's
gonna pull through this.

693
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,475
Always wanted a girl.

694
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,637
Thought it would
be easier, safer.

695
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,340
Those guys are gonna
pay for what they did.

696
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,452
I don't want them to
pay. I want them to stop.

697
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,816
We turn our backs on these
kids, we don't educate them...

698
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,186
and then we wonder
why this happens.

699
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,186
People have choices.

700
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,766
Some people don't know they do.

701
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,495
- Is it over?
- Not bad for your first shift.

702
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,267
- You cleared the board and an employee.
- I had no choice.

703
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,673
Yep. I gotta go get
Henry. I'll see you at Ike's.

704
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,278
Hey, what's up?

705
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,937
Nothing.

706
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,208
I'm gonna go play my game.

707
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:09,177
Thank you so much for having
a play date on Christmas Eve.

708
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,220
I can take them on
New Year's if you want.

709
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,358
You know, Sam, I don't think so.

710
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,128
Why, what's wrong?
Is there a problem?

711
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,763
Alex keeps telling
Willie his father's dead.

712
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,898
- That's not true.
- And now he's telling Willie...

713
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,625
his dad's gonna die too.

714
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,864
I'm sure he's
just joking around.

715
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,972
Sam, Alex needs help.

716
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,234
Until you get that for him, I'd
prefer he not hang out with Willie.

717
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,901
- Heather...
- I'm sorry.

718
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,376
Anything I can do?

719
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,218
Thanks, I got it.

720
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,721
Alex?

721
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,359
What's up?

722
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,630
Why did you tell Willie
that your father is dead?

723
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,563
Hey. Answer me.

724
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:04,000
I don't need him, so
that's like being dead.

725
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,942
Come on. Your dad has problems,
but he loves you, you know that.

726
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:11,241
- I know you love him.
- If he loved me, he'd call.

727
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,945
He can't call you, Alex.

728
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,850
- But he misses you.
- No, he doesn't.

729
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,456
You're just lying for him.

730
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,556
- Hey.
- Hi.

731
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,723
- What's this?
- Part of your present.

732
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,390
Open it.

733
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,438
Wow.

734
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,910
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

735
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,913
This... This beats
what I got you.

736
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,845
Open yours.

737
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:14,923
- A compass?
- I know it's corny, but...

738
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,762
it seems we always
find each other.

739
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,637
It's beautiful.

740
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,007
Can we talk?

741
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,211
Yeah, sure.

742
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,616
- You okay?
- Yeah.

743
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,348
Maybe go outside for a minute?

744
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,064
Okay.

745
00:42:57,475 --> 00:43:00,138
- I don't know how to say this.
- What?

746
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,247
Well, It's just that these past
three weeks have been really...

747
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,112
You know, I couldn't
have imagined it better.

748
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:09,652
- For me too.
- Yeah. And I haven't laughed so much...

749
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:13,758
or felt so good in a really long time. I
don't wanna do anything to ruin that.

750
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,451
- Hey, you won't, I promise.
- Look, Luka.

751
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,822
Yeah?

752
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,429
Oh, man.

753
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,892
- What?
- I'm pregnant.
