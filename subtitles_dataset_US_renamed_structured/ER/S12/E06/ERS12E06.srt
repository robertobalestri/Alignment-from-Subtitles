1
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:05,870
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,634
- Who are you?
- Victor Clemente, your new Attending.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,869
And congratulations,
doc, you just killed me.

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,344
I know what happened in Newark,
and I really do not want a repeat here.

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,579
Hear you're getting out.

6
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:17,485
It stunk to work here?
Try being a patient.

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:18,812
- Zoe.
- Yes?

8
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,186
- You know what you're doing?
- I know what I'd like to.

9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,041
- I'm your half-brother.
- Good to meet you.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,889
This is my wife, Evelyn,
and my daughter, Jocelyn.

11
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,029
Uh, this is Greg. My son.

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,994
You don't wanna have
anything to do with me.

13
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,404
- But what about your brother?
- Don't use him like that.

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,900
- I'm trying here.
- Then stop.

15
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,083
- Getting ready for a roast?
- We gotta clean this place up.

16
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,742
- Gallant won't be here for three days.
- It's gonna take a week to disinfect.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,287
I want it nice for him.
He's been there a long time.

18
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,821
Come on, we're gonna be late.

19
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,794
Oh. Hi, I'm Zoe.

20
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,455
Yeah. I remember.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,064
You have a cool place.

22
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,762
Thin walls, though.

23
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,827
Oh, sometimes we
really get it going.

24
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,501
Have you seen my... toothbrush?

25
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:14,936
Sorry.

26
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,971
Keep it. I have gum.

27
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,745
- You're just leaving her here?
- Afraid she's gonna steal something?

28
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,852
- She already took my toothbrush.
- Don't worry. She'll lock up.

29
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,853
- You gave her keys?
- It's different with Zoe.

30
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,820
There's something
real between us.

31
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,927
Yeah. Real loud.

32
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,095
Wouldn't admit him because what?

33
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,631
Too young?

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,429
Yeah, we got a NICU...

35
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,165
but it's not exactly SOP.

36
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,807
"SOP"?

37
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,375
Standard operating
procedure. It's military talk.

38
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,012
- Ah. That must mean you like him.
- Ha-ha-ha.

39
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,943
It's gonna take a
little more than that.

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,208
All right, all right.
But you owe me, man.

41
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,715
- Lockhart?
- Abby.

42
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:02,345
Incoming. I need a room with a warmer
set up for an infant, Miller 1 and a 2.5.

43
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,514
2.5? What's it, a preemie?

44
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,684
Yeah, but... We got it, thanks.

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,364
You can see it in his eyes. It's
starting to sink in on the poor sucker.

46
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,058
What is?

47
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,533
- That he actually works here.
- Hmm.

48
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,302
This is a special case. Needs to
be treated on the DL, you follow?

49
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,811
- Is it your illegitimate love child?
- Try to be cool, okay?

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,211
Nine-week-old, two days
vomiting, diarrhea, fever.

51
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,011
- Vitals?
- Tachy. Couldn't get a BP.

52
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,517
- How about a sat?
- Probe wouldn't stick to the fur.

53
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:37,488
Easy, easy. Lockhart,
this is Darwin.

54
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,224
That's the ugliest
baby I've ever seen.

55
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,881
Okay, folks, the good news is
the hospital has approved 4:1 ratios.

56
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,852
- Finally.
- That means extra full-time equivalents...

57
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:47,484
and zero, zero, tolerance
for excessive OT.

58
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,823
Let's hope we have enough
people to fill those shifts.

59
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,988
<i>Sam, you got a haircut.</i>

60
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,224
No. It's just highlights.

61
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,402
<i>Good morning, ER staff.</i>

62
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,561
So it's true. We're not alone.

63
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,036
What's going on?

64
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,802
<i>Well, this device was designed
to offer remote surgical consults.</i>

65
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>So since I'm still at
home recovering...</i>

66
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,141
<i>thought I'd give
it a test drive.</i>

67
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,872
Okay. Meeting's over.

68
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,419
<i>Nurses, for the sake of the
trial, I'm gonna need a few things.</i>

69
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,920
- I miss the Bronx.
- This is why I don't have cable.

70
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,684
- How are you doing that?
<i>- I have a joystick in my lap.</i>

71
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,454
All right, that is too
much information.

72
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,163
- Sam, we're gonna be in sutures.
- You need help?

73
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,823
- No, that's okay. We got it.
<i>- Morning, Dr. Lockhart.</i>

74
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,338
- Some kid in triage asking for you.
- Tell him to take a number.

75
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,372
He says he knows you.

76
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,770
Oh, yeah. Set him up in 2, okay?

77
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,471
Okay.

78
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,079
Haleh, walk with me.

79
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,051
- You sure like to walk.
- Remember that little chat we had?

80
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,020
No more OT. I did
what I promised.

81
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,525
You're picking up extra
time by taking shifts in ICU.

82
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,889
You never said I couldn't.

83
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,965
I also didn't say you couldn't flip
burgers or turn tricks in Lincoln Park.

84
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,362
Excuse me?

85
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,868
It's overtime. You know
what I'm talking about.

86
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,740
I'm sorry. It won't
happen again.

87
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,546
Okay, his temperature's only 94.

88
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,480
I must have skipped school the
day they taught monkey veins.

89
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,211
Word is you give good neonate.

90
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:23,084
Human neonate, Dr. Moreau.

91
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,420
Bet you didn't know chimps and
humans share 96 percent of their DNA.

92
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,959
I know, it's fascinating.
So this is what happened:

93
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,497
Darwin's handler calls me up and
tells me that the vet's kind of nervous.

94
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,965
He figures this little
guy's best shot is with me.

95
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,299
- Oh, of course he does.
- Tachy, carotid's weak.

96
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,805
This handler, he knows you because
you went to clown school together?

97
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,443
How did you guess?

98
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,341
No, I'm serious. I was at NYU
while he was at Ringling Bros.

99
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,244
- I had kind of a circus thing.
- Okay.

100
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,585
We need access, Lockhart.

101
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,154
Right. Abby. I'll try to
find a transilluminator.

102
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,622
- Is there anyone else we can trust?
- What are we doing?

103
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,324
I'm an attending. I can't
spend all day with a chimp.

104
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,088
I know. So, what are we doing?

105
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,133
Go, go, go. Okay, okay, go, go.

106
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,065
Don't forget to knock, okay?

107
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,968
Please, go.

108
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,869
I heard you have a baby
there. You need help?

109
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,273
No. I... We got it.

110
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,678
- Is it cute?
- Yes, it's a hairy little monkey.

111
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,341
I love babies. Babies love
me. I have a way with them.

112
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,886
- Can you get me a transilluminator?
- I'm like the wind.

113
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,891
Oh, hey, Neela. Do
you have a minute?

114
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,221
- We could use an extra set of hands.
- "We"?

115
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,626
Clemente and I have a patient.

116
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,856
Sure.

117
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,922
Come on. Hurry up.

118
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:48,303
- Transilluminator was MIA, but I...
- Forget that, I got a 24 in the antecube.

119
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,000
Wait. What?

120
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,208
- You two do realize that's a monkey.
- Chimp, actually.

121
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,375
Ninety-six percent
human. Who knew?

122
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,245
So how did this happen?

123
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,152
I was just horsing around.

124
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,724
Looks like you did
a bit more than that.

125
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,555
I got in a fight.

126
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,424
Where? At school?

127
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,259
No, at home. With Dad.

128
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,727
- Did he hit you?
- No, man, he doesn't do that.

129
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,633
So, what were
you fighting about?

130
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,332
I always felt there was something
going on in my house I didn't know about.

131
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,646
Then I met you, and I got it.

132
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,081
It was like... It was
like a cloud was lifted.

133
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,883
But the cloud came back.

134
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,384
- You mean, because I cut off Charlie?
- Not just him, man, you cut me off too.

135
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,959
I don't want it to be like that.

136
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,924
I mean, ain't we brothers?

137
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,733
This may be worse
off than it looks.

138
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,364
Sounds like they need this
room for an actual patient.

139
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,376
Thing they share with humans is a
tendency to get sepsis as neonates.

140
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:04,612
So let's go with a CBC, D-stick, cultures,
portable chest and 20 cc's per kilo bolus.

141
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,753
Oh, that's all? No Foley, no LP?

142
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,788
Tap might be jumping the
gun, but Foley's not a bad idea.

143
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,980
Hold on a second.

144
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,658
<i>Hello, Dr. Clemente?</i>

145
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,729
- Yes, Eve.
<i>- We're over here in Trauma 2...</i>

146
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,091
<i>with our friend Jessie...</i>

147
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,256
<i>who has multiple
fractures from a fall.</i>

148
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:24,131
<i>We were just wondering if it would be
possible for you to get your ass in here.</i>

149
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,102
All right, all right, all
right. Shake a leg, okay?

150
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,303
Because if this chimp gets sepsis,
he could crump at any minute.

151
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,312
And lock the door.

152
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,117
We should take core temp.

153
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,380
I'm not sticking anything
up this monkey's ass.

154
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,456
If I had a nickel for
every time I said that...

155
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,354
How about we flip for it?

156
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,825
- Fine.
- The transilluminator's missing a bulb...

157
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,829
but I thought I'd give you a
little help with this sweet little...

158
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,990
Hah! By all that
is good and holy...

159
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,568
what diabolical spell
have you cast on this child?

160
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,200
Dr. Pratt, can you
sign off on this chart?

161
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,062
Who's it for?

162
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:37,173
The kid in 2, got
into it with his father.

163
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,335
- Wait. What?
- Social work's in with him now.

164
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,708
- You weren't supposed to do a chart.
- I have to.

165
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,076
No, it's not like that.

166
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,651
Eve's strict with this stuff. Suspicion
of abuse, I have to call them in.

167
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,915
- I don't need any help. I'm fine.
- That's not how it looks.

168
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,991
Why do I gotta go
through this with her?

169
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,888
- I'm Dr. Pratt.
- Liz Dade, social work.

170
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,188
- Can I talk to you outside?
- When I'm finished.

171
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,092
- The thing is...
- I'm not finished yet.

172
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,698
Well, I think you should be.

173
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,694
Look, the nurse jumped the gun, okay?
I know this family. It's a stable home.

174
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,669
It's an innocent argument.
The kid got a little too steamed.

175
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,206
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,908
- And nobody hit anybody?
- I just got real mad at a chair.

177
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,574
That's not gonna do it.

178
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,018
Okay, look here, all
right. He's my brother.

179
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,114
- Okay?
- His brother?

180
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,880
Yeah. Same last
name, check it out.

181
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,458
Why didn't you just say so?
I'll do a follow-up phone call.

182
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,729
- Sally.
- Tom Cruise? Retarded.

183
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,196
- Sally.
- Sammy Sosa's retarded.

184
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,931
Son of a bitch.

185
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,775
- Sam.
- Ah!

186
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,043
- Yeah, I just...
- No, that's all right.

187
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,341
How retarded was that, huh?

188
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,082
Listen, I overheard
you talking to Inez.

189
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,313
Oh. Sorry about that. It's just
sometimes she needs a little guidance.

190
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,616
No, that's okay. I'm
actually really impressed.

191
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,760
You have fantastic
interpersonal skills.

192
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,897
The younger nurses respect
you, the older ones trust you.

193
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,258
Oh. Thanks.

194
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,457
So I think it's time you
moved up the ladder.

195
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,994
What ladder?

196
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,831
Nursing administration.

197
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,236
- I'm pretty happy doing what I'm doing.
- Job wouldn't change much.

198
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,104
You'd help out with staff education,
implementing policies and procedures.

199
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,770
- Sounds like a lot of work.
- There'd be a big pay hike.

200
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,446
- How big?
- Shopping-on-Michigan-Avenue big.

201
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,613
Well, if you put it that
way... When do I start?

202
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,817
Right away. First thing I
need you to do is fire Haleh.

203
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,121
- Hold on. What?
- Welcome to management.

204
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:42,959
Eve.

205
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,604
- Is it done?
- No.

206
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,967
Inez, how's that pulse
ox probe working out?

207
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,438
Fine.

208
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,141
I'm not gonna fire Haleh.

209
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,802
- Hey, management's a bitch.
- Yeah, not the only one.

210
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,574
You know, Haleh's been warned
three times, twice in writing.

211
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,615
- She has?
- With all the OT she's doing...

212
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:02,415
we could hire two nurses and still
have enough for a wet bar in the lounge.

213
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,285
Well, then let's counsel her.

214
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,153
Yeah. You're confusing
me with Oprah.

215
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,125
Dr. Clemente, did you sign
in this patient in sutures?

216
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,025
No, no, no. VIP.

217
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,430
What, is he the reincarnation
of the Dalai Lama or something?

218
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,968
No, no, it's a privacy
issue kind of thing.

219
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,732
Well, he still needs to be tracked.
Give me a name, any name.

220
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,672
- Darwin.
- Darwin what?

221
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,441
Magilla.

222
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,047
Are you gonna need a NICU bed?

223
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,811
No, no, because we were transferring
him back to the referring facility.

224
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,545
It's closer to where he lives.

225
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,819
The mom doesn't drive.

226
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,459
I'm not doing it. I don't
need the job that bad.

227
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,500
- Either way, Haleh's gonna go.
- But she's a great nurse.

228
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,200
- You've never fired anyone before.
- No.

229
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,171
All right, okay. It's a new
skill, it needs to be developed.

230
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,570
We'll do it together.

231
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,507
- What?
- Cheer up. It won't be so bad.

232
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,477
Listen, my EMT trainees are
waiting for their 12-lead class.

233
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,674
I'll come find you after.

234
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,721
Hey. Hey, you
left the door open.

235
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,716
All right. So, doctors,
what's the status report?

236
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,124
Heart rate's down. He's
on 100 percent room air.

237
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,594
Took 8 ounces PO.

238
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,700
Oh, that's great. Good
little guy. Good little guy.

239
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,359
Let's ship him out before
they put us on a psych hold.

240
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,198
Shouldn't we keep him a while?

241
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,363
- Yeah, for observation.
- He's awfully young.

242
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,032
Guys, guys, it's just a
bad viral GE. That's all.

243
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,974
We should recheck the cultures.
- A vet can do that.

244
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,741
Well, he's gonna need
another round of antibiotics.

245
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,741
I thought you
didn't like monkeys.

246
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,046
- I never said that.
- And anyway, he's not a monkey.

247
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,888
Okay. I don't know if I'm touched or
if I'm nauseous, but you know what?

248
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,687
We're done here. So D/C the
lock and let's get a move on.

249
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,386
There's a giraffe out
there clogging up triage.

250
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,532
Twelve-year-old
crushed under scaffolding.

251
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,999
- What's your name, little man?
- Barry. Is my pop all right?

252
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,570
Chest injury, respiratory
distress, vitals stable.

253
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,707
- What happened to his father?
- Everything fell.

254
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,240
- Had an MI trying to dig him out.
- Ray, that's you.

255
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,674
- I'll check on him. PRATT:
Both lungs up. Let's go.

256
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,780
- Cardiac arrest during exertion.
- Downtime?

257
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,917
Maybe 12 minutes. Shocked him
three times with epi and atropine.

258
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,279
Full compressions.

259
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,216
Pulse is V-tach.
Let's go, let's go.

260
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:17,016
Okay, kiddo, deep breath now.

261
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,386
- It hurts.
- A little bit of stridor here.

262
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,754
Pulse ox 92.

263
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,725
Chest, C-spine, pelvis, CBC.

264
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,796
- You hang in there, Bar.
- Thank you, ma'am.

265
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,432
Chem-7, UA, type and screen.

266
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,931
Five hundred cc saline bolus.

267
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,229
Okay. Simon says
squeeze my fingers, pal.

268
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,668
Good man. Now
wiggle those toes for me.

269
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,968
- I'll be right back.
- Oh! I didn't say "Simon says."

270
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,110
Shock again at 360.

271
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,873
- Rhythm.
- I got a pulse. Check the BP.

272
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,949
It's hard to keep track
of the Splenda in here.

273
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,444
- Pupils sluggish but reactive.
- Let's hope for neurological function.

274
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,749
- God.
- What, no response?

275
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,259
- No.
- BP's 100 over 70.

276
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,758
His GCS is only 3.

277
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,420
Fellas, if we save the heart and lose
the brain, we might as well go home.

278
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,295
Worsening respiratory distress in here.
- Okay, I'm coming.

279
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,232
Pop! Pop!

280
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,799
We need to paralyze
and intubate. 6.5 ET tube.

281
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,306
- Yeah, hold on.
- Is he okay?

282
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,001
He will be. Why
is he so stridorous?

283
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,440
Laryngeal injury?

284
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,082
No. No neck injury,
no midline shift.

285
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,480
Okay, give me some
lido and a towel clip.

286
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,621
- Clavicle's displaced?
- I think it's compressing the trachea.

287
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,417
He needs an airway right now.
Draw up etomidate and sux.

288
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,320
- Don't push anything yet.
- Pratt.

289
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,587
So, Barry, what's
your dad building?

290
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,991
Our dream house.

291
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,496
Oh, yeah?

292
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,860
It's for my mom.

293
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,160
That sounds nice, buddy.

294
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,667
Okay, buddy, you're
gonna feel a little stick here.

295
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,734
I'm helping.

296
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,536
Pratt, push the etomidate.

297
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,234
Hold on. I just need
to get a good grip.

298
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:50,011
Okay. So, Barry, what
kind of house is it?

299
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,373
Craftsman. Ah!

300
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,212
<i>Is he all right?</i>

301
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,720
Sats coming up.
Pulse is normalizing.

302
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,188
Vitals are stable,
tenderness over the lower ribs.

303
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,657
<i>Get a CT abdomen and
chest. What's next door?</i>

304
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,491
V-tach arrest. We got him back.

305
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,765
Is that a robot doctor?

306
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,869
Oh, yeah. We're
very advanced here.

307
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,497
- How's it going?
- He's not waking up.

308
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,164
- We've got ROSC without RONF.
- Come again?

309
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,800
<i>Return of spontaneous circulation
without return of neurologic function.</i>

310
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,210
- The downtime was over 10 minutes.
<i>- Not good enough for brain cells.</i>

311
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,872
- Cath lab?
- No, I don't think so.

312
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,282
- All he's got is a little ST depression.
<i>- I think ICU.</i>

313
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,682
No, no, not yet. We're gonna
go with a portable chest...

314
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,723
- and a cardiac echo.
- What for?

315
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:36,385
A little ditty I like to call "induced
hypothermia." I'll be right back.

316
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,428
How you doing?

317
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,092
Me? I'm okay.

318
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,830
The board's not too backed
up. You need anything?

319
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,497
No. I'm good.

320
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,575
I kind of like this new energy.

321
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,006
You mean Eve?

322
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:56,411
She's tough, but it's gonna be
good for all of us in the long run.

323
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,914
Yeah, I hope so.

324
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,076
This new nurse manager's
working out, huh?

325
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,584
She's a terrorist, Neela.

326
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,556
- Zoe.
- Hi. Heh.

327
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,389
Are you looking for Ray?

328
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,726
Oh, no. Actually, I was
hoping you could help me.

329
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,930
Where did you get this thing?

330
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,040
I stole it from the last place I worked
at. Hey, but that's between us, okay?

331
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,436
How cold do you set it?

332
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,770
- Thirty-three degrees centigrade.
<i>- Ninety Fahrenheit.</i>

333
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,937
<i>- Which many consider dangerous.</i>
- We're decreasing his metabolism?

334
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,243
Six percent per degree centigrade.
Might get his brain started again.

335
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,909
<i>What about effect on oxygen
demand in low-flow regions?</i>

336
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,147
The studies show a 23 percent
improvement in neurologic outcome.

337
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,621
<i>Yeah, I'm familiar
with the literature.</i>

338
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,387
Okay, that's it. I'm done
arguing with a television set.

339
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,622
<i>It's believed to suppress
radical formation...</i>

340
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,494
<i>Did you just call me a
television set? That's pretty funny.</i>

341
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,465
This isn't surgical
consult, my friend.

342
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,763
<i>It's believed to suppress
radical formation...</i>

343
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,999
If you can't come to work, I don't
see why we should listen to you.

344
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,302
You little mechanical bitch.

345
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,104
It kind of burns when I pee.

346
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,276
It sounds like a
bladder infection.

347
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:02,976
Oh, I figured.

348
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:08,019
You can get it from many
things, like having sex. A lot.

349
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,815
I've been doing that.

350
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,321
Don't I know it.

351
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,121
Look, I hope you don't mind. I just
didn't wanna ask Ray to do this, you know.

352
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,993
It's fine. I'll need a urine
sample and run some tests...

353
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,658
but first I'll need to
get some information.

354
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,201
Name?

355
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,803
Butler. Zoe Butler.

356
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,873
Okay. Address?

357
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,508
1226 Parkington Road.

358
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,042
Okay. Date of birth?

359
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,339
December 12th...

360
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,907
1990.

361
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,320
- Sorry?
- December 12th.

362
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,687
No, I know...

363
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,922
1990.

364
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:51,929
1990. So you're... 14 years old?

365
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,526
Almost 15.

366
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,561
My birthday's coming up. Heh.

367
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,740
When will he wake up?

368
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,712
Soon, we hope.

369
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,747
He cheated.

370
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,892
On a business trip, with
some lady from work.

371
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,086
When my mom found out, she
wouldn't let him come home for a month.

372
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,097
He lived in a hotel.

373
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,926
You know, parents
make mistakes too.

374
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,762
He's trying to
make it up to her.

375
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,031
Is that what the house is for?

376
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,704
He wants everything
back the way it was.

377
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,073
Barry. Are you okay?

378
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,010
Yeah, Mom. I'm okay.

379
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,177
He's got some broken bones
and a small injury to his liver...

380
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,880
but we don't think
he'll need surgery.

381
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,787
And Paul?

382
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,128
Your husband's
had a heart attack.

383
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,461
His brain's been
deprived of oxygen.

384
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,999
We're doing our best
to help wake him up.

385
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,232
Excuse me.

386
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,468
- What's the big hurry?
- Zoe's here. She's in Exam 2.

387
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,270
- She is?
- Yes, she is.

388
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,915
Oh, and I almost forgot,
she's 14 years old.

389
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,383
- Shut up.
- She was born in 1990, Ray.

390
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,545
What?

391
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,216
That's the decade immediately
preceding the one that we're in.

392
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,024
- Are you for real?
- Yes.

393
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:36,033
And in prison math, I
believe 14 equals five to ten.

394
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,527
- Where is she?
- Exam 2.

395
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,900
- Okay.
- And here's the kicker, Jerry Lee:

396
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,441
Your prepubescent
penis pal has chlamydia.

397
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,439
I had no idea she
was that young.

398
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,137
Young? She's still teething.

399
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,374
Although, I don't know,
maybe you enjoy that.

400
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,950
She didn't say anything.
How was I supposed to know?

401
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,918
Take her out for a coffee,
converse with her a bit...

402
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,614
before you start boffing
and handing out house keys.

403
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,250
- I don't card my dates, okay?
- Maybe it's time you started.

404
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,725
- 1990?
- It was a very good year for chlamydia.

405
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,332
Hmm.

406
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,166
Why didn't you tell me?

407
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,934
I thought it was a bladder infection
from all the sex we were having.

408
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,665
No. God, not that.

409
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,673
Why didn't you tell
me how old you are?

410
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,039
Well, you never asked. Heh.

411
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,617
- You said you were a student.
- I am.

412
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,343
In what, ninth grade?

413
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,277
Eighth.

414
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,786
But I didn't think you'd
like me if you knew.

415
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,321
Well, you know, you're right.

416
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,293
Because I also don't like
courtrooms and prisons...

417
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,660
and men named Hank
who'd make me their bitch.

418
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,995
What is the big deal?
We like each other.

419
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,838
It's fun. Wait, who's Hank?

420
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,373
Zoe, I'm gonna give you a prescription
for doxycycline for the chlamydia.

421
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,477
You're gonna need to be tested
for a bunch of other STDs, okay?

422
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,012
- Like gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV...
- Sure, whatever.

423
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,379
And under the circumstances,
no parental consent is required.

424
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,576
- That's good.
- Thank God.

425
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,583
Wonder who I got it from.

426
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,018
Not me. Heh.

427
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,455
Whoa. Uh...

428
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,893
- How many other candidates are there?
- Wait, were we being monogamous?

429
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,674
- Starting to shiver.
- All right, try 25 of Demerol, IV push.

430
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,571
- Is his wife coming in?
- Not just yet.

431
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,074
Sam. Ready?

432
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,008
- For what?
- Haleh's in the family room.

433
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,373
Go ahead, I got this.
I'll push the meds.

434
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,643
Wait a second. Wait a second.

435
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:36,255
- Can we not do this? It's wrong.
- You think I find this enjoyable?

436
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,857
Firing Haleh will send a
message to every nurse in this joint.

437
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,891
Joint? We're not in jail, Eve.

438
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,553
No, but it should
feel like we are.

439
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,056
Haleh.

440
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,429
Is something wrong?

441
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,595
Well, we've had quite a few meetings
about your overtime, right, Haleh?

442
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,503
- Uh-huh.
- And I've discussed...

443
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,234
those meetings with Sam.

444
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,935
Right, Sam?

445
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,403
Yeah, I guess.

446
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,011
Haleh, uh...

447
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,920
you are a wonderful nurse.

448
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,255
And I'm sure that you're
gonna continue to do great work.

449
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,761
But...

450
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:22,100
It's gonna have to be
at some other hospital.

451
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:23,894
Excuse me?

452
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,900
It's just that you've been
warned three times and...

453
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,745
We're gonna have to let you go.

454
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,278
You're not serious.

455
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:39,979
Is she serious?

456
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,085
You can report to HR tomorrow.

457
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,283
You can't do this.

458
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,792
And you can turn in your badge
and you'll collect your last paycheck.

459
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,487
Sam.

460
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,265
Oh, Haleh, I'm so sorry.

461
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,256
- You just getting out?
- Yeah.

462
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,085
I read some magazines.

463
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:22,854
Never realized a human
esophagus could be so complex.

464
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:27,029
Hey, look, man. You know,
I'm sorry about all of this.

465
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:31,101
But you got to understand, it's like this
because of the choices that Charlie made.

466
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,533
It's not all me.

467
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,271
Dad's a hard guy to figure.

468
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:40,508
I think maybe some stuff
happened that he never talked about.

469
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,981
Maybe so.

470
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,549
I think there's some stuff
you don't know too, Greg.

471
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:50,689
Some stuff that maybe your
mom didn't tell you the truth about.

472
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,386
Is that what he told you?

473
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,317
Yeah.

474
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,192
Radiology faxed
down these results.

475
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,391
I just got here,
Frank. What patient?

476
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,399
It's me, actually.

477
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,703
I had a mammogram
last week. It's normal.

478
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,673
- Oh.
- Hey, congratulations.

479
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,710
I'm out of here.
The kid in 1's stable.

480
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,644
- You watching the dad?
- Yeah, I'm on the case.

481
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,183
Frank, will you forward
anything for me to my house?

482
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,684
Of course.

483
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,050
We're all really sorry, Haleh.

484
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,715
Thanks.

485
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:29,225
I'll try to come
by for a visit...

486
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,023
when I'm up to it.

487
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,097
- Take care.
- Bye, Haleh.

488
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:42,206
What? ALL: Nothing.

489
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,343
- What happened?
- Sam fired Haleh.

490
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,446
Oh, screw you, Frank.
Eve fired her. I just...

491
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:48,774
Helped?

492
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,882
I'm sorry. That's the
word on the street.

493
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,555
- Eve's making a statement?
- And all the words are dirty.

494
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:58,947
- Lockhart.
- Abby.

495
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,356
Code banana. Our
VIP's bouncing back.

496
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,123
Haleh.

497
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,966
Wait.

498
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,232
Haleh, I feel
terrible about this.

499
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,775
Who covered for you all those
times your kid was in trouble?

500
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,807
How many shifts were you
late or had to leave early?

501
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,473
And now you're gonna fire
me for too much overtime?

502
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,477
For what, Sam?

503
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,646
A couple extra
hundred bucks a month.

504
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,394
You calling her a liar?

505
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,136
- I don't know who you mean.
- My mother.

506
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,609
Isn't that what you said?

507
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,305
- Slow down, son.
- Don't you ever call me that.

508
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,506
Ever.

509
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,315
You wanna talk about
why you're upset?

510
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,648
I'm not one of those
little CeaseFire punks...

511
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:06,121
you've convinced you have
wisdom. Don't forget, I know you.

512
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,522
You're not a lesson or a
role model for anybody.

513
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:12,153
You don't know everything. How it
all went down when you were little.

514
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,096
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Then why the hell are you here?

515
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:20,537
You've already lost one son. Don't
make the same mistake with Chaz.

516
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,835
- You come to give me advice?
- Don't bring him into this.

517
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,875
Okay? Don't talk
to him about it.

518
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,842
He asked. He needed to know.

519
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,347
Know what? Know
what, how you spin it?

520
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,919
Some nonsense about a dead
woman who happens to be my mother?

521
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,390
She wasted her life away taking
care of me with no help from you.

522
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:41,686
- Nothing.
- I tried to come back.

523
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,060
She wouldn't let me.

524
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:50,832
Look. I can see we
both had rough days.

525
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,201
- Let's not do this tonight.
- Hey, don't turn away from me.

526
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,244
You can come by the
house some other time.

527
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,507
There's something of your
mother's I think you should have.

528
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,174
You've got something of hers?

529
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,879
It belongs to me and her.

530
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,084
Maybe they belong with you now.

531
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,756
Whatever it is, I want it.

532
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,264
You heard what I said. You
can come by the house...

533
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,865
Right now.

534
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,961
Right now.

535
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:36,239
He started breathing hard again,
so I brought him right back here.

536
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,816
- I thought you said he was okay.
- He was, Alonzo.

537
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:43,820
He looked great after the bolus.
He was drinking and playing.

538
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,024
- Bag him. He's not moving air.
- Maybe you should've kept him longer.

539
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,857
No, he seemed buffed after the fluid.
We thought it was just dehydration.

540
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,522
I promised Cookie's
owners he'd be okay.

541
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,566
- Who's Cookie?
- Darwin's mom.

542
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,398
She belongs to this super-nice
couple from Evanston.

543
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,439
- I also keep their llama.
- BP 66 over 25.

544
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,906
He's got hypotension with
a widened pulse pressure.

545
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,773
- Sepsis.
- Dopamine at 10 mics.

546
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,438
He's got a bacterial
infection in his blood.

547
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,380
- But you gave antibiotics.
- Which rupture the bacteria...

548
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,953
releasing endotoxins which
can make things worse.

549
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,589
- Suction.
- I'm so sorry, man.

550
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,249
I thought he was doing
too well to be septic.

551
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,922
Suction.

552
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,262
Okay, tube. PVCs.

553
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,026
Maybe you could
put him on a vent.

554
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,068
We're doing the best we can.

555
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,365
Okay. I'm in.

556
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,101
- My God, I lost the pulse.
- V-tach.

557
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,372
Please don't stop. These
people really love this little guy.

558
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:49,111
- I think you should call it.
- Charge to 10 joules. Starting CPR.

559
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,332
Don't you wanna come in?

560
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,936
No.

561
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,140
You don't have your keys?

562
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,414
- Hey.
- Chaz, you okay?

563
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,072
Yeah, Dad.

564
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,150
I gotta get
something for your...

565
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,446
For Greg.

566
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,926
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What's up, man?

567
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,823
I just wanted to go talk to him.

568
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,698
- Because of me?
- It's fine.

569
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,338
Chaz?

570
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:44,099
- Why don't you come in?
- No, I...

571
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,040
Chaz, dinner's on the table.

572
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,803
My mom's mac and cheese.

573
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:51,613
But I swear to God, it's the
best you ever tasted in your life.

574
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:55,276
- Heh.
- Come on, man.

575
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,327
Hey.

576
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,459
I'm sorry.

577
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,234
Why? Because I talked
myself into liking some groupie...

578
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,736
who turned out to be
Hilary Duff with an STD?

579
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,033
- I know you liked her.
- Mm.

580
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:17,902
I'm an idiot.

581
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,535
The bright side is your urine dip
came back negative for chlamydia.

582
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:27,050
Oh. Well, she must have gotten it from
another rock star she was partying with.

583
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,656
Probably one with
a recording deal.

584
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,724
I should probably
still swab you.

585
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,726
I used a condom, Neela.

586
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,795
Did you also use a dental dam?

587
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,936
Well...

588
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,546
Neela, your top-secret baby's
back. Abby needs you in sutures.

589
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,011
Okay.

590
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,518
Going again. Clear.

591
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,187
- Still V-tach.
- What happened?

592
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,790
- I don't know. Resuming compressions.
- Septic shock.

593
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,416
- How long since the last epi?
- Two minutes. Another round of lido?

594
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,762
- No.
- Are you sure you don't want another?

595
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,923
We've been doing this for 35
minutes. His brain's gotta be fried.

596
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,363
No. Keep going.

597
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,334
He's been through
enough. I... We gotta stop.

598
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,871
His heart's still beating.

599
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,599
It's more like a twitch.

600
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,836
It's not actually pumping
any blood to his body.

601
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,543
So that's it?

602
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,710
Just about.

603
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,249
He's fading.

604
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,288
Then I'll go get Cookie.

605
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,495
- Sorry?
- His mother.

606
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,725
If he's dying, she
should be here with him.

607
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,593
Her baby was taken from her.
She needs to understand why.

608
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,831
Anybody says "next of
kin," I'm gonna lose it.

609
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,497
I think you've already lost it.

610
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,110
Because I tried to help a
guy and it didn't work out?

611
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,575
Just game over, that's all.

612
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,903
In it this far, why
not let the mother in?

613
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:03,927
There's no need.

614
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,747
There was no need to treat
a chimp, but here we are.

615
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,387
The chimp was sick. Mom
is a little depressed, maybe?

616
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,920
It's the humane thing to do.

617
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,683
Forget it. You guys are
getting carried away with this.

618
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:18,694
Oh, come on. You're the one that
started this whole monkey business.

619
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,155
I didn't mean to say that.

620
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,792
Thank you, Lord, for the
blessings we are about to receive.

621
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,201
Look over those now
who cannot be with us...

622
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,206
including the countrymen who fight
to protect us in an overseas war...

623
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,612
founded on lies told to
us by our government.

624
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,048
- Jocelyn.
- And we welcome Greg...

625
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:42,278
and thank you, Lord, for bringing
him into our home and family.

626
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,717
Amen.

627
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,221
- Amen.
- Amen.

628
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:51,396
So why do you have that walker,
if you don't mind me asking?

629
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,231
I had a little fall.
Broke my hip.

630
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,402
Little? I was so scared when I
found her, I thought she was dead.

631
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:58,628
She was laying there:

632
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,435
I still have a ways to
go with my recovery.

633
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,940
Where'd you get your surgery?

634
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:06,668
County.

635
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,848
Must be downstairs.

636
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,516
It'll only take a minute.

637
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,493
Um, excuse me for a minute.

638
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,173
Why didn't you tell
me about Evelyn?

639
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,973
That she was the one at County
that day. Maybe I could've helped.

640
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,612
You didn't seem in
the mood for helping.

641
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,389
Here.

642
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,095
A bunch of things that
I sent your mother...

643
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,129
that she sent back.

644
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,867
A few notes she wrote me.

645
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:07,538
And this.

646
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,207
Hmm.

647
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:15,809
An act of mercy, her
sending me that picture.

648
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,212
I don't even remember
when this was taken.

649
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,020
I made mistakes, Greg.

650
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,417
I never denied it.

651
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:32,155
Got busted for some stupid petty
stuff and went away for a while.

652
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,456
Regretted it ever since.

653
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:41,034
But life is more
complicated than you think.

654
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,439
No respiratory effect.

655
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,115
Yeah, well, it
won't be long now.

656
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,776
Is he in pain? - No.

657
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,991
Ahem. I'm gonna give another
milligram of morphine just in case.

658
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,059
What? I just wanna make
sure he's comfortable.

659
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,710
Okay, I'm sorry. No, no, let go.

660
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,996
Thanks.

661
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,926
GCS is up from 4 to 11.

662
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,760
He's blinking on command,
starting to move his fingers.

663
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,733
See, sometimes you're good
and then sometimes you're lucky.

664
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,532
- Which one is this?
- This is "sometimes you're not sure."

665
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,537
- We're waiting on ICU.
- Good, good.

666
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,508
Hey. Why don't you
go bring his kid in?

667
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,204
Yeah.

668
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,280
Hey.

669
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,442
You know, patients come and go.

670
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:39,154
And some days, some of
them don't even register to me.

671
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:44,956
So how is it that a hairy little chimp
crumps on the table and it's like...?

672
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,693
In any case, it sounds
like you'll forgive me.

673
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,895
- For what?
- Well...

674
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,537
There's gonna be some
kind of disciplinary...

675
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:57,932
suspension.

676
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,878
- What, did Eve found out?
- She's not an animal lover.

677
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,844
No, more like an
animal strangler.

678
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,543
It's funny, because when I was a kid, I
always wanted a robot and a monkey.

679
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,283
- That doesn't shock me.
- No, no, I'm serious.

680
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,215
- Me too.
- Well, I'm over it.

681
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,931
Spontaneous eye movement.
That's a very good sign, Lockhart.

682
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,468
My name's Abby.

683
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:26,861
Yeah, I know.

684
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,812
Jodie. Jodie, if you call me
one more time, I swear to God...

685
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,652
Well, you just gotta
stop that nonsense.

686
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,319
No, I'm not in New York. Why
would I tell you where I'm at?

687
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,553
Yeah. Why would I tell you?

688
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,492
Yeah, because you're...

689
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,800
Every time that...

690
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,229
You're the... Hey.

691
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,836
Hey, hey.

692
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,092
You sure are getting
good at finding me.

693
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:06,935
Yeah.

694
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,267
I talked to Olivia.

695
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,747
This was our house.

696
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,075
I used to play out here.

697
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,452
She would watch
me from the window.

698
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,356
So you tried to come back.

699
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,097
She pushed you away.

700
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,290
She lied to you. She lied to me.

701
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,437
And no, I didn't know any of it.

702
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:46,238
But the question is, what did you
do to make her hate you so much?

703
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,948
I got into trouble.

704
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,082
Maybe she felt she
was protecting you.

705
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:59,421
When I got out of the pen,
I wanted us to be a family.

706
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:05,218
I was still a kid when she
died. What about then?

707
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:10,093
I was living in
Gary with Evelyn.

708
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,534
I came here to find you.

709
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,641
But they told me you had gone to
Detroit with your cousin's people.

710
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,641
So you gave up?

711
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,943
That was the
biggest mistake of all.

712
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,813
But I had a second life that
I was trying to hold together.

713
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,786
I've done my penance.

714
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,517
I do it every day.

715
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:40,455
But there's only one person
I still need forgiveness from.

716
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,163
Tsk.

717
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,137
I hear you.

718
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,516
I hear everything that you say.

719
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,856
But you and me, we're here now.

720
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,026
None of that other
stuff matters anymore.

721
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,965
Because even if the
story's more complicated...

722
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:24,542
than the one I spent the
last 20 years believing...

723
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,607
you still were not there for me.

724
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,644
And I don't give a damn
why or who said what.

725
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:37,778
- Hey, Greg...
- You were not here.

726
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,287
Please listen to me.

727
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,790
And we can never change that.

728
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,194
We can fix it.

729
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,432
Never, man.

730
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,203
But...

731
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,374
Never.
