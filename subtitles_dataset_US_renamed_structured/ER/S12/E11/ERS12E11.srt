1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,133
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,172
Your East Coast squeeze is here.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,073
She's kind of a looker in
an interstate off-ramp way.

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,941
I'm here now, baby.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,311
- Bobby hit me.
- What?

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,215
- Broke a rib.
- I'm sorry.

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,516
I didn't know. You didn't say anything.
Why didn't you go to the police?

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,690
He is the police.

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,623
- A compass?
- Seems we always find each other.

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,029
- Can we talk?
- What?

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,523
I'm pregnant.

12
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,860
What are you doing?

13
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:05,022
Well, Christmas was two weeks
ago. I figured it's time to put it away.

14
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,725
Leave it. I like it.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,434
You wanna be one of those people
dragging some dead brown tree...

16
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,733
out into the street
in the middle of April?

17
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,275
I like those people.
They don't give up easy.

18
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,012
I made this for Maggie
when I was, I think, 6.

19
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:33,788
We were living in a
motel in Minnetonka.

20
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,600
Don't you have a search-committee
meeting this morning?

21
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,738
I could skip it. We
can talk some more.

22
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:49,502
No, you should go. I
have to be in soon, so...

23
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,517
We haven't figured anything out yet.
- Yeah, I really...

24
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,020
don't wanna get into it again.

25
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,625
You've made a decision?

26
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,891
We don't know what
we are to each other.

27
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,932
- No one ever knows that.
- Oh, come on.

28
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,970
We've been friends for a
long time. Good friends.

29
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,266
- Yeah?
- Been through a lot together.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,501
That doesn't mean we
could take care of a child.

31
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,407
It has to be your choice.

32
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,107
I know that.

33
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,577
Fall in the ambulance bay.
No head trauma, no LOC.

34
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,246
Okay, it's all right. I'm fine.

35
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,824
- Complains of hip pain, can't bear weight.
- Stop it.

36
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,188
- I'm trying to be professional.
- It's annoying.

37
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,626
Whose job is it to
deice the entrance?

38
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,857
Get back to work.
Only a bruise, I'm fine.

39
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,696
- I'm gonna go find you a bed.
- No. I don't need all that.

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,339
Hey. Acetaminophen OD.
Should I give Mucomyst?

41
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,805
Could you look over
the positive-cultures list?

42
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,139
- CT's down, we're closing...
- Hold it! I'm not even on today.

43
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,643
Guys, guys. Easy. Easy.

44
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,773
Look, she had a nasty little slip on the
ice, so let's give her some space, okay?

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,974
Thank you.

46
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,387
- All right. What?
- What "what"?

47
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,184
- What do you want?
- I need a few weeks off.

48
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,726
- Why?
- My band got a recording deal.

49
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,158
We're going to L.A.

50
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:21,291
Back away from the gurney or
I will impale you with my crutch.

51
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,836
- Kerry.
- Back off, Elvis.

52
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,224
Damn salt's ruined my shoes.

53
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,260
Newark's been snow-free all
year. Why don't you go back there?

54
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,193
These are Jimmy Choos. - Who?

55
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,832
Why are you wearing his shoes?

56
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,468
Choos. And they cost
me about 400 bucks.

57
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,300
A, number one, you shouldn't be wearing
shoes that cost more than people's rent.

58
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,807
And B, number two, it's January
in Chicago. Get some damn boots.

59
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,537
Let me tell you something:
You're not a morning person.

60
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,206
No, I am not. Hey, excuse me. Excuse
me, can I get some more coffee, please?

61
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,217
And some Splenda, about a fistful.
- No problem.

62
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,415
- What?
- Shut up.

63
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,820
All I'm saying is that you're not
really prepared for winter, are you?

64
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,893
- So?
- So...

65
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,731
So?

66
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,401
So, so, so why don't you
stay at my place today?

67
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,366
I wanna see Michigan Avenue.

68
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,465
All right, fine. Whatever.
Just don't buy it, will you?

69
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,578
- I can shop if I want to, Vic.
- On whose credit card?

70
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,915
You're still worried about Bobby. I
told you I severed all ties with him.

71
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,177
Just because you severed
all ties with Bobby...

72
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,651
doesn't mean that he
severed all ties with you.

73
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,849
- He has no idea where I went.
- Of course not. He has no idea.

74
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,960
He would never think
of you being with me.

75
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,689
- He doesn't know where you are.
- No. No. He's a freaking cop.

76
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,492
How hard do you think that
is, huh? What are you, stupid?

77
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,829
I mean, how stupid
do you have to be?

78
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,106
- What?
- Give me some money.

79
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,870
- What for?
- For a cab. Give me some money.

80
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,277
Oh, come on. Don't do this. Don't
be ridiculous, okay? Just don't...

81
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,440
Give me the money.

82
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,045
Yeah. I need another 20.

83
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,347
Come on, don't do this.

84
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,391
And you know what you should
think about? You... Don't touch me.

85
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,222
You should think about
getting into meditation classes...

86
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:06,025
or maybe Pilates or something,
because you, Vic, are getting very ugly.

87
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,534
And I mean that in the most
metaphorical sense, okay?

88
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,695
Come on, don't walk away mad.
- Don't.

89
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,501
What? Now I gotta go get
myself some boots, you jerk-off.

90
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,838
Oh, come on. Come
back here. Jodie.

91
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,505
I'm sorry, I'm having
trouble clearing a bed.

92
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,242
You know, this really isn't necessary.
I'm sure I can get to my office...

93
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,010
Oh, you should let
me examine you.

94
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,678
All right. Just treat me
like any other patient.

95
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,881
- You sure?
- Yeah. Get me out of the hall.

96
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,320
Neela, let's run the board.

97
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,393
- I have to take my broken-hip lady...
- Hey.

98
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,359
- Not broken. MORALES:
Ted Cunningham, 23.

99
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,361
Lost his Shiley at
the nursing home.

100
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,762
They found him cyanotic,
put a 7.0 in the neck.

101
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,562
- Okay, Pratt, go with them.
- He had a lot of mucous.

102
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,730
We tried to suction him. His
trach tube came out, he turned blue.

103
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,876
- You from the home?
- No, I'm his mother.

104
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,274
Ted, can you open your eyes?

105
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,707
He can't follow commands.

106
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,177
Okay. Excuse us.

107
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,216
- NG tube and Number 6 Shiley.
- Ninety-four and 15 liters.

108
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:01,253
- He needs an NG?
- Use it as a guide to change the airway.

109
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,925
- How long has he been like this?
- Two years.

110
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,028
Ever since the
night he turned 21.

111
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,098
His friends took him to a bar
and made him drink 21 shots.

112
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,101
And on the way home...

113
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,136
he stepped into traffic and
got clipped by a pickup truck.

114
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,934
You spend your whole
life raising a kid right...

115
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,606
and then one stupid
night turns him into this.

116
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,655
Where are you? It's
time to open the presents.

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,826
Just making sure.

118
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,733
Oh, I think you can stop now.

119
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,341
We could find a
way to make it work.

120
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,051
- If that's what you want.
- I don't know what I want.

121
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:12,087
I mean, I'm 37 years
old. If not now, when?

122
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:16,855
You know how I feel about it.
Everything happens for a reason.

123
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,066
It scares me, Luka.

124
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,874
Having it or choosing not to?

125
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,202
Yeah.

126
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,440
<i>All right, pull the
NG and bag him.</i>

127
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,948
Abby, bag him.

128
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,552
Is he all right?

129
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,450
He should be much better
now that he has a new tube.

130
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,646
Thank you.

131
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,560
Sats up to 99.

132
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,721
What's Coburn doing here?

133
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,458
Kovac's got her down on
this lady with ovarian torsion.

134
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,596
Dr. Rasgotra, someone
seems to have left this.

135
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,136
So how's married life?

136
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,245
It's very nice, thank you. We're
looking for a place of our own.

137
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,642
It sounds exciting.

138
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:11,012
The Army want Michael to finish
his Residency at a military hospital.

139
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:14,348
- Then, where's the closest program?
- Fort Hood, Texas.

140
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,218
I'm hoping he can end up
somewhere not too far away.

141
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,256
Tenderness over the
greater trochanter?

142
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,918
Probably just a contusion
from where I hit the ground.

143
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,757
I'm going to check
your range of motion.

144
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,828
Ow! Oh, God.

145
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,868
Pain with internal rotation.

146
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,164
That's happened before.

147
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,206
I just need an ice pack
for 10 minutes and it'll stop.

148
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,606
Something for the pain
perhaps? Percocet? Vicodin?

149
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,837
No, no. I have too
much work to do.

150
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,415
Eight hundred of ibuprofen
and call for a hip series.

151
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,280
Well, I'll have to run it
past my Attending first...

152
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,921
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,856
Hey, pull the curtain, please.

154
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,453
- How's she doing?
- Bit cranky at the moment.

155
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,291
You'll soften her
up for me, right?

156
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,694
- What?
- For my TO request.

157
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,425
What do you need time off for?

158
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,571
Neela, do you know
who Barry Ginzberg is?

159
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,968
- Gynecologist on the fourth floor?
- No.

160
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,608
No, he's a record producer,
a mogul, an idol maker.

161
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,439
He took a listen to a couple
tracks my boys laid down and:

162
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,138
We are going to L.A. and
we have a gig at the Key Club.

163
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,547
If all goes well, we get to record
a demo at his studio in Venice.

164
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,812
- Italy?
- California, on the beach.

165
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,286
Congratulations, Ray,
that's really awesome. Here.

166
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,425
Super-infected foot fungus in 4.

167
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,925
Only thing is, is I'm
gonna need a little time off.

168
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,893
- How much is a little?
- Just a month.

169
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,966
- That's not little.
- Can you check out this patient for me?

170
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,160
Amanda Ramsey, 15,
presented with vague pain.

171
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,500
Sorry. I have to get some ibuprofen
and a hip series for Dr. Weaver.

172
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,334
Please, I'll trade you.

173
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,942
- Haven't told her yet.
- Thanks a lot.

174
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,441
Amanda, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

175
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,314
How much longer do you think it'll be?
Because I didn't mean to make a big deal.

176
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,979
- I probably just need Motrin or something.
- We ran a test on your urine.

177
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,716
Do I have a bladder infection?

178
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,091
You're pregnant.

179
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,787
Did you know that?

180
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,539
You didn't tell my
parents, did you?

181
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,868
They've been told that
you were here, but that's all.

182
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,273
Who's the father?

183
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,873
Some guy from school.

184
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,711
Boyfriend?

185
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,354
No.

186
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,890
I can get our Adolescent Clinic
to come down and talk to you.

187
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,995
- My parents won't like that.
- There are a number of options.

188
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,360
Yeah, I can keep it or
put it up for adoption.

189
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,900
Or you could
choose not to have it.

190
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,505
I could never do that.

191
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,001
It'd be against God.

192
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,576
They stabbed me in the heart!

193
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,272
P. P. Perkins, mugging
victim. Wounds to chest, arms...

194
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,441
- Name's P.P.? PERKINS:
Got blood coming out.

195
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,019
- He's only satting 82.
- You guys need a hand?

196
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,588
No, we're on it. Chest
tube, in here. Let's move it.

197
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,350
Okay, we're gonna need
to remove an ovary, Sara...

198
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,358
but that's why God
gave you a spare.

199
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:12,693
It's gonna be fine. Prep her in
2. I should be up in 15 minutes.

200
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,561
- How's it going?
- Well, good.

201
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,703
She's young and the
other ovary looks good.

202
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,394
Oh, no. I meant...

203
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,507
- Oh, "How's it going?" Well, fine. You?
- Good.

204
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,267
I just got paged
for an ultrasound.

205
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,674
- Do you know anything about that?
- No.

206
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,543
No, but I remember hearing
that you surg your own practice?

207
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,777
Yeah, yeah. It's going
very well, you know.

208
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,218
The only problem's
the boss. What a bitch.

209
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,316
- I'm the boss, Abby.
- Right.

210
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,794
- Now you're patronizing me.
- No, I...

211
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,195
I just... I just might want to
come and see you. I need an OB.

212
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,096
Congratulations.
Wow, I had no idea.

213
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,638
I'll shut up.

214
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,071
Yeah, it wasn't
something I expected.

215
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,572
Is it something you want?

216
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:05,146
I'm not sure I'm at the
right place in my life for this.

217
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,649
So...

218
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,220
So you don't wanna keep it.

219
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,257
- I'm sorry. COBURN:
I'm always prepared. Here.

220
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,793
Thanks.

221
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,558
I've got office hours every
afternoon. Just come by any time.

222
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,497
I can help you. Whether it's
prenatal care or termination.

223
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,763
Whatever you decide.

224
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,600
Thank you.

225
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,301
And whatever you do, Abby,
it's gonna be the right thing.

226
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,105
Thanks.

227
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,557
- Systolic's only 86.
- Almost there. Get the Thora-Seal.

228
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,092
Okay. A little pressure now.

229
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,389
All right. So who really
jacked you, huh, P.P.?

230
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,897
- Some guys I know.
- Sats coming up.

231
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,002
Drinking by fire in this alley.

232
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,865
Right. Must be real good
friends to stab you in the heart.

233
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,166
- Did somebody call the cops?
- On their way.

234
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,242
I'm sure they're rushing over.
- No.

235
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,743
- BP's better, 110/75.
- No cops? They could have killed you.

236
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,745
I got problems. I got problems.

237
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,942
- Cops only gonna make it worse.
- I feel you, bro. Trust me.

238
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,279
Then do me a solid, man.

239
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,752
Anything for you, P.P. Anything.

240
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,823
More lube.

241
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,856
- It's cold.
- Oh, sorry about that.

242
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,964
- Dr. Coburn.
- I called OB.

243
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,430
Couldn't there be a
mistake with that test?

244
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,468
I don't think so.
Here. You see this?

245
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,666
That's the heart beating.

246
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,173
It's about seven
weeks old, I'd say.

247
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,308
They won't understand.

248
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,481
- Your parents?
- They'll say I've sinned.

249
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,148
I can help you talk
to them if you want.

250
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,854
Can I have a minute?

251
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,558
You were in with a patient,
so I thought it was best to just...

252
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,956
It would be better if
you presented to me first.

253
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,963
Well, either way, I had to call
an OB. She's 15 and scared.

254
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,294
- Family on the way in?
- They're very religious people.

255
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,460
Call me when they get here.

256
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,731
How'd you do this?

257
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,307
Tried to hop a bus.

258
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,239
What, did you slip on the ice?

259
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,143
I was skitching,
fell off the fender.

260
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,547
Might be easier
just to pay the fare.

261
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,650
Do I look like I got
surplus income to blow?

262
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,526
Can I get another 3-0 Ethilon?
- Mm-hm.

263
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:34,000
Were you on your way home?

264
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:38,494
I haven't been home in
a while. Since, like, May.

265
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,203
Your folks must be
worried about you.

266
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,366
Yeah, they worry a lot.

267
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:47,036
Always wanting to know
what I'm doing, what I'm up to.

268
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,880
Gets to be a real
drag, you know.

269
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,845
Doesn't sound so bad.

270
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,387
I'm an independent spirit, you
know. I wanna be on my own.

271
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,020
Do they even know where you are?

272
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,958
No.

273
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,690
Just left one day.

274
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,071
What if I don't know
how to love it right?

275
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,072
Abby.

276
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,367
Maybe I'm not strong enough.

277
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,842
Being a parent
makes you stronger.

278
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,052
And it breaks your
heart. You told me that.

279
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,448
That's not what I meant.

280
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,220
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- No, don't... Don't use that as a reason.

281
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,627
I'm sorry.

282
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,078
What if I go shopping and
leave it in the supermarket?

283
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,080
Don't worry, I'll do
all the shopping.

284
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,146
I'm afraid I'd mess it up, Luka.

285
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,087
We won't.

286
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,158
Okay.

287
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,635
Keep the wound clean and dry.

288
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,170
Come back in a week to
have the stitches removed.

289
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,604
That's it? ABBY: Yeah.

290
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,676
Unless you wanna talk to
somebody from Social Work.

291
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,279
Your daughter's right in here.

292
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,109
- Mandy? Are you okay?
- I'm fine, Mom.

293
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,548
I'll leave you all to talk.

294
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,777
Could you stay?

295
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,053
Sure.

296
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,559
Mom.

297
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,627
Daddy.

298
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,129
Something happened
and I'm real sorry.

299
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,791
What happened, sweetie?

300
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,068
We ran a test and
did an ultrasound.

301
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,005
Amanda's pregnant.

302
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,143
We're waiting for
some blood results.

303
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,373
- As soon as they arrive...
- That's fine.

304
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,019
There are a number of places
we can refer you to for counseling.

305
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,212
We'd like to be alone
with our daughter now.

306
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,718
Thank you.

307
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,427
No free fluid on ultrasound.
Waiting on surgery to evaluate.

308
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,659
Not anymore, Red.
What do you got?

309
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,063
Morning, sunshine.

310
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,931
- Who are you?
- Clemente. Who are you?

311
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,505
- I'm Surgery, see the badge?
- Oh, yeah.

312
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,370
You must be the bedside-manner
coach I heard so much about.

313
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,206
Multiple stab wounds.
Stable after the chest tube.

314
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,577
- Anything enter the peritoneum?
- Not sure. Ultrasound's negative.

315
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,342
Doesn't answer my question.

316
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,887
- Hey, I got the cops out here.
- Relax. Relax. I got your back.

317
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,692
If you can get a smile out of
Surgery, I'll pay for the date.

318
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,194
You're right on the cusp
of sexual harassment.

319
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,698
The cusp. That would
be a new position for me.

320
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,268
Hey, guys. I'm the Attending
Physician on this case.

321
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,701
- Clemente?
- Yeah.

322
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,103
This dude is very sick.
He's out of it completely.

323
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,539
He won't be able to give
a statement. I'm sorry.

324
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,044
- Hold on a sec. You're Victor Clemente?
- Yeah. Were you listening to me?

325
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,445
He won't be able to give a statement.
- Easy.

326
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,609
We're not here on your
patient. We're here for you.

327
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,980
Dubenko's feisty
gopher's at it again.

328
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,819
- What?
- The chief Resident from the Death Star.

329
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,393
- She's down on a consult.
- Albright?

330
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,395
He's hemodynamically
stable with no peritoneal signs.

331
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,558
- So why'd you call me?
- Look, missy, it's protocol, all right?

332
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,899
You didn't really just
call me "missy," did you?

333
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:36,736
Okay, look. The case
meets trauma criteria.

334
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,777
Next time, call me when you
know what you got on your hands.

335
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,004
Are you Dr. Albright?

336
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,843
He was stabbed. I need to
know if he needs surgical repair.

337
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,646
Neela Rasgotra. I wanted to catch
you about doing a surgery elective.

338
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,415
Right. Work up your patient.

339
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,185
Image the belly, explore the
wounds, figure out how deep they are.

340
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,955
If they enter the
peritoneal cavity, call me.

341
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,121
I'll be more than
happy to get involved.

342
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,927
One-third of stab wounds
enter the peritoneal cavity...

343
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,296
and damage the viscera.

344
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,132
One-third go in and
don't hit anything.

345
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,433
And one-third...

346
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,442
are shallow and tangential.

347
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:19,346
The trajectory was suggested by the hilt
mark of the knife. He won't need surgery.

348
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,022
You should pay more
attention to your interns, Red.

349
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,658
I'm an R2, actually.

350
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:30,525
Okay, R2. Call me about that elective.
We might be able to work something out.

351
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,127
Parking violations? You
gotta be kidding me, right?

352
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,797
Okay. But you had some
other problems back East.

353
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,704
What problems you talking about?

354
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,471
You left Newark General
under some serious allegations.

355
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,347
I never.

356
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,349
I never, never, never
compromised a patient's care.

357
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,147
- Do you understand me? I never.
- Okay, okay.

358
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,483
Let's get back to Mrs.
Kenyon. She had issues...

359
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,921
What issues? She had
no issues. She was a nurse.

360
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,153
I'd ask her for 6-0 Vicryl and
she'd bring it to me. No issues.

361
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,992
- Can I go now? Thank you.
- Not yet.

362
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,691
All right. You do realize
that son of a bitch hits her?

363
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:12,531
- So you have seen her?
- You realize that. No, I haven't seen her.

364
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,265
But I can see what's going
on here and it's pretty low.

365
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:19,037
To sic you on me because he can't keep
his wife happy, that's pretty pathetic.

366
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,613
All we know is Mrs. Kenyon's a
missing person who might be in trouble.

367
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,013
- Be in more trouble if you find her.
- Meaning?

368
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,382
Meaning sometimes people go
missing because they feel safer that way.

369
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,114
- My advice: Stop looking for her.
- Don't you go missing.

370
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,260
- I'm gonna wanna talk to you.
- Why would I go missing? Why?

371
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,793
Confusing me for
one of your scumbags?

372
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,760
Settle down before
it gets embarrassing.

373
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,264
Hope this conversation
doesn't throw me off my game.

374
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,197
After all the cops'
lives I've saved.

375
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,101
I'd hate to be less than 100 percent
when your brother comes in with a bullet.

376
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,935
I think we're done for now.

377
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,238
Take it easy.

378
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,130
Hey, we got any
loperamide in stock?

379
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,289
Yeah, I'm sure we have some.

380
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:31,213
- I got you the good stuff. Today was...
- Hey.

381
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,717
Sorry. It's turkey
day in the cafeteria.

382
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,515
No.

383
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,124
- No what?
- Is the answer to your question.

384
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,620
Can I at least
state my case first?

385
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,923
Okay.

386
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:52,402
This is big. This is a big
opportunity for my band.

387
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,698
And for me.

388
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,241
And you never know when you're
gonna get another shot like this.

389
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,642
My recollection is you were warned last
year about your commitment to this job.

390
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:02,873
Yes, I was.

391
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,712
To your credit, you've done an excellent
job showing us that you wanna be here.

392
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,412
- I do.
- You're a good doctor.

393
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:13,153
- Thank you.
- We don't need to discuss this further.

394
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:17,592
You're valuable, you're
valued. Conversation over.

395
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,328
Have you tried the stuffing?

396
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,934
It's great stuffing.

397
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,969
And, you know, I got
you an extra piece...

398
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,834
- Dr. Barnett!
- Look, Kerry...

399
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,534
Dr. Weaver.

400
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,776
Have you ever dreamed
about something...

401
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:37,110
without ever believing it
would actually happen?

402
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,616
Because that's what this is.

403
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,947
I've...

404
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,124
This is so huge to me,
that if I couldn't do this...

405
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,692
I would seriously
consider quitting.

406
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,097
Far be it from me to stand in
the way of the next Springsteen...

407
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,029
or KC & The Sunshine Band.

408
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,135
Resignation accepted.

409
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,768
What?

410
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,272
- Why do you wanna do surgery?
- I'm curious about it.

411
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,535
The hours suck, Attendings
are slave drivers...

412
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,542
Residents stab each
other in the back.

413
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:09,546
Not like down here where
we're one big, happy family.

414
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:12,378
What's wrong? Ashlee Simpson
get caught lip-synching again?

415
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,816
- I think I just quit.
- Quit?

416
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,615
To go to California
with my band.

417
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,487
Oh, great. Yeah. No, bold move. I
like it. Keeping that music dream alive.

418
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,720
No, you'll love California.
Everybody, Ray Barnett, rock god.

419
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,491
Morris, I've already sent
my paperwork up to Surgery.

420
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,193
Well, get it back. I can't spare you,
especially now with Ray on his way out.

421
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,861
If we're not fully staffed,
you're not going anywhere.

422
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,836
I don't care what
Dr. Cruella says.

423
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,306
Three forty-five, that'll
work. Yeah. Thank you.

424
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,739
Ray's out? MORRIS: Yeah.

425
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,176
Up and quit, not gonna
let the man keep him down.

426
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,078
- I don't think he meant to.
- Hey, guys. Guys, come here.

427
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,344
- Know the girl I've been hanging with?
- Jodie? Yeah, we love Jodie.

428
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,353
Taught me to tie a knot in a
cherry stem using only my tongue.

429
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,581
- Really?
- Come on, guys.

430
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,385
- Anybody ask for her?
- No.

431
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,654
You never saw her, okay? And if
anybody asks, the same goes for me.

432
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,525
- What?
- Pretend you never heard of me.

433
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,557
Pratt's bringing in a
patient. Get with him, okay?

434
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,430
Okay.

435
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,001
He gets weirder every day.

436
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,106
Look, you heard
what Dr. Albright said.

437
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:12,233
So? She's the chief Resident upstairs,
I'm the chief here. You work for me.

438
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,744
- Oh, come on. That's not fair.
- Fair? What's fair?

439
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,404
Excuse me, doctor.

440
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,677
Mr. Ramsey.

441
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,015
I can sign whatever I need
to, and we'll get out of your way.

442
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,452
Like me to call anyone
for further treatment?

443
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:28,149
Thank you. I think we'll
arrange our own prenatal care.

444
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,287
Amanda decided to keep it?

445
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,431
The baby.

446
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,126
It's just that she's young
and it was an accident.

447
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,033
No, no.

448
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,564
I don't believe in accidents.

449
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,467
Now, I know you may
not understand this...

450
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:49,239
but it is God's will for
her to have this child.

451
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:52,317
I only mean you may want to
consider the long-term effects.

452
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,886
You might wanna consider the spiritual
effects of what you're suggesting.

453
00:25:56,055 --> 00:26:00,254
It's my job to make sure the patient
understands all the options available.

454
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,055
A human life has
just been created.

455
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,754
And I'm sorry, but anything
that interferes with that...

456
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,560
is morally indefensible.

457
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,237
Finished chemo two days ago.

458
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,065
Couldn't get an IV, too dry.

459
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,731
O.R. needs an Attending to sign
off on your pancreatic pseudocyst.

460
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,741
- Where's Clemente?
- On the roof.

461
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,573
- A chopper patient?
- No.

462
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,012
He just says that his cell phone
gets better reception up there.

463
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,310
Place a subclavian and
bolus him. I'll be back.

464
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,114
Okay, triple lumen
tray and 1 percent lido.

465
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:32,156
- He's tachy at 132.
- A little bit cold here.

466
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,424
I was never the
sickly type, you know.

467
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,030
- No?
- Always very healthy.

468
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,435
Used to do triathlons.
Believe that?

469
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,969
- Me too.
- Really?

470
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,302
Smoking, drinking
and watching TV.

471
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,669
- You should stop that.
- I have.

472
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:59,751
Six years ago, I find out I inherited
the Philadelphia chromosome.

473
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,352
Ran on my mother's
side of the family.

474
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,753
I never knew.

475
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,892
Screwed by genetics.

476
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,956
First time, I was panicked
the baby would be bipolar.

477
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,001
I'm not so sure I've
changed that much.

478
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,502
The chances are
slim, you know that.

479
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,334
Crossing the street is a risk.

480
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,912
If you let it get to you,
you'd never have children.

481
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,843
Nobody would.

482
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,574
Well, maybe some
people aren't supposed to.

483
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,548
Well, I don't think
you're one of them.

484
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,358
Yeah, well, you don't
know what it was like...

485
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,221
with Maggie and Eric.

486
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,696
Come on. You're
looking for reasons again.

487
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,367
And what are you looking for?
Someone to have a baby with?

488
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,706
That what you think?

489
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:04,945
Because if it is, then what
the hell are we doing here?

490
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,690
Happy New Year.

491
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,902
A whole cascade of things
have to happen to cause CML.

492
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,241
Philadelphia chromosome
doesn't mean cancer.

493
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:41,444
No, just that you're born
with a big strike against you.

494
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,421
Soon as you get this, call me.

495
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,924
I wanna talk to you
immediately. Right away.

496
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,120
Maybe you're trying me right now,
so I'm just gonna hang up and...

497
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,424
And you gotta call me.

498
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,732
You gonna jump?

499
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,069
- It's not a trick question.
- Yeah, sure it's not.

500
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,668
Here. I need you
to sign off on this.

501
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,744
- What are you doing here? It's freezing.
- Yeah, well, I got a very high core temp.

502
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,508
It's a Latin thing.

503
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:16,680
- You wanna talk or something?
- No. Why would I?

504
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,754
I don't know. You
seem a little ragged.

505
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,624
Yeah, I just got some
chick trouble, that's all.

506
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,196
- Then I'm your men.
- Except I don't like to share.

507
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,330
You know, I heard you
never stick anyplace.

508
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:35,506
Maybe people don't go to the mat for
you because they have no idea who you are.

509
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,311
All right.

510
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,354
All right, so there was this
crazy nurse at my last hospital.

511
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,990
- In Newark?
- Yeah.

512
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,956
She's a piece of work,
and it just ended bad.

513
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,057
It usually does.

514
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,666
You know, I came here just to focus,
to stay on the straight and narrow.

515
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,394
- Sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah, one would think.

516
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,368
Except it's easier said than
done, because this girl...

517
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,735
she's got my number, if
you know what I mean.

518
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,307
And a very pissed-off husband.

519
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,714
See? I'm starting to
like you more already.

520
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,214
Damn, so many patients.

521
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,923
- Don't you feel better now?
- Not really, no. Can't say that I do.

522
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,356
Type and Rh are back on Amanda.

523
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,359
Then we're done.

524
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,064
- You off already?
- Yeah.

525
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,565
- I have a doctor's appointment.
- Oh.

526
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,328
I'm going to see Coburn.

527
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,066
- Coburn?
- At her practice.

528
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,540
Uh...

529
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,239
- I'll get Clemente to cover.
- It's okay. You're working.

530
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,266
No, I should come with you.

531
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,716
- It probably would
be easier if you didn't.

532
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,082
Hey. Hey.

533
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,786
When I say I want us to keep it,
you don't like the way it sounds.

534
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,429
But anything else is a lie.

535
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,435
Luka. Neela's waiting for you
to sign off on the Ramsey girl.

536
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,005
Get Clemente to do it.
- He's MIA.

537
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,445
I don't know what else to say.

538
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,210
Don't say anything.

539
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,555
Take one of these every day. It'll
help keep you and the baby healthy.

540
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,497
- Okay.
- Where are your parents?

541
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,400
My mom's making some calls
and my dad had to go to a meeting.

542
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,566
If it makes you nauseous, try taking
it at night before you go to bed, okay?

543
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,780
This is some more
information that might be useful.

544
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:01,613
And we got this for
you from the ultrasound.

545
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,985
I wish this didn't happen.

546
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,964
I wish I could make it go away.

547
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,465
Well, everything
happens for a reason.

548
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,775
There was this party at
my friend Ginny's house.

549
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,649
And I drank some beer...

550
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:36,949
and I did some other stuff
with a couple of guys, and...

551
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,451
And I must have passed
out in the bedroom...

552
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,596
because when I woke up...

553
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:50,064
my jeans were on the floor and
there was blood all over the sheets.

554
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,669
I tried to change the covers...

555
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,635
Amanda...

556
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,098
were you raped?

557
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:59,207
Always thought the first time
would be with someone I loved.

558
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,743
Why didn't you say something?

559
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,174
I don't want this. Please.

560
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,718
You need to explain to
your parents what happened.

561
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,356
They'll understand.
You have to tell them.

562
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,823
I did tell them.

563
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,856
Mrs. Ramsey?

564
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,860
I'll call you back.

565
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:22,399
- Amanda told you what happened to her?
- Yes.

566
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,195
And you still want
her to do this?

567
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:29,004
That baby can't be punished
for how it was conceived.

568
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,110
It's not up to us to determine
who gets to be born.

569
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,405
We're talking about
a 15-year-old girl.

570
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,343
- Your daughter, who was raped.
- Neela.

571
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,075
You'd force her to carry
this to term, change her life?

572
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,720
I wouldn't force
her to do anything.

573
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,220
She believes the same
things that we believe.

574
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,257
This is an inappropriate conversation.
- Inappropriate?

575
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,395
- She's terrified, doesn't wanna keep it.
- Let's take a walk.

576
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:54,124
Think for one minute about what's
in your daughter's best interest.

577
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,360
You think it's in her best
interest to kill the baby?

578
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,867
Because I can assure you...

579
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,564
that in the eyes of God,
it most certainly is not.

580
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:03,800
Excuse me.

581
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,406
Leave these people alone
now. They've made a decision.

582
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,105
Parents have no legal rights.
Pregnancy emancipates her.

583
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,080
There's nothing else you can do.

584
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,812
That girl's head is so far twisted, she
doesn't understand she has a choice.

585
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,319
She doesn't want an abortion.

586
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,618
She doesn't wanna have the
baby either. Anyone can see that.

587
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,455
What about misoprostol?
It's used as an abortifacient.

588
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,927
She won't consent to
that. Just let it go, Neela.

589
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,999
You're the wrong person
to talk to about this.

590
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,100
Excuse me?

591
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,341
I would like your permission
to consult another Attending.

592
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,137
Someone who's not Catholic.

593
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,777
Listen to me very seriously.

594
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,948
I'm a doctor first, above
and beyond anything else...

595
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:58,495
and I don't let my personal beliefs get
in the way of a patient's best interests.

596
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,722
Ever.

597
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,200
Now, give me that chart
and move on to the next one.

598
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,467
I'm sorry. I...

599
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:14,101
- There's gotta be something that we...
- You're done here.

600
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,200
<i>Do you wanna have this baby?</i>

601
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,468
I have to.

602
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,335
Is it what you want?

603
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,915
No. No, it isn't.

604
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,289
This is called a laminaria.

605
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,656
It goes into the cervix...

606
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:11,192
<i>where it absorbs water and
swells, creating a larger opening.</i>

607
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,773
<i>After that happens...</i>

608
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,537
it's possible that the
fetus might fall out.

609
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:23,944
- Possible?
- You might have a miscarriage.

610
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,079
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

611
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,744
There might be some cramping.

612
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,851
Is it a sin?

613
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:39,965
It's just a medical
way we have...

614
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,529
of giving God a
chance to reconsider.

615
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,568
Abigail Lockhart?

616
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,117
Oh, my God. Nobody was out
today. I had the pick of the litter.

617
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,719
Hey, come on. You gotta leave.

618
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,185
Hey, what the hell's
wrong with you?

619
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,585
Cops are on me,
getting on my ass.

620
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:11,093
Why? Your dick of a husband, Bobby,
has put out a missing-persons report.

621
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,355
- That's why.
- He did?

622
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,692
Yeah. How long we got
till he traces you to me?

623
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:18,132
How long before I'm walking around
with my testicles in a jar? Tell me.

624
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:20,101
Vicky. Vic, Vic.

625
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,933
I love you.

626
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:24,076
Sometimes you can
be such a little faggot.

627
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,266
Oh, yeah?

628
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:29,107
I'm gonna get a big boyfriend who'll
kick your maniac of a husband's ass.

629
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,114
How do you like that,
huh? How do you like that?

630
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,447
Hey, you're ripping the leather.

631
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,780
Quiet, will you?

632
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,486
- That's great. That's great.
- You gotta pay your tickets.

633
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,163
That's great. Damn it.

634
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,925
Vic, what's going on?

635
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,431
Hey, X-Ray, how's it going?

636
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,267
So this must be Jodie, huh?

637
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,271
Who, her? That's not Jodie.

638
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,736
Hi. RAY: Hey.

639
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,003
It's weird. I've parked here a lot
of times and never had a problem.

640
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,180
Yeah, it's weird.
We're gonna take the el.

641
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:03,576
Right.

642
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,341
Nice meeting you. - Likewise.

643
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:06,985
Yo, Ray.

644
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,644
Bret. Hey, how was practice?

645
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,256
- Thanks for meeting me, man.
- Yeah.

646
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,482
Grab some coffee?

647
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,425
Yeah. So I took care of
everything. Schedule's all cleared up.

648
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,030
I thought we were gonna
talk before you did anything.

649
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:23,099
Did something happen? Don't
tell me Ginzberg isn't interested.

650
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:25,737
No, it's still on.

651
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,866
Here's the thing. You've been pretty
busy with this whole doctor thing lately.

652
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,203
- Kind of distracted, you know?
- True. True.

653
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:35,677
But I'm a hundred percent onboard
now, okay? Hundred and ten, actually.

654
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,112
Well, we all got together
and talked about it.

655
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,345
Who did?

656
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,982
The guys. This morning.

657
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,490
Kind of decided the band's
gotta make some changes.

658
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,888
Changes?

659
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,497
What do you mean, changes?

660
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:02,902
You'll need to come back to
have the laminaria removed.

661
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,238
Probably feel a little pain.
Nothing to worry about.

662
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,846
You can take ibuprofen.
That should help.

663
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,981
Before I formed thee
in the belly I knew thee.

664
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,688
And before thou camest forth
out of the womb I sanctified thee...

665
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,694
and ordained thee a
prophet unto the nations.

666
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:30,065
Jeremiah 1:5.

667
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,364
Man was born of dust.

668
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:39,038
It was only when God
breathed life into Adam...

669
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,577
that he became a living soul.

670
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,742
Genesis.

671
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,045
You're a Christian.

672
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,083
What do I tell my mom?

673
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,764
She'll think you're
having a miscarriage.

674
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,230
And you will be.

675
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,259
All done. You can
take her home now.

676
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,765
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

677
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,428
Weaver's MRI results are back.

678
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,234
- What happened?
- Sorry?

679
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,808
What were you doing in there?

680
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:47,172
Taking care of the patient.

681
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,319
Hey, Abby. It's me.

682
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,262
<i>I guess I missed you.</i>

683
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,928
<i>Um...</i>

684
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,262
<i>Nothing. I'll see you soon.</i>

685
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,468
Okay.

686
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,905
Advanced degeneration
with a cartilaginous flap.

687
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,285
At least that explains the pain.

688
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:32,119
I've seen that kind of thing heal with
enough bed rest and physical therapy.

689
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:38,019
I've been putting this off for years.
Maybe it's time to face the music.

690
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:41,860
- I'll need a total hip replacement.
- Not necessarily.

691
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:46,296
Just when Henry's starting
to run around like a crazy man.

692
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,833
- How is he?
- He's great.

693
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,367
You should see him.
He looks just like Sandy.

694
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,391
Went by your place...

695
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,056
but I figured you might
come home this way.

696
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:29,346
I don't want everything we have
to come down to this one decision.

697
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,417
We can get past it.

698
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,081
You did what you had to do.

699
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,723
Doesn't mean we
can't be together.

700
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:49,067
I didn't do it.

701
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,204
I couldn't.

702
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,541
I wanna keep it.

703
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,113
I want us to have this baby.
