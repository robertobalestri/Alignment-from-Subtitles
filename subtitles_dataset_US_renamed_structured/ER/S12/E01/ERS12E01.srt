1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:05,925
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,632
Got a letter from your dad.

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,737
Steve's writing that he got
some new job in Colorado.

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,812
Sam, you've got
to tell Alex the truth.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,471
Alex!

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,713
It's all gonna be okay.

7
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,397
- He's 12. MAN: When's
the last time you saw him?

8
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,601
Around 8:30.

9
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,269
So four and a half hours ago?

10
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,173
Friends, relatives,
anyone he might be with?

11
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:53,218
We've been calling and
driving around. There's nothing.

12
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,789
- Any fights, school problems?
- We had an argument.

13
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,826
I went upstairs to take a
shower and get ready for bed...

14
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:07,464
and about an hour later, Visa
called for an authorization on my card.

15
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,297
He'd gone to the bus station
and tried to buy a ticket.

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,601
- Ticket to where?
- Colorado.

17
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,573
- Why Colorado?
- His dad is there.

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,339
What about his home situation?
Is it stable? Drugs? Violence?

19
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,244
Alex has a good home.

20
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,148
What about Dad, you let him know
Alex might be on his way or calling?

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,016
He's not that easy
to get ahold of.

22
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,280
Why's that?

23
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,854
He's in prison.

24
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,030
Alex doesn't know
that his dad is in jail.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,496
He's been asking me if
he can go live with him...

26
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,660
I'm sorry, shouldn't we be
calling Amtrak or the airlines?

27
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,329
No, they won't board a
minor without parental consent.

28
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,239
- You got a recent photo?
- This happens all the time.

29
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,375
Nine times out of 10, they're
back home in 24 hours or less.

30
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,948
Alex doesn't have 24
hours. He's diabetic.

31
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,951
He could be in a coma by this time
tomorrow if he doesn't get his insulin.

32
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,679
Sam. Sam. SAM: We
gotta go by Shelley's...

33
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,155
- Union Station, the park...
- Sam, the car's...

34
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,351
He likes Navy Pier,
maybe he went over there.

35
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:11,464
And then we'll circle back to the school,
and, uh, the... The arcade on Lincoln...

36
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,396
We should be at
home when he calls.

37
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,195
We'll check Denny's
and McDonald's.

38
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,564
Open the door.

39
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,365
- Sam, he's not...
- Please, open the door.

40
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:28,038
Sam, when he calls, he'll call
home. They said we should be there.

41
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,643
He knows how to monitor
his carbs, stay hydrated.

42
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,320
He's too smart.

43
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,849
He's stubborn and
resourceful and smart.

44
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,290
He's not coming back.

45
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,246
Oh. The day shift.

46
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,154
- There is a God.
- Ew.

47
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,259
- Hard night?
- Okay. Everybody's here. Good.

48
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,396
It's 8:02. Time for
rounds. Curtain Number 1.

49
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,532
Wait. Ray, you're on. - Huh?

50
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,429
You're an R-2 now,
R-2s run the board.

51
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,035
Okay. Well... Okay.

52
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,070
Curtain 1, foreign
body in the eye.

53
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,209
Sanding his boat without eye
gear. Shard of glass under the lid.

54
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,675
- Corneal abrasion?
- Didn't get a chance to check.

55
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,179
Okay. Jane, he's yours.
Fluorescein, slit-lamp exam, home.

56
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,874
Curtain 3, we have
an altered 19-year-old.

57
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,383
Drank a gallon of antifreeze.

58
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,216
Responding to fomepizole,
waiting on psych and an ICU bed.

59
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,229
- Great. Moving on.
- Whoa. Good teaching case.

60
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,919
Yeah. Take a minute and
tell us all about fomepizole.

61
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,063
Uh, well, it's pretty new.

62
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,900
Yeah? What does it do?

63
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,566
Lowers the
ethylene glycol level?

64
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,400
Tell them how.

65
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,236
Increases renal excretion.

66
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,403
- Anyone else?
- Does it inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase?

67
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,414
I think it might prevent
formation of acidic metabolites.

68
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,449
Get it in early and
you avoid dialysis.

69
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,780
I'm gonna read about
this and make a handout.

70
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,082
R-2s have to do the
reading before rounds.

71
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,122
- How? I just got here.
- Get here early.

72
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,317
Teaching should be
spontaneous, off-the-cuff.

73
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,894
Excuse me. Is there somewhere
private I can go breastfeed?

74
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,983
We've been here three
hours. My kid needs to eat.

75
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,829
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a,
uh, family room down the hallway.

76
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,471
Mom, I'm starving.

77
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,636
Uh, all the way on your left.

78
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,140
- How old is that kid?
- He's gotta be 6.

79
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,107
That is a little freaky.

80
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,772
Sam? Hey.

81
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,245
- What?
- It's okay.

82
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,714
- Did they call?
- No.

83
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,353
It's his picture on the TV.

84
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,262
- How long was I asleep for?
- Um, about an hour.

85
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,497
All right, we gotta start
calling everybody again.

86
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,230
We already called everybody.
They're gonna call us if... Sam.

87
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,968
Hi, Debbie.

88
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,448
Yeah. Nope.

89
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,176
No, huh? Okay. Yeah,
yeah. As soon as... Of course.

90
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,312
- As soon as I hear anything.
- Hi, yes. This is Luka Kovac again.

91
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,528
Hello. LEWIS: <i>What is it?</i>

92
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,018
Altered traffic collision.

93
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:14,156
GCS, eight. Systolic's
100. Let's bag her.

94
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,962
What's your plan, Ray?
- All right.

95
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,072
Intubation, FAST
exam and a head CT.

96
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,400
- Okay. I'll be in Curtain 2.
- Dr. Lewis?

97
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,669
- Call me if you need me.
- I guess she trusts you.

98
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:29,339
Uh, yeah, 20 of etomidate, 100 of
sux. Portable C-spine and chest to follow.

99
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,782
- Get that SonoSite ready. Come here.
- Mind if I intubate?

100
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,353
Might wanna observe one first.

101
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,853
Why do we use etomidate?

102
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,389
- We need a sedative with a paralytic.
- No, I know that.

103
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,323
But isn't it true that ketamine
causes less respiratory depression?

104
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,723
Uh, maybe.

105
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,094
Well, does it have a more
favorable hemodynamic profile?

106
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,394
If you're concerned about
interabdominal hemorrhaging, then it...

107
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,868
Jane, we use etomidate
because it's a good drug.

108
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,367
- Okay, let me take a look.
- Sats up to 92.

109
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,706
All right, pull the handle at 45 degrees
and never rock back against the teeth.

110
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,572
Shouldn't you give
a dose of Pavulon?

111
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,343
- Sometimes we do, yeah.
- Is sux okay in crush injuries?

112
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,749
- Uh-huh. Cricoid pressure.
- What about hyperkalemia?

113
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,583
Look, never seen it happen.

114
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:13,625
The 8-0, it won't pull through. All
right. We need a smaller tube. Bag her.

115
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,125
Is sux okay in burn patients?

116
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:20,392
More observation and less conversation.
We tube her and then we can chat, okay?

117
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,932
- Seven and a half.
- Okay. Thank you.

118
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,106
Sergeant Parker wouldn't
tell us what this was about.

119
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,244
We haven't found your son yet.
Twelve thousand fliers went out.

120
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,107
Precincts, hospitals,
state police.

121
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,941
We notified the
folks in Colorado...

122
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,448
and we're getting some
play on local television.

123
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,279
Please, have a seat.

124
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:45,153
We canvassed the airline ticket
counters, Union Station, buses.

125
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,623
Nobody recognized your son.

126
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,093
Hey. Thanks for
coming back down.

127
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,494
Still nothing from Alex?

128
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,964
No, no. You know, I'm sorry.

129
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,434
Why didn't you tell us
this over the phone?

130
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,300
Why did you want us
to come down here?

131
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,003
We got a report of an
unidentified diabetic kid in a coma.

132
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,304
It matches your son's
general description.

133
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,279
- Where is he?
- In all likelihood, it's not him.

134
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,681
We're waiting for them
to fax a photo, but the...

135
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,381
They're still working
on him at the hospital.

136
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,788
- Where is he?
- Iowa. Davenport, Iowa.

137
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,951
- It's 200 miles.
- I'll drive.

138
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,495
They'll know if it's him
or not before we get there.

139
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,600
- If it's him, we'll be closer.
- If not, we'll be farther away.

140
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,532
I can't just sit at the house
waiting for someone to call...

141
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,832
to tell me they've found Alex in a
ditch somewhere or a Dumpster.

142
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,134
I can't! Okay? I can't.

143
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,972
Tell Dubenko the second
HemoCue was 12.1.

144
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,312
- Going to the O.R.?
- FAST was positive, needs an ex-lap.

145
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,944
- How'd it go, Haleh?
- It was a little rough.

146
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,318
Do you wanna give
Dr. Barnett some feedback?

147
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,823
There wasn't much teaching.

148
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,121
You seemed distracted by
questions from the interns.

149
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,356
- Well, they wouldn't shut up.
- Ray.

150
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,365
His frustration prevented the
team from working together.

151
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,002
There was tension in the room.

152
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,532
Could have caused a delay
in diagnosing a splenic lac.

153
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,197
- Oh, please.
- Thank you, Haleh.

154
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,071
Thank you. Thanks.
What was that about?

155
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,043
Improving your skills. Making
you a better teacher, a better leader.

156
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,206
Since when do nurses
evaluate the Residents?

157
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,477
- Haleh's been here longer. She knows.
- I needed to treat this patient.

158
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,692
You also need to create
a positive learning climate.

159
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,222
Are you torturing all
the R-2s, or is it just me?

160
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,258
Ray. Resolving TIA?

161
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,689
Go.

162
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,568
We must have missed it.

163
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,340
They said it's over a mile from
the interstate. We've only gone...

164
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,036
Ah! That's it.

165
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,807
Hello? Anybody here?

166
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,934
Excuse me.

167
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,409
There's a button.

168
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,079
Over there.

169
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,512
Hold your horses, I'm coming.

170
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,215
Hi, you have a boy in DKA?

171
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:35,123
Security guard found him down behind
Penney's at the mall, didn't have any ID.

172
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,256
His blood sugar was
764, pH 7.10, GCS eight.

173
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,766
Ketones were
positive at one to 64.

174
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,428
He's on IV saline,
insulin and potassium.

175
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,597
He just started opening
his eyes on command.

176
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:48,969
You just missed Dr. Hahn.

177
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:53,603
He went home to get his digital camera
so we could send a picture to Chicago.

178
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,947
<i>No. No, it wasn't him.</i>

179
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,109
Right. Thanks.

180
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,856
- Anything?
- No, not yet.

181
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,125
God! Damn it, Alex!

182
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,192
Uhh!

183
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:26,272
Erica's fine to stay at the
apartment till we get back.

184
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:31,084
He's not coming home, Luka.

185
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,869
You have the keys?

186
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,468
Where are we going?

187
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,474
Colorado.

188
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,618
- No infiltrate.
- Like I said, fever without source.

189
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,454
- Everything okay?
- Well, he doesn't have pneumonia.

190
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,289
- Urine?
- All clear.

191
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,954
- Rapid strep?
- No clinical indication.

192
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,897
Okay. Mason, can you
open up your mouth for me?

193
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,162
- I don't like that.
- Come on, you're a big boy.

194
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,737
I already did it.

195
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,306
Okay. Real quick, huh? Ah.

196
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,074
- A little bigger.
- Uh.

197
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,908
- Any rash?
- No.

198
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,811
He looks good. Can you
remove his pajamas for me?

199
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,909
- Dr. Babinski had him in a gown.
- I don't wanna take off my clothes again.

200
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,079
Look, I'm sorry, but
it's important. Okay?

201
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,122
You said we can go home.

202
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,953
- I want to go home.
- Mason.

203
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,355
Mason. WOMAN: Okay.

204
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,429
- I want to go home now!
- Mason, come on.

205
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,826
Ray? WOMAN: Two seconds.

206
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,490
- No!
- Excuse me. Be right back.

207
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,930
No! WOMAN: Come on, Mason.

208
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,264
- No! JIM: Come on,
Mason. One more time.

209
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,600
How's it going in there?

210
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,332
Just looking for a fever source.

211
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,306
Babinski said there wasn't one.

212
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,276
You know how it is with interns.
You gotta check up on them.

213
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,209
But not for 20 minutes.

214
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,817
The interns are doctors.
You have to trust their skills.

215
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,613
But they were students last
week, don't know what they're doing.

216
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,188
You're micromanaging
every case. That's not good.

217
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,293
We were caught up. We've got
six to be seen and 20 in the rack.

218
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,222
And that's my fault?

219
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,626
I liked you better when
you were the closer.

220
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,140
Still no service.

221
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:38,369
We're about 30 miles from Omaha,
so we'll probably get service soon.

222
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,405
- Where in Colorado?
- Huh?

223
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,316
Where's Steve?

224
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,243
Cañon City.

225
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,813
- Where's that?
- In the mountains somewhere, I think.

226
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,515
Never been.

227
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,650
What?

228
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:59,831
Colorado. Always wanted
to go. I hear it's beautiful.

229
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,661
Yeah.

230
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:10,336
What were you and Alex fighting
about? Last night, before he left?

231
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,775
The usual.

232
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,073
Me?

233
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,909
Us.

234
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,950
I should have just
told him the truth.

235
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,352
- Well, he knew we were having trouble.
- No.

236
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,088
The truth about his father.

237
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,972
After the Attending leaves you alone
in Trauma, you'll be critiqued by a nurse.

238
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,144
That's weird.

239
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,432
Even if the patient's crashing, make
nice with the newbies or you'll be dinged.

240
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,949
Ray, can I give another four
of morphine to McKenzie?

241
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,350
- You think he needs it?
- No, I just want him to stop breathing.

242
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,545
Fine.

243
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,850
You're responsible for
everything the intern does...

244
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,119
but question the history,
they get testy on you.

245
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,934
- Sounds like you had a great day.
- Yeah.

246
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,395
You ready, Neela? Tonight's
all about you and me.

247
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,194
- And me. Teddy Marsh, new intern.
- Hello.

248
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,666
First shift. An
overnight. Awesome.

249
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,068
This is Neela. She's
the R-2. She's in charge.

250
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,639
Your mission, clear
that board by morning.

251
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,336
I'm so screwed.

252
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,207
Antifreeze overdose has been
here all night waiting on ICU.

253
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,974
Let's step it up. The day
shift wants to get out of here.

254
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,051
Fomepizole's an alcohol
dehydrogenase inhibitor. You'll be fine.

255
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:26,534
What?

256
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:28,688
Neela, you're running
rounds. Let's start.

257
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,673
It's about nine hours to Denver.
I think we can make it by dawn.

258
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,874
- You try to sleep. I'll drive.
- No, I'm okay.

259
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,020
No, no. I'm awake. I'm not sure
I will be in the next four hours.

260
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,181
Shoot. My cell-phone battery's almost
dead. I should have brought my charger.

261
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,925
Hey, Luka.

262
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,372
Thank you.

263
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,906
The calculated osmolality
is approximated...

264
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,913
by multiplying the
sodium concentration...

265
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,214
by two and adding glucose
divided by 18 and the BUN, over 2.8.

266
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,790
Anyone have the numbers handy?
That's okay. We'll make some up.

267
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,122
Let's say he's measured...

268
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,627
What does this have to
do with a fractured rib?

269
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,128
Absolutely nothing.

270
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,893
- I have a date.
- Go. We could be here all night.

271
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,627
- Thank you.
- Divided by 2.8.

272
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,466
Twenty minutes and we're
only on the second patient.

273
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,302
Stay focused on the clinically
relevant teaching points.

274
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,274
It is. There's an osmolar gap.
Interns need to know what that means.

275
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,646
- Not right now.
- Stab wound. Need some help here.

276
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,808
Neela, take it with Marsh. Pratt,
Morris, finish running the board.

277
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,319
- Ready?
- My first trauma as a doc. All right.

278
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,652
Single stab to the right chest,
agonal resps, sats 84 on 15 liters.

279
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,317
All right, Trauma 1, let's go.

280
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,634
Now enter the thoracic
cavity through the intercostal.

281
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,996
Okay. I felt a pop.

282
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:28,836
Okay, insert finger, feel lung tissue,
pass the tube on a curved clamp.

283
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,477
Pretty cool. My first
night, my first chest tube.

284
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:35,706
The key is to avoid the neurovascular
bundle at the inferior margin of the rib.

285
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,315
The tube won't pass.

286
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,213
All right, let me try.

287
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,681
I can't find the tract.

288
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,350
Sometimes you need to
check again with a finger.

289
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,821
There is no tract. Did you
enter the thoracic cavity?

290
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,194
I thought I did.

291
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,858
Did you feel lung tissue?

292
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,503
It was warm and soft.

293
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,162
Lung tissue expands and
contracts with ventilation.

294
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,967
Right.

295
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,206
Now we're into the pleura.

296
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,374
I'm sorry. I thought I was in.

297
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,708
- I'll do better next time.
- How you doing?

298
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,545
Finishing up a chest tube.
Can you start a central line?

299
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,655
- I got a cue ball versus cheek to sew up.
- Trauma patient takes priority. 0-silk.

300
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,950
Pulse is 98, BP is stable,
what's the big deal?

301
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,391
My guy needs a three-layer closure
on a complex stellate facial lac.

302
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,553
- That could take two hours.
- Yeah.

303
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,222
Let Plastics do it. Someone
needs to keep an eye on the board.

304
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,336
Don't worry. I told the nurses to
send off labs and x-rays on everyone.

305
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,527
Morris!

306
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,504
Looks like everything's
under control.

307
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,753
- Is that a vertical mattress?
- No, it's horizontal.

308
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,299
What are you doing?

309
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,604
Bugs. It's difficult to see.

310
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,595
Where are we?

311
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,532
Uh, we passed Grand
Island about an hour ago.

312
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,942
- We should get to a phone, call Chicago.
- Okay.

313
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,947
What time is it?

314
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,011
One-thirty.

315
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,890
I was dreaming about Alex.

316
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,892
He was 2 or 3.

317
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,292
And I needed a bathing suit...

318
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:36,095
so I was looking through the
racks at some department store.

319
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,266
And when I looked
back, Alex was gone.

320
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,633
He just vanished.

321
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,544
I guess you don't have to be
Freud to figure that one out.

322
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,012
I lost my son at the ocean.

323
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,424
Daniella didn't want me
to take him, but I insisted.

324
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:09,695
I was mad that she
didn't trust me, so, uh...

325
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,771
We had a big fight,
and she let us go.

326
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,265
What happened?

327
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:19,003
It was a very hot day, so
everyone had come to the beach.

328
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,010
You have beaches in Croatia?

329
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,110
Beautiful beaches.
Miles of them.

330
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:31,019
Anyway, so, uh, we found
about an inch of sand...

331
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,686
that wasn't already taken,
and we went down to the water.

332
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,455
He wanted to build
a sand castle...

333
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:44,002
so I went back up to pick
up his little shovel and bucket.

334
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,138
And when I came
back, he was gone.

335
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,306
I looked everywhere...

336
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:56,848
ran up and down the beach to the
shops by the road, into the water.

337
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,507
I couldn't find him.

338
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,879
How long was he missing?

339
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,887
Two hours.

340
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,386
Where was he?

341
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,060
Some boy had a dog.

342
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,431
The police found him wandering.

343
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:21,499
He knew his name, so they called
our house and Daniella answered.

344
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:28,344
When I got home, he was
sitting in a bathtub with his sister...

345
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,143
having a wonderful time.

346
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:41,388
I went to the kitchen and I cried
by the sink, with the water running.

347
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,095
What was his name?

348
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,929
Marco.

349
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,697
Alex is gonna be all right, Sam.

350
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,434
We're gonna find him
and he's gonna be all right.

351
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,988
It's 3 a.m. Shouldn't this
be slowing down by now?

352
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,784
You've got a dark cloud,
Neela. Always have.

353
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,722
Twelve more out there
triaging as we speak.

354
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,489
Neurosurg is coming to see the
subdural, he'll need a unit bed.

355
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,427
I'm gonna lie down for
a couple hours. Cool?

356
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,658
We've got three intubated
patients and a full board.

357
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:25,100
You are more than capable of
managing whatever comes in.

358
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,164
What? That's the fun
of being the big R-2.

359
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,241
You get to be queen
of the night shift.

360
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,311
Don't wanna be. I wanna get the
board cleared before day shift comes.

361
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:36,643
Can I get a copy of your schedule?
I'm trying to avoid nights that you're on.

362
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,307
Are you going to bed and
leaving me alone with this mess?

363
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,045
- You're not alone. You have him.
- Busy? I wanna present my guy.

364
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,816
Wake me only if it's
really, really important.

365
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,654
- He's going to bed?
- Yup. It's you and me against the world.

366
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,821
Chuny had me correct your fentanyl
order. It's micrograms, not milligrams.

367
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,558
Oh, God. That could have
led to a really serious mistake.

368
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,193
- It was caught in time, no harm done.
- I'm so sorry. Thanks for fixing it.

369
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,533
It's okay. You gotta learn
somehow. What you got?

370
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:04,074
A 37-year-old with
a deltoid abscess.

371
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,906
Never done an I&D, thought
you might wanna supervise me.

372
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,049
- Any other history?
- Chronic IV drug use, that's about it.

373
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,410
Physical?

374
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,042
Four-by-five fluctuant lesion on
the lateral aspect of the upper arm.

375
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,018
Remainder of the exam
was entirely normal.

376
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,057
Hey, doc. You ready to
slice open this bad boy?

377
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,387
This is Dr. Rasgotra.
She's my supervisor.

378
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,223
Just wanna take a quick listen.

379
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,729
It's so satisfying when
you guys cut it open...

380
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,663
and all that pus
comes pouring out.

381
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,636
Ten blade, saline,
swabs, packing gauze.

382
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,741
Anything else?

383
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:38,070
- Mr...?
- Kingsley.

384
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,405
Uh, we'll be, uh, back
in a minute. Okay?

385
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,551
- Did you listen to his heart?
- Of course I did.

386
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,987
So when you said his
exam was entirely normal...

387
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,922
were you just forgetting
to mention his murmur?

388
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,893
- He has a murmur?
- Four over six at the left sternal border.

389
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:02,831
- He has a thrill. It's not subtle.
- Wow. Big miss. I'll listen again.

390
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,096
You can't miss a
murmur in an IV drug user.

391
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,465
Could be endocarditis.

392
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,971
He needs an echo and
antibiotics before the I&D.

393
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:14,570
I heard you were smart, but I had no
idea you were such an awesome teacher.

394
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,507
Thanks for saving my ass.

395
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,365
What was that?

396
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,834
I don't know.

397
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,419
Oh, God.

398
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,658
Wait here.

399
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,935
What is it?

400
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,097
A deer, I think.

401
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,703
Is it dead?

402
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,575
No.

403
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,406
I don't think so.

404
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,918
I don't know.

405
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,554
You folks need help?

406
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,119
- I didn't... I didn't see it.
- Antelope.

407
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,921
Did a real number to your car.

408
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,958
- You both all right?
- Yeah.

409
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,568
I got a rifle in the truck.

410
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,641
Sam. SAM: We gotta keep going.

411
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,445
Sam, the car's wrecked.
The radiator's leaking.

412
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,889
The windshield's shattered.
You won't be able to see.

413
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,590
Come on.

414
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,088
Come on!

415
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,877
Our syphilis guy's had over
50 partners in the last 90 days.

416
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,811
Wants to know if they
can come for treatment.

417
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:11,287
As long as they wait till sunrise.
Pen G, 2.4 million units IM.

418
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,585
Neela! Your COPD'er
isn't looking so good.

419
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,961
Sats dropped to 87 on room air.

420
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,462
Can hardly catch my breath.

421
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,759
He was fine when I saw
him, he wasn't wheezing.

422
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,800
You can't wheeze if
you're not moving air.

423
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:27,462
We'll give you medicine to help.
Albuterol, 5 migs with 500 of Atrovent.

424
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,700
Sure that's a good idea? His
theophylline's 53, he's throwing PVCs.

425
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,812
What? You didn't bother
mentioning a toxic theophylline level?

426
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,505
I didn't know. I hadn't checked.

427
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,913
Didn't think we'd have
the level back till tomorrow.

428
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,813
Breathing's been bad.

429
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,819
I took some extra pills.

430
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,151
A hundred of lidocaine
and move him to Trauma.

431
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:49,124
Hold off on the albuterol until
we stabilize his arrhythmia.

432
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,694
You got it.

433
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,457
We'll be right
back, Mr. Canberra.

434
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,204
Whoa, you were great in
there. You really took control.

435
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:03,001
- Teddy, listen...
- I'm sorry about the theophylline thing.

436
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,373
- I'll have to thank Chuny for fixing it...
- Just listen, okay?

437
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,345
You wanna know a secret?

438
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:11,306
You don't have to be that
smart to be a good doctor.

439
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,146
You just have to be thorough,
systematic and meticulous.

440
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,379
- I'm trying.
- Not hard enough.

441
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:19,719
You've missed glaring physical
findings, overlooked critical labs...

442
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,521
and I've been correcting
your med orders all night.

443
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,091
It's my first shift.

444
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,996
I realize that, but you're
responsible for real people here...

445
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,261
and I can't watch
your every move.

446
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,202
I know that. And I
wanna thank you...

447
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,899
And your attitude...

448
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,208
It's just so contrite
and appreciative.

449
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,976
It's just weird.

450
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,384
I...

451
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,094
I guess I just don't get it.

452
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,492
- Wait...
- I'm getting some coffee. Need anything?

453
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,862
Teddy, wait!

454
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:07,029
We'll do a head-to-toe
H & P together.

455
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,765
Might help identify where
some of your deficiencies are.

456
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,644
Bollocks.

457
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,464
They're gonna send a
truck to tow the car in.

458
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,224
Did you call Chicago?

459
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:47,776
The guy inside gets off at 7.
Offered us a ride back to North Platte.

460
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,281
From there, we can catch a bus
to Denver, or maybe rent a car.

461
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,044
North Platte's an hour east?

462
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,926
What are you doing?

463
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,468
Sam?

464
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,135
Sam.

465
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,334
Sam!

466
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,007
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

467
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,210
- You gonna hitchhike?
- He's been off his insulin for two days.

468
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,322
He's out there dying.

469
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,316
Hey!

470
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,459
- How'd it go?
- Not well.

471
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:40,160
Will you take a look at this board?
It's not 8 a.m. and the day sucks.

472
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,994
- Morning.
- You should've called me.

473
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,398
I hate leaving a
mess for the day shift.

474
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,967
Most of them are
waiting for beds.

475
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,201
This is ridiculous. Antifreeze overdose
has been here since yesterday morning.

476
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,140
Case in point.

477
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,007
What have you
been doing all night?

478
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,111
Taking a bubble bath
and eating bonbons.

479
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,850
- Lewis will make you run the board.
- I know.

480
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,286
Just remember that fomepizole's
an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor.

481
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,823
Hey, come on, come on.
Present this thing already.

482
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,928
Okay, let's get the night
shift home. You are...?

483
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,621
- Lana Clemons, new intern.
- You've met Dr. Sackowitz.

484
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,767
Pratt's the senior and
Dr. Lewis is our Attending.

485
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,131
- Neela, where's your intern?
- Sent him home a bit early.

486
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,566
Okay, day shift, let's go.

487
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,436
Curtain Number 1, 22-year-old
with myelomeningocele. What's that?

488
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:25,076
- Spina bifida?
- Excellent.

489
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,179
Most common congenital
neurologic deficit compatible with life.

490
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,370
How does it happen?

491
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,380
Neural tube doesn't
close in utero.

492
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,850
Uh-huh. Most likely due to an interaction
of genetic and environmental factors.

493
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,750
Ladies, remember
to take your folate.

494
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:40,586
On to why the patient is here. Rule out
shunt obstruction, common ER complaint.

495
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,421
- What's your approach?
- Shunt series?

496
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,063
- Before that?
- Tap the reservoir.

497
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:50,267
Guys. Before you do
anything? Take a history.

498
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,031
Classic symptoms of shunt obstruction:
headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy.

499
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:08,748
I'm like a bad trailer-park
version of myself.

500
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,062
What are you doing here, Luka?

501
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,495
Sam, I care about Alex.

502
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,795
But you can't
replace his father.

503
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,770
I know that.

504
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:35,642
I'm just not ready for this
to be all there is in my life.

505
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,449
I can't bring your kids back.

506
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:46,784
I have a child of my own, and if
it's a choice between you and Alex...

507
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,154
I am always going
to choose Alex.

508
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,627
- I'm not asking you to choose.
- Of course you are.

509
00:33:55,233 --> 00:34:00,763
I don't want what happened to
my family to be the end of my story.

510
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,674
I was a good father. I
can be a good father again.

511
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,436
And what if it's
not what I want?

512
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,044
Why don't you wanna
have children with me?

513
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,879
It's not about you.

514
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,982
I don't wanna
have any more kids.

515
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,223
I'm done.

516
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,386
I want my life back.

517
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,404
They can stop the run, but the
secondary is suspect, Champ or no Champ.

518
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:47,147
I tell you what, they make the
playoffs again, Colts will eat them up.

519
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:49,116
My brother and I got tickets.

520
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,655
Raiders. Should be able
to beat up on those jokers.

521
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,590
What's this idiot doing?

522
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,620
You wanna ticket him?

523
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,429
- Hang on. I'll be right back.
- What do you got?

524
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,772
Alex Taggart?

525
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,081
Hey. Alex?

526
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,885
Are you Alex Taggart?

527
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,958
- I'm Samantha Taggart.
- Dr. Collins.

528
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,358
How is he?

529
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,159
He was lethargic when
they brought him in here.

530
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,926
Glucose was 375.

531
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,330
It's not too critical.

532
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,941
After a little insulin and
saline, he's doing much better.

533
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,241
Can you give us
a minute, please?

534
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:28,714
Damn it, Alex.

535
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,452
I'm okay. I drank lots of water.

536
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,091
- You were lucky.
- I know how to monitor my sugar.

537
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,762
You're 12 years old and diabetic.
What the hell are you thinking?

538
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,227
I couldn't find him.

539
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,770
What?

540
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,034
Dad.

541
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,346
I looked in the phone
books, I called Information...

542
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,846
a bunch of different
rafting companies.

543
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,076
He's not here.

544
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,193
How we doing?

545
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,890
I'm losing the battle, and
we're knee-deep in triage.

546
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:20,266
- Well, I'm going as fast as I can.
- More than I can say for your interns.

547
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,236
Well, say no more.

548
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,036
- Dr. Sackowitz. SACKOWITZ:
Four-centimeter scalp lac.

549
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,111
After copious irrigation...

550
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,773
I'm using a 4-0 nylon interrupted,
the wound's edges are...

551
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,145
Abby.

552
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,049
Cosmetic repair is not
an issue at the scalp.

553
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,781
- I've never used a skin stapler.
- You'll do it next time.

554
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:41,119
Just point and shoot.
Grab another two patients.

555
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,454
There's a guy with
abdominal pain in distress.

556
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:48,225
I sent off a CBC, Chem-20, ordered an
abdominal series and a Surgical consult.

557
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:52,131
- Hello. George, how are you feeling?
- I can't get comfortable.

558
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,933
Okay, tell me, does it
feel worse when I do this?

559
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,809
Okay. All right. You
have a kidney stone.

560
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,345
- How'd you know that?
- I just do.

561
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,984
- Four plus blood.
- Okay, 30 of IV Toradol and 10 of MS.

562
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,347
Get a CT urogram and
cancel all the other orders.

563
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,784
- Got it.
- Ten minutes, you'll be feeling no pain.

564
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,411
Thank you.

565
00:38:11,435 --> 00:38:13,236
Should I see if the
analgesics take effect?

566
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,486
No, you should pick
up another chart.

567
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:34,476
You sure? Because
you don't have to.

568
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,353
I'm sorry, Alex.

569
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,462
I wish that this
wasn't your life.

570
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,728
I can't tell you how
much I wish that.

571
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:02,463
It's okay, Mom. I wanna go.

572
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,054
Here?

573
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,358
Here? How about here?

574
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,656
Ah!

575
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,322
- Okay, 3 cc's, 1 percent lidocaine.
- Lidocaine?

576
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,436
You have a knot in your muscle,
which this shot should help.

577
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:33,866
Ah!

578
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,065
Okay. All right. Be right back.

579
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,574
Okay.

580
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,235
Right-lower-quadrant
tenderness, low-grade fever.

581
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:45,577
- No white count, anorexia or rebound.
- All right. Can you stand up for me?

582
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,720
- Do you think it's appendicitis?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

583
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,585
Okay. Can you do this?

584
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,953
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

585
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,160
Can you do it again?

586
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,796
Okay. Excellent. It's not an appy.
Clear liquids, recheck in the a.m.

587
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,869
- How's your headache?
- Completely gone. Thank you, doctor.

588
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,596
I'm about to clear the rack.

589
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,104
Oh, yeah?

590
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,800
If I saw all the patients
myself, we wouldn't get behind.

591
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,616
Bet you're feeling
pretty good about that.

592
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,407
Mm-hm. I can't believe it
took me so long to figure it out.

593
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,949
- You haven't.
- What?

594
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,678
You didn't show
Sackowitz how to staple.

595
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,293
You didn't teach Clemons about
your approach to kidney stones.

596
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,391
You did a trigger point, a jump test
and completely ignored your interns.

597
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,289
They were moving like
slugs. You told me to step it up.

598
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:34,091
Yeah, but your job isn't to just move
the meat. You're a Resident now.

599
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,463
The lady in Exam
3 spiked to 104.

600
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,399
Guess I better go.

601
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,572
Nice job on the board, Abby.

602
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:47,341
- What's the matter with her?
- She's a new R-2.

603
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:50,141
- It's gonna be a long year.
- She'll catch on.

604
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,648
But she's not supervising,
she's not teaching.

605
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,410
She's doing everything herself.

606
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,350
You know, that reminds me
of someone I used to know.

607
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,670
How is he?

608
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,268
Full of crap, like always.

609
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,547
I meant Alex.

610
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,745
He's okay.

611
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:29,581
He wants to spend some
time alone with his dad, so...

612
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:33,247
There's only 10 more
minutes of visiting hours, so...

613
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,690
I figure Steve can't screw
him up that bad in 10 minutes.

614
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,693
God knows, I'm sure he'll try.

615
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,458
Alex is a good kid.
He'll figure it out.

616
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,091
Goddamn it, that bastard. He
couldn't care less about us...

617
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:50,105
but that little boy loves him anyway.
What the hell is right about that?

618
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,078
- Thank you.
- For what?

619
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,622
Coming.

620
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:17,500
Now what?

621
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,241
Home, I guess. I don't...

622
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,969
Luka, you cannot possibly
want this for your life.

623
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:31,506
- Want what?
- This! This mess.

624
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,508
Isn't that something I
get to decide for myself?

625
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:39,983
No. If it were just me?

626
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,120
Maybe.

627
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,295
I'd better go in
and check on him.

628
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,647
Steve's in prison.

629
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:08,415
You don't have to run anymore.

630
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,454
I'm not running.

631
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,992
I just don't want what you want.
