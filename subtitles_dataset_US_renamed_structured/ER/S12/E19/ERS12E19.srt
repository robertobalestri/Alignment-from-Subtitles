1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,138
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,036
Change the orders.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,836
This means war, you know.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,172
Look, we never talked
about being monogamous.

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,647
- Never said about not being monogamous.
- The surgery is gonna take away my crutch.

6
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,285
Who will I be then?

7
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:21,354
- You're sending me to Africa?
- How the hell did you get here?

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,082
I got lots of experience
getting into dumps like this, Vic.

9
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,590
<i>Pow.</i>

10
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,368
<i>Hey, this is Jodie. Leave a
message and I'll call you back.</i>

11
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:45,845
Hey, Jodes. Yeah, I know it's late
there and you're sleeping and whatnot.

12
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,108
I just wanted to call
and say hi. Yeah.

13
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:03,159
Yeah, well, board's a mess and
it's the usual bunch of lowlifes.

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,322
Yeah, I don't know
when I'm gonna get out.

15
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:09,163
Yeah, you know, I heard
you got six inches of snow.

16
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:12,329
Yeah, in April. Go figure, huh?

17
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,698
All right.

18
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,938
I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you. Bye.

19
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,285
Dr. Clemente?

20
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,314
Lateral ducubitus
on the coin ingestion.

21
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,755
Dr. Lockhart said we
could discharge the patient...

22
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,454
- Hey, who are you?
- I'm Jane. I'm an intern.

23
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,099
Oh, yeah? How come I've
never seen you before, Jane?

24
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,467
I don't know. I
mostly work nights.

25
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,629
I work nights. And?

26
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,407
Did you wanna see these?

27
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,478
I thought you were
gone two hours ago.

28
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,486
I'm a dedicated guy.
What can I say, huh?

29
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,922
- Wanna help me stock some shelves?
- Do I wanna help you what?

30
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,127
Dr. Clemente, Dr. Pratt
for you on line two.

31
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,594
Yeah, it's about time.

32
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,358
Hey, Pratt?

33
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,765
I got a patient here, Ottley. Claims
you promised him some Vicodin.

34
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,770
Right, he came in with a
migraine. I resolved it with Imitrex.

35
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,170
Said I'd gave him Vicodin
in case the pain came back.

36
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,609
Yeah, well, I think he's playing
us, drug-seeking and whatnot.

37
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,476
Vic, write him a scrip, man.

38
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,847
Know what I was thinking the other day?
Remember that time on top of the roof?

39
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,989
<i>- And we talked, remember that?</i>
- What is the matter with you?

40
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:13,457
- Is Jodie okay?
- Yeah, Jodie's great. It's just...

41
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:19,961
It's just her ex, Bobby. He keeps sending
these weird freaking sympathy cards.

42
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,865
This one, the latest, was filled
with this bunch of little dead goldfish.

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,506
- What?
<i>- What do you think he's trying to tell me?</i>

44
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,471
That "sleeps with
the fishes" thing?

45
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,476
Okay, look, I think you should
give Mr. Ottley his drugs...

46
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,876
go home and get
some sleep, all right?

47
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,711
Okay, all right, all right.
Thanks, man. Thanks. Okay.

48
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,150
- Have fun in the motherland, all right?
- Right.

49
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,666
Two Vicodin? That's it?

50
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,830
- Dr. Pratt said...
- Dr. Pratt's not here. Okay, Mr. Ottley?

51
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,736
What if my migraine comes back?

52
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,373
You take those and you call your
regular doctor in the morning, okay?

53
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,343
You got any more questions?

54
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,877
Hey, Jer. What
else you got for me?

55
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:18,116
Possibly the slowest night on
record. And I am out of here.

56
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,055
- What, you're going?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,686
- Well, hang on, hang on. I'll go with you.
- Yeah, all right.

58
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,026
Wanna go to Ike's
and grab a beer?

59
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,639
I would, but actually, I'm waiting
for my friend to pick me up.

60
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,468
It's all right. Why don't he
join us? What's the big deal?

61
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,545
Well, it's actually a friend
of the female variety.

62
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,545
Ah, I got you, got you, right.

63
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,943
- Next time.
- Okay.

64
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,782
Yeah. So, well,
I'll be going, then.

65
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,585
- Okay, good night.
- Yeah, take it easy.

66
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,629
You want to take
me on, you little prick?

67
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,103
Want to take me on?
Is that what you want?

68
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,999
Okay, you did it.

69
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,575
I can't believe I'm done.

70
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,440
Happy graduation day. Looking
forward to getting back to work?

71
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,572
I've been back for about a week,
trying to keeping up with my paperwork.

72
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,116
Well...

73
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,780
Here's one thing you don't
need to keep up with anymore.

74
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,520
- Thanks for everything.
- No.

75
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,297
- Abdominal bracing. Ten reps a day.
- Okay.

76
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,993
Lenore Bee, 43, 10-foot fall
from a second-story window.

77
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,229
- Are we here? What are we doing?
- What happened to the 12-year-old?

78
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,273
- Morris, why are you wearing...?
- A Prada suit? No reason.

79
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,000
Is he a doctor? I want him.

80
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,941
Dr. Archie Morris at
your service, ma'am.

81
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,014
Twelve-year-old, MVC, complains
of tenderness over the sternum.

82
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,378
- What's your name?
- Ruthie Pooler.

83
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,745
- You got this?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,599
And you get to have this too.

85
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,855
And I'd recommend a face mask.
Damn mutt farted all the way here.

86
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,094
Abdominal pain, low-grade fever.

87
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,824
Doc was worried about appendicitis
so he figured he'd get a surgical consult.

88
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,195
The guy seems fine to me.

89
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:53,203
Kovac. Nice to see you again.

90
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,610
You didn't need to
come in, Grandma.

91
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,369
Of course I needed to.

92
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,707
- My eyes don't hurt.
- I'm checking for signs of head trauma.

93
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,214
I was only going like
two miles an hour.

94
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,654
You were driving? Did
you know about that?

95
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,280
Did you tell your family everything
you did when you were 12?

96
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,353
I did not know.

97
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,496
I wanted to pick up your
prescriptions and still get to school.

98
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,894
Let me see. What
about your parents?

99
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,595
Oh, uh, Ruthie's mother and father
died when she was 6 months old.

100
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,898
- I was about a year, Grandma.
- I'm sorry.

101
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,734
I would be too, if I remembered.

102
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,575
Bob. Ooh, he's a regular wind
tunnel this morning, isn't he?

103
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,686
Ruthie, we have to keep you
here for a while for observation.

104
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,517
Grandma, maybe Dr. Lockhart
can ask you about your cough.

105
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,421
- Sure, we'll check that out.
- What about the dog?

106
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,091
Oh, I think it's his diet.

107
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,926
No, he can't be here, even temporarily.
Is there some place you can keep him?

108
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,495
- So should I call the SPCA?
- Oh.

109
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,268
Bob's 13 years old.

110
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,965
Don't get me wrong,
I support the SPCA.

111
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,474
But they take him, I'm
stuck here a day or two...

112
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,670
and my Grandma
can't get him out...

113
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,719
they might put him down.
So if Bob goes, I go with him.

114
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,288
You're sure you don't want this?

115
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,254
- You'll be sorry.
- Lenore, did you lose consciousness?

116
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,827
No, Dr. Archie, I remember
everything. Cleaning my windows...

117
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,492
- BP's 90/50, 300 of saline.
- Gotta worry about the spleen.

118
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,567
Paramedics came. Kind of cute,
kind of like the two of you guys.

119
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,171
- Is she on meth?
- Okay. Possible left 10th rib fracture.

120
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,507
Whoa. MORRIS: Whoa. Okay.

121
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,680
You know...? You know
what? If you don't mind.

122
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,510
- You want me to hold it?
- What's with the suit, man?

123
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,281
Uh, keep this on the QT, but I took
a job with Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.

124
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,425
Doesn't start till July
1st, but signing bonus.

125
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,186
Always been my dream. Pushing
overpriced meds to people...

126
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,953
who probably don't need them.

127
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,689
Always been my dream
to hold Dr. Archie's coat.

128
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:03,963
Okay, trauma panel, C-spine, chest,
page Surgery and let's get an ultrasound.

129
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:08,199
- Will Ruthie's x-rays take a little while?
- Only about 30 minutes.

130
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,536
- Isn't that what you said?
- Something like that.

131
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,269
Can you take another
deep breath in, please?

132
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,012
How long have
you had that cough?

133
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:23,045
About three or four years. Since
Jimmy Carter was president, I guess.

134
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,158
Since you wish Jimmy Carter
was president, right, Grandma?

135
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,227
I write his name in every time.

136
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,659
Still waiting for Radiology.
Shouldn't be long.

137
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,128
Thanks.

138
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,329
Don't worry, dear. They said
it'd only take about 30 minutes.

139
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,131
Can you remind me again?
When was Jimmy Carter elected?

140
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,299
- I think it was back...
- Mrs. Pooler?

141
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,914
Well, sometime
before this latest bozo.

142
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,073
Oh, thank you.

143
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,275
You know, I don't
much like any of them.

144
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,911
You wanna know why?

145
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,852
I don't think Dr. Lockhart
cares much about our politics.

146
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,582
Stamps.

147
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:03,029
The price of stamps.
They all keep raising them.

148
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,758
This latest increase,
can you believe it?

149
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,528
Nineteen cents for first class.

150
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,897
Nineteen cents?

151
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,066
Come on, Grandma, you know
it's gone up a lot more than that.

152
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,509
Yeah, I know, I know, but
I don't like to think about it.

153
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,182
If Ruthie has to stay in here...

154
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,684
it won't be more than
a couple of days, right?

155
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,824
Because I really do
want her home for Easter.

156
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,517
- Grandma...
- I think Easter was last week.

157
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,526
Well, I certainly hope not. We're
picking up the ham on Saturday.

158
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,836
I've got four cases backed up in
the O.R. so this had better be real.

159
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,704
I'm Dr. Albright from
Surgery. Does your belly hurt?

160
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,608
- I guess so.
- Here you go.

161
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,710
- Fluid in Morison's pouch?
- That looks like it.

162
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,693
Blood anterior to the bladder
and in the splenorenal recess.

163
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,197
I've seen enough.
Prep her for the O.R.

164
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,801
I think we should get a CT.

165
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,700
- She's unstable, she's anemic.
- Could be chronic.

166
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,306
- She's hypotensive.
- BP normalized with a liter.

167
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,411
She's bleeding in her belly,
end of story. Get her upstairs.

168
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,474
Guess you told her.

169
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,743
Repeat the HemoCue, get a
serum albumin and a urine protein.

170
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,878
- Yeah, but that could take...
- Yes, Haleh, it could.

171
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,254
- I wanted to give you a heads up...
- Steve's in Exam 2? I know.

172
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,450
- Hey.
- It's okay.

173
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,996
- We can get another nurse.
- Luka, thank you, but I can handle it.

174
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,800
Hey, Sam.

175
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,166
They thought it
was appendicitis?

176
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:57,242
Yeah, I was in a lot of pain on
the drive over, but I feel okay now.

177
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,977
Figured they'd assign
me another nurse.

178
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,172
Just doing my job.

179
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,784
So things are going
pretty well, huh?

180
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,013
Alex writes me a
lot of letters now.

181
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,624
Yeah, I know. Your temp's 99.4.

182
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,259
I'm happy for you, Sam.

183
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,794
New job, new place to live.

184
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,602
What's with the cross?

185
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,306
The chaplain gave it to me.

186
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,965
Are you keeping up
on your Bible studies?

187
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,805
Yeah.

188
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,112
I'm picking up a thing or two.

189
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,774
And it doesn't hurt that those are
the guys who'll watch your back.

190
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,453
Your BP's 124/80.

191
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,920
That's good, right?

192
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,919
It's normal.

193
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,160
You think I'm faking
this pain, don't you?

194
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,968
A lot of guys do just
so they can get out.

195
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,799
- Yeah.
- I can't say I blame them.

196
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,692
If there's one thing
you can say about

197
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,042
jail, it's everything
it's cracked up to be.

198
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,520
One of the docs will
be in to check you out.

199
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,253
Steve Curtis, 35-year-old detainee
with abdominal pain. Rule out appy.

200
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:23,021
- How'd we get a detainee?
- Pain was 10 out of 10. It's resolved.

201
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,256
Resolved. That's convenient.

202
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,900
I feel I should let you know
that Mr. Curtis and Sam...

203
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,592
Neela.

204
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,502
It's my ex, my kid's dad.

205
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,040
Oh, that must be really
tough on your little boy.

206
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,543
- It is what it is.
- Hello, Mr. Curtis. I'm Dr. Clemente.

207
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,840
Are you feeling any
tenderness at all anywhere?

208
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,745
- No, it's better now.
- His white count's 10,000.

209
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,149
- That's not very impressive, is it?
- Pulse is down after a liter.

210
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,722
- It was pretty painful for a while.
- Oh, yeah?

211
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,655
Could be the stomach flu.
You live in close quarters.

212
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,159
That could run rampant
through half the population.

213
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,628
Close quarters? You're a riot.

214
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,836
Anyway, anyway. Well,
you're feeling better, right?

215
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,303
And Dr. Rasgotra
here will sign you out.

216
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,836
He has a low-grade fever.
We should observe him...

217
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,172
Come on, it's barely a
low-grade fever, please.

218
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,874
- CBC shows a left shift.
- Yeah, but there's no leukocytosis.

219
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,508
I can appreciate these guys wanting
to get out of the can now and then.

220
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,782
But we're not running a timeshare
here, okay? Just release him.

221
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,719
I'm sorry if you didn't want
me to mention your relationship.

222
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,526
It's okay. I just don't
need people protecting me.

223
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,100
You wanna write
up his aftercare?

224
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,602
- No, repeat the CBC.
- Neela, you don't have to do that for me.

225
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,366
I'm not doing it for you.
His history tells me to do it.

226
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:47,037
- History? What, lies and deception?
- You never really thought he was sick?

227
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,381
I don't know. Clemente
examined him and released him.

228
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,384
- He's a patient like anyone else.
- Repeat the CBC.

229
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,086
So it's not Alzheimer's?

230
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,388
No, but there are similarities
in how it affects people.

231
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,897
And with this type of dementia, it
can sometimes progress very quickly.

232
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,126
But that means
sometimes it can be slow.

233
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,128
Ruthie, let the doctor talk.

234
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:16,373
There are some concerns, Mrs. Pooler,
about your ability to take care of Ruthie.

235
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,912
- To make decisions, to cook.
- I can cook, I can make decisions.

236
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,474
Like you did about
driving this morning?

237
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,248
And Social Services is
going to wanna talk to you.

238
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:32,654
Most likely, they're gonna wanna
discuss putting Ruthie into foster care.

239
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,590
They can't do that. You
can't do that, that's not fair.

240
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,923
- We're not gonna let them, are we?
- Ruthie.

241
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,931
I don't take the car much and
I've never hit anything before.

242
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,795
I know everything she
needs, all of her prescriptions.

243
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,439
- Neurontin, 300 milligrams, twice a day.
- Ruthie.

244
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,501
Diltiazem, 240 milligrams a day.

245
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,603
- Stop it.
- Lanoxin, 0.125 milligrams a day.

246
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,578
Stop it now.

247
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,346
Please, please,
don't let this happen.

248
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,616
I don't want anything to change.

249
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,281
Ruthie?

250
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,690
When your mama and daddy died...

251
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,293
I thought that nothing
would ever be the same.

252
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:20,439
And then we took the
worst possible moments...

253
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:26,773
and we turned it into years and
years of the best possible moments.

254
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,475
- Didn't we?
- Yeah.

255
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:35,014
Oh, now, I know that at
least about this one thing...

256
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,123
Grandma is not confused, am I?

257
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:42,060
- No.
- No, that's my girl.

258
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,294
Oh, yeah.

259
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,369
Okay, so you don't want
me to hold the coat this time.

260
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,305
Had a talk with myself this afternoon.
I said, "Archie, you know what?

261
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,469
You are Dr. Archie Morris. You
don't need no stinking Prada suit."

262
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,480
- What did you spill?
- Coffee.

263
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,346
Little numbing
medicine here, Lenore.

264
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,981
- Morris, what the hell are you doing?
- Peritoneal aspirate.

265
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,757
- Is your name Morris?
- Her crit was stable.

266
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,690
- So I decided to do...
- I've been waiting for half an hour.

267
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,762
I discovered she's been
on lithium for a year.

268
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,457
- Oh, and that changes everything?
- Not quite everything, but...

269
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,369
- Whoa, wait, she's prepped and draped.
- And bleeding internally.

270
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,064
- What's going on?
- Wait, wait.

271
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,699
- The lithium causes nephrotic syndrome.
- Tell me something I don't know.

272
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,540
Her hypertension could be
vasovagal from the rib pain.

273
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,183
- You wanna make that assumption?
- Where am I going?

274
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,548
- Hold on, honey, they're figuring it out.
- She may not need the O.R.

275
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,189
I feel very strongly
about this, Dr. Albright.

276
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,349
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Yes, I do.

277
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,051
Morris!

278
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,292
- Wow.
- Wow.

279
00:18:56,235 --> 00:19:00,366
Straw-colored fluid, not blood. It's
ascites from nephrotic syndrome.

280
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,634
She doesn't need surgery. She
needs steroids and a kidney biopsy.

281
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,989
Double trauma pulling up
if you're looking for action.

282
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:55,595
No, I gotta head upstairs.
Sorry we missed you in your suit.

283
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,754
- How'd you know about my suit?
- I know everything.

284
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,297
- Everything?
- Dr. Weaver.

285
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,436
Don't suppose I can get you
to look at this open tib-fib in 4?

286
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:07,698
- Sorry, Chuny, I'm not on today.
- All right.

287
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,670
- Dr. Weaver.
- Dr. Albright.

288
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,111
- Don't worry, I am handling it.
- You haven't called Social Services.

289
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:23,484
I didn't say that. I said they put
me on hold. I don't have the time...

290
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,990
You really think you're gonna make
things easier by keeping them around?

291
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,627
No.

292
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,824
It's not easy. They've
always had each other.

293
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,024
I know, and it's horribly sad,
but they can't stay that way.

294
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,670
We don't know that a hundred
percent for sure, do we?

295
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,029
This woman has
bilateral lacunar infarcts.

296
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,641
She's gonna decompensate
sooner rather than later.

297
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,004
And what? She's gonna
raise a 12-year-old?

298
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,806
Well, a very mature
12-year-old that seems so far...

299
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,643
to have done a very good
job of holding it together.

300
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,845
They're a family, Luka. Why
aren't we fighting for that?

301
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,851
Kids shouldn't be caretakers.

302
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,482
Sometimes they have to be.

303
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,355
I know in Croatia, you grew
up like Ozzie and Harriet.

304
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,362
I'm sorry, I know you don't
know what <i>Ozzie & Harriet</i> is.

305
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,501
But whatever. The thing is, it's
going to get harder and harder.

306
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,364
That doesn't mean that
they're not better off together.

307
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,268
Like you were better
off with your mother?

308
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,375
- Sorry.
- You know, that girl is healthy.

309
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,707
She's in school. She's
in a loving environment.

310
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,715
The grandmother is still
functioning. She can handle her ADLs.

311
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,113
Yeah, for now, but what...?

312
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,119
If you asked me if I wanted to
be taken away from my mother...

313
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,189
I would have said no.

314
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,020
It's not our job to let
the 12-year-olds decide.

315
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:39,695
Ruthie? Hey,
Ruthie, stop. Ruthie.

316
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,929
Very mature.

317
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:46,595
Neela, your repeat blood work's back
on your no doubt unfairly prosecuted...

318
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,764
wrongly incarcerated,
rule-out appy.

319
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:52,571
- I told you to discharge him, didn't I?
- His white count's up to 12,000.

320
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,907
- So what?
- If his appendix burst on the way...

321
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,573
his pain might be temporarily
relieved. Wait, see if he declares himself.

322
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,243
- I examined him. Here.
- His temperature's up to 100.4.

323
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,649
- Could be an appy.
- Right.

324
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,882
- No way. It's impossible.
- Let me take a look.

325
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,891
The initial exam could've been
in the post-perforation window.

326
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,656
- But he'd have signs of peritonitis.
- Takes a while to develop.

327
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,265
Steve.

328
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,797
- Hey, Steve.
- He's diaphoretic, barely has a pulse.

329
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,166
Two liters, wide open,
put him in Trendelenberg.

330
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,672
- Take the cuffs off, please.
- All right.

331
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,778
- His abdomen's rigid as a board.
- Can't be, it was soft.

332
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,404
- Pressure's only 70 palp.
- He's gonna need a second IV.

333
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,622
- Give him a gram of cefoxitin.
- Are you gonna take him to the O.R.?

334
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,947
If we get pressure up.
He's septic. Dopamine.

335
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,015
- Run a V-tach.
- Okay, get the crash cart.

336
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,026
O.R. 3. They bumped your
lap chole. Hey, how are you?

337
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,493
- I wasn't faking.
- Yeah, I know.

338
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:52,627
Rasgotra, Barney Fife here wants to
know how long you're gonna detain him.

339
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,240
I was thinking, what?
As long as possible?

340
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,739
Yes, that would be correct.

341
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,480
Yeah?

342
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,350
<i>You've been working
pretty long hours, Vic.</i>

343
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,922
<i>Getting any sleep?</i>

344
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,925
Bobby, I'm not doing this. You
hear me? I'm not doing it, man.

345
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,154
<i>I've been wanting
to talk to you all day.</i>

346
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,266
<i>Even stopped by to drop something off,
but there was this sheriff's van outside.</i>

347
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,595
<i>What did you do, go
and hire protection?</i>

348
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,170
I'm not playing your game.

349
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,466
You hear me? I'm not
playing your little games.

350
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,769
<i>Okay, okay, calm down,
buddy. I'll let you go.</i>

351
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,344
<i>Oh, and one last thing, though.</i>

352
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,107
<i>What time are you
going home tonight?</i>

353
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,715
- Where's Dr. Lockhart?
- We'd have to check.

354
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,222
Please tell her Ruthie Pooler's here
and I'll be in with my grandmother.

355
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,621
- Exam 3?
- Sure.

356
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,560
Any word from Social Services?

357
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,393
I think Dr. Lockhart called them,
but no one has been down yet.

358
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,831
It's just I haven't been
getting any sleep lately.

359
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,564
And the thing is that I've been
really, really needing some.

360
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,503
It's been kind of
rocky since Jodie.

361
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:07,841
- Is she okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, she's great.

362
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,581
It's just...

363
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,878
I was wondering. Can you write
me a scrip for some Ambien?

364
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,023
- Is herbal tea not working?
- Ha-ha.

365
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,317
- Very funny.
- Did you ask your doctor?

366
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,359
Docs don't have
docs. You know that.

367
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:29,362
Abby, thank you. Thank you, I
really appreciate it, I really do.

368
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,265
Sure.

369
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,167
- What? You give me two? Just two?
- Tonight, tomorrow night.

370
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,038
And I'm sure by the next day, you'll
have your own primary-care physician.

371
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,078
Ruthie Pooler's back. She's
looking for you, she's in the room.

372
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,238
- Thanks, Jerry.
- Come on, you're killing me.

373
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,580
Have you tried those nature CDs?
Birds chirping? Waves crashing?

374
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,296
I wasn't running away.

375
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,502
I didn't think you were.

376
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:08,232
I didn't think you would
leave your grandmother.

377
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,637
Or your dog.

378
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,642
Ruthie...

379
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:20,652
Believe me, I know this
is not gonna be easy.

380
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,720
Keys to my grandmother's car.

381
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,620
El passes. Three months' worth.

382
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,034
<i>Italian Cooking Made Simple.</i>

383
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,433
<i>Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meals.</i>

384
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,799
<i>Better Food for Dogs.</i>

385
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,035
This one's for Bob.

386
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,943
This one's for us.

387
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,755
I can do this, Dr. Lockhart.

388
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,256
We can do this.

389
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,804
For this to happen, Social
Services has to follow up with you.

390
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,462
Probably once a week.

391
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,940
You're gonna need home health-care
workers, probably every day.

392
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,170
You said it wasn't
going to be easy.

393
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,846
ER.

394
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,725
Don't you ever pull
that crap on me again!

395
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,027
Excuse me. Excuse me.

396
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:47,333
- But the last time I looked, I was right.
- You were lucky.

397
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:51,136
A hypertensive patient with a low crit
and a positive ultrasound needs surgery.

398
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,644
It was vasovagal, it was chronic anemia
and it was ascites. I saved your ass.

399
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,076
She could've bled to death.

400
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,514
You would've sliced her open
on the table for no good reason.

401
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,355
Hey, Jerry.

402
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,428
- Olivia, how you doing?
- Where are we?

403
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,361
- Pick your poison. Trauma 1 or 2.
- Thanks.

404
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,697
Dr. Pratt dropped this for you
before he took off for the airport.

405
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:31,241
They're lovely. Too
bad they're not mine.

406
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,779
<i>Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

407
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,421
<i>This is the captain speaking...</i>

408
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,217
<i>- and welcome to Flight 1 1 17.</i>
- Thank you.

409
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,893
- Here you go, sir, vodka tonic.
- Thank you very much.

410
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,723
You're welcome.

411
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,768
How you doing?

412
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,898
I'm Greg Pratt.

413
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,107
Vatima Abika.

414
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:00,978
Nice name.

415
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,473
So if you don't mind me asking,
what's taking you to Khartoum?

416
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,548
I live there.

417
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,450
I work for the government,
Ministry of Education.

418
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,049
Wow.

419
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,388
I'm a doctor. An emergency
physician, actually.

420
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:20,932
And I'm on my way to Darfur, to do
some work at one of the refugee camps.

421
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,832
You mean IDP camp.

422
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:30,641
They're not refugees, they're
IDPs. Internally Displaced Persons.

423
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,779
- Right, right.
- Why?

424
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,773
- Why, what?
- Why are you going?

425
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,222
Um, I don't know.

426
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,615
Something new, I guess.
You know, something different.

427
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,489
And you've read up on Darfur?

428
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,761
Oh, yeah.

429
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,130
It's a lot.

430
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,962
Yeah, well...

431
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,935
I work in Chicago, at County ER.

432
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:04,634
And I've treated hundreds of
gunshot wounds, knife wounds...

433
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,370
- domestic violence.
- Ahem.

434
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:08,946
I think I know my way around.

435
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,917
AIDS, malaria, dysentery.

436
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,042
Two million people homeless.

437
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:18,247
Not to mention the nearly
400,000 already slaughtered.

438
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:22,725
Boys, babies,
tossed onto bonfires.

439
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,262
Women and young girls
raped, sometimes by men...

440
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,923
sometimes by bayonet.

441
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,071
The work of gangs, all
things you have seen.

442
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,399
But in Darfur...

443
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,301
it's political and
on a massive scale.

444
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,975
<i>And while this insanity
rages on and on and on...</i>

445
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,981
<i>the rest of the world
continues its debate:</i>

446
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,587
<i>Is it or is it not genocide?</i>

447
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:52,816
<i>This is not debate,
this is paralysis.</i>

448
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:58,931
<i>Can you treat that, Dr. Pratt?
Can you cure paralysis?</i>

449
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,937
I don't speak
Arabic, only English.

450
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,679
Work? Where are you working?

451
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,079
Yeah, I'm going to
work in a refugee...

452
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:23,746
An IDP camp.
Dumtala. I'm a doctor.

453
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,405
Is there a problem?

454
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,216
Ibrahim, you're gonna
run the battery down.

455
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,289
Come on, we need you.

456
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,817
I was wondering if you
could help us, Mr...?

457
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,489
- Mudawi.
- Mr. Mudawi, we're here to pick up...

458
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,318
that gentleman right over there.

459
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:36,690
It would be a lot easier if they had
someone who could speak English.

460
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,592
Yeah, the whole language
thing, very inconvenient.

461
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,859
Giving me the third
degree over a paperback.

462
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,800
They wanted to confiscate it like it
was the Nazi master plan or something.

463
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,338
Guess they don't put
much money into road work.

464
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,178
I'm just gonna assume
you're being facetious.

465
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,148
Doesn't look like they put
much money into anything.

466
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,308
Money is not the real
currency around here.

467
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,149
Life is mostly about a little
bit of food, little bit of firewood.

468
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:07,554
Safety is the scarcest
resource of all.

469
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,321
Mm. Well, it's hot as hell.

470
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,896
You got any cold sodas
or waters in this cooler?

471
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,159
Oxytocin, measles, Hep
B and tetanus vaccines.

472
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,386
I can't believe it. We're in middle of
nowhere and he's got Sonny and Cher?

473
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:46,862
Ibrahim speaks English, Pratt.

474
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,564
Hey, sorry about that,
man. How you doing?

475
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,781
Whoa, what the hell is that?

476
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,909
Keep driving, but slowly.
Maybe they won't stop us.

477
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,721
- Who are these guys?
- Janjaweed.

478
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,112
Don't do anything,
don't say anything.

479
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,525
- Aah!
- No, no, no.

480
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,130
It's okay.

481
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,173
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- He won't hurt me.

482
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,605
I'm not leaving.

483
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,880
He's not Sudanese. He's an ex-pat
doctor, only here to help. He has no gun.

484
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,490
We have no guns. We're
on our way to Dumtala Camp.

485
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,391
Pratt, tell him. Pratt, tell
him who you are in English.

486
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,995
Tell him!

487
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,327
I'm a doctor. We're all doctors.

488
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,630
We're on our way to the Dumtala
Camp to help the sick people.

489
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:37,105
We're not armed, we have no
guns. We're only here to help.

490
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:07,671
Okay, Ibrahim, let
me take a look, man.

491
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,633
- Ouch!
- Okay, okay, okay.

492
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,801
Yep, it might be broken.

493
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:17,848
No septal hematoma, so you'll be
okay. Just pinch it, keep the pressure on.

494
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:25,385
- Radio's no good.
- Yeah, what a surprise.

495
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,398
What are you looking
for, a phone booth?

496
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,367
Who feels like walking?

497
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,709
Mouthwash? You've
gotta be kidding me.

498
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,743
You're a weird dude, Pratt.

499
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,212
Ow.

500
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,385
Ah! Unh.

501
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,080
Do you need some help?

502
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:51,222
What? No, take it easy. Relax,
I'm a doctor. Take it easy, relax.

503
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,993
Sorry, sorry.

504
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:59,092
I'm a doctor. Do you speak
English? Do you need some help?

505
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,501
Actually, I think it is you
that needs some help.

506
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,933
I'm Stephen Dakarai,
medical director here.

507
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,338
Hi.

508
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,113
- Nice to meet you, I'm Greg Pratt.
- I know.

509
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,449
I was trying to see if
I could do anything.

510
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,848
The girl was raped.

511
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,615
It is custom that only women
take care of those patients.

512
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,124
But don't worry, Zahra is an
excellent nurse. She will handle it.

513
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,488
- Yeah.
- Come.

514
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,927
So you just got here.

515
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:32,036
- And not easily, I heard.
- Yeah, well, that's one way of putting it.

516
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:37,139
The Janjaweed, generally, they do
not hurt the doctors or the NGO workers.

517
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,278
One never knows
what might happen.

518
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,871
Are you okay?

519
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,448
I caught myself a stomach virus.

520
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,981
You must be careful what you eat here.
- Here you go.

521
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,487
This is the best we could come up
with. We don't have a supply sergeant.

522
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,525
- Thank you.
- We'll take up a collection for you later.

523
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:58,725
Dr. Carter.

524
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,696
A young girl's outside. Wants
us to check on her grandmother.

525
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,129
What's the problem?

526
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,566
She's got vomiting and
diarrhea. Too weak to walk.

527
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,399
Hey, Greg? You wanna
take the 10-cent tour?

528
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,006
Yeah, sure. I'll be right out.

529
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:14,305
I'd offer to come too, but these IV
poles, they don't run so well in the sand.

530
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,471
- Hey.
- Hey.

531
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,675
- Hey, Pratt. How are your feet?
- Still working.

532
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,013
- See you later.
- All right.

533
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,814
- Debbie and Dakarai, huh?
- Yeah, they're an item.

534
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,389
Tell me the news. What's
the news from County?

535
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:38,734
Uh, well, Susan Lewis left,
took a job over in Iowa City.

536
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,702
Yeah, I talked to her. She
thinks she got kind of screwed.

537
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,365
She did. Now we've got
this guy named Clemente.

538
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,376
He's the new Attending.
Frank calls him Dr. Schizo.

539
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:52,807
He's really not a bad guy. He's
just, I don't know, a little nutty.

540
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,544
And the R-2s?

541
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,220
Well, we're still keeping our fingers
crossed that they don't kill anybody.

542
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,880
Even Abby?

543
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,391
Abby's always ahead of the rest.

544
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,328
You know, her and Kovac
are back together again.

545
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,867
Really?

546
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,194
Yeah, man. They're
about to have a baby.

547
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,906
Wow, that's news.

548
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,870
It's great news. I'm happy for them.
I'm gonna have to send them something.

549
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,482
From here? Well,
good luck with that.

550
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,847
Harun, stay with her.

551
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,657
Ishaak, what happened?

552
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,458
He rode too close to the village by
himself. They took him off his horse.

553
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,569
Janjaweed. He is Janjaweed.

554
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,930
They're beating the hell out of the guy.
- Stay back.

555
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,303
No, Pratt. Let Ishaak handle it.

556
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,419
Is that vodka or gin?

557
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,657
Something like that.

558
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,318
With a little green
food coloring?

559
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,657
It's a good trick.

560
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,632
Yeah, well, I'm a guy who
really knows his way around.

561
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,465
Welcome to Darfur.
