1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,865
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,033
Oh, man.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,450
I've been here for a long time.

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:15,014
I know the people, I know the department.
I just wanna put my name into the mixture.

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,227
Want me to take this,
Kerry? I don't mind.

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,380
What? Think I'm rusty?

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,052
You've been the one
person I can count on.

8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,555
That means a lot to
me, that friendship.

9
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,287
What you're saying is that
we'll just stay friends, then.

10
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,983
- I told you. I have a boyfriend.
- Oh.

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,624
So, what is he? A lawyer?
A commodities trader?

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,598
- A dentist?
- He's a doctor.

13
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,397
- County?
- In the Army.

14
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,335
When is he coming home?

15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,653
That's the wankiest idea I've
heard. You must be shell-shocked.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,413
Well, what are you... Wankiest?

17
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,923
Foolish, ridiculous,
possibly even stupid.

18
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,820
I think that's the best idea I've ever
had. I don't know what the problem is.

19
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,125
Okay, sweet, yes.
Best? I don't think so.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,166
It's 10 after 7. I
have to go to work.

21
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,134
Just give me one good
reason why we shouldn't.

22
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,968
God, it's a hundred degrees
in here, and I'm about to die.

23
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,973
You're trying to
change the subject.

24
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,167
I can't breathe.

25
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,812
Listen, you can
be honest with me.

26
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,847
No, I am being honest,
I can't breathe. Michael.

27
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,985
I'm not budging till you give me
a good reason why we shouldn't.

28
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:28,054
- Because you've gone completely mad.
- Come on, no muss, no fuss?

29
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,848
No family...

30
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,117
Yeah, okay, they might
be a little surprised.

31
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,784
You think? "Hi, Mom, hi,
Dad, guess what I did today?"

32
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:38,399
- They'd get over it.
- No, actually, I don't think mine would.

33
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,766
Well, they'll have to,
because I love you.

34
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,296
Michael.

35
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,802
It's a great story for our
grandchildren. They'll think we're crazy.

36
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,373
- We would be crazy.
- Do you love me?

37
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,873
Yes, I do.

38
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,978
See, you already said, I do.
That settles it, that settles it.

39
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,877
- We're getting hitched today.
- Wait, wait, not so fast.

40
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,080
Will I have a bouquet?

41
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,351
Michael.

42
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,155
Michael.

43
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,941
Glenda Bardelarinski, 53.

44
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,480
Little head lac, CT negative.

45
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,283
Just move her to an exam
room, let her sleep it off.

46
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,891
And then, <i>a la casa.</i>

47
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,755
Okay, let me know
when she's set up.

48
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,953
Sure. Right this way, Glenda.

49
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,222
What's with the stop sign?

50
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,162
She's a school crossing guard.
Doesn't that make you sick?

51
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,563
The idea that woman is
getting drunk on the job.

52
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:27,902
Small, innocent, helpless, possibly
even frail children in her charge...

53
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,976
What's happening in there?

54
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,311
Hey, Frank.

55
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,816
I think they're
talking about you.

56
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,317
- What?
- Weaver kicking their butts is my guess.

57
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,685
She's gonna kick their butts if
they don't stop yapping at each other.

58
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,418
- Isn't one gonna be the new ER chief?
- My money ain't on the nosebleed.

59
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,462
- The nosebleed?
- You miss almost everything, don't you?

60
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,496
Whoa, where do you
think you're going?

61
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,794
Guy in Curtain 1
wants some doughnuts.

62
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,995
- Give me that. What are you thinking?
- He was gonna give me a tip.

63
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,106
Urine sample,
Exam 3, to the lab.

64
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,971
I need you to run up to the surgical
floor, pick up the level 1 rapid infuser.

65
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:08,104
Surgical floor? That's good.

66
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,445
All right, let's clear some of
these patients. I will be on today...

67
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,486
but first, run your cases by
either Drs. Kovac or Clemente.

68
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,020
You're on today?

69
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,488
Good, I mean, that's
good. You just...

70
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,151
You're always stuck in administration.
Good to keep your skills honed.

71
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,892
Dr. Kovac and Dr. Clemente will share
the honor of running the board today.

72
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,696
- Share?
- Abby, head lac's ready for you.

73
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,133
Doctors.

74
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,932
- After you.
- No, no, after you, my man.

75
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,667
No, no. Really.
Really, I insist.

76
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,674
Oh, well, I insist too.

77
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,006
- I'm serious...
- I'm serious too.

78
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,173
Dr. Clemente. Board.

79
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,683
Right.

80
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,679
Okay, Glenda, come on,
come on, come on, stop it.

81
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,153
Don't make nobody...

82
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,691
Haleh, your paranoid gardener
needs another slug of Haldol.

83
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,092
- Oh, it's all right. I got this.
Go ahead. HALEH: I'll be back.

84
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,791
Okay, Glenda. Here
we go, a little stick, okay?

85
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,937
- Aah!
- Crap.

86
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,663
Ortho's here for a tib-fib.

87
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,172
Oh, crap.

88
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,401
- Crap, crap, crap...
- Nice.

89
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,102
Yeah, Morris signed her out
as a garden-variety drunk...

90
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,772
but her IV's bleeding like stink.
Her lac's oozing around the sutures.

91
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,612
You know, alcoholics are
often a little coagulopathic.

92
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,311
How was your little sit-down
with Weaver this morning?

93
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,287
She was telling me and
Dr. Clemente how charming we are.

94
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,756
- Oh, really?
- You don't think I'm charming?

95
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,367
I think you're extremely
charming. I just also think you're...

96
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,192
- Aah!
- Whoa.

97
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,495
Oh, crap. Spilled my coffee.

98
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:39,503
She was telling us that we have
to get along better, you know...

99
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,073
leave better impression...

100
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:46,145
- to Residents and be more agreeable.
- Oh.

101
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,573
- That's a lot to ask.
- You don't think I am?

102
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,809
- I think you're agreeable.
- Well, you still think I'm full of...

103
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,248
Oh!

104
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,357
Active duty servicemen can
get married the same day. Bingo.

105
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,804
Watch where you're headed.

106
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,986
I mean, I realize it's all sex
now, but 20 years down the road...

107
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,290
she's dragging you off
to the Moose Lodge...

108
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,797
for folk dancing and bingo.

109
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,801
You know, I'm damn
envious of you, Gallant.

110
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,533
Finding your soul mate, someone to
share your hopes and calm your fears.

111
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,972
- Uh-huh.
- Hold your hand in the dark night, and...

112
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,874
Good one. Keep saying it to
yourself, you might believe it.

113
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:24,313
Dr. Gallant, I'd like to offer my
services in officiating at your nuptials.

114
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,510
- What? JERRY: I'm a
Universal Life minister.

115
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,884
- I can marry you and Neela.
- Jer, they're looking for something legal.

116
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,582
It's completely legal.
I've married lots of people.

117
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,588
So, what are you?
Like, Reverend Jerry?

118
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,027
Actually, I go by
Father Superior.

119
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,362
So the rumors are true?

120
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:47,906
Yes. I'd like you to be my bridesmaid.
Maid of honor, whatever they call it.

121
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,737
Well, normally I'd say no
because of the taffeta dress...

122
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,641
and matching peau
de soie shoes...

123
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,492
but this time, it's because you've
had a complete brain lapse...

124
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,849
Michael and I love each other.

125
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,111
- We wanna be together.
- But today?

126
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:03,121
We thought it'd be kind of crazy,
something good we can tell our...

127
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,522
Anyway, his tour's over.

128
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,854
What if he gets stationed
in, like, Romania?

129
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,862
He's hoping to finish his
training in stateside Army hospital.

130
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,058
I'm not saying he's not a great
guy. He is, but do you know him?

131
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,793
Of course, I do. He's
incredibly kind, generous...

132
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,565
My dry-cleaning guy is kind and
generous. Where's the prednisone?

133
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,867
Left bottom shelf.

134
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,068
I know him. I do.

135
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,406
Does he fold the newspaper
inside out when he reads it...

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,913
and then forget to put it
back when he is done?

137
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,813
Does he clip his
toenails in bed?

138
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,216
- Does he drip when the toilet seat's down?
- Abby.

139
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,123
Like jam on his grilled
cheese sandwiches?

140
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,507
I can learn during the marriage.

141
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,185
- Yes, but I don't think that's...
- I love Michael...

142
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,955
and I could use a
little support here.

143
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,167
I am very happy
for you, I really am.

144
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,567
And, of course, I'll stand
up for you. I wouldn't miss it.

145
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,730
- Great.
- Okay.

146
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,942
Dr. Pratt, you got a moment?

147
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,741
- Sure.
- Walk with me?

148
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,247
All right.

149
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,784
This young man, K.J. Thibeaux? You've
been sponsoring him as a Volunteen.

150
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:07,977
Yeah.

151
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,454
He got in the surgical floor
storeroom, stole a digital video camera.

152
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,719
- What? Get out of here.
- I don't wanna make a big issue...

153
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:19,025
as long as he's willing to admit it,
give it back, it doesn't go any further.

154
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,634
- Who told you it was K.J.?
- The chief of security.

155
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,168
- One of his guards reported it.
- He's sure about this?

156
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,104
Surveillance cameras.
Everything's on tape. I'm sorry.

157
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,968
- All right, I'll talk to him.
- He's just a teenager...

158
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,704
I'll talk to him.

159
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,549
Jack Gitts, 38, high-speed
MVC, no medical history.

160
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,778
So, I've been checking: we can
get the license, but they close...

161
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,582
- Can't talk right now.
- Just quickly.

162
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,625
Got a lead on three places. The florist in
the hospital would love to do a wedding.

163
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,386
I have a patient here. Vitals?

164
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,401
Tachy, 130, shallow
resps, BP, 80, palp.

165
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,725
- Oh, and Jerry is gonna marry us.
- What?

166
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,925
I'll come back when
you're not busy.

167
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,769
Page Dubenko and call
for O-neg. Did he say, Jerry?

168
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,930
- I thought you knew.
- One, two, three.

169
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,770
Cantaloupe allergy is waiting
for the Benadryl to kick in.

170
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,971
Infected nose piercing is home on Keflex.
She did it herself with a thumbtack.

171
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,810
That's sexy. Is she single?

172
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,078
And platelets are back
on my drunk head lac.

173
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:16,519
- A little low, 98, and INR is 1.4.
- Yeah, borderline.

174
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,045
Still, I'd like to give
platelets and FFP.

175
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,069
Yeah, go ahead.

176
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,688
Even a tiny bleed can
become serious if she can't clot.

177
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,695
It's possibly a good
idea, Dr. Kovac...

178
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,199
but you do realize that blood
products carry the risk of infection...

179
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,496
and transfusion
reaction, don't you?

180
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,163
- Yeah.
- Yeah, was the CT negative?

181
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,002
There's no bleed
that we could see.

182
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:40,173
Do you wanna expose your patient to
those risks because her platelets are low?

183
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,838
Scan was four hours ago.
She might have a delayed bleed.

184
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,850
I'd worry more if she had
mental status changes...

185
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,783
or a focal neuro exam.

186
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,857
- He's got a point.
- She's drunk so that's hard to assess.

187
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,789
Drunk people get sober.

188
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,525
And careful observation
is still better than any lab.

189
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,462
That's right. I'd have to agree.

190
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,334
What just happened?

191
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,234
They've been pulling
that on me all morning.

192
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,843
I don't know, some sort of
competitive agreeing contest?

193
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,512
- I wouldn't steal any stupid camera.
- Did you hear what I said?

194
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,809
- They got you on tape.
- Couldn't have been me.

195
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,818
- You were up there long enough.
- They had to look for that infuser thing.

196
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,115
Don't give me that crap, K.J.

197
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,289
Okay. There's this girl,
one of the volunteers...

198
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,986
- she's fine as hell...
- I went out on a limb for you.

199
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,689
I thought having you here
was gonna teach you something.

200
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,802
- Then you go and do this.
- I didn't do anything.

201
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,729
You know what? Your
father's on his way here.

202
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,703
So for now, go sit
in the waiting room.

203
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,470
- But, Dr. Pratt...
- Waiting room.

204
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,909
- Bag him.
- Got a second line?

205
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,162
- Vein keeps blowing.
- Run first unit of O-neg.

206
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,082
Hold four more
units ready to go.

207
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,188
So where's the
reception gonna be?

208
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,584
He needs central access.

209
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,054
They haven't decided yet.

210
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,590
I'd go to Baby Joon's.

211
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,853
La Chiquita Roja
is more romantic.

212
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,894
Neela, place a subclavian.

213
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,929
Cordis and sterile sixes.

214
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,832
What was the other place?

215
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,642
The Mandarin Club. - No way.

216
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,968
- That's a bad idea.
- Turn his head to the left.

217
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,769
- Systolic's 84. I like The Mandarin.
- Got a flash.

218
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:20,471
Should definitely do Chiquita Roja.
Candles, white table cloths, you know.

219
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:25,210
No, Baby Joon's. I'm telling
you, martinis and chili fries.

220
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,944
X-rays are up.

221
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,954
- C-spine clear, mediastinum looks okay.
- Very good.

222
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,989
- So where are you registered?
- What?

223
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,491
- Definitely have to.
- Could someone get SonoSite?

224
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,130
My ex-wife didn't, we
ended up with clocks.

225
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,528
With my sister, salad
bowls. Seven of them.

226
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,363
Does anybody mind if we
just focus on the patient?

227
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,497
Okay, then.

228
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,907
Can we have that
SonoSite, please?

229
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,119
Neela. Can you get away?

230
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,966
- We need to go get a license.
- We don't know where to get married.

231
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,049
- We do. Hospital chapel.
- When did we decide that?

232
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,706
- You were busy, I thought you...
- And Jerry's gonna marry us?

233
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,957
Yeah, he has some kind
of minister's license, so I...

234
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,261
Is that really who we want? What's
Frank gonna be, the ring bearer?

235
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,166
We don't have a lot of time.
I had to make some choices.

236
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,172
- Are you gonna choose the flowers too?
- No, no.

237
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,969
But you like lilies, right?

238
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,135
- Michael, we have to talk.
- About what?

239
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,645
I think this is getting a little...
- Dr. Gallant.

240
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,341
The groom isn't supposed to
see the bride on the wedding day.

241
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,645
Well, we have a few
details to work out.

242
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,364
Nothing that can't wait, I hope.

243
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,914
- Dr. Rasgotra's scrubbing in on this.
- I am?

244
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,492
Yeah. You did that
open lap in the street.

245
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,721
I think I can trust you in
a sterile operating room.

246
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,558
You're not getting
cold feet, are you?

247
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,964
We'll talk later.

248
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,907
Are his vaccinations up-to-date?

249
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,909
His pediatrician and I
don't believe in them.

250
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,014
Immunizations are probably
one of the most successful...

251
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,548
public health interventions
ever developed.

252
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,050
Thank you, but it's
a personal decision.

253
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,748
Did you know the air has
21 percent oxygen in it?

254
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,085
He's studying the
atmosphere in school.

255
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,559
Well, that's very cool.

256
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,388
He's sitting at 94, which is
low, but nothing dangerous.

257
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,365
It probably has to do with
the fluid I heard in his lungs.

258
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,028
I'd like to get a chest
x-ray, which is nothing scary.

259
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,437
It's just a special kind of
photograph and it doesn't hurt at all.

260
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,511
My uncle Deaver had one of those
and we got to see all his bones.

261
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,547
- Mm-hm.
- I don't want x-rays, if possible.

262
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,514
Mrs. Kenig, I'm pretty
sure Stewy has pneumonia.

263
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,480
Well, can't you just treat it then,
and we can avoid the radiation?

264
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,683
Well, it's a small amount. It just helps
us have a look at what we're dealing with.

265
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,920
- Glenda's waking up.
- Thank you.

266
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,429
Wouldn't you go with
antibiotics anyway?

267
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,498
Okay. He needs extra oxygen,
he's gonna have to spend the night.

268
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,230
Okay, that will be fine.

269
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,207
Then, we'll hold off on the film
for now, but if he gets any worse...

270
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,369
He gets x-rayed.

271
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,949
He says he didn't do it.

272
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,552
D, I don't like this any
better than you do, man.

273
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,744
He wouldn't lie.

274
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,412
Come on, man.

275
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,581
Did he lie about the tagging?

276
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,659
Or the weed they
found in his pocket?

277
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:25,622
Look, K.J.'s a good kid, but right
now, his judgment basically sucks.

278
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,562
I wanna talk to this Doctor...

279
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,194
- Dubenko.
- Yeah, the security guard too.

280
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,868
D, they don't wanna
press charges, man.

281
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,305
But they're accusing my
kid, I just wanna talk to them.

282
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,075
Banana bag is finished
and she took a few ice chips.

283
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,609
Who are you?

284
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,218
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

285
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,150
You're at County General.

286
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,290
Let's see if you can sit
up on your own, okay?

287
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,660
She should be
sobering up by now.

288
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:58,593
Glenda, can you squeeze my hand?

289
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,463
Let's see. Try and squeeze
my hand. Squeeze my hand.

290
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,967
Come on.

291
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,263
Okay. Can you open your eyes?

292
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,111
Glenda, come on.

293
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,075
Good. Okay.

294
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,774
Over here, right over here.
And do you know who I am?

295
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,918
Who are you?

296
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,415
Must have cleared 30 patients
and no one's brawling yet.

297
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,023
See? It's not that hard, is it?

298
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,592
Like the man said: "Can't
we just all get along?"

299
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,161
Sam, weren't we sending
the cracked Broviac up to IR?

300
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,525
- Don't you want a CBC first?
- Yes, you're right.

301
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,692
- Sam, the labs done on Mrs. Garvey?
- Just checked, be another half hour.

302
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,340
Dr. Weaver, the search committee
meeting has been moved up to 12:30.

303
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,872
All right, Jerry. Thank you.

304
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,340
- Dr. Kovac.
- Dr. Lockhart.

305
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,376
There's something
not right about Glenda.

306
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,506
Hey, that sounds like a movie, like,
<i>Something Not Right About Glenda.</i>

307
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,450
A body snatchers thing, shaky camera.
- Morris.

308
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,683
I wanna re-scan her.

309
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,290
Really? Why?

310
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,738
Because she's altered.

311
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:03,990
- But she's a drunk, how can you tell?
- Dr. Clemente, why don't you...?

312
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,828
Why don't we let
Dr. Lockhart present the case?

313
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,468
- Absolutely.
- She's disoriented.

314
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,195
She's repeating questions.
I just wanna get another CT.

315
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,862
- How long here?
- About six hours.

316
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,135
Luka, your malrotation
in Exam 4 is puking blood.

317
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,245
- I'll check back.
- Yeah, well...

318
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,674
Is she responding to commands?

319
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,449
Yes. Hand squeeze
and eye opening.

320
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,018
Rule of thumb, if a
patient's exam is non-focal...

321
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,587
and responding to commands,
just observe and wait.

322
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,520
- Dr. Clemente, Ortho on line
2. CLEMENTE: Yeah. Okay?

323
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,893
Yeah, I'm gonna re-scan her.

324
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,897
Call CT, let them
know we're on the way.

325
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,060
Have the blood bank send a unit
of FFP and six pack of platelets.

326
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,797
- You sure about that?
- Yes, I am.

327
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,572
What's this, your
bachelor party?

328
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,104
There's not gonna
be one of those.

329
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,739
Well, you didn't give me much time
to plan it, having your wedding today.

330
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,686
I don't think there's gonna
be one of those either.

331
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,788
What? So I don't get
to be your best man?

332
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,424
I mean, you were
gonna ask me, right?

333
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,629
I don't know, man. I...

334
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,235
You know, maybe
this was just all too fast.

335
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,364
You know, man, I
think she's scared.

336
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,770
Well, it is kind of a strong
move to the hoop, man.

337
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,570
Yeah, but I was
gonna ask her before.

338
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,603
But I...

339
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,111
You know, over in Iraq, guys got
married the week they shipped out.

340
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,755
I know, because
I worked on them.

341
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,618
Arms missing, legs gone.

342
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,785
Faces half blown off.

343
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:48,098
But they were in the most pain about
pain they're gonna cause somebody else.

344
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,600
So I told myself, if I ever
made it through this...

345
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,261
And you did.

346
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,900
- So you asked her now.
- Yeah.

347
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,980
Well, I...

348
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,440
I mean, kind of, I...

349
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,580
Kind of?

350
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,690
Is this French rap?

351
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,759
Supa Crew.

352
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,264
- Do you understand what they're saying?
- I can't understand any of them.

353
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,561
- You want contrast with this?
- No.

354
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,138
Oh, ugly.

355
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,112
Glenda?

356
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,349
Glenda?

357
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,008
- Hey, stop the scan.
- Few more cuts and we're done.

358
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,314
Stop the scan. Get the
Code Team up here now.

359
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,612
Excuse me. CLEMENTE: Move.

360
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,855
Come in. Hyperventilate her.
- What's going on?

361
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,827
- You can see.
- Equal breath sounds.

362
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,193
- Abby?
- I got this.

363
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,301
- Sats not picking up.
- Fifty of mannitol.

364
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,199
- So, what happened?
- Meet Glenda, my altered drunk head lac.

365
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,205
While you were jerking off,
she was bleeding in her head.

366
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,707
- BP's 170 over 110.
- What did you tell her to do?

367
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,742
Same thing you would
have, observation...

368
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,710
but she was responding
to commands at the time.

369
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,713
- Go order the platelets.
- I already did.

370
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,648
If I'd waited for you to sign
off on this, she'd be dead.

371
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,256
- Neurosurgeon is ready for her.
- Can we agree she needs to go to O.R.?

372
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,016
Good.

373
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,734
Throwing PVCs. NEELA:
Can't see well enough to find it.

374
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,065
Get control blindly, Neela.

375
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,401
Here, give me your hands.

376
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,405
What do you feel?

377
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,572
The liver, the edge is smooth.

378
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,578
BP's dropping, 66 over 35.

379
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,583
Focus.

380
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,887
There's a defect.
There's a tear in the SMA.

381
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,049
Over 1900 cc blood loss.
Losing the battle here, guys.

382
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,024
Direct pressure,
Neela, control it.

383
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,528
That's it, hold steady pressure.

384
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,428
Suction.

385
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,598
Hold it.

386
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,295
Statinsky.

387
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,909
Clamp the bleeder.

388
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,913
And we have liftoff.
Systolic's coming back.

389
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,453
Great job, Dr. Rasgotra.

390
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,216
We just have to run the
bowel before we close him up.

391
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,155
<i>Irrigate with 2 liters.</i>

392
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,385
Neela.

393
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,790
Welcome, Dr. Gallant.

394
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,954
Your bride-to-be here
just saved this guy's life.

395
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:35,260
- Michael, what are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

396
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,733
Suction. NEELA: Well,
now is not a good time.

397
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,037
I just wanted to tell you that...
- Michael, please...

398
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,836
Tell her what,
Dr. Gallant? Go ahead.

399
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,770
You know, when I was away...

400
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,251
thinking about you gave
me some other place to be.

401
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,082
Someplace peaceful,
where I could belong.

402
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,750
Now, maybe all of this has been
too fast and I know that's scary...

403
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,556
and maybe I didn't
ask you the right way.

404
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,825
But I just want
us to be together.

405
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,671
So I'm asking you now, Neela.

406
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,364
Will you marry me?

407
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,239
Will you marry me today?

408
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,215
Harry Royman, 70, fell through
ice playing hockey on a pond.

409
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,615
- Doing what?
- I know, it sounds stupid.

410
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,915
Not only does it sound stupid...
- Dr. Morris.

411
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,718
Perhaps, you'd like to let
us hear the rest of the case.

412
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,758
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

413
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,158
Altered and hypothermic,
temp's too low to register.

414
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,231
- He's not shivering.
- Heart rate's 74, BP 100 over 47.

415
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,231
- When is the ceremony?
- Not sure yet.

416
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,630
- Okay, let us know.
- Yeah.

417
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,897
Hey, Frank, where's Jerry?

418
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,336
Left early to get into
his ministerial mode.

419
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,500
This better be happening. We got
a temp coming to cover the desk.

420
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,941
It is, Frank. I'm off.
Cleared it with Dr. Weaver.

421
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,105
- Okay.
- So we need to go get a license?

422
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,773
- And rings.
- And rings?

423
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,283
We'll call with the details.
You are coming, right?

424
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,921
Yeah, went home at
lunch, got my best suit.

425
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,522
Wish us luck.

426
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,988
You're gonna need
more than that.

427
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,752
What do I know?

428
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,489
Repeat rectal temp, portable
chest, EKG, CBC, chemistry, coags.

429
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,459
Crackles, might
have aspirated water.

430
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,262
- Sats only 88.
- He needs an airway.

431
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,302
- I got it.
- Dr. Barnett.

432
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,600
Uh, yes, 8020
etomidate, hundred sux.

433
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,680
I hope it's okay, I made the
paramedics bring me with them.

434
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,875
- It's fine, Mister...
- Spevacek.

435
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,281
There's a pond where we grew up
and a few of us dug up our old skates...

436
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,981
knocked the puck around,
you know, for old times.

437
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:42,458
Bolus a liter of warm saline
and call Respiratory for a vent.

438
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,960
Rectal temp, 86.

439
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,563
- Suction.
- Osborne waves.

440
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,029
He's at risk for an arrhythmia.

441
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,294
All right, now. Tube.

442
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,496
Prep for bilateral chest
tubes for pleural irrigation.

443
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:58,076
Um, with all due respect,
Dr. Weaver, peritoneal dialysis is better.

444
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,979
Greater capacity for heat exchange,
warms the solid organs faster.

445
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,414
It's an interesting approach.

446
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,649
That's what the Navy
SEALs do. Really.

447
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,415
Proceed, Dr. Morris.

448
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:15,424
Okay. Okay, Betadine
and a DPL tray.

449
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,358
So you never actually saw him?

450
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,592
Told you, I see him all the time.
He's always up here sniffing around.

451
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,703
Sniffing around? He's not a dog.

452
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,931
He likes this girl that volunteers.
You know what I mean.

453
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,603
Sorry, they've been at
this for a couple of days.

454
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,938
How many people have
keys to the storeroom?

455
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:37,345
- That info isn't for general release.
- Then let us see the tape.

456
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,815
- Gotta get the chief's approval.
- So call him.

457
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,214
He'll be back in an hour.

458
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:45,188
So we got no chief, no tape
and he didn't even see K.J.

459
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,690
I don't check every room
every minute of the day.

460
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,522
- Maybe you should.
- Darnell.

461
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,425
He would have
seen it wasn't my son.

462
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,499
Okay, okay, we'll talk to
the chief. We'll get the tape.

463
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,694
It takes time to rewind,
run the tape forward...

464
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,265
Holds 24 hours, not
like you can just punch in.

465
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,499
I got time. You going somewhere?

466
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,543
We'll be here.

467
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,373
Come on, man.

468
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,908
- Core temp's 88.3.
- Up a couple of degrees.

469
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,712
Hang another
liter of warm saline.

470
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,048
Gotta tip him on his
right side. Got the head.

471
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,883
- Can I help? SAM:
We got it. Thank you.

472
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,548
Here we go. One, two, three.

473
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,160
- Okay.
- Just a few PVCs.

474
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:25,058
- Why are you doing this?
- Drains fluid through the abdomen.

475
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,563
- How long does that take?
- Thirty to 60 minutes.

476
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,498
- Human meat takes time to thaw.
- Dr. Morris.

477
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,900
You sure we can't get
you a seat, Mr. Spevacek?

478
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,064
Harry lived across the street.

479
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,937
Must have been 15 kids
up and down our block.

480
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,703
We played hockey all winter.

481
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,474
I fell in the ice once.

482
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,343
Harry pulled me out.

483
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,645
Then today...

484
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,424
Harry fell in.

485
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,922
I tried to help him.

486
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,530
But I couldn't.

487
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,099
Just, you know, a little
out of practice, I guess.

488
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,497
I'm sure you did
all that you could.

489
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,434
- I hope so.
- He's in V-tach, roll him.

490
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,051
- What's happening?
- No pulse.

491
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,614
- Get the crash cart.
- Starting compressions.

492
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:20,344
When I get upstairs, will I get my
own room or do I have to share?

493
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,782
I'm not sure.

494
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,480
Stop complaining, you
already got to skip school.

495
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,885
Patricia.

496
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,220
I don't see why I
couldn't stay in the gym.

497
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,293
- I'm missing practice.
- Patricia, please.

498
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,580
Do you know how
much longer it'll be?

499
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,794
Well, I can page the
pediatrician on call.

500
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,062
Are you still doing okay?

501
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,140
Clear.

502
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,175
- No change, still V-fib.
- Again. Charge to 360.

503
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,835
Clear.

504
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,504
He's not gonna respond to
shocks until we warm him up.

505
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,413
Resume compressions. Sam,
100 milligrams lidocaine IV.

506
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,921
Excuse me, Dr. Weaver. I think
we should use bretylium instead.

507
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,718
What? They took that out of
the ACLS guideline years ago.

508
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,656
But there was a
study in the '80s.

509
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,222
That's your reference?
Something from the '80s?

510
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,558
Yes, it is. It clearly
showed bretylium...

511
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:10,191
to be the anti-arrhythmic
of choice in hypothermia.

512
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,303
Core temp's up to 89.1.

513
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:23,113
Three hundred and fifty
milligrams of bretylium IV.

514
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,448
Given his immigration from
Vietnam you got to consider...

515
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,719
Right, but if you have hepatitis
C, INH's gonna be a disaster.

516
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,487
Liver function's fine. - Hey!

517
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,256
For the moment maybe... - Hey!

518
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,559
Stewy Kenig, 5-year-old,
with fever and cough.

519
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,895
Nontoxic, with bilateral
crackles on exam.

520
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,470
Sats 92 on room
air, 100 on 5 liters.

521
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,335
Mom's freaked out by
radiation, refused a chest x-ray.

522
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,067
So treating presumptive
pneumonia with amp and azithro.

523
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:55,476
CBC's pending, got 20 per kilo of
NS and is being admitted to Pedes...

524
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,981
since, although stable, I can't send
him home with an 02 requirement.

525
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,211
That's the plan. Do you concur?

526
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:06,088
- I don't know, azithro? Have you tried...
- Do you concur?

527
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,653
Yeah. ABBY: Thanks.

528
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,695
The chief of security met with
him, McCauley kept stalling...

529
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,132
then finally came clean.

530
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,668
There was a theft...

531
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,363
but there were no video
tapes and no suspects.

532
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,874
- No tapes at all?
- No. K.J. did nothing wrong.

533
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,571
Camera's missing and this fat-ass
figures it must have been the black kid.

534
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,548
There was absolutely no excuse for
it, it was an unconscionable thing to do.

535
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:35,119
- Where's McCauley working tomorrow?
- Not here.

536
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:39,325
Listen, Mr. Thibeaux, from
what everybody's been saying...

537
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,086
it sounds like K.J.'s been
doing a great job here.

538
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:45,254
He did not deserve
this and I'm...

539
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,262
Well, I'm very, very sorry.

540
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,231
On behalf of the entire
hospital, I apologize.

541
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,871
Why don't you
go tell that to K.J.?

542
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,370
Yeah.

543
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,946
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Thanks, man.

544
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,176
I guess it always all comes
down to the black check, doesn't it?

545
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,259
No matter how good your
job is, where you live...

546
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,224
- how much money you make...
- In the end, cops pull you over...

547
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,955
for driving through a
white neighborhood.

548
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm done with this place.
I'm not doing this anymore.

549
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:25,837
The hell you ain't. You're coming every
day till you've finished your service.

550
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,439
That's right, I'm gonna
make sure you work harder...

551
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,303
than any other
volunteer in there.

552
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,808
No more going out for
doughnuts, chasing skirts.

553
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:36,676
Man, what for? They always gonna
be on my back no matter how good I do.

554
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,579
Yeah, it's gonna be like
that forever, so get used to it.

555
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,745
Can't think about it. Just
live your life and do your best.

556
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,891
Gotta stay in the game,
K.J. Otherwise, they win.

557
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:53,459
Look, I'm sorry about
all this, man. All right?

558
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,496
Where is everybody?

559
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:00,002
Hi, I'm Maureen, can I help you?

560
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,003
- Who are you?
- I'm the temp.

561
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,207
Are you out of high school?

562
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,972
I'm 21, but I have my mother's
cheekbones and my father's chin.

563
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,742
Everyone always says that
combination makes you look younger, so...

564
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,283
Hey, you're still here?

565
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:17,082
Looking for Ray. Got patients to sign out
unless I wanna wear this to the wedding.

566
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,952
- I can take them.
- Oh, I can do that.

567
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,854
Sorry, Luka beat you to it.

568
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,961
Let me walk you outside.

569
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,460
- And you would be...?
- I'm Maureen, the temp.

570
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,331
Well, hello, Maureen,
the temp. Are you...?

571
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,268
I know what you're
gonna ask me, and I'm 21.

572
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,965
But I have my mother's
cheekbones and my father's chin.

573
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,112
Everyone always says that
combination makes you look younger, so...

574
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,407
- Is that what they say?
- Yeah, so...

575
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,008
TEF with aspiration,
going up for a bronch.

576
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,618
- Jellyfish sting...
- Jellyfish?

577
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,620
Yeah, it was a pet. Obs for
30 minutes and then home.

578
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,384
Stewy, my little guy with
pneumonia is hanging out on 02.

579
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,686
Pedes has seen him,
we're waiting on a bed.

580
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,454
A well-presented
plan, by the way.

581
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,188
Yes, I had to do something.

582
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,799
Well, like you said, I'm not
good at being agreeable.

583
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,299
I didn't say that.

584
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,868
You implied it.

585
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,700
I said, it was a lot to ask,
and it turns out I was right.

586
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,707
- Not that I'm happy about it.
- No, of course not.

587
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,372
I'm gonna be really late.

588
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,344
Are you coming to this wedding?
It's in the hospital chapel.

589
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,711
I don't know. Lots
of things to finish up.

590
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,410
- I'll see you at the reception, yeah?
- Right.

591
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:24,789
Charge to 360.

592
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,652
Clear.

593
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,925
Again, 360.

594
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,722
Clear.

595
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,864
Sinus rhythm.

596
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,694
And we've got a pulse.

597
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:39,065
- Ice hockey dude is warm and alive.
- Welcome back, Harry.

598
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,537
Temp's 90. Want more warm saline?
- No, keep him at 90.

599
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,007
Auto-induced hypothermia
will protect the brain.

600
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,373
- All right, everybody, way to go.
- Is he okay?

601
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,546
Your friend's gonna
spend the night in ICU.

602
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,116
But he's stable and he has
a good chance for recovery.

603
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,553
Thank you all so much.

604
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,882
Mr. Spevacek, you
are absolutely welcome.

605
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:01,454
Okay, take out the DPL
catheters and get him a unit bed.

606
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,126
Hey, it was a good job, man.

607
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,282
What's going on? - Suction.

608
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,318
- Heart rate's dropping.
- Give me cricoid.

609
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,480
- Abby's pneumonia patient?
- Is she gone?

610
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,901
MRS. Honey... KOVAC:
Let's worry about the airway.

611
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,485
Respiratory distress, not
moving air. Send the blood gas.

612
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,130
- Tell me what's going on.
- Pulse is 47, pull out.

613
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,959
No, I got it. I'm in.

614
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,960
Hey, baby.

615
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,768
Okay, good. Color change.

616
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,636
His oxygen level was dangerously
low. We had to take over his breathing.

617
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,607
X-ray's up.

618
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,873
No, it doesn't look good. No
wonder he's hypoxic. Hey, Kovac.

619
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,308
Took me a while to get the mom
to agree. She didn't want radiation.

620
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,818
Not Stewy's biggest problem,
but interstitial infiltrates. Look here.

621
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,581
Maybe staph aureus?

622
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,748
Could be MRSA.
We should add vanco.

623
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,894
Check out the white count.

624
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,987
- 0.4?
- It should be through the roof.

625
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,632
Unless he hasn't any left.

626
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,995
Then this is PCP pneumonia.

627
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,104
Any reason for this kid to be
immunosuppressed? Chemo? Steroids?

628
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,001
Nothing in the history.

629
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,472
All right, who's
gonna ask the mom?

630
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:30,706
Mrs. Kenig, the type of
lung infection your son has...

631
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,078
- We ran a number of tests...
- I didn't say you could do that.

632
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,019
He was about to stop breathing.
We needed to know why.

633
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:42,650
The tests showed your son
has pneumocystis pneumonia.

634
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:48,197
It's a type of infection we only see
when the immune system is not working.

635
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,232
We'd like to test
your son for HIV.

636
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,462
And if he does have the virus,
we can recommend medications...

637
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,574
Here we go with the
viral theory of AIDS.

638
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,802
Invented so biotech companies
could charge people 50 bucks a pop...

639
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,574
for some bogus test when they're
actually dying from real problems.

640
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,546
- Excuse me?
- Real problems?

641
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,381
Pollution, drug addiction, toxins,
but nobody wants to deal with those.

642
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:14,583
It's better to call it a virus
and sell a vaccine. The easy fix.

643
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,194
I have talked to 50 doctors
since I've been diagnosed...

644
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,490
and it's always the same
thing. HIV causes AIDS...

645
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,895
Wait, wait. You're infected?

646
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,069
I'm not infected with anything.

647
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,899
I carry the HIV virus as do
millions of other healthy people.

648
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,064
You don't believe
HIV causes AIDS?

649
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,733
- No, I don't.
- Oh, lady, you're nuts.

650
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,572
I was diagnosed 14 years ago. I
haven't been sick a day in my life.

651
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,909
So you didn't take AZT
while you were pregnant?

652
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,483
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

653
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:42,883
Prevent your child from getting
AIDS, which is what Stewy might have.

654
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,283
Dr. Clemente.

655
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,583
Are you so sure AZT
doesn't cause AIDS?

656
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,693
Everyone knows it
suppresses the immune system.

657
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,761
Lady, you are out there, okay?

658
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,091
I'm a conspiracy freak
too, don't get me wrong.

659
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,427
- Drug companies are trying to screw us.
- Doctor.

660
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,865
Your child has a
life-threatening disease...

661
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,596
and you jeopardize his
life to prove your theories...

662
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,765
you're just as bad as they are.
If he dies, will you be happy?

663
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,070
Dr. Clemente, I'll
take care of this, okay?

664
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,737
She knew she was infected with
HIV, she did nothing to protect her child.

665
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:13,147
It's the most
moronic, selfish...

666
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:21,316
So you're saying you never
even had Stewy tested?

667
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,990
No.

668
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,162
What about Patricia?

669
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,666
- There you are. They're waiting.
- What's going on?

670
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,863
Scheduling conflict.

671
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,360
- You could have put a note.
- You could have been on time.

672
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,275
- Take one.
- We're stealing their flowers?

673
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,936
Just take one.

674
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,741
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

675
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,691
Child Life took Patricia up
to play some video games.

676
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:34,321
I asked about their father.
He's not in the picture.

677
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:38,301
She will let us treat the pneumonia,
but won't consent to an HIV test...

678
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,235
and doesn't even wanna
discuss medication.

679
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,067
If we don't get this
boy on the cocktail...

680
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,345
How do people get like this?

681
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:11,730
When my son Alex was 5...

682
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,032
the doctor thought he
might have meningitis.

683
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,074
Wanted to do a
spinal tap on him.

684
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,269
I'm a nurse, and I
didn't want him to do it.

685
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:24,210
I was worried and scared. I
didn't want anything hurting my kid.

686
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,047
I don't want anything
hurting Stewy.

687
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,082
Stewy is already
hurting, Mrs. Kenig.

688
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,626
Everyone is entitled
to their beliefs.

689
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:41,358
But the truth here, in this room,
right now, is that if you let this go on...

690
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,661
there's not gonna be a
doctor that can help him.

691
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,373
He only has you.

692
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,790
Why do we have to
go through the kitchen?

693
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,588
Because Michael and Neela
are waiting by the front door.

694
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,731
- It's not a surprise party.
- Oh, Abby.

695
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,662
Oh, man, this isn't every
bride's dream come true.

696
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,564
Come on.

697
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,140
That's a nice tie.

698
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:32,114
Thanks, and a lovely outfit as
well. Better without the lab coat.

699
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,117
- What are we waiting for?
- I've no idea.

700
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,777
Where have you been?

701
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,186
Take that and that.

702
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,987
- Hey.
- What happened to the chapel?

703
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:47,462
- Scheduling conflict.
- Yes, I know that.

704
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,567
- No, but...
- Shh.

705
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,615
She still won't change
her mind about Patricia?

706
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,785
Says she's a healthy young
girl. She doesn't need any testing.

707
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,725
Gonna have to get a court order.

708
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,059
Well, at least she's
gonna let us help Stewy.

709
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,723
One out of two,
that's something.

710
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,803
- I'm going up with them to the PICU.
- Okay, thanks.

711
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,805
Hey, so the wacko finally gave in, huh?
- No thanks to you.

712
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,006
Yeah, look, I'm sorry
about that. I don't know.

713
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,015
I just had to yell
at her. I just...

714
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,416
Listen, I hope there won't
be any hard feelings...

715
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,182
but Kerry let me know I'm
gonna be the new ER chief.

716
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,155
That's awesome. That's awesome.

717
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:52,422
You know, when I withdrew my
name, I was hoping they'd pick you.

718
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,431
- You withdrew your name?
- Yeah, I just had a lot of stuff going on.

719
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,899
Long story, man. You're
the best guy for the job.

720
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,835
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

721
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,406
Um...

722
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,511
- Going to the wedding reception?
- I'd love to, I really would...

723
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,647
but Maureen here,
way in over her head.

724
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,509
Doesn't know where
the forks and knives go.

725
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:14,141
I'm gonna supervise her a
little bit. If you know what I mean.

726
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,984
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

727
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,522
Go, go, go.

728
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,092
- Do we have to call you "chief" now?
- Very funny.

729
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:32,931
If you're interviewed,
do they say:

730
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,198
"We're here at County
talking to Chief Kovac."

731
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,365
They don't do it that way.

732
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,011
I'm just saying I think
it's cute if it's a guy.

733
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,044
And if the chief is a woman?

734
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:46,112
I don't think women should
be put in positions of leadership.

735
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,582
Do you?

736
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,045
Peanut?

737
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,716
Ah.

738
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:57,191
Young love. They just have
to show it off to everybody.

739
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,489
Here's to discretion.

740
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,066
- Propriety.
- Maturity.

741
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:08,837
- Well...
- No, no, not that. Yeah, yeah.

742
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,008
That will be me someday.

743
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:21,279
Yup, that's gonna be me.

744
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,322
I should have said
something earlier.

745
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,352
Excuse me?

746
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,189
I should have said
something earlier.

747
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,161
But I want you to know
that I have a lot of respect...

748
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:37,234
for how you handled
that trauma today.

749
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,261
And there was some
truth in what you said...

750
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,170
about me being
up in administration.

751
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,834
I'm a little out of practice.

752
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:50,504
But I want you to know that I'm
gonna start spending more time...

753
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:53,049
down in the ER.

754
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,844
Morris!

755
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,795
Yeah!

756
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,232
Now, we really want
to thank everybody.

757
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,631
Well, you said that already.

758
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,864
When we get settled, I want all
of you to come over and visit us.

759
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,738
And you can all come and visit
me tomorrow morning at work, 7 a.m.

760
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,641
Really, we love
you all, thank you.

761
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,977
Yeah, and we're
leaving now. Good night.

762
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,322
- Where are they going on their honeymoon?
- My apartment.

763
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,422
I don't remember...

764
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,743
Okay, well, thanks for the ride.

765
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,671
- That bad, huh?
- No.

766
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,407
I would just keep your day job.

767
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,382
What? You never sing in the
car? You know, when you're alone?

768
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:05,011
Sometimes I do, yeah, but
you're not alone in the car.

769
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,749
Yeah, I know.

770
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,951
I'm just kidding.

771
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,534
Would you like to...?

772
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,221
- Come on, we can make it.
- You try running with a sari on.

773
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,933
What a day!

774
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,732
What a night!

775
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,965
We're actually married.

776
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:58,067
Yeah.

777
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,041
Do you really think we
should be doing this?

778
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,512
I do.
