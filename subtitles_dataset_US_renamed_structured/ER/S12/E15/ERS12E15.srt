1
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,703
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,137
He shot me.

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,402
They think I did it.
They think I did it.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,944
All right. Was there anyone
who can back you up?

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,604
Yeah. She's down there.

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,804
You've been accepted
in surgical elective.

7
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:17,945
Oh, my God, thank you.

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,678
I write your evaluation. I'm
the one you've to impress.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,289
I need you to draw
blood-alcohol for a suspected DUI.

10
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,427
- You gotta help me, Greg.
- His blood-alcohol came back negative.

11
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,118
It won't happen
again, I promise.

12
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,389
It won't. Stop drinking
and get in a program.

13
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:34,501
Debbie enlisted me to give a hand to
a Sudanese doctor who's short-staffed.

14
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,866
He works out of a camp
called Dumtala in Darfur.

15
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,393
Dr. Carter? It is Stephen.

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,137
You startled me.

17
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,467
You cough all night. I
brought you some tea.

18
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,135
Thank you.

19
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,544
It is the dryness, you know.

20
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,344
And the sand.

21
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,987
It happens to everyone
when they get here.

22
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,986
It's good.

23
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,354
Zahra, she made
me that when I came.

24
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,986
And I would drink it every
night before I went to sleep.

25
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,894
Debbie said you
needed some help here.

26
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:42,332
Yes. She's a good person.

27
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,834
And your help
will be appreciated.

28
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,167
So you and Debbie are...?

29
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,376
Yes.

30
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,504
How long has that been going on?

31
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,980
Well, she has been here two
months, so seven and a half weeks.

32
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,677
You know what? You
should go back to bed.

33
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,445
Okay.

34
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,653
Yeah, thank you.

35
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,384
No, thank you.

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,188
Now we can all get some sleep.

37
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,729
- What's that?
- It's the Janjaweed again.

38
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,202
You'll learn to
sleep through it.

39
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,371
- No, Bernie, no biting.
- Am I bleeding? Did he break the skin?

40
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,512
I am so sorry. He's
not usually like this.

41
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,545
I'll get a nurse to
give him the shot.

42
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,580
Can somebody take
a look at this wound?

43
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,719
Yeah, we're a little
short. Do it yourself.

44
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,548
- Hey, what's this?
- That's for you and the little bastard.

45
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,519
- Thanks, Frank.
- Hey, congratulations.

46
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,886
Thank you. It was
supposed to be a secret.

47
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,255
Everybody says you're
puffy. I had to defend you.

48
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,056
- Am I getting puffy?
- You're not.

49
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,699
- Are you on today?
- No. Clemente will be here at 8.

50
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,061
Damn it, I'm bleeding.

51
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,396
You should get a hep
panel and HIV on that kid.

52
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,049
Clemente's back on the schedule?

53
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,730
Isn't it a bit too soon after
everything that happened?

54
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,308
Which I hear is similar to
what happened in Newark.

55
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,479
- What happened in Newark?
- Nothing happened.

56
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,945
The guy is a loose cannon. I
mean, he's a suspected murderer.

57
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:06,143
Look, Dr. Clemente is an excellent
physician with some personal issues.

58
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,220
That's nothing new around here.

59
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,989
It's the fifth time you brought
me in this week, man. Five times.

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,392
Why don't you put it all down
on this piece of paper and sign?

61
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,099
Because if I shot her,
then how did I get shot?

62
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,828
Because she went for the gun, it went
off, and it clipped you in the shoulder.

63
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,835
Come on, man, her husband
did it. Her husband did it, okay?

64
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,268
He was working in Jersey.

65
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:31,003
Then he's gotta have a twin because
I saw a guy like him in my apartment.

66
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,807
If that's true, why can't a
neighbor back your story up?

67
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,950
I don't know, maybe people hate
me because I play my music loud.

68
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,949
Because it's bull,
Vic, and you know it.

69
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,455
Now, we talked to the doctor
and your girl ain't waking up.

70
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,085
So if I were you,
I'd get a lawyer.

71
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,716
This is great.

72
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,017
Just great.

73
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,136
Okay, okay. We'll
be with you soon.

74
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,283
- Zahra, where's Stephen?
- In the back. What's wrong?

75
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,044
Everything.

76
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,646
Good radial and ulnar pulses.

77
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,620
You okay? DAKARAI: I'm fine.

78
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,158
- Janjaweed shot up the reservoir.
- There's a patch kit. Tell the engineer.

79
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,990
- Went to Khartoum. We can't wait.
- We have the boreholes.

80
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,995
We need 15 liters
per person per day.

81
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,657
Cephalexin, 500
milligrams q.i.d. for a week.

82
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,600
Why are you being so calm?
People are drinking sand.

83
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,503
We've been through this. Drain the tank,
patch the holes, re-treat with chlorine.

84
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,009
So, sweetheart, take two deep
breaths and do your downtown dog.

85
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,715
Down-and-out dog?

86
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,316
It's not funny. We can't
provide basic needs.

87
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,214
What's new?

88
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:04,189
Fine, yeah. Be like that.

89
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,155
Oh, I have two more but I'll just save
them for someone who is listening to me.

90
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,695
Appreciates me.

91
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,833
- She was like this in the Congo?
- Worse.

92
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,696
At least in the Congo,
we had television and beer.

93
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,698
I'm not against anyone's religion but
this place would drive anybody to drink.

94
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,342
Dr. Carter, I need you in here.

95
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,102
It's downward dog.

96
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,355
IV is already in.

97
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,923
Osman.

98
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,394
Thought you're feeling better.

99
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,435
They want to go home.

100
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,908
Well, I'm gonna give him some
medicine so we can release him.

101
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,252
- Who's this? ZAHRA:
His brother, Khalid.

102
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,220
An artist?

103
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,724
Let me see.

104
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,898
It's him and his father
fighting the Janjaweed.

105
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:28,266
Tell him it's good. Somebody
needs to kick the Janjaweed's butt.

106
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,748
Okay. Doxycycline, single
dose, 4 mgs per kilo...

107
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,111
ORS is one cup
after each loose stool.

108
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,254
- Thank you, Dr. Carter.
- She's gonna take very good care of you.

109
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,228
Is this for me?

110
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,006
Dr. Clemente, how was jail?

111
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,408
- I didn't go to jail.
- Called the lawyer I left on your machine?

112
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,481
I don't need a lawyer,
Morris. Thank you.

113
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,844
Welcome back.

114
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,816
- So how did you survive without me?
- Oh, we did our best.

115
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,819
- Oh, yeah?
- You okay?

116
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,787
Yeah, I'm okay.

117
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,352
Why? Are people
talking about me?

118
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,496
Well, they're concerned.

119
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,188
They just wanna make
sure you're all right. That's all.

120
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,527
Well, tell them not to be
so concerned about me.

121
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,965
You didn't have to
come back so soon.

122
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,230
What is that supposed to mean?

123
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,269
Yeah, well, before Morris
or somebody starts a blog...

124
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,640
I wanna set the record straight.

125
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,375
I didn't shoot Jodie.

126
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,141
Okay.

127
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,349
But how did you
know about the blog?

128
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,781
Oh, that bitch.

129
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,922
Give bolus with a liter.
- Wait up.

130
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,820
Hey, Kovac. Kovac.
Hey, wait up, wait up.

131
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,720
What have you got for me?

132
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,362
Good to see you, but you're
not on the schedule today.

133
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,997
Weaver said I could come back.

134
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,965
I'm head of the ER, not Weaver,
and I don't think you're ready.

135
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,061
What are you doing? Giving
me the slow walk to the door?

136
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,240
- I'm looking out for you.
- I can take care of myself. Thank you.

137
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,003
More importantly, I'm
looking out for patients in here.

138
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,203
Patients don't need to
be protected from me.

139
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,543
Dr. Kovac, we've got a 14-year-old,
auto versus peds coming in.

140
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,582
- Go home, Vic.
- I am home.

141
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,017
- You're not working today.
- Come on, put me back on the schedule.

142
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,554
Kovac, come on.

143
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,715
Fourteen-year-old hit
by car going 30 or 40.

144
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,155
My leg.

145
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,353
Distal deformity of
the left lower extremity.

146
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,760
- What's your name?
- Jose Rodriguez.

147
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,230
- Jose, remember what happened?
- I got hit.

148
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,028
Let me guess? Flute.

149
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,068
- Tuba.
- Sorry about that.

150
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,433
LOC? Nope.

151
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,438
- A and O times four.
- Vitals?

152
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,770
Tachy in the 120s.
Resps, 20s. BP, 110/78.

153
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,380
Okay, Abby, you take the
airway. Pratt, you run it. Let's go.

154
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,074
So how long is
your wife in Paris?

155
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,777
I don't know.

156
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,082
- So how long are you with us?
- How long do you need me?

157
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,754
It's hard, huh?

158
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,760
Keeping relationships
going, doing what we do.

159
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,430
I have a sweet lady friend
in London named Grace.

160
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,591
Whenever I'm in town, we fall
in love. When I leave, we fall out.

161
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,236
How does Debbie feel about that?

162
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,100
She has the exact same relationship
with some Spanish photojournalist.

163
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,209
What happens in
Darfur stays in Darfur.

164
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,116
So when do you think these
people will be able to go home?

165
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,656
Who knows?

166
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,295
The government funded the Arab
militias to find and kill the rebels.

167
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,795
So they burned the villages,
killed the men, raped the women.

168
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,400
Whoever survived wound up here.

169
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,800
The Janjaweed have turned
this place into the Wild, Wild West.

170
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,271
Kofi Annan and Colin Powell,
they called this genocide.

171
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,275
And the Congress,
they just went on holiday.

172
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,639
I guess 300,000 dead...

173
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,805
and a million displaced persons
aren't enough to get involved.

174
00:11:55,982 --> 00:12:00,420
Does not matter whether it is Somalia
or Rwanda, Darfur, New Orleans.

175
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:04,649
When the faces are black,
the world moves slow.

176
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,157
Is she doing what
I think she's doing?

177
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,159
Yes. She is quite a woman.

178
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,291
Hey, how much
for the yoga class?

179
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,523
It's free.

180
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,333
What happened?

181
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,012
- Is it a stomachache?
- Yes. He also has diarrhea.

182
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,187
Mother's gone to get wood. He
doesn't know where his father is.

183
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,416
Let's take him back to the
tent for supervised rehydration.

184
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,361
It's okay, we'll fix you up
before your mom gets back.

185
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,591
I'd let him keep it, but what
happens when the battery dies?

186
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,385
It becomes iTrash.

187
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,620
Help, help. She needs a doctor.

188
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,603
You bring a towel,
I'll go get a stretcher.

189
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,707
Tell Zahra to prep
the procedure room.

190
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,805
Janjaweed.

191
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,707
- She's tachy at 120.
- BP is 100/60.

192
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,439
Two liters of saline wide
open. She lost a lot of blood.

193
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,743
Hope it's just from
the lacerations.

194
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,777
Looks like a nasal fracture...

195
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,219
probably an inferior
orbit blowout as well.

196
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,585
Chest is clear.

197
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,592
Get these lacerations cleared,
see what we're dealing here.

198
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,560
- Why did she leave camp?
- To get firewood for their families.

199
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,931
- Why don't the men go?
- The men would be killed.

200
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,092
- IV is in.
- Okay. Let's get 2 of morphine.

201
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,727
And I need two suture kits
too, 4-0 Vicryl, 4-0 nylon.

202
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,902
Gada, where's your husband?

203
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,736
We got a lot of blood down here.

204
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,443
What is it?

205
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:44,516
We have lacerations and contusions
to the external genitalia and upper thigh.

206
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,777
- No. Enough.
- We need to examine her.

207
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,993
- Doesn't want to be examined by men.
- She needs...

208
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,680
- I know!
- For STIs and HIV.

209
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,190
- I know.
- Okay, so get her husband in here.

210
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,419
- Do not tell him
she's been shamed.

211
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,075
- Shamed? ZAHRA:
Their word, not mine.

212
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,631
Sudanese men sometimes
disown their wives after rape.

213
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,633
When Gada awakens, we'll let
her tell him what she chooses.

214
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,199
We're going to regionals. I miss
practice, drum major will bench me.

215
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,344
Hey, Pratt, Endocrine saw
your IDDM kid, so he can go.

216
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:15,107
- KJ's dad is out here asking for you.
- Just got a little guarding here.

217
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,149
Ultrasound and call
Surgery to come take a look.

218
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,984
Have them follow up tomorrow.

219
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,621
- Where's Darnell?
- Right here.

220
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,518
Take your time with
discharge instructions.

221
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,987
I always do.

222
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,219
- What happened this time?
- I got in a fight, man. It's no big deal.

223
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,626
- Some cat at this restaurant.
- You been drinking again? Damn, man.

224
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,232
I blew it, okay?

225
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,335
We had a going-away
party for a buddy at work.

226
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,301
I had a few. Next thing I
knew, me and this kid got into it.

227
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,169
- But you're supposed to stay clean.
- You my sponsor now?

228
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,038
No. I'm your boy who you
promised you'd come clean to.

229
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,178
Look, I'm not gonna
kick this overnight.

230
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,516
What I need from you right now is to
fix me up before KJ gets down here.

231
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,849
- I don't want him to see me like this.
- Then stop coming in like this.

232
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,393
Hey there.

233
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,398
Jodes?

234
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,363
How are you doing?

235
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,174
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't
been around much. I just...

236
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,709
I got a lot of problems.

237
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,179
Things are really
messed up, baby.

238
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,066
Look, I can see
you're mad at me.

239
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:46,906
- You been going to the meetings?
- Hell, yeah. It's hard, man.

240
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,074
What happened in there?

241
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,409
Kid got hit by a truck.

242
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,945
Come on, hold still.

243
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,106
He gonna be all right?

244
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,617
Who knows?

245
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,216
Where is she?

246
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,953
Your wife was attacked
outside the second checkpoint.

247
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,424
- She okay?
- She will be.

248
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,261
Shamed?

249
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,639
She was badly beaten.

250
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,308
See her.

251
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,143
I can see her now?

252
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,648
Yes. Come with me.

253
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,581
It's this way.

254
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,622
Oh, Gada.

255
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,656
There are bruises to her
chest and to her abdomen...

256
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,165
but I don't think that there is
any damage to her internal organs.

257
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,764
She live?

258
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,601
Yes, we gave her some
medicine to help her sleep.

259
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,970
She has many cuts
but they're not so deep...

260
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:01,137
and I think the stitches
need to stay for one week.

261
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,991
- She cut there?
- Yes, but I think it will heal very well.

262
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,320
There shouldn't be any scarring.

263
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,692
Sir? Sir? Sir.

264
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,025
Sir, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

265
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,690
Wait.

266
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,796
What happened?

267
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,565
- I brought him in to see her.
- Did he see the wound?

268
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,002
Yeah.

269
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,945
The slash on the thigh
is the mark of rape.

270
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,840
How the hell was I
supposed to know that?

271
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,507
Where are you going?

272
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,050
- I'm gonna go get him.
- John!

273
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,499
Chuny, what are his vitals?

274
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:46,183
Pulse, 97. Resps, 20. BP, 102/58.
A hundred percent on room air.

275
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,158
Heart rate's a little high.
There could be occult blood loss.

276
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,991
- What took you so long?
- Our favorite surgeon has arrived.

277
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,032
- I was with the Crohn's girl.
- Why isn't Albright helping you?

278
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,693
I was given strict
instructions to handle ER...

279
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,998
so she can scrub in on
ileoanal anastomosis.

280
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,868
- What have you got?
- Tier one trauma.

281
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,873
He should've been seen first.

282
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:07,343
I heard he was stable. Thought
I'd get the acute obstruction first.

283
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,244
- It's fine.
- No. He needs an ex-lap, that takes time.

284
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,045
- Ex-lap? The ultrasound was negative.
- What's an ex-lap?

285
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,916
Abdominal pain, tachycardia
and a good mechanism.

286
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,881
That's a bleed until
proven otherwise.

287
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,220
Guys, that's basic Trauma 101.

288
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,722
Get Albright or Dubenko
down here to evaluate.

289
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,263
- I'm sure they'll agree with me.
- Serial hemoglobin?

290
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,560
- Thirteen to 11.6.
- Probably dilutional.

291
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,896
- Am I gonna have surgery?
- We're not sure yet.

292
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,904
This is the ER. I'm gonna need
a CT of the chest and abdomen.

293
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,542
Thanks. Get a portable, Chuny.

294
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,075
Would you forget the scan?

295
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,940
- It's a waste of time.
- I don't agree.

296
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,911
- CT shows a bleed, he's going to the O.R.
- If it doesn't?

297
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,574
- He's going to the O.R.
- Not necessarily. We'll OBS.

298
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,083
OBS? That doesn't sound good.

299
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,721
What do you gain from the scan?

300
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,756
- Other than giving him radiation?
- Pratt.

301
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,450
A chance to spare him from
an operation he doesn't need.

302
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,461
Sense of what we're dealing.
Surgeons don't like surprises.

303
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,428
- You're not a surgeon.
- Today, I am.

304
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,401
Just give her a break, Pratt.

305
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,904
Neela. Listen, I got a lot more experience
with pediatric traumas than you do.

306
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,941
Kids are tricky. They
have a huge reserve.

307
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,842
They maintain normal vitals for a while,
but when they crash, they crash hard.

308
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,448
CT scan is part of a
complete workup of the patient.

309
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,279
- It'll take 15 minutes. We got time.
- I don't think you do.

310
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,773
- It's my call, Pratt.
- Dad.

311
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,184
Are you okay?

312
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,325
You have to tell Monty I
won't be able to play tonight.

313
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,256
Don't worry about that, son.

314
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,625
The officer wants to ask you
some questions about the accident.

315
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,322
Did you get a description?

316
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,123
He was a black dude.

317
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,634
- Blue pickup.
- You see the license plate?

318
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,796
All I remember is that
the side door is smashed...

319
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,775
and the grill was crushed.

320
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,845
Oh, and there was bumper stickers.
Lots of Bears bumper stickers.

321
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,175
Malik, take a break.

322
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,146
- What's up? PRATT: I
need you to take a break.

323
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,688
- What's wrong?
- You still drive that old truck?

324
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,126
Yeah, why?

325
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,324
Because that kid you were so
curious about, the one who got hit...

326
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,665
says the guy who hit him was a
black dude, who drove a blue pickup.

327
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,399
- Million of brothers drive blue pickups.
- Not talking about a million brothers.

328
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,076
I'm talking about you.

329
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,301
Did you hit that kid?

330
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,747
- Yo, Greg.
- Answer me.

331
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,651
Did your drunk ass hit that kid?

332
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,824
I didn't mean to hit him, man.

333
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,989
It was a accident, man. I swear.

334
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,029
It was an accident, man. I
didn't mean to hurt that kid.

335
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,098
I swear to God.

336
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,048
I think it's this one.

337
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,049
This one up here with
the Oxfam logo on it.

338
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,699
What did he say?

339
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,364
He said Lwendo went
to find the Janjaweed.

340
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,238
It happened by the second checkpoint.
- You cannot do this.

341
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,902
- We can stop him.
- It's dangerous.

342
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,911
- This is my fault.
- It's Lwendo's fault.

343
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,743
He knows it's
suicide to leave camp.

344
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,250
- That's right. You'll get yourself killed.
- So could Lwendo.

345
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,081
Look, I'll go.

346
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:41,750
At least I know
where it is. You stay.

347
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,486
You drive.

348
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,098
Is my dad still here?

349
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,533
He's outside. No talking.
You have to hold still.

350
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,866
Liver and spleen look good.

351
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,701
- How's he doing?
- Why are you here?

352
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,435
- Follow-up on my patient. Vitals good?
- I've got this.

353
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,943
- You don't.
- Why are you here?

354
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,946
Dr. Pratt was concerned you
were not receptive to his input.

355
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,608
So concerned that he had to page me
out of the O.R. to come see this patient.

356
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,254
- Went over my head.
- Make sure we don't miss anything.

357
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:13,119
I'm doing what you said. I'm getting
ER to work up their patients completely.

358
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,921
No, not really, since you're
the one here doing the CT.

359
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,295
Heart rate is up to 125.

360
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,762
Got some fluid in the
retroperitoneal fossa.

361
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,560
That could be
blood. Scan's over.

362
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,461
Retroperitoneal injury wouldn't
show up on an ultrasound.

363
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,732
- Jose. PRATT: He's
hypotensive, non-responsive.

364
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,502
He was talking. His heart
rate was in the 90s before.

365
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,508
Get two units type-specific.

366
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,738
Send off another
set of blood cultures.

367
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,076
Change to Zosyn and up
the dopamine to 10 mics.

368
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,014
Hey, whoa.

369
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,781
- You skipped her. What are you doing?
- We rounded on her 10 minutes ago.

370
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,754
Don't think so, I
didn't see new orders.

371
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,791
Come on, I need to
know what's going on.

372
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,155
I'll catch up with you.

373
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,457
She's off pressors, stable from
a cardiopulmonary standpoint.

374
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,260
We're just waiting for her
neuro status to declare itself.

375
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,466
So, what are you gonna do now?

376
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,332
What are you gonna do?

377
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,373
Sit back and twiddle your thumbs?
Is that what you're gonna do?

378
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,803
We're gonna wait.

379
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,002
That's all we can do.

380
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,679
What's up?

381
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,858
<i>How does it feel, Vic?</i>

382
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,589
Who is this?

383
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,852
<i>How does she look now?</i>

384
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,861
<i>You still wanna touch her?</i>

385
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,860
You sick, twisted piece of...

386
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,002
<i>Yeah, I might not
have finished the job...</i>

387
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,171
but it's still a
beautiful thing.

388
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,204
The cops are all over you.

389
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,308
You wait, man. You wait till
she wakes up and starts talking.

390
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,241
Because you'll be in a world of hurt.
- <i>Keep dreaming, buddy.</i>

391
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,812
You got out of Jersey okay.

392
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,317
You're not gonna
pull that off this time.

393
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,521
- Oh, you don't think?
<i>- She was mine.</i>

394
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,317
You never should
have touched her.

395
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,433
Is that kid gonna be all right?

396
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,570
I don't know. He's up in the
O.R., trying to stop the bleeding.

397
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:09,004
- Look, man. I messed up, man. I'm sorry.
- I went out on a limb for you.

398
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,542
I risked my job to cover for you
because you promised me you'd get help.

399
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,113
I'm trying. All I do is
think about drinking.

400
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,772
I wake up, I want a drink.

401
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,112
I walk down the
street, I want a drink.

402
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,720
I see the winos on the
corner and I'm jealous.

403
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,414
I think to myself, "If I could
get through raising KJ...

404
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,425
get him through college, then
I could be there with them."

405
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,189
- Come on, man.
- Are you listening to me?

406
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,356
This is serious. I'm not
proud of it, but it's serious.

407
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,263
What's serious is
that kid could die.

408
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,536
And I know that, and I'm sorry for
it. But what else you want me to do?

409
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,167
Turn yourself in.

410
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,305
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

411
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,474
Look, you talk about
raising KJ to be honest, right?

412
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:55,552
You got him working up here to
teach him integrity and respect.

413
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,623
How's he supposed to learn
that if you just get away with this?

414
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,487
I ain't going to jail.

415
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,554
You've gotta
turn yourself in, D.

416
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,499
What does he think
he's gonna accomplish?

417
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:15,401
For men like him, pride
slips away on a daily basis.

418
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,443
They can't provide without getting
killed, so their wives must do it.

419
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,671
Then the worst happens.

420
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,179
He's had enough.

421
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,112
Just wants to be a man again.

422
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,586
This.

423
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,086
This is one of the places.

424
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,293
Doesn't seem to
be anybody around.

425
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,504
Let's go a little further.

426
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,503
Look, John.

427
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:54,044
The farther we go, the
more dangerous it gets.

428
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,273
Now, I'm sorry, but we
are going to turn around.

429
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,223
How is she doing?

430
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,862
She wants to know
where Lwendo is.

431
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,410
Tell her we have doctors
out looking for him.

432
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:09,015
- Her children.
- They're here. I'll get them.

433
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,921
Come on. Your mother's awake.

434
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,745
- What is he asking?
- He's asking if we have weapons.

435
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,712
We don't have any weapons. We
don't have any weapons. We're doctors.

436
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:42,817
- A woman was raped, we're trying to...
- He says shut up and so do I.

437
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,480
- I'm just saying that they can help us.
- John.

438
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,348
Look, John, there's
a lot of corruption.

439
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,613
- Government, military, police, everybody.
- They could've helped us.

440
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,518
Yes. But then the
U.S. would prefer...

441
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,888
to have conversations with
criminals like Salah Gosh.

442
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,329
Salah Gosh?

443
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:30,800
Your government flew him to Washington
to get intel on the war on terrorism.

444
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,269
They wouldn't be able to do that
if they started pissing off Bashir.

445
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,534
They wouldn't be able to get their
hands on the oil out here either.

446
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,107
Let's go a little further.

447
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,048
It is too late.

448
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,344
A little further, please.

449
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,051
No. We are going back. Oh!

450
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,825
What?

451
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,658
What? What is going on with you?

452
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,531
- It's not cholera, is it?
- I'm fine.

453
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:05,966
Cirrhosis.

454
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,339
- Spironolactone.
- You have hepatitis.

455
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:14,071
Schistosomiasis as a child. Left
me with a few liver granulomas.

456
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,010
What is that?

457
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,819
That could be them, huh?

458
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,830
So, what happens now?

459
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,501
He'll get booked.
Probably post bail.

460
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,675
My dad's going away, isn't he?

461
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,089
We're going to go back. There's
nothing more that we can do here.

462
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,296
- They're gonna kill him.
- And they'll kill us too.

463
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,308
Stay still, John. Say nothing.

464
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,465
Lwendo.

465
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,607
Lwendo, stay with
me. Stay with me.

466
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:07,242
We've got multiple GSWs
to the chest, flank and legs.

467
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,709
Bagged the femoral
artery. I need a clamp.

468
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,906
John.

469
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,813
Start an IV.

470
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:17,814
We're just one hour to camp and
another two to the surgical hospital.

471
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,254
- John!
- Don't worry, Lwendo.

472
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,088
We're gonna get
you back to camp.

473
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,230
Damn it.

474
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,559
I need some suction.
I need to intubate him.

475
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,327
We can't even do
that at the clinic.

476
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,803
Lost the pulse.

477
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,605
John.

478
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,534
Vic.

479
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,043
Vicky.

480
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,517
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

481
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,985
Oh, my God, you're
awake. You're awake, baby.

482
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,121
I was so worried about you.

483
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,995
What happened?

484
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,195
You don't remember?

485
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:42,868
Gunshots.

486
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,033
Yes. Yes.

487
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,270
And Bobby...

488
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,045
- Bobby shot me?
- That's right.

489
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,982
That's right. You think
you can tell the police that?

490
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,687
Is he in jail?

491
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,719
No, no. Not yet. Not yet.

492
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,154
But we're gonna be okay.

493
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,189
How long am I gonna...?

494
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,431
How long am I
gonna be like this?

495
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,500
Oh, baby, it's gonna
be a while longer.

496
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,433
About a week or two. Your
mom's coming out to take you home.

497
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,870
Not my mom, Vic. Please.

498
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,307
It's just gonna be for a little
while, that's all. You gotta do it.

499
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,179
We're still gonna be
together, though, right?

500
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,953
Don't you leave me now, jerk.

501
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,948
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

502
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,059
You just take it
easy, all right?

503
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,195
I'm gonna get your doctor.

504
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:39,822
Okay.

505
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,271
I'm headed out.

506
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:53,071
- Is somebody coming to pick you up?
- Yeah, I'll stay with my aunt for a while.

507
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,611
Hey, KJ, look.

508
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,608
I feel bad about all of this,
but you gotta understand...

509
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,218
It's not your fault.

510
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,887
I mean, every time my dad
picked me up from school...

511
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,718
I could smell the
alcohol on him.

512
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,088
- He's gonna get the help he needs.
- Thanks to you.

513
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,463
- KJ...
- All my dad's other boys...

514
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,123
They just help him
get out of trouble...

515
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:20,500
but you're the only one that makes
him step up and take responsibility.

516
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,971
That means a lot, Dr. Pratt.

517
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,134
A lot.

518
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,577
All right, man.

519
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,278
- Oh, damn.
- What was all that about?

520
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,983
How's the kid?

521
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,317
A tear in the mesentery
opened a small artery.

522
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,926
- Easily controlled once we got in there.
- He's okay?

523
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,527
- Yeah.
- Didn't drop his pressure?

524
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,597
- He didn't code on the table?
- No, Pratt. The case went well.

525
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,601
All right. Thank you.

526
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:54,537
Well, I'm sorry. You were right,
I should have listened to you.

527
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,642
Oh, forget about it. He
tolerated the anesthesia okay?

528
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,004
- Yeah.
- All right. Good.

529
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,544
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

530
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,012
You're lying. What's up?

531
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,117
I...

532
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,015
I know who hit that
kid. It's all my fault.

533
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,180
What do you
mean, it's your fault?

534
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:16,786
The cops brought in a friend of mine
a while ago for a blood-alcohol level.

535
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,192
I drew my own blood,
switched the tubes.

536
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:20,627
What?

537
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,462
He swore to me he
was gonna get help.

538
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,366
That kid almost died.

539
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,803
You just said he was fine.

540
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,069
He's got a pulverized leg, he
needed blood transfusions...

541
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:36,010
he'll be on ventilator, he's in the
hospital for weeks, you call that fine?

542
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,649
All right, I made a mistake.

543
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,684
Look, Darnell's not a bad guy.

544
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:45,150
At the time, it seemed like him going to
jail for DUI wasn't gonna help anybody.

545
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,885
It would have helped
Jose Rodriguez.

546
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:51,493
- He wouldn't be in the hospital now.
- I made him turn himself in.

547
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,322
You think that's enough?

548
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,925
So now what?

549
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,729
You gonna tell
Kovac or something?

550
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,998
You got your friend to
own up to what he did.

551
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,165
Take your own advice.

552
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,745
How about Céline? Or Jewel?

553
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,284
Have you been going through
your CD collection again?

554
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,421
- I love Jewel.
- Well, yeah, me too.

555
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,388
I guess, but not for a name.

556
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,688
What about Charo?

557
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,763
Or Liberace?

558
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:32,265
How about we give him the name of the
first person who walks through the door?

559
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,804
- Seriously? Okay.
- Sure.

560
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,736
Well, maybe not.

561
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:42,042
- Hey, what's up?
- That's great news about Jodie.

562
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,546
- Thanks.
- We were all happy to hear it.

563
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,117
Maybe now you could put
me back on the schedule, huh?

564
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,015
- Give me a second.
- Mm-hm.

565
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,212
Hey, Vic.

566
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:58,095
You'll need to undergo an evaluation
by the Impaired Physician Committee.

567
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,624
- Come on. You're not serious, are you?
- Medical, drug testing, psych.

568
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,130
You're serious.

569
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:07,170
- Yeah, well, I don't need that, okay?
- I do.

570
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,906
Okay. Fine, fine.
Whatever you need, man.

571
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,739
- I'll do it for you, okay?
- Okay.

572
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:25,920
Son of a bitch.

573
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,456
You're screwed, buddy.

574
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,891
Yeah, she's upstairs telling the
cops now everything you're doing.

575
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,630
Right now. That's right.

576
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,528
We're gonna get you.
We're gonna get you.

577
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,466
Hey!

578
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,858
I can't get Gada to rest.
She's inside with the children.

579
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,726
Look. Maybe she won't
have to wait too long.

580
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,010
Lwendo?

581
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,978
Lwendo?

582
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,116
Lwendo.

583
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,521
Lwendo.

584
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,455
What's he saying?

585
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,718
It's from the Koran.

586
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,820
From the earth
God created you...

587
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,667
to the earth God
will return you.

588
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:34,479
And from the earth, God
will bring you out again.
