1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,198
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,605
- What's with the cross?
- My chaplain gave it to me.

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,438
You keeping up on
your Bible studies?

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,945
- I wasn't faking it.
- Yeah, I know.

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,883
- Take it off! Get it off me!
- Hey, hey, hey.

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,482
Weaver knew he had
problems before she hired him.

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,749
- Now we're paying for it.
- Well, Luka, it's your ER.

8
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,291
Have you any idea why
Michael went back to Iraq?

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,724
The boy's his father's son.

10
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,728
Soldiers gotta go
where they tell them to.

11
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,527
Why don't you explain why
he's not here with his wife?

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,535
The secretary of the Army would
like to express his deepest regret...

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,435
that your husband,
Captain Michael Gallant...

14
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,941
was killed in action
in Iraq on April 29th.

15
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:54,116
- So we can't even send anything, or...?
- Flowers? Donations?

16
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,120
There's gonna be a
memorial next week.

17
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,658
For today, Neela and the Gallants
wanna have a private graveside ceremony.

18
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,022
- Family only.
- And you.

19
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,523
Yeah, that's right. She needs
somebody to lean on right now.

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,429
- Plus, Mike and I were tight.
- Let her know we're with her.

21
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,663
And tell her to not even think
about coming back until she's ready.

22
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,741
All right. I should get out of here. Car's
picking me up. I need to be there by 9.

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,812
Dr. Weaver, that was Dr. Anspaugh's
office. He's waiting for you upstairs.

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,020
Dr. Weaver. WEAVER: Yep.

25
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,844
This is Mary Warner. She's
an EMT trainee from Mitchelson.

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:28,182
Hi. My program sent me over to
spend the day taking vitals or whatever.

27
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,823
- For credit.
- Of course.

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,516
Somebody needs to sign
this at the end of the shift...

29
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,719
to say that I was
here and did stuff.

30
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,126
- What would you like to do?
- Let her shadow.

31
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,792
- See how different nurses do the primary.
- That's what my instructor suggested.

32
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,202
Well, patients come in
through the triage desk here.

33
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:50,902
Waiting's out there, and ambulance runs
come in just outside those doors there.

34
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,310
- Right, I got it.
- How long you wanted to be an EMT?

35
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:59,215
Oh, not long, actually. I got
tired of retail. Christmas sucked.

36
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,845
Sam, this is Mary Warner,
she's studying to be an EMT.

37
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:03,422
Hey.

38
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:05,652
- I've got to irrigate a
full-body road rash...

39
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,385
on an unfortunate Vespa driver.

40
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,291
I got the mother of
all meth mouths here.

41
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,331
So? Can you let Mary
observe you for a while?

42
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:12,855
Haleh.

43
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,968
I'll come and get her
as soon as I'm free.

44
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,502
- Haleh.
- Bye.

45
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,675
- Yuck.
- Yep, that's the magic of meth.

46
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,944
Corrosive substances in the
drug eat away at the tooth enamel.

47
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:30,016
Plus, I have a feeling Mike here
hasn't been flossing. Have you, Mike?

48
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,349
It's not really a priority.

49
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,585
Dude, you gotta floss every day.

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,853
- Hey.
- Hey.

51
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,554
So how's she doing?

52
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,962
- I left messages, but haven't heard back.
- Amazingly well, actually.

53
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,761
Well, she's tougher
than she looks, huh?

54
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,895
Yeah.

55
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,531
I'll try calling her again.

56
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,200
Ray, I think she needs
some space, man.

57
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,708
- Yeah, but I just thought that...
- Look, she...

58
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,979
I just don't think
that you should, uh...

59
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,451
What?

60
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,378
Complicate it.

61
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,723
- You Dr. Pratt?
- Yeah, that's right. Where's Neela?

62
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,891
Dr. Rasgotra has asked that we
go on to the cemetery without her.

63
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,230
She said she's not
feeling up to it today.

64
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,256
Okay.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,630
Hey. Bob Vila, look out.

66
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,405
- It's not finished yet.
- Looks pretty finished to me.

67
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,675
Well, either I've been sleeping for
days, or you're working really fast.

68
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,211
How's the insomnia?

69
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,948
I kept thinking about
Gallant and Clemente.

70
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,623
It's a lot.

71
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,963
I went with yellow.

72
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:30,298
Because we don't know
is it gonna be blue or pink.

73
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,170
What's it gonna be,
huh? Blue or pink? Hello.

74
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,810
Is it just me, or are
pandas kind of creepy?

75
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,946
Wow, they're terrifying.

76
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,580
Hey. Steady.

77
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,650
Hello.

78
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,550
Listen, I know we don't say it,
because I guess that's just how we are...

79
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:53,490
but I hope you know
how much I love this.

80
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,494
All of this.

81
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:05,701
But since we are on the cusp
of this hugely life-altering event...

82
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:11,072
and we haven't been as
specific as we could be about us...

83
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,610
- about our relationship...
- You're right, let's get married.

84
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,441
Donald, oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

85
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,813
I didn't realize we were having a
pre-meeting. I went to your office...

86
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,544
Have a seat.

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,748
I wanted us to talk prior to the session
with the Medical Executive Committee.

88
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,260
The fallout from Clemente...

89
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,799
may be more
significant than I thought.

90
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,826
- I've been hearing things.
- What kind of things?

91
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,674
This is a letter from an attorney
representing Mr. Fred Fong...

92
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,868
a patient Clemente
saw a few weeks back.

93
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,172
Yes, diabetic with a gangrenous
toe. I've reviewed the case.

94
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,815
Ended up needing an amputation.

95
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:59,450
A reasonable outcome for which
Vic was completely blameless.

96
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,114
The family sees an opportunity.

97
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,989
You know, can
we talk in private?

98
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,358
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,191
Hospital policy. I need this
conversation documented.

100
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,234
Dr. Clemente was cleared by the
Impaired Physicians' Committee.

101
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,304
He never once tested
positive for drugs.

102
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,531
I don't believe he
compromised patient care.

103
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,539
I'm not sure that that matters.

104
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,879
The state board posts a bad-doctor list
on their website, and Clemente's on it.

105
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:31,507
- Any idiot with a computer has access.
- Doesn't give them legal cause.

106
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:35,383
Let's let the lawyers determine that. In
the meantime, the board feels let down.

107
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,117
They expect their chief of staff to
exercise the utmost discretion in hiring.

108
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,388
I needed an Attending, Donald. I
hired the best doctor I could find.

109
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,158
Even when you knew his
history? What happened in Newark?

110
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,395
I'm tired of hearing about Newark.
That was a very complicated situation.

111
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,404
Very unclear. There were lots
of unsubstantiated allegations.

112
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,237
- You should have kept your eye on him.
- You know, I'm not down there, Donald.

113
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,072
I don't run the ER anymore.

114
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,737
Which leads me
to a second issue.

115
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:05,408
The board has concerns about Dr. Kovac's
ability to manage the department.

116
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,348
You're not serious.

117
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,013
Are you satisfied with
the job he's doing?

118
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:16,219
He's doing the best he
can with what he has.

119
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,029
Keep him on 100
percent. Six of Pavulon.

120
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,429
I gave him Norcuron.

121
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,538
Fine. Dopamine
to a systolic of 100.

122
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,765
- Did you call the ICU?
- Ten minutes ago.

123
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:33,539
Okay, fine. Let's find him a
monitored bed until we get a room.

124
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,381
I'll put him in 2.

125
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,722
Cold shoulder, huh?

126
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,761
Well, not exactly the
answer I was hoping to hear.

127
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,627
Well, not exactly the best
proposal I've ever heard.

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,098
How many have you heard?

129
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:00,096
Hey, hey, hey. Okay, so you
don't know what you want this to be.

130
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,607
I don't wanna get married for the
sake of getting married. I tried that.

131
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,804
- Don't we love each other?
- It's not about that. Of course we do.

132
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,313
Don't you think we should
stay together forever?

133
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:14,477
I don't know if anybody should, or can...
- Paging Dr. Lockhart.

134
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:19,256
I just... Let me get through one
humongous life change at a time, okay?

135
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,424
Luka, got a minute?

136
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,029
Yeah.

137
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,996
Sometimes it's easier if
you lump them all together.

138
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,807
- Hey.
- Hey.

139
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,775
- How's the hip?
- Good, thanks. Better all the time.

140
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,278
Looks like you'll be short
an Attending after all.

141
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,976
I have to attend an emergency
Med Exec Committee meeting.

142
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,680
Risk Management is coming to
advise us on the Clemente situation.

143
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,814
What situation? He's gone.

144
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:56,118
Well, there's potential litigation.
We're getting some heat about it.

145
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,129
We are getting some heat?

146
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,864
It's your department.

147
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,160
Kerry, he was your hire.

148
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,497
He was on staff before
I moved up to this job.

149
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,867
Yeah, I know that, I'm
the one who moved you up.

150
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,373
So, what, I should
have fired him sooner?

151
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,476
The warning signs were
there. You had the authority.

152
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,278
Am I gonna lose
my job over this?

153
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,216
Look, all I'm saying is,
if I weren't chief of staff...

154
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,515
I'm not so sure you'd
be department head.

155
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,854
So let's just get
through this, okay?

156
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,528
Neela.

157
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,736
You know, I'm not
used to getting stood up.

158
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,569
I'm not going, Greg.

159
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,806
It's gonna be fine, I promise.

160
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:47,878
Well, going means saying goodbye,
and saying goodbye means forgetting.

161
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,009
It doesn't have to.

162
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,214
I can't help it.

163
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:59,087
It's started already. I can't
remember his hands, his voice.

164
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,260
Can I come in?

165
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,261
I keep asking myself
why he went back.

166
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,831
It's like a hammer in my head.

167
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,434
He did what he wanted to do.

168
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,440
What he needed to do.

169
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,412
It's not a bad way to go.

170
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,714
He was 29 years old, Greg.

171
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,379
He was blown up by a bomb.

172
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,790
It's a tragedy, and believe
me, I'm not saying it isn't...

173
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:39,262
but Michael, he wanted to be a
part of something bigger than himself.

174
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,297
Now, two months ago, I
would have laughed at that.

175
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,301
But now...

176
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:50,141
Look, he put himself out there, and
sometimes that means taking risks...

177
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,372
and doing things that you could
never imagine yourself doing...

178
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,016
because you have
this crazy idea that...

179
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,483
you just might be able
to make a difference.

180
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:06,816
Nobody wants to forget Michael.

181
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,462
We all wanna remember him.

182
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,599
And that's exactly
what today is all about.

183
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,905
Smart, uh, efficient, um...

184
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,113
- Loyal friend.
- Something sexier.

185
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,809
- Sexier?
- Something about my charm.

186
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,616
Like a man whose
charm with women...

187
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,850
is matched only by his sensitivity
to his patients. Yes, action.

188
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,324
This is stupid. Forget it.

189
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,463
- What? Abs, this is it.
- Don't call me Abs.

190
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,498
I am out of here. You're not
gonna have Archie to kick around.

191
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,135
- Abs?
- Can't blame a guy for wanting memories.

192
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,704
You're not going to Kilimanjaro. You're
going to Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.

193
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,364
- Seven city blocks from here.
- Six and a half.

194
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,636
Besides, people don't make memory
videos unless they're getting married.

195
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,713
- I'm a sentimental guy.
- And they don't film them themselves...

196
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,043
so the person is held
hostage to say nice things.

197
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:08,211
Really? You didn't seem held hostage.
I expected better material out of you.

198
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,653
Well, you were feeding
me the lines, Fassbinder.

199
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,224
Oh, what was that? Some
kind of nasty Croatian word?

200
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,693
- Something about me and a goat?
- This is Timmy Jankowski.

201
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,697
Overindulged at the buffet
at his school's spring pageant.

202
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,400
Let me guess. Fruit salad.

203
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,402
You must be the funny guy.

204
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,364
School nurse brought him in.

205
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,476
As this is my last day, and seeing that I
am chief resident, I designate Lockhart.

206
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,578
- Excuse me?
- I'm out of here in 10 hours.

207
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,580
I call no kids for the duration. I'm
sick of getting bit, kicked and pissed on.

208
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,411
Guess you stopped
dating too, huh?

209
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,578
We got a 71-year-old male found
slumped over in a parked car. GCS, 224.

210
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:47,523
Okay, put him in Curtain 1. I'll try to
be right back. Take it easy, Timmy.

211
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:52,223
Easy? I'm a freaking strawberry.

212
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,527
- Stomach hurts pretty bad, huh?
- Kind of.

213
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,501
Hm. Well... Here.

214
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,737
Try pinching yourself.

215
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,278
- Here, let me do it.
- Ow! That hurts.

216
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,245
Well, you're not thinking about
your stomach now, are you?

217
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,819
When Mitch didn't show up
for the bus trip to Bloomington...

218
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,454
we knew something was wrong.

219
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,888
- They're part of the same church group.
- Mitch. Mitch, can you wake up for me?

220
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,430
We prayed and prayed, and
then we started seeing things.

221
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,158
- Everybody thought he was dead.
- But we found him.

222
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,965
- Our visions led us right to him.
- A half a mile from the church.

223
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,404
- Can you save him?
- We're gonna do our best.

224
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,567
Oh, thank you.

225
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,737
And, uh...

226
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,782
You should be very, very
proud, Mr. and Mrs. Morris.

227
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:52,289
Okay, cut. Mama Morris is dead,
so can we take that one more time?

228
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,424
- Holly says they need us in Exam 3.
- Holly?

229
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,486
You know, that other nurse.

230
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,565
Haleh? I gotta go.

231
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,929
The old lady in 3's still
waiting on her rectal.

232
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,095
No, no, no. Not on my last
day. No rectals, no geezers.

233
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,264
Any patients you're
willing to examine?

234
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,103
Yeah, hot chicks.

235
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,171
I got the vitals like you
asked, on the medium timer.

236
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,282
Mediastinum. Mediastinal mass.

237
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,110
Whatever. Had to pry her cell
phone off her ear to check her temp.

238
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,221
- Mary...
- She thinks I'm a bitch...

239
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,017
but this is a hospital,
we've got a job to do.

240
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,524
Did you write this? BP, 28/17?

241
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,691
- Did I do it wrong?
- 28/17 is practically dead...

242
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,527
not eating Jell-O or
chatting on your cell phone.

243
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,965
Sorry, I'm new to this.

244
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,863
Is that her? MARY: Yeah.

245
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,372
- She look dead to you?
- Not right now.

246
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,979
Before you take more, you need to
know what's normal and what's not.

247
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,376
And if you're not sure,
then get some help, okay?

248
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:52,508
- Okay.
- Let's see what we got in here.

249
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,979
- Hey, what do you have?
- Obtunded with bradycardia.

250
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:00,217
I need 0.5 of atropine, CBC,
Chem-7, ABG, tox screen...

251
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,225
and set up for
transcutaneous pacing.

252
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,859
- Okay, got it.
- No gag, I have to tube him.

253
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,727
- What happened?
- Eight-oh and a Mac 2.

254
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,869
He must have passed
out at the wheel.

255
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,733
Not from drinking.
He's not like that.

256
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,405
Atropine's in.

257
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,351
Have another dose
ready. I need suction.

258
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,537
- Is he taking any medications?
- Maybe.

259
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,244
- Maybe something for his pressure.
- Yes.

260
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,934
Right? Pressure. HELEN: Yeah.

261
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,415
I'm in.

262
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,518
Heart rate's down to 38.

263
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,746
Damn it, his IV blew.
We lost the pulse.

264
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,890
Start compressions,
he needs to be paced.

265
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,753
You know CPR, right?

266
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,087
- Uh, yeah, a little.
- Good, go.

267
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,664
So how did you
audition for this role?

268
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,530
I didn't. I wanted
to be the bad bunny.

269
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:47,265
I wanted to be the Cowardly Lion
once, but I had to play a Munchkin.

270
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,306
They cast you as a Munchkin?

271
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,103
It was before my growth spurt.

272
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,704
Okay, no tenderness,
guarding or rebound.

273
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,441
Think you could eat a
Popsicle, help settle things down?

274
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,610
- Sure.
- I'll get it. Let me guess. Strawberry?

275
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,190
Ah, and here comes our
trusty paramedic, Brian Dumar...

276
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,349
wheeling in another
needy patient.

277
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,519
Twenty-eight-year-old, blunt head
trauma, altered LOC, vitals stable.

278
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,255
Bitch-sucker. Rabid
dog, I'll send you to hell!

279
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,491
Nasty fight in detention.
Partner's behind me.

280
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,226
- Okay, Trauma 2. Ray will be right there.
- What?

281
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,135
- No prisoners, man. I called it, last day.
- I'll send you all to hell!

282
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,766
- You kiss your cellmate with that mouth?
- I'm right here, you dumb bastard!

283
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:28,813
That opened up a recent surgical
scar. BP, 124/78, pulse, 98.

284
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,973
- Your belly hurt?
- Hey, put me with him.

285
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,483
- Nice to see you.
- Recovering from an appendectomy.

286
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,521
Must have ripped open his stitches.
- Okay... Oh, yuck.

287
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,815
Yeah, that's not good.

288
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,960
Dr. Ray Barnett
will be right with you.

289
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,760
- How long do I have to keep this up?
- Epi infusion, 10 mics per minute.

290
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,298
He's very healthy, Mitch is.

291
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,044
- I ain't going anywhere!
- Even virile.

292
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,503
- Okay, tell me. ABBY:
Bradycardic arrest.

293
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,469
No response to atro,
no capture with pacing.

294
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,164
I'm behind you, you bastard!

295
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,310
- What are you doing?
- CPR.

296
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,344
You can't possibly hope to
perfuse the brain that way.

297
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,880
- Fuse the what?
- Okay, step back.

298
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,881
Step back.

299
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,883
- Who is she?
- Who are you?

300
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:10,649
That's Mary. She's an EMT trainee.
She's shadowing the nurses today.

301
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,487
Then you should be showing
her the right way to do things.

302
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,859
Okay, Mary, I'm Dr. Kovac.

303
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,363
I'm the Attending physician and
the ER chief, so let me train you a bit.

304
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,526
Hundred times a minute, and you
should really compress the chest.

305
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,150
There'll be a military
honor as requested.

306
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,719
I didn't request that.

307
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,023
Colonel and Mrs. Gallant
requested it, ma'am.

308
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,691
Sounds like something
he might want.

309
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,487
After the ceremony, we'll head
out to the reception in Lincoln Park.

310
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,528
Canapés will be served.

311
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,403
- Bed will be ready in half an hour.
- Sedation's off. He's trying to extubate.

312
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,377
Give him a few minutes, then
you can pull it and send him up.

313
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,413
- Hey, Luka, can I get a minute?
- Sure.

314
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,420
His heart's beating
well now. It looks good.

315
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:17,421
You hear, Mitch? You're okay.

316
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:22,260
- Probably took too many pills by accident.
- Oh, he gets confused sometimes.

317
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,556
Can we go now? Take him home?

318
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,063
No, probably not
for a couple of days.

319
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,061
Something the matter?

320
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,604
There's something
bad here, I can feel it.

321
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,902
Yeah. Heh-heh. I
feel that every day.

322
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,437
Is everything all
right with your baby?

323
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,113
It's fine.

324
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,753
Are you a believer, dear?

325
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,489
You must be very brave, then.

326
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,418
I could never have brought
a child into this world...

327
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,222
if I didn't have faith...

328
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,958
- In a higher power.
- In a higher power.

329
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,965
Amen.

330
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,601
I'm sorry about in there.

331
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,139
You're a senior nurse, I expect you
to know what's going on around you.

332
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,709
I want you to be
exact about meds.

333
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,473
I know, it's... I guess that that
girl is kind of dragging me down.

334
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,641
I'm sure you'll
whip her into shape.

335
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,312
My bad, I guess. He
sure is a gloomy Gus.

336
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,424
Needs to lighten
up a bit, doesn't he?

337
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,986
It's his department.

338
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,290
Hey, Sam, you got a minute?
I may have to tube this guy.

339
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,664
- I need you to draw up induction meds.
- Steve's here?

340
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,364
Yeah, he got in a little jail-yard
altercation, but he's okay.

341
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,804
Belly's benign. Looks
like superficial dehiscence.

342
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:43,999
Does he need anything?

343
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,272
Look, I'll get somebody else
to redress the wounds, okay?

344
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,507
I'll get you a CPR
dummy, okay? After this.

345
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,618
You can practice
compressions in the lounge.

346
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,653
I think I've had enough
CPR for one day.

347
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,689
GCS is 11, and
resps are shallow.

348
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,623
Sometimes, if you hit your
head, you can stop breathing.

349
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,524
- So then you do mouth-to-mouth?
- No.

350
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,029
We put a tube in his
trachea and breathe for him.

351
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,396
This is vec. It knocks him out
so we can do the intubation.

352
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,408
- 132/84.
- Good.

353
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,470
Pulse ox is up to 99.

354
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,546
Excellent. Let's lay off the
tube for now, he's doing okay.

355
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,377
Doc, how long I gotta wait
on Miss Congeniality here?

356
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,213
He needs to be
admitted for observation.

357
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,410
Jerk-off.

358
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,821
Come on, Hendricks,
we're missing lunch.

359
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,892
- Gumbo Thursday.
- Hey.

360
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,688
As long as they're here,
they're patients, not prisoners.

361
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,855
Sorry, but they're
always our prisoners.

362
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,368
Been a while since I seen that.

363
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:46,397
- What?
- Compassion.

364
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,869
Flank party.

365
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,563
Ready.

366
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,237
Ready, aim, fire.

367
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,806
Ready, aim, fire.

368
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,908
Ready, aim, fire.

369
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,337
Neela, it is too
dangerous over there.

370
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,905
It's too dangerous for me, but it's
okay for you? What a load of crap.

371
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:58,909
- Neela, I am a soldier, remember?
- You're also a husband, remember that?

372
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,849
Seems kind of silly now, but out
in the bay this morning, I was, uh...

373
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,532
I was thinking
about asking you out.

374
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,530
I was thinking of saying yes.

375
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,521
Ready, face.

376
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,551
You better come back.
You know that, don't you?

377
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,753
Yeah, I will.

378
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,397
You ready?

379
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,560
Goodbye, Michael.

380
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,900
- How am I doing?
- Your CT's normal.

381
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,269
But it looks like you'll
be spending the night.

382
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,774
Lucky me.

383
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,436
Yeah, well, you've got a
standard-issue jump suit...

384
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,105
an armed guard, and
a major head injury.

385
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:22,585
- You're not the luckiest guy in the world?
- Yeah. Could be worse, could be dead.

386
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,724
No arguing that.
Dead would be bad.

387
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,756
Hey, it's the other
guy who started it.

388
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,252
Is that so? RAFE: Yeah.

389
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,897
I've made mistakes, but
that guy's a wrong number.

390
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,733
I'd stay away from him.

391
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,497
Thanks for the advice. I'm gonna
go check on the guy in Sutures.

392
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,733
- Does he get a bandage on that?
- Just a little Neosporin. Oh...

393
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,708
- And we're gonna need some urine.
- I'll check his vitals.

394
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,075
You said every 30
minutes. It's been 35.

395
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:53,450
- I'm not peeing in front of everyone.
- Use the screen.

396
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,752
Hey. SAM: What's going on?

397
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,621
- I'm getting to be like a regular.
- Leave the nurse alone.

398
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,127
It's all right. We
know each other.

399
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,461
- What is that?
- It's called a moist-to-dry dressing.

400
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,570
We soak gauze in saline,
then pack it in the wound.

401
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,797
Ooh. Ooh.

402
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:19,309
- How'd you do this?
- Jerk tried to shiv me.

403
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,777
What, Bible group
got out of hand, huh?

404
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,677
He was trying to
snag my smokes, man.

405
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,977
These dudes will beef
it up over anything.

406
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,121
- Thought you were trying to turn around.
- I am, Sammy.

407
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,790
- I really am.
- Then you gotta stay out of trouble.

408
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,455
Hey, BP's 125 over...

409
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,994
Nice and easy, dumbass.

410
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,564
Pull the blinds, now.

411
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,965
- Are you out of your mind?
- Pull the blinds, bitch.

412
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,477
"Handsome. Sensitive.

413
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,510
Macho?"

414
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:04,816
- What is this macho?
- Thank you, Sveta, that's good.

415
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,358
- Dude, I slayed him.
- No, no, he's still moving. Look.

416
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,018
But I cut off his head.

417
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,994
Well, I got to the Oblivion Gate
long before you did anyway.

418
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,828
- Don't cheat, Jerry.
- I'm gonna move your old guy.

419
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,594
- The cops are coming.
- What for?

420
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,398
There was a missing-persons
report. I gotta follow it up.

421
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,838
- Who did the workup on migraine guy?
- Sam and Mary.

422
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,036
These vitals are completely
wrong. Where's Sam?

423
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,977
- In with prisoner number one.
- What?

424
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,984
Yeah, Steve and another guy came in.
I guess they had some sort of jail fight.

425
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,748
- Steve is here again?
- Mm-hm.

426
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:44,062
Here's how this is goes. You're gonna
walk us out like old Steve's going back.

427
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,222
This is it, Steve. You cross this
line, there's no stepping back.

428
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,730
They got me, Sam,
on all kinds of stuff.

429
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,568
You are such an idiot.

430
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,274
- I ain't getting out any time soon.
- That is what you deserve!

431
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,603
Hey, hey, kids. Can we
move this thing along?

432
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:02,270
If there's anything we haven't anticipated,
this is the time to mention it.

433
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,155
Hey, open up.

434
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:22,329
Um, just a second.

435
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,005
Come on.

436
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,308
- Hi.
- What's going on?

437
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:37,981
- Sit down.
- Come here.

438
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,679
Sit down, now.
Babe, tape him up.

439
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,154
No! No, don't shoot!

440
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,792
Luka!

441
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,757
Shut up, shut up. - Luka.

442
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,253
Stop!

443
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,796
- What was that?
- The crap you were gonna give Rafe.

444
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,700
Vec? You gave him vec?

445
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,777
Get me the ambu-mask.

446
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,649
- This thing?
- Yes.

447
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,415
That was vecuronium.

448
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,718
You were gonna give it
to Rafe. To knock him out.

449
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,260
- It paralyzes muscles, he's not breathing.
- Let's go, Sam.

450
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,850
He'll be paralyzed
for the next half hour.

451
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:27,263
Good.

452
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,230
His diaphragm
isn't working, okay?

453
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,098
- He's gonna asphyxiate.
- Not our problem.

454
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:35,572
Look, if you leave him here,
in five minutes, he'll be dead.

455
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,300
He needs to be
intubated, please.

456
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,807
You want a murder rap?
We're not killers, man.

457
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,745
Let me fix him up. I
swear, I promise you...

458
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,318
if you let me fix him up, I
will walk you right out of here.

459
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,514
Mary, go get the van.

460
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,886
- Curtis...
- Shut up, it's my call.

461
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,029
- We'll be right out.
- Hey.

462
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,635
Hi. Is the SonoSite in there?

463
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,670
- The ultrasound machine?
- Oh, I don't think so.

464
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:17,513
- Is something going on?
- They're about to do an intubation.

465
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,049
Who is? Kovac?

466
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,548
No. No, he went over to that
place where they do the head thingy.

467
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,691
- The head thingy? CT?
- The what?

468
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,691
CT? MARY: CT, yeah.

469
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,092
Oh, Exam 3. That's
where I saw it. Thanks.

470
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:39,167
Sitting Bull...

471
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,302
was facing terrible
odds against Custer.

472
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:47,546
He turned to his warriors and
said, "This is a good day to die."

473
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,744
That's how a
soldier has to think.

474
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,681
That's the kind of boy I raised.

475
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,929
Michael would want
you to have these.

476
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,393
To me, all they mean
is that he's dead.

477
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:12,234
- This is a hard time for all of us.
- How dare you.

478
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:16,431
How dare you stand
there and say that.

479
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,075
"A good day to die"?

480
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,612
I was explaining the
mindset of a warrior.

481
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,511
You could have kept him here.

482
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,742
- You could have saved him.
- Neela, sit down.

483
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,411
But instead, you made
him want to go back.

484
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,353
For what?

485
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,857
Because there was
something noble in it?

486
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,963
Why did you do that?

487
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:42,465
When it would have been just
as easy to convince him to stay...

488
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,263
for a much better reason:

489
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,996
Because we loved him.

490
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,169
Because we loved him.

491
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,474
Neela, come on. Let's
go for a walk, okay?

492
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,158
I can't see anything.

493
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,894
- Stick the damn thing in and let's go.
- It doesn't work like that.

494
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:17,366
- Luka, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- He can hear you?

495
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,698
He's paralyzed, but
he can hear and feel.

496
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,772
Come on, she's
waiting for us out there.

497
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,568
Come on, Sammy, we gotta go.

498
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,867
Steve, why did
you do this to me?

499
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:29,038
It was his idea, I swear.

500
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,410
Are we going together
or am I leaving you here?

501
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,848
One more try, okay?

502
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,026
- Enough. Grab her and let's go.
- Yeah.

503
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,495
- Put your hand...
- What?

504
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,658
Put your hand right here on his
Adam's apple. Yes, push on that.

505
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,730
Through the cords.

506
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,239
Okay. Okay.

507
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,006
Squeeze this bag. Squeeze
it just like that, okay?

508
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,241
- I swear to God, right now. Right now!
- No.

509
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,851
Come on.

510
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:16,056
Thank God. Thank
God. I'm so sorry... Ow!

511
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:19,426
- He still needs help breathing.
- Too bad for him.

512
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,771
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Morris, I'll help you in a second.

513
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,498
- Let me get Steve off.
- Hold it.

514
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,409
You have a missing
person. An old guy?

515
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,273
Mitch Keely? We
need to talk to him.

516
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,141
He was moved. Do
you know where he is?

517
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,749
No, I'm not sure. You might
wanna check in Sutures.

518
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,254
Sutures? Didn't you
just come from there?

519
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,515
Oh... Yeah.

520
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,452
You know what? Ask at the
front desk, they'll help you.

521
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,464
- Thanks.
- So back to the joint, huh?

522
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,263
- Yeah, I'm a quick healer.
- Where's your fight-club buddy?

523
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,663
They took him up to
the ward for observation.

524
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:37,799
Okay.

525
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,481
Well, nice to see you again.

526
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,980
Watch your back.

527
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,713
Let's go another way.

528
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,817
This way's fastest.
That's what you said.

529
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,456
But there's cops now.

530
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,525
Well, if we'd split right away,
we'd be on the Dan Ryan by now.

531
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,491
Hey, Steve, we
could just turn around.

532
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:00,189
We're only 30 seconds from
freedom. We are not pussing out now.

533
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,927
And no more smoke
signals from you. Got it?

534
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,496
Hey, Sam, you gotta
fill out the discharge.

535
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,837
Admin says we gotta be really
tight about prisoner paperwork.

536
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,003
Check in Sutures. I think
I might have left it in there.

537
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:18,976
Okay, Abigail?

538
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,555
Something's wrong.

539
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,595
- Something's wrong.
- Hey, sheriff, hold up.

540
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,699
Hey. Hey, bring it
back here a minute.

541
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,145
Come on!

542
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,749
Get in!

543
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,718
- What the hell happened?
- Get in!

544
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:40,457
Steve, just go! Stop! Just go!
Think about Alex. Steve, stop.

545
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,965
I already did.

546
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,570
- Alex!
- Get back!

547
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,666
Go!

548
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:01,711
Damn it.

549
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,121
If you're good to walk, move
out into the bay. The ER is closed.

550
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:20,602
Emergency, emergency. We
got shots fired by and at police.

551
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,764
I got officers down
at County General.

552
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:26,241
If you got someone hurt by you
or if you're hurt, give us a sign.

553
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,607
- We can move people.
- Vehicle heading north...

554
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,578
from the hospital on Franklin.

555
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,183
- You okay, honey?
- I think so.

556
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,344
- Is this okay?
- Please. Need a doc here.

557
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,917
Hey, buddy.

558
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,924
- Do you know what day it is? Neck.
- Axilla too.

559
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,155
Can we get a gurney
in here, please?

560
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,765
- Airway's okay.
- Pulse thready.

561
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,958
Page Surgery. You're
gonna be fine, all right?

562
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:53,128
Yeah, he's coming this way.
He's pretty bad. We'll take care of it.

563
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,364
Hey, find Kovac. Jerry's hurt.

564
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,937
- It's hard to breathe.
- He saved me.

565
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,146
- I almost got shot.
- Zadro, get a gurney.

566
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,314
Wow. Getting shot sucks.

567
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,510
Here. JERRY: Ow!

568
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,745
Is that better?

569
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,049
- Thanks, kid.
- Right, set up for a chest tube.

570
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:17,093
- O2, 100 percent nonrebreather.
- Radial pulse strong. You're good, Jerry.

571
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,788
- Jerry, man, what'd you do?
- I'm a big target.

572
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,567
Oh, tell Frank I can't cover
for him on Friday, okay?

573
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,245
- This is on you, man.
- Just shut up. Shut up.

574
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,581
- Keep driving.
- Where to?

575
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,256
Put some distance between us.

576
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,585
- We'll figure it out later.
- We need to figure...

577
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:48,988
Just shut the hell up.

578
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:52,694
You probably killed someone
back there, Steve. One of my friends.

579
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,464
I thought you said you
were turning yourself around.

580
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,534
I've been praying, Sam.

581
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,568
And asking God to
make me a better man.

582
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:03,065
And it took a while, but he
finally started talking back.

583
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,442
That's not God.

584
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,540
He said losing you
was where I went wrong.

585
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:13,282
Everything would be right in my
garden if I could only get my family back.

586
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,115
Did he tell you
to do it with guns?

587
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,786
Curtis. Steve Curtis.

588
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,451
He's down to 80 systolic.

589
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,460
The other one, I don't
know. There's a chart.

590
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,460
- Where's Sam? Have you talked to her?
- We haven't located your nurse yet.

591
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,159
We're still looking.

592
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,369
- I'll be right back.
- Lot of pressure here, pal.

593
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,066
Ah! Oh, man,
I'm not liking that.

594
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,743
You had to go and get shot. I was
three hours away from a clean getaway.

595
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,280
- I can't find it.
- Keep looking.

596
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,815
They taking him up to Surgery?

597
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,783
He arrested after the
thoracotomy. They're not optimistic.

598
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,446
- I can't do this.
- He's a big man. Go supraclavicular.

599
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:55,219
- Supraclavicular?
- Ray, sew this in for me.

600
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,795
The junction of the subclavian
and the IJ is a bigger target.

601
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,827
- Are you okay, Abby?
- Yeah, I'm just, um...

602
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,701
I'm all dizzy. I hit my head.
I'll prime the rapid infuser.

603
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,639
Enter at the clavisternomastoid
angle. And, bingo, we're in.

604
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,204
Ladokern Pharmaceuticals
is gonna be lucky to have you.

605
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:20,978
Ray, did Luka take
your cop up to the O.R.?

606
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,122
I haven't seen him. I
thought he was with you.

607
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,519
Is this something
I never get over?

608
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,215
No.

609
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,794
This is something you find a place
to put and let it make you stronger.

610
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,857
Then you go on living your life,
because that's all you can do.

611
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,793
That's the way he
would have wanted it.

612
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,282
I think there's something
going on at the hospital.

613
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,283
- Dropped his pressure.
- How you doing?

614
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,945
Time for you to say
something intended to be funny.

615
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,622
- Got to be bleeding in the belly.
- Belly is clear.

616
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,887
- Well, we're missing something.
- Units three and four going up.

617
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,662
- He needs a second chest tube.
- First one's in a good position.

618
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,462
- He had less than 500 cc's out.
- There's more in there.

619
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,128
- I don't see a hemothorax.
- They wouldn't let us down.

620
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,171
- What the hell happened?
- The O.K. Corral.

621
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,139
Oh, my God. Jerry.

622
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:27,776
- Any free fluid? RAY:
He may need a CT.

623
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,413
- It's not the belly.
- Morris.

624
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,014
Dr. Weaver, look at the film.

625
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,742
The right hemithorax is
slightly opaque. That's blood.

626
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,853
Don't see an air-fluid
level because he's flat.

627
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,013
- The first tube should've drained it.
- Not if it's kinked or clotted.

628
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,557
Oh. Oh...

629
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:45,488
- Okay. Over a liter in the chest.
- Where's another Thora-Seal?

630
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,462
- Next door, I think. ABBY:
All right. Be right back.
