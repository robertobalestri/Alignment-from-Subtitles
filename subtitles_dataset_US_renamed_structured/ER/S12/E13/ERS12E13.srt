1
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,117
You can't be out here.

2
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,989
Sir?

3
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,182
Sir, it's not safe, sir.

4
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,658
Sir, you can't be here.

5
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,056
Sir?

6
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,502
They found some guy
wandering and disoriented.

7
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,665
- Just what we need, another lost soul.
- You can never have enough.

8
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,538
Nate Lennox, 54, medic
alert bracelet says he has ALS.

9
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:21,079
Paralyzed and unresponsive. He
rolled out on to the ice at Prospect Rink.

10
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,511
Was somebody with him?

11
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,050
I called the number on
the bracelet, left a message.

12
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,050
Mr. Lennox, can you hear me?

13
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,348
- How'd he get out of the house?
- Good question.

14
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,014
Do you think he was abandoned?

15
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,923
Somebody's taking care of him. He's got
clean clothes, had a shave this morning.

16
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,529
Pulse ox is only 89.

17
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,893
Let's get him on five
liters by a mask. Okay.

18
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:42,434
- I'm gonna need some lifting help.
- Let's leave him in the chair for now.

19
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,971
If we lay him down, it might compress
his lungs, might make things worse.

20
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,699
Okay, crackles bilaterally.

21
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,471
CBC, chem panel
and a portable chest.

22
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,274
Let's call for his
old medical records.

23
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,780
Whoa, hey, hey.

24
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,681
- Hey, did you hit the joystick?
- No.

25
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,085
Okay, sats are up to 92.

26
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,490
Have RT induce a sputum
for a Gram's stain and culture.

27
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,459
Whoa, hey.

28
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,729
- Don't do that.
- I didn't touch it.

29
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,333
Is there a short or something?

30
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,634
I think the computer has an eye
sensor that's controlling the chair.

31
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,573
- I think he wants to get out of here.
- Probably altered from too low oxygen.

32
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,078
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
disconnect the battery. Hold on.

33
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,613
Need a hand?

34
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,411
ALS with pneumonia.
Could use a Hep-Lock.

35
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,076
What's his name?

36
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,516
Nate Lennox.

37
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,519
I've seen him
before, a while back.

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,094
No help. Don't.

39
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:47,826
- He did that with his eyes?
- Looks like a speech-synthesizer program.

40
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,130
It's okay now, sir. We're
gonna take care of you.

41
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,101
Want out. Please, let me out.

42
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,937
Please, let me out.

43
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,365
Okay, sir, we're gonna
sit you forward now.

44
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,563
Sats are still borderline.

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,471
I'm not sure how aggressive
we need to be with this guy.

46
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,304
Is he a DNR?

47
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,037
If I were like that, I
sure as hell would be.

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,151
Mr. Lennox, your
oxygen levels are falling.

49
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,514
Do you understand?

50
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,526
We need to know your
wishes about resuscitation.

51
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,161
Okay.

52
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,435
- Home.
- Does that mean...

53
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,097
you don't want heroic measures?
- Home.

54
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:39,979
If you stop breathing, do you want
us to use a machine, a ventilator?

55
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,242
Hungry. Food.

56
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,512
Do you have a living will?
An advanced directive?

57
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:53,860
- Drugstore.
- I don't think we're getting through.

58
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,086
Do you know where you are?

59
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,265
I have amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis.

60
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,132
Also known as Lou
Gehrig's disease.

61
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,173
It is a progressive degenerative
neurologic disorder...

62
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,310
that has weakened my muscles.

63
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,605
All of my senses are intact.

64
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,044
- My mind is clear.
- Not today, it isn't.

65
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,309
Got his old records.

66
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,983
We need the name of his neurologist.
Maybe he'll know what to do with this.

67
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,885
You want me to up his oxygen?

68
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,027
I'm gonna say let's go with BiPAP. It'll
buy us time without having to intubate.

69
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,595
I knew he looked familiar.

70
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,493
- What?
- He should already be on BiPAP.

71
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,897
Neela and I treated him a year ago.
He came in for shortness of breath.

72
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,332
<i>Every time you have a thought...</i>

73
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,666
every time...

74
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,738
you take a breath...

75
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:47,244
every time you move a muscle...

76
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:51,579
every time you take a crap...

77
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,754
you should thank your ATP.

78
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,358
AT... ATP.

79
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,431
Oxidative phosphorylation...

80
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,077
The bedpan may
distort things a little.

81
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,777
Oh, boy.

82
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:31,789
The kids at school are
gonna make fun of me.

83
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,452
- It's too tight?
- No, it's fine.

84
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,131
It's like an oven in here.

85
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,029
I'm sorry, they're
working on the a.c.

86
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,863
So hot.

87
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,273
The BiPAP increases
your tidal volume.

88
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,706
Your neurologist says it'll give you
more energy and a longer survival.

89
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,106
That's great news.

90
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,976
Sam, labs were hemolyzed
on your heat-stroke guy.

91
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,980
- I'll be right back.
- I'll wait here. Ha.

92
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,676
I should have another listen.

93
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,417
Where did you go to med school?

94
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,495
Uh, right here.

95
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:15,693
I was a biochemistry major at
Yale, so I placed out of your class.

96
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,098
Yale? Oh.

97
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,171
I worked in Sandra
Hamilton's lab...

98
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,205
- senior year.
- Yeah, I know it.

99
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,170
We were in awe of your
work on anti-sense RNA.

100
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:32,376
I cited your studies in my paper on
gene inactivation in <i>Trypanosoma brucei.</i>

101
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:37,252
You published as
an undergraduate?

102
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,223
Second author.

103
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,522
Impressive.

104
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:47,229
So, what are you doing
here in this, uh, cesspool?

105
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,531
Are you just here
for the big bucks?

106
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,107
What is it gonna be?

107
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:01,479
Orthopedics? Plastic surgery?

108
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,383
Neither. I can't stand surgeons.

109
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,784
They're arrogant workaholics
who can't relate to people...

110
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,253
unless they're asleep.

111
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,892
Sorry, Nate, the car overheated
and I had to take the el.

112
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,290
What happened?

113
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,830
- I'm fine.
- He had some shortness of breath.

114
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,900
- I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
- Oh, Fran Bevens.

115
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,330
Did you reach Dr. Ames?

116
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,993
- He's already been down.
- Okay.

117
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,631
He's consulting a
speech pathologist.

118
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,508
- Good.
- Not good.

119
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,237
I don't need it.

120
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,780
It's getting hard to
understand what you're saying.

121
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,912
Maybe they should
start listening better.

122
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,088
Hello, Fran. FRAN:
Jared, it's good to see you.

123
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,593
Ready to start?

124
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:55,326
- I'm trying to contain my enthusiasm.
- How long are you guys gonna be?

125
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,993
- Half an hour.
- Fifteen minutes.

126
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,537
We'll be back with your
aftercare instructions.

127
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:05,043
You think about
what you're doing.

128
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,318
You may realize
you don't belong here.

129
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:19,117
- Where does he think you belong?
- At Jumbo Mart. He misses my slushies.

130
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,419
Please be kind.

131
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,894
Hey, severe sunburn. Dispo if the
pain is down with Toradol and aloe.

132
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,762
- Not too bad.
- Soft rule out going to tele.

133
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,096
- Excellent.
- And this guy's with his PMD.

134
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,206
- So there's nothing for you to do.
- Lennox? Is that Nate Lennox?

135
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,602
The biochemistry professor.

136
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,710
- No, wait, I've got one more.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.

137
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,307
Nate.

138
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,473
Do you like my new look?

139
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,778
Well, not a lot of
people could pull that off.

140
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,580
- Good to see you, Abby.
- Hi, Fran.

141
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,382
What you doing?

142
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,321
Playing "Medal of Honor."

143
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,587
I just killed a couple of Nazis.

144
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:00,166
His facial muscles are weakening. He
needs to practice with assisted speech.

145
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,563
Hey, I've got a great idea.

146
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,931
Oops.

147
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,910
Well, we can wait on speech
therapy for the time being.

148
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,675
But I gotta tell you, Nate, you're
just putting off the inevitable.

149
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,512
- You need to start wearing this.
- Why?

150
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:24,021
Because it has your diagnosis on it,
and your name and your phone number.

151
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,852
We're lucky you
were in class today.

152
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,926
Otherwise, who knows
what might have happened.

153
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,957
Okay, okay.

154
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,127
How about this thing?

155
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,701
Do I have to wear
it all the time?

156
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,532
Well, we'll start
with bedtime use.

157
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:43,199
You'll get the benefits of eight
hours a night while you're asleep.

158
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,177
I keep waking up...

159
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,781
and something else is gone.

160
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,220
- Thank God for the bracelet.
- Is that comfortable?

161
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,392
Nate. Nate.

162
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,119
He was speaking with the
computer when he first came in.

163
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,535
We can't get an IV in him.

164
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,790
He always needs a central line.

165
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,998
He was at an ice rink?

166
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,636
Yeah, any idea why?

167
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,396
I don't know. It was
like any other day.

168
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,565
I got up, I shaved
him, bathed him.

169
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,576
Fed him breakfast and then
transferred him to the chair.

170
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,408
He was watching television,
so I went to take a quick nap.

171
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,810
How did he get outside?

172
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,679
Well, he can open the
front door with his computer.

173
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,480
Ray, ready to present?

174
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,316
Dr. Kovac?

175
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,817
- Fran Bevens.
- Hello. Hello, sir.

176
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,852
You saw him a few years ago.

177
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,997
Right, middle and
lower lobe infiltrates.

178
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:41,100
He's altered, borderline
oxygenation, even with BiPAP.

179
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,667
Can we have a word?

180
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,663
Yes, of course.

181
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,973
We need to make a decision
about intubating and ventilation.

182
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,947
You think he can get
over the pneumonia?

183
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,712
He could, or he could be intubated in
the ICU, going downhill for four weeks.

184
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,221
He hasn't got a lot of reserve.
There's no guarantee he'll get better.

185
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,384
This may be the natural
endpoint of his disease.

186
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,263
So maybe it's time to focus
on keeping him comfortable.

187
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,428
Fran, I just heard
you were here.

188
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,197
- Thank you for coming by.
- I've taken care of him before.

189
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,069
He decided to go out by himself.

190
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,612
Why did you do that, Nate?

191
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,508
- In motion.
- What's in motion?

192
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,647
Free.

193
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,393
- Pulse ox is down to 82.
- Yeah, what are you doing?

194
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,656
His lungs are full of junk, his sats
down, he needs to be intubated.

195
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,460
We've been just discussing
about how best to proceed.

196
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,160
Well, helping him breathe
would be a good way to start.

197
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,067
I don't think that
he'd want that, Abby.

198
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,508
- Abby...
- Yankauer.

199
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,112
We haven't come to a consensus.

200
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,584
- I'm not comfortable with this.
- I'm not intubating.

201
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,422
Large mucous plug at the cords.

202
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,149
- Okay, that should help.
- Temporarily.

203
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,658
Sats are coming up.

204
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,854
This will give us time to treat
him with oxygen and antibiotics...

205
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,193
until he's alert enough
to tell us what he wants.

206
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,195
Dr. Lennox?

207
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,828
Nate. Nate, talk to us.

208
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,878
Around and into the subclavian.

209
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,384
- Fluoro off. Okay, that's as far as we go.
- Ceftriaxone's ready.

210
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,546
- How'd he do?
- Well, we're starting the IV antibiotics.

211
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,386
- When did he last eat?
- I fed him this morning.

212
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,619
He needs some calories.

213
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,424
- How are you doing?
- You're in the hospital, Nate.

214
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,522
Nate?

215
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,538
You remember when we
talked about putting in a trach...

216
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,537
if you had trouble breathing?

217
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,535
You said you wanted to keep going
until they found a stem-cell cure.

218
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,237
Why don't we just let him rest?

219
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,576
Snowmobile versus tree.
Morris needs some help.

220
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,381
500 of azithro after the Rocephin.
- Got it.

221
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:19,423
Okay, we all need to agree on
this. You told me you wanted a trach.

222
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,152
That was a long time ago, Abby.

223
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:26,199
His biggest fear now is that
he'll end up on life-support...

224
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,564
aware of everything, but
with no way to communicate.

225
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,466
He was communicating
a half-hour ago.

226
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,606
That could have been
random eye movements.

227
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,607
- Four hundred cc's of Jevity?
- Yep.

228
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,244
So if we do the trach...?

229
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,750
He's out of here in a day. He can
go home with a portable ventilator.

230
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,117
You'd have to learn how to
suction and troubleshoot the vent.

231
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,986
But we can get you some
help. I know you're tired.

232
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,754
- He's the one who's tired.
- Fran...

233
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,488
I'm with him every
day, Abby. I know.

234
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,294
Looks like we got a
clogged G-tube here.

235
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,131
- Do you flush it with water?
- Yes, after every feeding.

236
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,740
He needs nutritional
support to fight off infection.

237
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,810
- It won't go.
- Do you know when the tube was put in?

238
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,277
- No, I...
- G-tube placed in May, 2002.

239
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,273
He came in after
a choking spell.

240
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,444
You know, each May, the
graduating medical students...

241
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,420
- vote for teacher of the year...
- I love the fresh flowers.

242
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,153
They must think it'll make up
for cutting back on my teaching.

243
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,456
But rather a scientist,
whose dynamism...

244
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,430
May I have a glass of
wine? Thanks very much.

245
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,932
Made a strong impression...

246
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,628
and stayed with the students
throughout their training.

247
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,399
It gives me great pleasure to present...
- What is it?

248
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,875
- The 2002 Teacher of the Year Award...
- Nate, Nate.

249
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,809
To Dr. Nathan Lennox.

250
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,347
Well, his chest x-ray is
negative for aspiration.

251
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,678
- You got lucky, Nate.
- Yeah.

252
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,014
I'm the luckiest man
on the face of the Earth.

253
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,520
It's time for a feeding tube.

254
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,157
No, it's not.

255
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,123
Well, your chewing and swallowing
muscles are getting pretty weak.

256
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,196
Fran will have to cut
my meat smaller...

257
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,525
- won't she?
- Takes him an hour to eat a meal.

258
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,966
- He's lost 10 pounds.
- More like 5. The rest is water weight.

259
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,766
Weight loss accelerates
the progression of ALS.

260
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,342
The extra calories from the tube
feeding will mean increased strength...

261
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,672
more energy and longer survival.

262
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,372
- I'll think about it.
- Romano around?

263
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:26,280
In the O.R. with a pneumonectomy, but
I'll see about getting you on the schedule.

264
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,943
I said, I'll think about it.

265
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,386
Well, we'll save you a
spot. We can always cancel.

266
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,560
- Good night.
- I'll walk out with you, Donald.

267
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,786
- I'll be right back.
- Night, guys. Been great.

268
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:40,161
- Tell them to send the trophy to my mom.
- Trophy?

269
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,826
I won the potato-sack
race at the County retreat.

270
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,032
Abby Lockhart around?

271
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,406
- No, not tonight.
- It's pretty quiet around here.

272
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,706
Well, sometimes it's slow.

273
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,579
It's not just that.

274
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,652
What, are you cutting
back on staff or something?

275
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,984
Well, one of our Attendings
died. Mark Greene.

276
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,250
A lot of people took off
to go to his memorial.

277
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,724
Chen wants you in Exam
3 with the belly-pain guy.

278
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,728
It's a slam-dunk
diverticulitis. I called Medicine.

279
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:16,336
- All she has to do is co-sign my chart.
- I'll let you tell her that yourself.

280
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,574
- What year of residency are you in?
- First. I'm an intern.

281
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:29,841
Ho-ho! Pretty cocky for
an intern, aren't you? Huh?

282
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,424
You're either real
smart or really insecure.

283
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,351
If I were you, I'd
put my money...

284
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,080
- on the first one.
- Of course, all the great minds...

285
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,282
wanna work in the County ER.

286
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,018
Actually, this is
just temporary.

287
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,164
I'm planning on moving
over to Northwestern soon.

288
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:50,296
- Congratulations. You got in, huh?
- Well, not yet, but believe me, I will.

289
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,233
Pre-op instructions
for the G-tube.

290
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,896
Okay, cool.

291
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,407
This is gonna show you everything
you need to know about the procedure.

292
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:02,811
Where to show up, what to eat
the night before, what to wear...

293
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,744
Um...

294
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,287
Are you okay?

295
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,651
Look, I know it's hard, but...

296
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,656
This isn't me. It's the disease.

297
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,786
Okay. The nerve deterioration
leads to pseudobulbar affect.

298
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,092
His emotions can
be very exaggerated.

299
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,098
Yeah, I see. FRAN: Okay.

300
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,462
It's called emotional
incontinence. It sucks.

301
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,509
You get a little upset about something,
and next thing, you're crying like a baby.

302
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,007
There has to be some
sort of medicine for that.

303
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,844
- He won't take them.
- Side effects are too much.

304
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,852
And it's the BDNF.

305
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:49,663
I've been injecting nerve growth
factor twice a day for a year.

306
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,327
The stuff turns ALS
mice into Olympic athletes.

307
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,869
- But human trials, worthless.
- Results haven't panned out in humans.

308
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,599
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- And now Fran has to pour...

309
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,709
Ensure in my stomach tube all day.
- It's no big deal. Come on.

310
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:10,043
- Shh. Come on, calm down.
- I didn't wanna be a burden on anyone.

311
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,742
Shh. Come on. Come on.

312
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:20,726
- Should this be hurting him?
- Maybe just a little. Okay, G-tube is in.

313
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,330
Balloon is up. Check the pump.

314
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,159
I think he's waking
up a little bit.

315
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,063
- Go ahead and set up for PFT's.
- Flow is looking good.

316
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,237
Thank you. RAY: Mm-hm.

317
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,873
All right, we need to
test his lung function.

318
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:40,002
Nate, I'm gonna put this in your
mouth and Sam's gonna pinch your nose.

319
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,238
Here we go.

320
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,747
Easy.

321
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,475
All right.

322
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,084
Easy, yeah.

323
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,087
Okay.

324
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,820
All right, deep breath in.

325
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,559
And blow it out,
blow it out, blow it out.

326
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,034
- Great.
- Forced vital capacity...

327
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,763
is 32 percent of normal.

328
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,374
He can move... I know.

329
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,067
Okay.

330
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,740
Nate?

331
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,947
Nate, your lung
capacity has deteriorated.

332
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:26,453
The best way to help your
breathing is for us to put in a trach.

333
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,690
You're gonna need assisted
ventilation. Do you want us to do it?

334
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,800
I'm not sure you'll
recover without it.

335
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:39,735
The trach is the best chance you
have of clearing up your pneumonia.

336
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,074
Nate.

337
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,607
Okay.

338
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,842
Okay.

339
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,448
- Call Surgery, he consented.
- I'm okay.

340
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,817
- Abby, I don't think that's what he meant.
- What?

341
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,652
He said, "Okay."

342
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,988
He said, "I'm okay" after that,
which could mean, leave him alone.

343
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,859
- It's not exactly informed consent.
- Nate.

344
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,664
You want the trach, don't you?

345
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:13,095
- You know, you all heard what he said.
- At a vital capacity of 30 percent...

346
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,673
some ALS patients
enter into hospice care.

347
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,604
- It means they have six months to live.
- His FVC is low because of pneumonia.

348
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,011
- Clear that, lung function will be back.
- Best-case scenario.

349
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:27,017
He expressed his wishes in advance. Now
he's too sick, can't give reliable consent.

350
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,121
- How's his PO2?
- I wanna do a trach.

351
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,417
- We have a consent issue.
- I explained the procedure to the patient.

352
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,288
I asked if he wanted it. He
said, "Okay," on his computer.

353
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,896
- He did?
- He also said, "I'm okay," after that.

354
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,793
I don't think that
he understood.

355
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,527
He was alert and looking at me
the entire time. He understood.

356
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,036
I really don't think that
this is what he wants.

357
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,906
Fran has a durable
power of attorney.

358
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,435
- Thank you.
- It's your call.

359
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,880
You know, with all due respect, I'm
sorry, but Nate expressed his wishes...

360
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,646
and I think we
have to go with that.

361
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,249
Well, if there's a chance that
he asked for the procedure...

362
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,158
I'm not sure that he did.

363
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,663
- I think we have to do it.
- Dr. Kovac...

364
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,427
Ray, I need you next door to
help me with a central line. Let's go.

365
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,036
- I'd like to page Dr. Ames.
- I'll try to find him.

366
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:23,233
And call Dubenko.

367
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,570
Put in the trach and
RT to set up a vent.

368
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,148
Between first and
second tracheal ring.

369
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,316
Close your eyes if
you're having any pain.

370
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,392
Doesn't look like
he's feeling anything.

371
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,156
Aspirate air, confirm you're in.
- Guidewire.

372
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,924
So you're in surgery now, Neela?

373
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,658
I'm just doing an elective.

374
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,800
Things change, right?

375
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,568
Certainly do.

376
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,263
Eleven French dilator.

377
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,669
Balloon's good to go.

378
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,400
I hope he's okay with this.

379
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,745
Well, it doesn't wanna pass.

380
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,848
A little more muscle.

381
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,446
You doing all right, Nate?

382
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:10,650
Okay, remove the dilator,
slide the trach tube in.

383
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,292
Mm. Bit of oozing here.

384
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,360
Pressure should
take care of that.

385
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,859
A little bleeding can be normal.

386
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,327
- Tachy at 130.
- I'll open up his fluids.

387
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,091
Is he okay?

388
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,760
He could be sensitive to the
blood loss. Let's take another look.

389
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,133
- Oh, my God. DUBENKO:
Pressure again, 10 blade.

390
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,330
What are you doing?

391
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,874
Converting to open
procedure. We need hemostasis.

392
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,305
Two units of packed cells.

393
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,307
Blood transfusion?

394
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:35,209
Just a precaution.
Call for type specific.

395
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,714
Sam, see if his antibody
screen's in the old chart.

396
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,818
- Abby, grab a Yankauer.
- What's happening?

397
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,045
- A minor complication.
- Doesn't look minor.

398
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,421
- Suction on high.
- Shouldn't have let you do this.

399
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,459
- Mosquito clamp.
- Antibody screens negative.

400
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,463
- He's in pain. Give him medication.
- Four of morphine.

401
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:57,034
- No morphine.
- Had a bad reaction in 2001...

402
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,122
- when he came with a broken wrist.
- The transgene will be suppressed.

403
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,799
Use two fluorescent
reporters with different spectra.

404
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,935
- Why two?
- One for our transfected cells.

405
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:08,173
And one for translational
fusion with the target gene.

406
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,839
- That's... That's brilliant.
- Well, it's simple.

407
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,008
I don't know if it's brill...

408
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,355
Four morphine.

409
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,925
- Get to work on the plasmid DNA vectors.
- Right now?

410
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,528
I don't want Gregorio
beating us to the Nobel Prize.

411
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:25,892
Right.

412
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:29,558
- You're not supposed to take the stairs.
- They were servicing the elevators.

413
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,000
- Wait for the next one. All right.
- We were late.

414
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,664
- I've canceled your morning classes.
- Don't be ridiculous. Why'd you do that?

415
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,174
I couldn't get a hold of
Baker. And he's the only one...

416
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,109
- Baker doesn't decide...
- What did he say?

417
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,148
He thinks it's time to
start using a wheelchair.

418
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,450
You've got to be kidding.

419
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,850
Weakness in your legs is progressing
to the point that it's not safe.

420
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:53,083
- Next time, you could break your hip.
- They have power wheelchairs.

421
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,521
Motorized scooters.

422
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,924
You'll still be
very independent.

423
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,530
Until my battery goes dead.

424
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,063
You won't be losing something.

425
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,701
You'll be conserving energy
so you can do more things.

426
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,303
You're trying to turn
me into an invalid.

427
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:11,369
People with degenerative
diseases do best when they have...

428
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,478
What? Hope?

429
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,472
Do you read the paper?

430
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,811
Bush just banned federal funding
for embryonic stem-cell research.

431
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,682
I am trying to hold
on to hope, doctor.

432
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,951
But nobody's
cooperating these days.

433
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,656
Well, Dr. Ames has some
papers on mobility assist devices...

434
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,629
I don't want them.

435
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,497
- I'll go pick them up. Thank you.
- Not for me.

436
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,604
Not for me.

437
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,905
Ow. Ooh.

438
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,479
So Fran drives you to
all your doctor visits?

439
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,980
Mostly, she just
drives me crazy.

440
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,314
- Ow, ow.
- How long have you been together?

441
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,450
We're not together.

442
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,588
- She works for me.
- Oh.

443
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,625
For some time now?

444
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,161
Fifteen years.

445
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,963
She was right out of college.

446
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:12,594
I needed an assistant who was on the
ball. She was ridiculously overqualified.

447
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:17,641
The thing that really surprised me
was that she stayed after that first year.

448
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,303
She could have gone to law
school, to business school.

449
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:25,846
- But I have to say, she stuck with me.
- She knows you pretty well.

450
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,351
And that's why I
assumed you guys...

451
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,682
No, no, no.

452
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,189
There was a point...

453
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,992
a million years ago...

454
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,394
when it almost happened.

455
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,840
But then I came to my senses.

456
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,176
You married?

457
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,709
Then you understand.

458
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,309
Who has time for family when
you're devoted to your work?

459
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,211
Well, some people
try for a balance.

460
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,013
Maybe if you're an ER doc.

461
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:07,088
But if you're trying to push back
the frontiers of science, it's 24/7.

462
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,891
Right.

463
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,056
It's not bad to be
married to your career.

464
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,169
My career's a good companion.

465
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,039
Never nags me.

466
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,006
- Whoa.
- You okay?

467
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,575
Side effect of the morphine.

468
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,573
It's good to know.

469
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,518
This will make you feel better.
- Two of Versed.

470
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,606
- That should settle him down.
- Sats, 89.

471
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:39,715
Maybe we've done enough. If you can't?
- We need to find the source.

472
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,052
May have to open his
chest, but we'll find it.

473
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,789
- Damn it.
- It's a detour, we can get back on track.

474
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,397
You don't know that.

475
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,796
If you'd like, I can take
you to the family room.

476
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,664
- No.
- Okay. Stay, hold his hand, talk with him.

477
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,238
Vascular clamp, pickups.
- Frazier tip suction.

478
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,705
- Nate, I am so sorry.
- Careful, careful.

479
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,977
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Right there.

480
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,608
Deep to the manubrium.

481
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,272
I think you've got it.

482
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,281
- My, oh, my.
- What?

483
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,421
Poked through innominate vein.
Never seen anything like that.

484
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,284
Very unusual anatomy.

485
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,584
Well, when they made
Nate, they broke the mold.

486
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,126
Sats are coming up. BP, 120/75.

487
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,389
- Okay, we're out of the woods.
- Good.

488
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,931
Trach's in, vent tubing.

489
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,227
4.0 Prolene.

490
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,961
You gave us a
little scare there.

491
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,401
Okay. SAM: Let me help.

492
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,008
You're not gonna be
needing this anymore.

493
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,480
Nate.

494
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,883
Dr. Lennox, open your eyes.

495
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,783
Could just be because
of the sedative.

496
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,687
There might be some damage.

497
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,828
The blood loss may have
deprived the brain of oxygen.

498
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,627
Pass the tubing all the way...

499
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,665
and cover the suction
port with your thumb.

500
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,464
Then pull out slowly.

501
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,932
It's making him cough.

502
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,133
That's good. It'll help
clear the secretions.

503
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,278
That's all there is to it.

504
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,674
How often?

505
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,975
Maybe two, three times a
day. More, if he sounds junky.

506
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,983
We're gonna get you
some help at home.

507
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,478
I don't think so.

508
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,056
You know how many caregivers
he's made me get rid of?

509
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,523
It's just easier
if I do it myself.

510
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,389
Sometimes you need a break.

511
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,825
Well, I'm fine.

512
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:29,128
I've cut back to 12 hours a day.
We have night aides, you know.

513
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:32,237
I mean, if there's a problem,
they still come and wake me up.

514
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:36,336
It's hard for me to see someone
not giving him the best care, so...

515
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,436
Nate.

516
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,306
Hey, Nate.

517
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,649
Okay, you let us know
when you're ready to talk.

518
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,391
Can I take him home?

519
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,823
- In a couple days.
- How about tonight?

520
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,032
I think that after everything
he's been through...

521
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,534
we should probably
keep an eye on him.

522
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:10,604
I know, but I promised him
that I would keep him at home.

523
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,371
- It's what he wants.
- He'll do better in the hospital.

524
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,343
Yeah.

525
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:19,013
But I promised him.

526
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:27,559
- How long have you been with him?
- Oh, 21 years.

527
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,723
It's hard for me to
believe sometimes.

528
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,361
It started out as
just a job, you know.

529
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:37,628
But after a while...

530
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:43,264
There was this one time I
traveled with him to Boston.

531
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:46,606
It was September of '99.

532
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,146
It's beautiful
there in the fall.

533
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:56,879
He was giving a paper at a
molecular-biology symposium.

534
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,388
I was still prepping his
slides and his handouts...

535
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:02,426
five minutes before the talk.

536
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:06,156
We worked so hard, he added
a couple of days to the trip.

537
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,430
We went up to Cape Cod.

538
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,597
Hotel was right on the beach.

539
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,306
He took me sailing.

540
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,486
It was one of those times
in life where you think...

541
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,681
everything is just
falling into place.

542
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,652
Well, a couple of weeks later...

543
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,957
he got the diagnosis.

544
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,033
I saw the neurologist today.

545
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,362
- Everything okay? Good.
- Blood tests are normal.

546
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,333
No periventricular
lesions on the MRI.

547
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,167
- So it's not MS.
- Great.

548
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,708
- Although, I was kind of hoping for MS.
- What?

549
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,778
The EMG showed denervation
of the muscles of the right hand.

550
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,877
I have motor neuron
disease, Fran.

551
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,146
- I have ALS.
- Oh, my God.

552
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:07,816
Average life expectancy is 4 years, but 5
percent of patients progress, then plateau.

553
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:11,828
<i>There's some guy in his 60s who's still
playing golf 40 years into the disease.</i>

554
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,228
<i>They're starting me on a
new drug called Riluzole.</i>

555
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:18,033
<i>It's very promising at slowing the
progression of the degeneration.</i>

556
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:24,174
There are going to be challenges,
but I'm hopeful about the new research.

557
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,608
And they're setting me up with
a multidisciplinary support team.

558
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,583
<i>Physical and occupational therapists,
nutritionists, speech pathologists...</i>

559
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,844
- respiratory therapists.
- I could help too.

560
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:37,012
Well, I'm still gonna need an
assistant obviously, of course.

561
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,124
Now more than ever.

562
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,750
That's not what I meant.

563
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,690
I have to put all my energy
into fighting this disease.

564
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,606
He didn't wanna start something,
only to have it taken away.

565
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:59,336
- He was afraid it would be too painful.
- For you or for him?

566
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,071
- For both of us.
- Hello.

567
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:05,081
Hey, good to see you're back.

568
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,283
My neck.

569
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,720
- They did a trach. ABBY:
To treat your pneumonia.

570
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,224
- Really?
- Yes, your oxygen levels are up.

571
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,694
Your tidal volume's
improved. You're more alert.

572
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,393
I'll never wear a
turtleneck again.

573
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,539
- You still want an ICU bed?
- No.

574
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,368
- I'll get a tele bed.
- Thank you.

575
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:33,902
We're admitting you for
antibiotics and respiratory therapy.

576
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,677
No trach.

577
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,447
I thought you would
have wanted this.

578
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,417
Appreciate it.

579
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,222
It saved your life, Nate.

580
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,624
I understand.

581
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,067
You know, you can live
for a long time with this.

582
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,274
My facial muscles
are getting weaker.

583
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:08,777
Once I lose my eye
movements, I'll be locked in.

584
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:12,406
I'll be seeing, hearing, and
feeling my surroundings...

585
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,782
but I'll be unable to communicate
my needs and wishes.

586
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:19,288
I don't want to
get to that point.

587
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,093
This infection that you
have is a temporary setback.

588
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,492
Once you get rid of that, you're
gonna be right back to where you were.

589
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,429
- I'm going downhill.
- Well, maybe more slowly...

590
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,466
with good oxygenation
and ventilation.

591
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,003
Had enough.

592
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,464
No, in a couple of days, you're
gonna have a lot more energy...

593
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,337
He's made up his mind.

594
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,877
Take out trach.

595
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,292
I can't.

596
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,843
Fine. Then home.

597
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,909
Poker.

598
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:31,519
He wants me to invite some
of his friends over for poker.

599
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,097
His friends can visit
him in the hospital.

600
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,498
Beer.

601
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,167
We've got beer.

602
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,106
Well, you're in no
condition to go home, Nate.

603
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,051
I'm not comfortable with this.

604
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,416
I am.

605
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,215
Why don't we wait in the lobby?

606
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:00,654
No. Outside.

607
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,158
I'm not sure that
the van is here yet.

608
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,059
- Fresh air.
- You know, it's cold out there.

609
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:09,429
Oh, no. I might catch pneumonia.

610
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,361
Well, I'm sending a respiratory
therapist home to assist you.

611
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,438
- Don't bother.
- You know, it's to help Fran.

612
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:23,272
Tonight, we turn off the vent.

613
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,418
Go to sleep. Won't wake up.

614
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:33,957
Miss Bevens, I got those
papers for you to sign.

615
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,450
I'll be quick.

616
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,296
I know the way out.

617
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:41,695
Well, it's hospital policy. Somebody
has to accompany you to the van.

618
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,233
You forgot your coat.

619
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:50,402
You have a treatable condition. I'm just
asking for two days in the hospital. Two.

620
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,407
- Can't.
- Why not?

621
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,411
I don't want to be a
soul trapped in a corpse.

622
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,311
Well, you're not there yet.
- Close.

623
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,611
Wait. Just wait a
minute. Wait, wait.

624
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,779
What happened to fighting this disease?
- Too tired.

625
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,449
Once we treat the pneumonia, you're
gonna feel better. You can even plateau.

626
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,653
Look at Stephen Hawking, he's
had this disease for 40 years.

627
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,298
I'm not Stephen Hawking.

628
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,764
You're still advising
students, writing books.

629
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,403
You published the lead
article in <i>Cell</i> two months ago.

630
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,970
Just please, wait. Wait.

631
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:28,312
If you recover from this, you
could hang on until there's a cure.

632
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,020
If I don't recover?

633
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,990
Then I'll be there.

634
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:50,293
To make sure you're comfortable,
take you off the vent, and let you go.

635
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,881
I bet you 10 bucks
you can get through this.

636
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:16,551
Ten bucks?

637
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,496
All you have to do is
go back into the hospital.

638
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,270
I'm impressed.

639
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,399
You've become a
pretty persuasive doctor.

640
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,215
Well, I'm not so sure I'd
be here if it weren't for you.

641
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:41,820
The air you breathe,
all the food you eat...

642
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:46,424
it all leads to the production
of one incredible molecule:

643
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,856
ATP. Adenosine triphosphate.

644
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:52,395
The end result of
oxidative phosphorylation.

645
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:56,558
This is the force of life.

646
00:38:56,734 --> 00:39:01,570
Seventy-three hundred
kilocalories per mole.

647
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,004
Pure unadulterated energy.

648
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,541
What are you doing right now?

649
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,402
Taking notes,
crossing your legs...

650
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,378
coughing, digesting your food...

651
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,211
listening to your voice mail
while your professor is lecturing.

652
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:20,048
Every action of the human body,
every single thing it means to be alive...

653
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:23,525
is powered by ATP.

654
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,391
How much do you weigh?

655
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,727
- One fifty-five.
- Stand up. Stand up.

656
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:34,436
Every day, the human body
uses 180 pounds of ATP.

657
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,098
Yes, yes. More than you weigh.

658
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:40,803
And yet, and yet, this body
only has half a pound of ATP.

659
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:43,039
- What's going on?
- You recycle it?

660
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,274
Yes. Yes, you do.

661
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,215
Thank you. Bravo,
thank you. A-plus.

662
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:53,984
You recycle it. Otherwise, you
would burn off your ATP in five minutes.

663
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:58,459
The human body
recycles it 300 times a day.

664
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:04,126
If you were a car, you would
get 150,000 miles to the tank.

665
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:08,433
Now, electron transport jams
protons into the intermembrane space...

666
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,801
of the mitochondria.

667
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:14,002
ATP synthase is, in
fact, a rotary engine.

668
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,670
The flow of protons
spins the shaft.

669
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,818
That sucks in ADP and
blows out fresh ATP...

670
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,922
filled with the energy it takes to fuel
the human body, the human mind...

671
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,786
and, yes, yes, the human spirit.

672
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,690
Okay, we're done. Thank you
very much. Tomorrow... Thank you.

673
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:35,333
Tomorrow, chapter 19, Lehninger.
Electron Transport in Detail.

674
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,095
Thank you. Thank you.

675
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,633
- Dr. Lennox. Do you have a minute?
- Yeah?

676
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,507
- And you are?
- Abby Lockhart. I'm a first year.

677
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,841
Uh-huh.

678
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,483
I need your signature
to drop this class.

679
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,209
You wanna quit biochemistry?

680
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:57,821
I failed the midterm, and I'm not
feeling very optimistic about the final.

681
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,686
- It's a required course.
- Maybe I'll try again next year.

682
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,692
Tough to do. Second-year
curriculum is pretty busy.

683
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,389
I'm thinking about maybe taking a
year off to reconsider my options.

684
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,897
Wow, I'm surprised.

685
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,037
So you don't wanna be a doctor?

686
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,567
I d... I want... I'm
trying. I just... It's a lot.

687
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:19,540
With biochemistry, and physiology,
and microbiology, anatomy.

688
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:23,045
- It's just a lot, it's a lot to memorize.
- There's your problem.

689
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,241
Rote memorization
is the path to failure.

690
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:29,649
Um, do you like sports?

691
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,387
- Do you ice skate?
- Not, really. No.

692
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,858
Do you dance?
Everybody likes to dance.

693
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,464
I took ballet when
I was a kid, yes.

694
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,064
Did you like it?

695
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,763
Yes. I was the sugarplum fairy in
<i>The Nutcracker,</i> third from the left.

696
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,099
Excellent. Do you wanna learn?

697
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:53,574
Stop memorizing
and think conceptually.

698
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:58,880
Biochemistry is
the dance of life.

699
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,410
Ballet is its central dogma.

700
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:06,422
Adenine holds hands with
thymine, cytosine with guanine.

701
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:10,926
When they let go, a line of
gypsy dancers breaks free...

702
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,429
to look for new partners, and
messenger RNA is created.

703
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,196
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
not usually so clumsy. See?

704
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,307
Um, yeah. Can you sign my form?

705
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,911
My office hours begin
at 1 p.m. on Tuesdays.

706
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,778
- Show up.
- You're gonna tutor me?

707
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,283
Think of it as dance lessons.

708
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:38,787
After three weeks, I guarantee
that you'll pass with flying colors.

709
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,754
In fact, I will bet
you 10 bucks.

710
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,292
That's a very generous
offer, I just... I just...

711
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:47,796
I know that you can do this.

712
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,795
I wish I had your confidence.

713
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,332
You will. Don't give up.

714
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:57,168
If nothing else, I will
teach you how to fight.

715
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,473
I'll see you Tuesday.

716
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,807
Thank you.
