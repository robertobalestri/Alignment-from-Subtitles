00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,838
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,441
- What's this?
- That's for you and the little bastard.

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,975
Thanks, Frank.

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:14,545
- Ow! I need a total hip replacement.
- Not necessarily.

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,685
You've gotta help me, Greg.
I've been trying damn hard.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,342
For me, for K.J.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,386
- What's your name?
- Jose Rodriguez.

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,649
Did your drunk ass hit that kid?

9
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,124
The cops brought in a friend a
while ago for a blood-alcohol level.

10
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,229
I drew my own blood,
switched the tubes.

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,864
I made him turn himself in.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,296
You got your friend to
own up to what he did.

13
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,566
Take your own advice.

14
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,939
Kerry? What are you doing here?

15
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,244
Good morning to you too, Luka.

16
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,252
- Thought I'd come in and lend a hand.
- On your day off?

17
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,252
Neela's still doing her surgical elective
and with Clemente on medical leave...

18
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,794
As department chief, I felt
the circumstances warranted it.

19
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,398
And I supported your
decision, but in the meantime...

20
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,092
It will be fine. Go home,
spend the day with Henry.

21
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,670
Henry is spending the day with
Sandy's mom at the science museum.

22
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:15,240
- If we get busy, I'll call you, okay?
- Look, I'm here now.

23
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,977
You are making this up.
Toilet training at six months?

24
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,347
Hookah bar asthma attack.

25
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,412
I saved the article.
I'll bring it for you.

26
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,812
Parking meter versus fist.

27
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,283
Sounds like a direct
route to the shrink's couch.

28
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,615
And in Curtain 1, a
severe case of over-golding.

29
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,587
- Over a what-ing?
- Prepare to be amazed.

30
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,659
- Here's a fax from the blood bank.
- Okay, everybody, listen up.

31
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,594
There's a statewide blood shortage.
So no extra servings if you can help it.

32
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,132
Employee blood-drive in
the cafeteria until 8:00 tonight.

33
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,294
- Got anything for me, chief?
- Oh, yes. For you, anal warts.

34
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,666
Every girl's dream.

35
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,809
- And raw oyster anaphylaxis.
- How can anyone eat those things?

36
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:52,310
- They're supposed to be an aphrodisiac.
- Trust me, they work.

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,314
Let's start with the lumbar disc, followed
by the rotator cuff and then the ACL.

38
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,510
Dr. Weaver, you're early. Your
surgery's not until this afternoon.

39
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,155
Yeah, I know. I'm
sorry. I have to cancel.

40
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,655
ER's getting slammed and
they begged me to come in.

41
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,794
And the dog ate your homework.

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,657
- I've heard this before. Twice.
- I know that I've canceled.

43
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,527
- But it's just not a good time.
- You can't keep doing this.

44
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,863
You should realize the havoc
you're wreaking with my schedule.

45
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,803
- You need this operation.
- Dr. Kline, can we talk in here?

46
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,074
You have end-stage arthrosis,
advanced degeneration...

47
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,979
with a piece of cartilage
that's flapping in the breeze.

48
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,551
I will take care of it soon.

49
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,049
Look, I realize that the prospect of
surgery can be scary, even for doctors.

50
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,058
- It's not that. It's just that I...
- Just what, Kerry?

51
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,695
You're in pain.

52
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,866
I'm sorry about your schedule,
but the ER comes first.

53
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,499
Fine, but I don't get it.

54
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:55,006
If I were you, I would be dying to
throw that crutch away once and for all.

55
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,957
- All I'm saying is you got to accessorize.
- And I can see that, Mr. Lemoyne...

56
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,571
but your rings and bracelets
are cutting off your circulation.

57
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,105
Is that why my neck hurts?

58
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,099
Let's see.

59
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,940
Um...

60
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,083
Your chains... Wow.

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,448
Have eroded into your
skin. It looks infected.

62
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,483
So you're gonna give
me some medicine?

63
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:20,491
Yeah. But infection can't get better
unless you remove your jewelry.

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,253
Oh, no, I never take it off.

65
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,161
I eat with it, sleep with
it and bathe with it on.

66
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:32,170
Let's see. Does it ever get in
the way of, say, airport security?

67
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,035
Oh, no. I don't fly.

68
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,310
Well, when you're having...

69
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,211
- When you're...
- Oh, the ladies love the bling.

70
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,819
I hear you, man.

71
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,887
All right, who left a
kielbasa in the drug fridge?

72
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,549
This is a clear JCAHO
violation. Who didn't know that?

73
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:58,062
- I'm guessing Frank. His name's on it.
- Tell him to keep his sausage to himself.

74
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,732
Do you wanna see something?
- What?

75
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,337
My 3-D sonogram. I just got it.

76
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,670
So that's his, or her, I
guess, first baby picture.

77
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,172
You okay? Kerry?

78
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,250
Yeah, I'm...

79
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,387
So you...

80
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,820
- You didn't find out what the sex is?
- No.

81
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,425
Luka wanted to, but I'm
old-fashioned, I guess.

82
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,722
Well, there aren't too many true
surprises left in life, are there?

83
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,094
No, and it doesn't matter
as long as it's healthy, right?

84
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,360
Right. So how are you feeling?

85
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,333
Very good. Very
energetic, actually.

86
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,905
That's how Sandy was. She
loved the second trimester.

87
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,633
The nausea was gone, she
could eat whatever she wanted.

88
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,904
Dr. Weaver, auto versus
peds, multiples a minute out.

89
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,241
Ray and Morris
are already outside.

90
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,941
- Be right there.
- Are you sure? You want me to get you...?

91
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,780
No, I'm fine. Make
sure you get that framed.

92
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,061
Rasgotra, perfect timing.
We may need a consult.

93
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,965
- That's a big lunch.
- They're cookies.

94
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,071
I've got an Army Spouse
Club meeting tonight.

95
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,764
I'd rather watch
<i>World Poker Tour.</i>

96
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,068
- You baked?
- Everyone has to bring something.

97
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,940
- You gonna show some love?
- The ER vultures can taste test.

98
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,638
All right, one cookie per
person. I'll see you inside.

99
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,612
Okay, fellas,
heads up. Let's go.

100
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,117
Donna Gallagher, unrestrained teen
driver, ejected when her car flipped.

101
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,257
Hit a jogger, coming in on the
next rig. GCS seven. BP 90 palp.

102
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,618
Ray, Trauma 1.

103
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,284
Passenger has facial injuries from
air bag and shoulder pain, vitals stable.

104
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,725
- Abby, sutures.
- Got it.

105
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,128
- What's your name, sweetie?
- Katherine Odachowski.

106
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,666
I feel you. I used to
be Abigail Wyczenski.

107
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,928
My friends call me Katie-O.

108
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:47,597
- Donna, can you hear me?
- BP 75 systolic, pulse 130.

109
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,642
- How are we doing in here?
- Nothing in the belly, no tamponade.

110
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,972
Why she hypotensive?

111
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,408
Ecchymosis on the thighs.

112
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,982
- Distal extremities too.
- She's in DIC.

113
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,143
- She has to be hemorrhaging somewhere.
- All right, let's get her to the scanner.

114
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,789
Oh! Her IV sites are oozing.

115
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,926
- She needs platelets and FFP.
- No, not with this blood shortage.

116
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,118
We can't give her
our last platelets.

117
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,695
She's unresponsive, bleeding...

118
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,355
- could have a head bleed.
- We don't know that.

119
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,864
Get me a gram of acetaminophen.

120
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,696
Why else would
she be unconscious?

121
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,929
- Acetaminophen?
- For me. Tablets, please.

122
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,040
Secure her airway. Let's
see what we find on CT.

123
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,472
By then it could be too late.

124
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,672
Okay, Katie, move your
head from side to side.

125
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,206
Does that hurt?

126
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,903
It's just a little stiff.
- Okay.

127
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,315
And I hurt all over.

128
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,045
And your forearms
are bruised up.

129
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,087
I must have hit them
on the dashboard.

130
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,817
Now, do you remember
what happened?

131
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,020
- We were at the mall.
- No school?

132
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,358
It was the last day before
spring break, so we cut.

133
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,264
But Donna got a headache and
she said she wanted to go home.

134
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,234
Okay. Okay, follow my finger.

135
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,732
The light really hurts.

136
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,169
The air bag could have
scratched your cornea.

137
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,872
BP 115 over 80, pulse 104.

138
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,677
I'm gonna press on your
abdomen, let me know if it hurts.

139
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,720
She fainted on the way home. I
tried to stop the car, but I couldn't.

140
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,381
Chest x-ray, shoulder series,
ICON, UA and visual acuity.

141
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,891
I'll set up the slit lamp.
- Thank you.

142
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,825
And then the car
was upside down.

143
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,229
I looked over at Donna, but
she wasn't there anymore.

144
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,062
It's okay.

145
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,735
Ah! NEELA: Abdomen's tender.

146
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,567
- Morphine, five migs. NEELA:
CBC, chemistry, coags and Foley.

147
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,607
This is what I get for
trying to be healthy.

148
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,369
Thigh deformity,
right femur films.

149
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,376
C-spine, chest and
pelvis. Sager Splint.

150
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,380
This morning, I started a new
diet and went out for a jog...

151
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,350
- BP's 94 over 40, pulse 140.
- Second liter of saline wide open.

152
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,319
When, bam, this car drives
into the sidewalk and hits me.

153
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,550
- Pedal pulse intact.
- Blood in Morrison's.

154
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,024
Two liters in. BP still 85.

155
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,596
Mr. Highsmith, you're bleeding
internally. You'll need surgery to stop it.

156
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,064
Just wait till I get my
hands on that driver.

157
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,998
Type and cross four
units and call the OR.

158
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,228
I'll look in next door.

159
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,602
Okay, check on Kerry while you're
there. See if she needs any help.

160
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,104
Sats 88 and dropping. RAY:
Laryngospasm, can't pass the tube.

161
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,404
Need surgery consult?

162
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,618
Not yet. RAY: Yes.

163
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,442
Well, page me if
anything changes.

164
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,816
- Need sux.
- Got it.

165
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,415
- You okay in here otherwise?
- Yeah, why?

166
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,916
Nothing. Dr. Kovac just
asked me to make sure.

167
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,120
We're fine.

168
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,913
Okay, go ahead, Sam.
She's bradying down.

169
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,283
Sats 82. RAY: Okay.

170
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,250
Trying again.

171
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,849
Neela, I need you to see somebody
in 3. And you're not gonna believe this.

172
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,993
Hypotensive femur
fracture and ortho's MIA.

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,130
Three more minutes
before I call your chief.

174
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,168
The guy's a professional
regurgitator. He swallowed a light bulb.

175
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,633
It's stuck in the duodenum,
so he needs the OR.

176
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,672
That's weird, but I can't help. I've
got a triple trauma, page Albright.

177
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,970
You hear the good news? Jose
Rodriguez, they're releasing him today.

178
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,874
Not anymore. He's
got a wound infection.

179
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,980
He'll need another
week of IV antibiotics.

180
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,277
I assume things went well with
Kovac when you told him what you did.

181
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,215
- You are still here.
- Right, yeah.

182
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,446
Neela, I got the
x-ray on our jogger.

183
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,352
Okay, I gotta go.

184
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,224
- Did you reach my parents?
- They're on their way in, so are Donna's.

185
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,663
Is she okay?

186
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,033
She's got some really good
doctors taking care of her.

187
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,967
Can I get something for my headache?
- Sure.

188
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,168
Temp is up, 101.8.

189
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,473
Okay, 600 of ibuprofen.

190
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,484
And about my bruises,
when will they go away?

191
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,516
They've spread.

192
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,850
Yeah.

193
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:09,363
- Abby?
- Okay. Chuny, put on a mask.

194
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,064
Call the lab for stat blood cultures,
hang two grams of ceftriaxone on IV.

195
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,764
Make sure she
stays in isolation.

196
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,069
Don't worry, you'll
be jogging in no time.

197
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,734
Luka.

198
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,904
- Time of death, 12:17.
- It's meningococcemia.

199
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,743
Are you sure?

200
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,584
My patient has rapidly
progressing purpura and fever...

201
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,051
and I bet this one does too.

202
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,190
- It was DIC from trauma.
- I don't think so.

203
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,554
My girl complained of headaches,
stiff neck and sensitivity to light.

204
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,422
I'll call Infection Control.

205
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,587
I put her in isolation.

206
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:41,734
We need immediate prophylaxis for all
hospital staff exposed to these patients.

207
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,564
- That's a lot of people.
- We're all at risk.

208
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,439
When can we go in? I
wanna be with my daughter.

209
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,206
Not until we get
her up to the ICU.

210
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,748
- When will that be?
- We're still waiting for a bed.

211
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,146
I don't understand.

212
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,550
How did the girls get this?
Who else was exposed?

213
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,713
Public Health will
need to figure that out.

214
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,119
We have two other children.

215
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,624
They need to be treated
immediately and you do too.

216
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,525
Chuny, let's make sure that
Katie's parents are treated...

217
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,632
and then show them
to the family room.

218
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,927
I'll get you as soon as
we send Katie upstairs.

219
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,265
This is County General, the
parents of Michelle Sutton called.

220
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,906
Here you go, Frank.

221
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,474
I better not get this. I
can't even pronounce it.

222
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,476
We're halfway through the
student list from the girls' school.

223
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,807
- Morris. WEAVER: How
are we doing on Cipro?

224
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,347
Mercy's sending 150 doses.

225
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,951
The pharmacy called the distributor.
They're sending more within the hour.

226
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,486
- Here you go.
- Can't take that, it's contraindicated.

227
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,681
I didn't know that.
I'll find you some...

228
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,485
That's all right. I'm on it.

229
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,151
- Did you take your Cipro?
- Yes, did you get your shot?

230
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,456
No, I'm researching
alternatives right now.

231
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,191
- You should just get a ceftriaxone...
- I wanna make sure.

232
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,836
- It's safe for you and the baby.
- You can't know that.

233
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,132
- It's category B, not category A.
- Abby, there is no category A.

234
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,275
Nobody does controlled
trials on pregnant...

235
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,001
"In most cases ceftriaxone
is probably safe." Probably.

236
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,874
- I'll give you the shot myself.
- You're fine with probably?

237
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,378
Thank you, Mrs. Riley.

238
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,723
Hey, Jose. How's it going, man?

239
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:22,498
- What are you watching?
<i>- Rock 'n' Roll Soldiers.</i>

240
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,035
Oh, yeah? Any good?

241
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,365
Yeah, it's cool.

242
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,643
Did you hit your head when
you passed out, Mr. Elliot?

243
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,403
I don't think so.

244
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,672
But then again, I was
unconscious at the time.

245
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,874
He slumped over in the back seat,
but he was wearing his seatbelt.

246
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,246
Malik, a little help?

247
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,856
What, are you giving away
free toasters here or something?

248
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,691
Conjunctiva are
pale. Tachy at 120.

249
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,924
I'll order an EKG.

250
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,826
Any history of heart problems?

251
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,558
No, my heart's fine.

252
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,863
Hello. Yeah. Let me
call you back, all right?

253
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,768
Give me 10 minutes. Yeah.

254
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,571
Okay, your spleen
is enlarged, so...

255
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,681
No, not my spleen...
Look, I'm sorry, Morris.

256
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,283
Thanks for your thoroughness,
but I don't need tests.

257
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,285
I just prefer my driver...
John, just take me home now.

258
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,423
I'd prefer your driver
take me home too...

259
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,058
but we have to stay and
find out why you passed out.

260
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,792
- And you are?
- Sam Taggart.

261
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,663
Well, Ms. Taggart,
I'm anemic from MDS.

262
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,964
- MDS?
- Myelodysplastic syndrome.

263
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,569
His bone marrow doesn't
like making red blood cells.

264
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,366
- Exactly.
- What type do you have?

265
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,872
Just the kind that requires
frequent transfusions.

266
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,204
Iron chelation therapy
five nights a week.

267
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,712
<i>Will the owner of the
ginormous SUV parked outside...</i>

268
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,611
<i>please move said vehicle.</i>

269
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:47,311
<i>You're blocking the ambulance
bay. You will be towed.</i>

270
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,718
John, I believe that's
us. Let's get out of here.

271
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,755
Wait, I have to advise
you not to leave.

272
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,155
You could pass out, you
could have a heart attack.

273
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,262
Yeah, I appreciate...

274
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:02,630
I got it. Why don't you let us
get two units into you, okay?

275
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,271
You're here, might as
well let us top off your tank.

276
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,408
- Top off my tank?
- Yeah.

277
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,409
All right. John, move
the car. Take a long lunch.

278
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,910
I'll call you when I'm ready.

279
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,983
Sam, CBC, retic, type and cross for four
and see if there's an open bed in Exam 3.

280
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,114
Where do you normally
get your transfusions?

281
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,728
Home. I keep a
blood supply there.

282
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:32,491
- Really? Where do you get it?
- EBay.

283
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,135
- Work on your injection technique.
- Come on, it didn't hurt.

284
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,139
I wish I didn't have
to take anything.

285
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,279
Don't let your mind go
there. It'll stress you out.

286
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,641
I'm already stressed.

287
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,282
I'll buy you a hot chocolate.

288
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,781
I don't want a hot chocolate.

289
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,646
What I wanna do is
worry about the baby.

290
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,118
- What?
- Don't reassure me.

291
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,223
Don't tell me
everything's fine. Don't...

292
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,018
- Buy you hot chocolate?
- I'm serious.

293
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,524
Don't you think I'd be
concerned if there's any chance...

294
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,927
- that something bad could happen?
- So, what? Now I'm the crazy one?

295
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,068
I didn't say that.
We're in this together.

296
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:09,500
Really?

297
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:10,932
- Yeah, 100 percent.
- Really?

298
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,937
Well, it feels more
like 60-40 to me.

299
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,472
Well, sometimes I'm
completely terrified.

300
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,547
And I just need to worry
about it every now and then...

301
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,241
and I need you
to let me do that.

302
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,588
Would it help if I
worried along with you?

303
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,553
We could try that, yeah.

304
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,870
- How long should we worry?
- Ten or 20 minutes.

305
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:51,275
- Can I have two hot chocolates, please?
- Okay.

306
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,549
Hold still now, Mr. Lemoyne.

307
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,409
- Do you have a patient belongings bag?
- Sure.

308
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,678
Ooh. Pizza? I didn't know
there was a collection.

309
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,086
- Yeah, your money's no good here.
- It's on Kovac.

310
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,486
All right, I'll take two.

311
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,595
His way of saying, sorry you
were exposed to a deadly bacteria.

312
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,663
Please ask for Dr. Archie Morris
when you call back. Thank you.

313
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,233
Hey, how'd it go with our jogger?
- He's in recovery.

314
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,063
He should be fine,
but I'm a pariah.

315
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,035
Everyone in Surgery has
to take Cipro because of me.

316
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,903
Frank, you're supposed to
be the keeper of my cookies.

317
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,738
Leaving them out anyone could
take as many as they wanted.

318
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,938
Probably all gone by now...

319
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,881
Oh.

320
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,518
Has anyone tasted them?

321
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,052
Reviews are still coming in.

322
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,689
Morris, have you
tried my cookies?

323
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,189
No, but I would love
to try your cookies...

324
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,021
as soon as I'm done with lunch.

325
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,719
Mm. I'll save this for later.

326
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,865
- Do you have a second?
- Yeah, sure.

327
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,558
Kovac, thanks
for the pizza, man.

328
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,758
Enjoy it, Malik.

329
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,768
Frank, what was all that about?

330
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,067
If you don't want a three-day
bellyache, lose the cookie.

331
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,144
How late is your Spouse
Club meeting going tonight?

332
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,611
Eight or 9. Why?

333
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,877
I made a date with this
hot girl named Ashley.

334
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,886
- She's really hard to pin down.
- And I should care because?

335
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,991
I invited her to the apartment.
I'm making penne à la Barnett.

336
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,888
Great, Ray. I'm
absolutely knackered.

337
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,428
All I wanna do after this meeting
is go straight home and watch TV.

338
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,965
- Please, Neela, I really like this girl.
- You like them all.

339
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,863
I owe you.

340
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,103
- What's up?
- I just made Ray happy.

341
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,104
You're such a giver.

342
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,937
- You wanna have dinner with me tonight?
- I can't tonight.

343
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,012
Too bad. I was looking forward
to sharing a meal with someone...

344
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,672
who doesn't calculate
every ounce of protein I eat.

345
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,680
Is Luka being a
little overprotective?

346
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,477
He doesn't understand
that sometimes...

347
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,679
the baby wants a hot
fudge sundae at night.

348
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,620
So I have some themes in
mind for your baby shower.

349
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,021
Themes?

350
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,686
I'm not sure I'm really the
baby shower kind of person.

351
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,195
We could have a tea
party with a garden theme...

352
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,494
or a diaper party or a
books-for-baby party.

353
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,137
Isn't it a little early to
be talking about this?

354
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,670
Maybe you want a co-ed shower?

355
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,807
Before you know it, the
baby's gonna be here.

356
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,637
- And my life, as I know it, will be over.
- In a good way.

357
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,506
In a good way.

358
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,676
We can talk about
showers next week...

359
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,818
but I'm telling you, I'm not wearing
a paper plate hat with ribbons on it.

360
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,943
Looks like fun,
can anybody play?

361
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,536
I was just...

362
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,905
Practicing.

363
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,146
I dropped a syringe today
and I couldn't pick it up.

364
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,545
- Your hip?
- Mm.

365
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:54,558
It is a pain, literally
and figuratively.

366
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,462
Thanks.

367
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,230
Have you given up on the
idea of replacement surgery?

368
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,237
Three times now,
including today.

369
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,568
- Today?
- I cancelled.

370
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,139
It's not a good time to be off
my feet. The ER needs me...

371
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,714
and what mobility I do have I
need for Henry, because he's...

372
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,748
All he wants to...

373
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:26,582
do these days is drive this
little hot rod that I got him.

374
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,494
He steers and I push.

375
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,656
Well, Henry's only gonna
get older and more active.

376
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,832
Are you afraid of the surgery?

377
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,875
Sorry, need the room. Kovac
just got an assault victim.

378
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,773
Buy you a free cup of coffee?

379
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,284
That's... That's very generous.

380
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,921
James Bucci, 21, blunt
trauma to head and chest.

381
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,025
Pulse in the 80s, resps
18, BP 160 over 95.

382
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,785
Okay, ready?

383
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,792
One, two, three.

384
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,430
Get Pratt.

385
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,932
- I'm Dr. Kovac, what's your name?
- Go, Huskies.

386
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,730
Disoriented to place and
time, but he's had a few.

387
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,270
Okay, how'd this happen?

388
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,203
Got punched by
another basketball fan.

389
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,741
- You know, March Madness.
- More like March stupid.

390
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:22,115
You gotta get out of the way.
Come on, this is not a playground.

391
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,715
Be gentle.

392
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,311
- What do we got?
- Bar fight, head trauma...

393
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,955
alert on arrival but bradied
down, hypoventilating.

394
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,148
- Sats only 79.
- Okay, he needs a tube.

395
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,953
Eight-O and a Miller two.
What's with the Three Stooges?

396
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,959
I'd say they can't
hold their liquor.

397
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,428
BP's 210 over 100, heart
rate's down in the 50s.

398
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,930
It's herniating.

399
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,831
Okay, 50 of mannitol and
hurry with that tube, Pratt.

400
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,096
You guys need to wait outside.
- Suction.

401
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,834
- It was just... It was a stupid bar fight.
- They usually are.

402
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,170
It was nothing. The
bartender called 911.

403
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,040
Probably was scared
he'd get his ass sued.

404
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,913
Knock it off. Knock it off!

405
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,175
He's gonna be all
right, though, right?

406
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,184
Call CT and tell them we'll be
there soon as we get an airway.

407
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,083
All right, I'm in. Bag him.

408
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,192
You're very good. I
didn't even feel the needle.

409
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,302
Fastest stick north
of the Mason-Dixon.

410
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,672
Hey, how are you feeling?

411
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,871
Pizza really hit the spot.

412
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,602
Well, I figured you
for a deep-dish guy.

413
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,375
Has this Dr. Morris heard
back from my primary?

414
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,313
You know, I am
not sure. Hold on.

415
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,655
Hey, Frank, can you tell Morris
I got a repeat on his 12-lead...

416
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,385
and can I get a
troponin to the lab?

417
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,326
Yeah, and do you know
if Mr. Elliot's doctor...?

418
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,990
- Robert Gorman.
- A Dr. Gorman has called back yet?

419
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,596
Okay, thanks.

420
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,795
Nope.

421
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,000
Tell me why I'm paying 20,000 a
year on personalized medical care.

422
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,710
I can't even get it
in an emergency.

423
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,372
Twenty thousand dollars?

424
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,217
Well, Gorman's
a boutique doctor.

425
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,585
Yeah, well, if there's any such
thing as a boutique nurse, sign me up.

426
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,192
- Listen, Ms. Taggart...
- Sam.

427
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,524
- For Samantha.
- Samantha, huh?

428
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,633
If life were fair, you nurses
and cops, firemen and teachers...

429
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,360
you'd all be paid like baseball
players and movie stars.

430
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,665
Huh! I like the way you think.

431
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,607
Hey, you know, if you
don't mind my asking...

432
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,803
what is it that you do?

433
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,743
We manage hedge funds.

434
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:40,546
I started out in imports and
exports, that kind of thing.

435
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,553
- What are we doing here?
- You're cold.

436
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,987
All right, I will check
back in on you in a bit.

437
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,130
- V-tach, lost the pulse.
- Starting compressions.

438
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,792
- What's wrong?
- Charge to 200.

439
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,062
Ready with lido.

440
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,103
His heart went into
an abnormal rhythm.

441
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,706
Clear.

442
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,335
Charging to 300.

443
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,345
- Man, I can't believe this is happening.
- Drop it, Phil.

444
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,143
- One of you needs to call his parents.
- Clear.

445
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,519
Sinus, he's back.

446
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,161
- I think I'm gonna hurl. PRATT:
Nope, not in here you're not.

447
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,350
Come on, guys. Let's
go. Out. Out, damn it.

448
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,018
Okay, let's get him to
CT before he codes again.

449
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,662
What's the matter with you guys?

450
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,493
Your friend's sick and you
act like jackasses, huh? Go.

451
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,431
Hey, make sure these
guys stay in the waiting room.

452
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:34,539
Man, we're not always like that, all right?
We've been friends since we were little.

453
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,300
Do yourself a favor and
get some new friends, okay?

454
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,173
Hey, look. Look, man.

455
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,043
I did it.

456
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,248
You know, Jimmy kept
riding me about our team...

457
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,680
how we had no inside game,
he was getting up in my face...

458
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:51,949
and I punched him.

459
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,154
Well, friends get
into it sometimes.

460
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,267
I lost it, man.

461
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,697
You know, it was just...

462
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,072
It was a split second and he fell
and he hit his head on the table.

463
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,976
You didn't mean it.

464
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,515
Now, believe me, everybody's
done something in the past...

465
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,482
that they wish they
could take back.

466
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:29,826
Look, I should call his parents, you
know, and let them know what's going on.

467
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,287
All right.

468
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,732
What do you see
when you look at me?

469
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,036
- What?
- How would you...?

470
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,305
- How would you describe me?
- I don't know.

471
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,853
Okay, you're a woman.

472
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,815
Doctor, mother.

473
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,858
- A friend.
- Thank you.

474
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,061
You're pretty.

475
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,695
Um...

476
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,029
Red-head, nice dresser...

477
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,798
- I'm a disabled person.
- Well, that's not how I see you.

478
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,372
Why not? Why?

479
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,203
It's... It's... It's who I am.

480
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,470
It's who I've always been.

481
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,136
That's how I grew up.

482
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,873
It's how I see myself.

483
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:28,951
I have never considered
myself handicapped or broken.

484
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,317
I don't need to be fixed.

485
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,016
If it weren't for
this pain and the...

486
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:37,527
The limits that I am
facing at work and...

487
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:43,762
trying to take care of my son, I'd
never even consider getting a new hip.

488
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,495
I don't...

489
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:53,035
This surgery is gonna
take away my crutch forever.

490
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,048
And everyone
says that's so great.

491
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,848
But what else
will I be giving up?

492
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,353
Who will I be then?

493
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,887
Okay, you should be good...

494
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,222
for another two weeks
before your next transfusion.

495
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,421
And, I'm sorry, your
primary never called back.

496
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,032
Don't worry about it.

497
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,827
Thank you for your help.

498
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,560
Anytime.

499
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:22,501
I'll let you in on a secret. I
fired Dr. Gorman an hour ago.

500
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,439
Well, that'll teach his
non-responding boutique butt.

501
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,102
Hey, Sam.

502
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,439
Alex, what happened?

503
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,544
- I got jacked.
- What?

504
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:34,243
A couple of older kids
beat me up walking home.

505
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,717
Does it hurt much?

506
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,880
No, but they stole
my cell phone.

507
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,883
That's okay, don't
worry about that.

508
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,889
Hey, Chuny, will you
take him to Curtain 4?

509
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,361
I get off in 15 minutes.
We'll leave then, okay?

510
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,131
- Okay.
- Come on, Alex, I'll get you an ice pack.

511
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,200
That's my kid, Alex.

512
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,704
Sounds like you and your husband will
be moving to a nicer neighborhood now.

513
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,540
It's just me and Alex.

514
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,547
And on a nurse's salary, where
we live is a nice neighborhood.

515
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:08,244
It must be hard raising a
child on your own like that, huh?

516
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,252
He's a good kid.

517
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,554
Okay, all done.

518
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,092
Someone will be here
shortly to wheel you out.

519
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,628
- I'd rather walk.
- Yeah, hospital policy says you...

520
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,733
Do I look like I need
a wheelchair to you?

521
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,494
Ladies first.

522
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,736
I have two sons...

523
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,743
and a daughter.

524
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,712
Denny and David
are out west now...

525
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:41,445
and Kelly's in Boca. They're
trying to convince me to move there.

526
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,918
Florida's nice.

527
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,284
If you like hurricanes
and early bird specials.

528
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,450
I like my view of the
ice on Lake Michigan.

529
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,829
- Well, it was really good to meet you.
- It was good to meet you, Samantha.

530
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,208
Okay, keep me posted
on our college kid.

531
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,139
- Good work in there.
- Thanks. You too.

532
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,803
Dr. Kovac.

533
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,510
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

534
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:15,148
- In private?
- Yeah.

535
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,458
Are you okay?

536
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,291
Morris, you have the
handwriting of a serial killer.

537
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,729
Excuse me. My friend
wants to ask you something.

538
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,492
- Yeah?
- I have this bruise.

539
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:33,230
- You think I got what those girls
have? ABBY: Let me see. Where is it?

540
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,168
Right there.

541
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,871
- I think what you got there is a...
- A hickey, right?

542
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,376
- Right.
- See, told you.

543
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,514
You're just jealous
because Kevin likes me.

544
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,013
- Am not.
- Are too.

545
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,209
Well, guys, if you go this way,
someone will take care of you, okay?

546
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,514
Hey, Abby, what
do you think Pratt...

547
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,816
and your baby daddy
are talking about in 1?

548
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,186
- It looks pretty serious.
- Mm.

549
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,693
- Maybe they're talking about you.
- You think?

550
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,196
Frank, I'm leaving.
I need my cookies.

551
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,890
- Fellas.
- Today would be nice.

552
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,696
Hey, Neela. We
need to have a talk.

553
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,068
- We?
- Yeah. Um...

554
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,233
Because we care about you...
- Since when?

555
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,209
You know, it just makes
it more difficult if you're...

556
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,905
Have you all been hit
on the head with a mallet?

557
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,108
What are you
blathering on about?

558
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,683
Your cookies.

559
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,788
- My cookies?
- Yeah.

560
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,755
After careful consideration
from your ER peers...

561
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,556
plus Hector in
janitorial services...

562
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,394
Just the feeling is
that your cookies are...

563
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,937
The worst cookies ever
made in the history of baking.

564
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,471
Shut up.

565
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,239
Bollocks to you all.

566
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,435
The truth hurts.

567
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,240
All right, if anyone needs me...

568
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:53,510
I'm gonna be in Exam 3
doing a shoulder reduction.

569
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,619
A shoulder reduction is tricky.

570
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,916
I had one where I had
to use my whole body.

571
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,925
Practically had to stand on
the guy to pop it back in place.

572
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:06,088
But you gotta get it right the first time
otherwise the patient's in a lot of pain.

573
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,131
That would be bad.

574
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,832
I could take this if you want.

575
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:16,303
I think that is an
excellent idea, Ray.

576
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,569
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

577
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,672
Frank, see if you can get
me Dr. Kline on the line.

578
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,316
Okay.

579
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,948
You falsified a police report.

580
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,784
Yeah, I guess I did.

581
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,585
That's great.

582
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,624
You... You know, I'm obligated to
report this to the state medical board.

583
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,289
- I know.
- They'll investigate...

584
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:45,631
and from what you told me, there's
little doubt they'll suspend your license.

585
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,773
Your career and reputation gone
because of one moment of stupidity.

586
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,935
- It didn't seem like that at the time...
- And now that I know...

587
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,081
you've involved me too.

588
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,374
- I had to tell you.
- What would you do?

589
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:03,619
What would you do if you were
me, huh? What would you do?

590
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,158
Would you risk your career for
someone who did what you did?

591
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:13,096
Dr. Kovac, Ortho needs you to eyeball
an open tib-fib before he goes upstairs.

592
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,167
- Dr. Kovac?
- Yeah. Just give...

593
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,303
Give us a minute, please.

594
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,336
Okay, you're
going on a vacation.

595
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,947
- What?
- Five days unpaid, starting now.

596
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:34,980
- You're kidding, right?
- Don't have fun. Don't enjoy it.

597
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,584
Spend it thinking about
what it means to be a doctor.

598
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,329
- Thank you.
- No, no, don't thank me.

599
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,627
It's not a reward.

600
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,881
Thanks again for letting me
get off work early for my date.

601
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,386
Anything for love and pasta.

602
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,456
Basal skull fracture
being admitted for obs...

603
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,558
as soon as you take
care of your head lac.

604
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,025
It's already irrigated,
just needs a few staples.

605
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,061
Mr. Gauthier, this
is Dr. Lockhart.

606
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,097
I leave you in her
capable hands.

607
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,701
Hello. How'd you hurt your head?

608
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,236
- Trying to stop an epidemic.
- An epidemic?

609
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,373
Of antisocial behavior.

610
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,804
Why do some parents think it's
okay for their kid to yell "doody"...

611
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:35,675
- over and over again in public?
- I've often wondered about that myself.

612
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,409
Or that it's good manners if little
Emma or Julian sprawls on the floor...

613
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,043
or hurls themselves at display
cases while you try to enjoy a latte.

614
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,316
So a latte led to
your skull fracture?

615
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,920
When I told Doody Boy
to use his inside voice...

616
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,086
his mom threatened
to call the cops.

617
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,323
I tripped over a double
stroller on my way out.

618
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,397
- Thank you for being on my side.
- No.

619
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,402
It's not that.
It's my baby, I...

620
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:01,767
I just felt it move.

621
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,607
- You did?
- Yeah, it's the first time.

622
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,774
Great. It's all
about you, isn't it?

623
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,048
All forms of anesthesia
involve some risks.

624
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,122
Although rare, unexpected
severe complications can occur...

625
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,125
and include remote
possibility of infection...

626
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:27,597
bleeding, blood clots,
paralysis, stroke, brain damage...

627
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:31,464
loss of sensation,
heart attack or death.

628
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,266
I understand that these risks
apply to all forms of anesthesia...

629
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,141
and that additional or specific
risks have been identified below.

630
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:51,814
That concludes the business portion
of our meeting, ladies and gentleman.

631
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,652
Let's eat.

632
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,994
I want... Just a moment.

633
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:59,461
- Neela, there you are.
- Joan, I am so sorry I'm late.

634
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,328
I know they're not homemade,
but they're very good.

635
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,202
I had a baking setback.

636
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,171
It must be hard.

637
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:11,504
Frankly, I don't know how you gals do it,
married to your careers and the military.

638
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,511
Hey, can I have
pizza for dinner?

639
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,910
I can cook, you know.

640
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,846
Yeah, but not pizza.

641
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:22,385
Someday you're
gonna turn into a pizza.

642
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,682
- Hey.
- Hey.

643
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,021
- Is that yours?
- Yeah, what do you think?

644
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,588
- It's pretty cool.
- Pretty big.

645
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,998
The next time you and your
mommy wanna take a ride in that...

646
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,228
- just let me know.
- Awesome.

647
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,863
- Hey, can I have a soda?
- Sure.

648
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:49,044
You wait inside that store for me,
okay? And be careful crossing the street.

649
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,447
Hey, John, go with him.

650
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,954
Great. He is gonna be bugging
me about that ride for weeks.

651
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,591
I meant it.

652
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,260
I'll think about it.

653
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,397
I got something else
for you to think about.

654
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,624
I was in a real
firing mood today.

655
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,564
I fired my primary care doctor.

656
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,074
- I fired the home-care nurse.
- Why'd you do that?

657
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,401
I don't know. I saw you in
action today. It got me thinking.

658
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,773
I could do better.

659
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,812
Well, it's too bad
that I'm not available.

660
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,111
You're not? That's a shame.

661
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,583
I was offering you the job.

662
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,816
It's very flattering, but
I already have a job.

663
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,152
Which you can keep.

664
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,794
It's a part-time job.
Flexible hours, good pay.

665
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:40,289
Just check my crit, give me the
transfusions when I need them.

666
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,799
The overnight chelation therapy
that's gotta be done five times a week.

667
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,630
Wait, did you say overnight?

668
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:48,137
No, I can't. I
can't. I have Alex.

669
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,765
I can't be running back and forth to
your house in the middle of the night.

670
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,436
That's why you and Alex would be
more than welcome to come live with me.

671
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,650
- Move in.
- Excuse me?

672
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,821
Listen, you could take a whole
section of my house right now...

673
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,478
and have it all to yourselves.

674
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,683
My live-in housekeeper, Mrs.
Harrison, has been with me 15 years.

675
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,021
The place is so big, I
hardly see the woman.

676
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,187
She can even watch
Alex after school.

677
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:18,063
What, is it you feel sorry for me,
because I'm a single-mom nurse?

678
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,204
We're not a charity case.

679
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,840
It's no charity,
it's an opportunity.

680
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,315
This is just weird.

681
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,181
Think about it, Samantha.

682
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,551
I look forward to
hearing from you.

683
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,530
So how's Michael doing
back in the saddle again?

684
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,502
- Bless him, volunteering to go back?
- He's fine, doing well.

685
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,234
- Says he's very busy. He misses me.
- Of course. He'll be home again soon.

686
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,378
Is Joe gonna be home
in time for the birth?

687
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:03,344
I don't think so. He'd pass out
in the delivery room anyway.

688
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,450
- I did.
- Seriously.

689
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,017
Of course I want him home.

690
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,518
I knew what I was getting
when I married a soldier.

691
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,623
The long absences, the moving
for the umpteenth time, the pay.

692
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,452
It's sad he's not gonna be here.

693
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,083
It's hard sometimes...

694
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:19,356
but that's why I'm so glad I
have Spouse Club and all of you.

695
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:23,866
Our loved ones are serving our
country, it's a small price to pay.

696
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,767
I think it's a huge price to pay,
especially under the circumstances.

697
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:31,239
- What circumstances?
- The way the whole thing's been handled.

698
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,208
How we got into it,
how it's being managed.

699
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,608
What exactly do you mean?

700
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,582
- Never mind, I'm sorry.
- No, no, go on.

701
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:44,711
Well, I still haven't seen any
weapons of mass destruction, have you?

702
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,653
Who's thirsty?

703
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,987
If you don't support the war, how do
you justify what Michael's doing there?

704
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,460
I don't justify it.

705
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,496
And I don't support any war...

706
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,602
but I do support our troops
and I am proud of my husband.

707
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,898
- Doesn't sound that way.
- You can't tell me...

708
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:04,804
that you believe 100 percent in your
heart that we should be in Iraq, can you?

709
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:09,243
- I don't think it helps to talk that way.
- Our duty is to support their duty.

710
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:12,942
My duty is to be a good
doctor and to be a good wife.

711
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:19,284
Not to be brainwashed into falling in
line with some pseudo-patriotic delusion.

712
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,869
I got your page. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

713
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,098
- They'll be in for you soon.
- Thank you.

714
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,469
- I thought you cancelled this.
- I un-cancelled.

715
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:42,273
My surgeon was afraid I'd
change my mind again tomorrow.

716
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,150
There's something
I need to ask you.

717
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,513
Want me to hang around,
check on you in Recovery?

718
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,348
No, that's not it.

719
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:55,118
If something were to happen in surgery,
I'd need someone to look after Henry.

720
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,660
- Nothing's gonna happen in surgery.
- But if it does.

721
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,627
Would you be
Henry's legal guardian?

722
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,829
Well, what about
Sandy's parents?

723
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:14,376
They're... They're wonderful with
him, but they're getting older and I...

724
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,673
I just need to know
that he'd be okay.

725
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:21,145
And you know that
it's... It's not just me now.

726
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,810
That Luka's in my life.

727
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,354
He's a good man. He's
gonna be a great father.

728
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,525
Look, is this even
possible to do now?

729
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:33,187
I mean, isn't there something I have
to do? Sign a legal thing? Something?

730
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:37,768
I had these drawn up the first
time that I scheduled the surgery.

731
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,899
Can you just give
us a second, please?

732
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,374
You know, sometimes
it's hard being alone.

733
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:53,341
But I've always felt like
I could depend on you.

734
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,517
You can.

735
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,884
Thanks.

736
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,376
Ray? RAY: Hey.

737
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,574
- Were you watching <i>Ghost?</i>
- What?

738
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,453
No, no, it's the...
It's the game.

739
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,421
- Where's your date?
- Oh, yeah.

740
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,088
Something happened.

741
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,020
She stood you up.

742
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,588
Yeah, fine.

743
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,963
You know, if that's what you
wanna hear, she stood me up, okay?

744
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:47,469
Well, you are a
mere mortal after all.

745
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,101
Rough night?

746
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:56,778
Is it possible to kick
yourself out of a club?

747
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:02,447
Well, to better times, huh?

748
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,421
Yeah.

749
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,792
You know, I feel very
proud of Michael...

750
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,268
but sometimes when I'm
with those other wives...

751
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:21,702
I start to get so
angry, frustrated...

752
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,803
and I talk too much.

753
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,376
You? Talk too much?

754
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,012
It's only because I miss him.

755
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,614
- This is utterly pathetic.
- What?

756
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,780
This. A married woman
living like a college student...

757
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,983
crying next to her
roommate on his sofa.

758
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:47,994
Okay, well, I have something
that'll make you feel better.

759
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,897
You recorded it for me.

760
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,507
Anything for my roomie.

761
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,469
<i>It's lights, camera, action...</i>

762
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,807
<i>tonight on the</i> World Poker Tour.

763
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,543
<i>They play until one player
wins all the chips on the table.</i>

764
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,321
Take some deep breaths.

765
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,021
You'll start feeling sleepy.

766
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,727
Count backwards from 100, Kerry.

767
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:31,241
One hundred, 99...

768
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:37,274
98, 97...

769
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:43,647
96, 95...
