1
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,668
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,366
- We gotta clean up.
- Gallant won't be here for days.

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:13,002
I just want it to be nice for him.
He's been over there a long time.

4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,612
- Oh, hey. I'm Zoe.
- Fourteen years old?

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,617
- Why didn't you tell me how old you are?
- You never asked.

6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,950
I'm gonna give you a prescription
for doxycycline for the chlamydia.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,685
It's just that you've been
warned three times and, uh...

8
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,687
We're gonna have to let you go.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,491
- Who's this Clemente?
- I'm done arguing with a TV set.

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:35,102
<i>Believed it's a fresh radical
formation. Did you just call me a TV set?</i>

11
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,330
- He's the new department chief?
- We're forming a search committee.

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,940
The guy wouldn't be here
if he wasn't angling for it.

13
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,977
You gonna eat your eggs?

14
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,048
They're cold.

15
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,749
What about your waffles?

16
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,995
- I'm not hungry. I got a stomachache.
- Really?

17
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,789
Wanna bring them home with you?

18
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,432
Mr. Coogy might
wanna eat them later.

19
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,062
He doesn't like waffles.

20
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,168
Excuse me. Could
we get the bill, please?

21
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,678
I'm sorry. Our
machine's still out.

22
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,043
Would you like more coffee?

23
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,479
Uh, no, thanks.

24
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,779
It should be just
a couple minutes.

25
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,827
Come on. We're
gonna get out of here.

26
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,323
Grab your coat. Hurry up.

27
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,194
You want your picture? - No.

28
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,632
No, no. This way. Let's go.

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,775
You can't come back here, sir.

30
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,874
Hey!

31
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,344
Hey.

32
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,719
I like your picture, okay?
I think we should keep it.

33
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,616
Aah!

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,216
- Damn!
- I'm hit!

35
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,061
Don't move. Stay down.

36
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,266
Easy, hon.

37
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,500
You'll be okay. We're
gonna take care of you.

38
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,605
Try to stay still, okay?

39
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,336
Call for another rig.

40
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,306
This is 73. We need backup.

41
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,643
<i>Copy, 73. On its way.</i>

42
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,262
Put him down! Darrel! Security!

43
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,374
- What the hell are you doing?
- Checking for internal bleeding.

44
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,567
By sticking your
finger in my butt?

45
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,303
Called a guaiac test.

46
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,347
Oh, jeez. Get that away from me.

47
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,211
Aah, aah, aah!

48
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,645
- You got crap on my nose.
- You okay?

49
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,914
- Oh, man. That's horrible!
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm okay.

50
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,450
Aah, aah, aah!

51
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,821
That guy's terrible.
Somebody, give me a towel.

52
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,292
Oh, my God!

53
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,328
Guaiac's negative.

54
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,330
Give him two of
Ativan. Make it four.

55
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,629
- C-spine and first day of labs.
- Oh, it's horrible.

56
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,294
I need a tetanus shot.

57
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,333
- Yes?
- Have you seen your buddy K.J.?

58
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,843
- Nope.
- Me neither.

59
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,311
I'm gonna broom him.

60
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,679
- You can't fire him, he's a volunteer.
- A very involuntary volunteer.

61
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,514
- I need kids we can count on.
- All right. I'll talk to him.

62
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,647
Okay, okay, okay, kids,
gather round. It's showtime.

63
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,825
Yo, Lockhart, Barnett, come
on, fall in. You too, Pratt.

64
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,793
All right.

65
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,798
In order to bring this
ER into the 21st century...

66
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,405
we'll be introducing new equipment
and new procedures on a regular basis.

67
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,541
Now, first up...

68
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,709
my lovely assistant will demonstrate
the patient communication board.

69
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,746
No more pens and paper. This
will make everyone's life easier.

70
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,817
From now on, intubated
patients can point, circle or mark...

71
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,385
any questions or
requests they have.

72
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,524
Beautifully done. Next up,
will be the Freedom Splint.

73
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,990
The federal regulations are
discouraging the use of wrist restraints...

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,400
which, by the way, should
be checked every 10 minutes.

75
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,296
What's so funny, Barnett?

76
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,570
Uh, I just find that
hard to believe.

77
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,731
There's quite a few cases of
patients unattended for a few hours...

78
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,877
who have lost hands to ischemia.

79
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,570
Therefore, we are gonna
start using the Freedom Splint.

80
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,510
Any volunteers?
Volunteers. Any volunteers?

81
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,513
Hey.

82
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,017
- Thank you, Jerry.
- All right.

83
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,087
The Freedom Splint
is less restrictive...

84
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,191
and should be used before
any hard or soft restraints.

85
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,887
The splint is very helpful in preventing
obtunded or combative patients...

86
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,258
Ah.

87
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,730
From pulling out tubes,
picking at wound sites...

88
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,028
and disrupting lifesaving
medical equipment.

89
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,261
Oh, yeah.

90
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,267
Sexy.

91
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,705
- Woo-hoo.
- Thank you, I think.

92
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,812
What's the occasion? <i>Playboy</i>
doing a "Girls of the ER" edition?

93
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,948
Bugger off, Frank.

94
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,016
- You do look very nice.
- Michael's coming home today.

95
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,311
Well, hello, soldier.

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
Vic, Darrel just put his head
through the supply cabinet.

97
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,455
Give him five of Haldol.

98
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,953
Wait, make it 10.

99
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,186
He's like a rogue elephant. What,
shoot it from a tranquilizer gun?

100
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,660
We got one of those?

101
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,059
It was a joke. Hey, X-ray,
you and me, tag team.

102
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,633
- You distract him, I shoot him.
- Distract with what?

103
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,135
You pretend to be a rodeo clown.
Come on, do something. You go first.

104
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,299
Heads up, guys,
multiple GSWs coming in.

105
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,341
Abby, you're with me.
Neela, call the O.R.

106
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,309
Make sure a suite is open.
Pratt, prepare Trauma 1 and 2.

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,472
I'll clear the rooms.
Call the blood bank.

108
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,413
- Tell them we'll need some O-neg.
- Okay!

109
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,984
Uh...

110
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,347
Is this a gang shooting?

111
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,200
Father used his daughter
as a human shield.

112
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,316
- Oh, lovely.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,452
- Well, you missed show-and-tell.
- Huh?

114
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,155
Clemente is implementing
some changes. New equipment.

115
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,824
They gonna make him head of
the ER? That's what they're saying.

116
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,971
The guy who got you and Neela
suspended for working on a monkey?

117
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,835
- It was a chimp.
- If he wants the position, he can have it.

118
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,272
He can open a petting
zoo in the doctor's lounge.

119
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,435
Ten-year-old, single
GSW to the right chest.

120
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,513
BP, 85/60. Pulse, 120.

121
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,343
- Pulse ox?
- Ninety-six on two liters.

122
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,508
- What's your name?
- Vincent calls me Mezoti.

123
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,210
- Who's Vincent?
- Guy she was with.

124
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,855
She's a kidnap victim. Her
abductor started shooting.

125
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,490
- We returned fire.
- You shot her?

126
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,526
No, I had a clear shot. But the guy's gun
must've discharged when he went down.

127
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,186
Is Vincent dead?

128
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,740
Seventy-three's bringing him in.

129
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,995
Guy got popped a bunch
of times, once in the head.

130
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,795
- He shot one of our guys.
- Got this?

131
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,801
- Yep.
- Okay, I'll wait for the next one.

132
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,963
Come on. Let's get
you fixed up, okay?

133
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,379
- It really hurts.
- I know.

134
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,238
We're gonna make it stop
hurting real soon, okay?

135
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,811
- I lost Coogy.
- Who's Coogy?

136
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,278
My stuffed puppy.

137
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,713
Maybe the police found
him. I'm sure he's okay.

138
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,351
One's open, blood's on its way.

139
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,181
- Need a hand?
- No, I think we got this. Thank you, Sam.

140
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,386
Hi. Nice mustache.

141
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,051
Ian, uh, Summerlin?

142
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,696
Your buddies do that?

143
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,197
I wouldn't call them my
buddies, but, uh, yeah.

144
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,337
- We live in the same dorm.
- Freshman?

145
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,529
How'd you guess?

146
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,901
Thought campus life
was supposed to be fun.

147
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,038
If you like being tortured.

148
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,809
- You've been vomiting?
- Yeah, I puked all night.

149
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,677
Keg party?

150
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,581
Pass out, wake up with a bad
hangover and a Magic Marker facial?

151
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:40,777
Something like that.

152
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,556
Okay, well, you don't have a
fever, so it's probably not viral.

153
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,023
Your BP's a little low, which
means you're maybe dehydrated.

154
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,221
All right. Thank you. Um...

155
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,094
- If I have to puke again...?
- Ah.

156
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,565
Here you go.

157
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,796
Uh, you got anything
a little bigger?

158
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,968
Well, if it isn't
the hatchet lady.

159
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,907
Which beloved employee
are you axing today?

160
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,808
Stick a sock in it, Frank.

161
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,777
I'm sending Haleh
her last check.

162
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,473
You want to include a note?

163
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,210
Haleh was Eve's idea. I
was just following orders.

164
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,752
That's what Himmler said.

165
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:19,017
You got a letter here somewhere
from your jailbird boyfriend. Yeah.

166
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,783
Probably marrying his cellmate.

167
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,290
Jimmy Howe, 25. GSW to
the upper arm, lot of blood loss.

168
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,958
Have no fear, Dr. Pratt is here.

169
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,467
- This isn't the shooter?
- No.

170
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,630
This is my first week riding
solo. I just got out of the academy.

171
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,606
- The bullet snuck under his vest.
- The other guy's critical.

172
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,971
We took what they told us.

173
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,171
- BP, 100/65. Pulse, 120.
- Must've bagged the brachial artery.

174
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,248
- I can't feel my hand.
- Median nerve too.

175
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,477
- Am I gonna lose my arm?
- No, we can repair the artery.

176
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,918
- You okay with this?
- Yup. I'm all over it.

177
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,529
- Where you been?
- Doing stuff.

178
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,925
I'll do some stuff on your head. We
need O-neg from the blood bank. Go now!

179
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,986
Never seen him move that fast.

180
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,243
I can't move my hand.

181
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,061
May have bruised the nerve.
- What's this?

182
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,829
Penetrating axillary trauma
with neurovascular deficit.

183
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,301
You wanna clamp the bleeder?

184
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,408
- If we can visualize it.
- I'm getting dizzy. Don't let me die.

185
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,168
- You won't die.
- Don't let me die.

186
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,245
- Hey, you with the 23rd?
- What? Yeah.

187
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,939
Ready? One, two, three.

188
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,583
My father and brother
are with the 17 and the 109.

189
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,812
- Really?
- Uh-huh. You know Joe Butchitelli?

190
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,651
Yeah, he helped me through
the academy. He's your brother?

191
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,417
No, he gave me my first orgasm.

192
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,824
What? It was a milestone.

193
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,876
<i>How's the pulse ox?</i>

194
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,927
- Holding on 92.
<i>- What's the status on the other patients?</i>

195
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,767
Uh, Pratt's got a cop with a
grazing GSW to the upper arm.

196
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,408
There's another victim en route.

197
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,669
<i>All right. I'm on my way down.</i>

198
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,402
The station confirmed her ID.

199
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,480
Her name's Sydney Carlyle.

200
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,982
She was abducted in a campsite
from upstate New York in August.

201
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,285
Is your real name Sydney?

202
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,325
It's okay. You can tell me.

203
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,528
- Yes.
- Yeah?

204
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,159
We're gonna have
to do a rape exam.

205
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,162
I'll open a kit.

206
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:17,037
Sydney, we're gonna check
between your legs, okay?

207
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,044
Is Vincent dead?

208
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,148
Vincent Jansen, the
creep who took her.

209
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,551
- I don't know.
- They shot him.

210
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,339
How big's the pneumothorax?

211
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,321
Abby.

212
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:41,957
Multiple abrasions adjacent
to the external genitalia.

213
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,594
Four lacerations to the labia
in various stages of healing.

214
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,414
Did Vincent hurt you?

215
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,393
Did he touch you
in your private parts?

216
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,468
Only when we play
the married game.

217
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,526
Vincent loves me.

218
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,303
Systolic's down to 70.

219
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,033
Hey, shooter's here.

220
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,012
Thinking about a chest tube?

221
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,583
- Abby?
- Yeah. What?

222
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,484
- Chest tube.
- Yeah.

223
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:40,286
- They're processing the film.
- Okay. Don't wait. Just do it now.

224
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,328
Right. Betadine and Steri-Drape.

225
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,626
Vincent Jansen, 34, multiple
GSWs to the chest and abdomen.

226
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,840
- One to the melon.
- You didn't intubate.

227
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,304
- Spontaneous resps, satting at 96.
- He needs two IVs.

228
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,667
Full up! Exam 2.

229
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,672
- How's the little girl?
- She's stable.

230
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,037
- Tony Gates.
- Dr. Rasgotra.

231
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,372
- BP's at 100 palp.
- Should've needled the chest.

232
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,911
- No time.
- He's bleeding out.

233
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,743
He shot through our windshield,
almost blew Gates' head.

234
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,011
I saw my life flash before my
eyes. I think we were on a beach.

235
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,417
Stop. Can we focus
here? I lost the radial pulse.

236
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,821
- Needs two chest tubes and central line...
- Yowza, look at that head shot.

237
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,517
He needs a couple
of chest tubes...

238
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,493
- Isn't that your patient?
- I can do that with my eyes closed.

239
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,224
It's probably
best if you didn't.

240
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,890
I'll call you if I need help.

241
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,330
Yeah, you'll call me.

242
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,404
His head could roll off,
you wouldn't call me.

243
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,232
- 110/70.
- Is that good?

244
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,742
- Couldn't be better.
- Okay, just sliding off the vest.

245
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,805
Damn. Okay, we need to
lift your arm to take a look.

246
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,873
- Aah!
- Aah!

247
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,828
- All right. Got it.
- Oh, God. I'm bleeding out.

248
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,287
- No, you're not.
- Jimmy, look at me. Look at me.

249
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,856
Is Marty Stats still the
desk sergeant at the 23?

250
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,549
What? Yeah.

251
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,155
He used to baby-sit me. You know
he's got a metal plate in his head?

252
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,322
I need a procedural tray.
- Right away.

253
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,467
- What's happening?
- Sterile gloves, please.

254
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,433
- What's happening?
- We need to clamp the artery you severed.

255
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,663
Oh, man. SAM: Can I
steal your HemoCue?

256
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,863
Help yourself.

257
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,100
Eve, you want me
to take over for you?

258
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,041
Sure. Yeah, that would be good.
I gotta go check on the others.

259
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,882
Hang in there, Jimmy.
I'll be right back.

260
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,181
Cut, please.

261
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,054
Did they find Coogy?

262
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,089
- Who is that?
- Um, her stuffed animal.

263
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,759
He's a puppy.

264
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,729
Yeah.

265
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,025
- I don't know.
- Great. Hang on.

266
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,398
- I got her mom.
- Okay. Vaseline gauze dressing on that.

267
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,265
Hi, Mrs. Carlyle,
this is Abby Lockhart.

268
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,603
I'm treating your daughter.

269
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,143
Uh, yes, she was
shot in the chest.

270
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,941
But we're doing all we can
for her, and she's doing well.

271
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,948
She's a very brave little girl.

272
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,612
Uh, sure. Just a minute.

273
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,383
Two hundred cc's
in the Thora-Seal.

274
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,450
It's your mom.

275
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,119
Mom?

276
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,738
I miss you too.

277
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,801
I am.

278
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,805
Yeah. I will.

279
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,970
I love you too.

280
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,878
Okay.

281
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,186
Hi, I'll give you back
to the police now.

282
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:25,415
We have to treat your daughter, but
we'll see you in a couple hours. Okay.

283
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,185
Mrs. Carlyle? Officer Yau.

284
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,258
It's okay, Sydney.
You're safe now.

285
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,458
Your parents are coming to get
you, and nobody can hurt you here.

286
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,132
What about Vincent?

287
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,704
Don't worry about him anymore.

288
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:43,365
- How's the chest tube output?
- Less than 500 cc's. Small hemothorax.

289
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,978
Should be able to
manage her conservatively.

290
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,580
Hey, nice lid. You get a
free bowl of soup with that?

291
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,341
Pressure's down, 80/50.

292
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,213
Okay, call for type-specific
and, uh, run in 500 of saline.

293
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,751
No, let's not do that.

294
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,983
Hi, there. I'm Dr. Clemente.
We'll put a little glop on your belly.

295
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,026
Then, we'll take this
camera to look inside, okay?

296
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,828
Are you the little princess I
heard was coming this morning?

297
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,164
I'm not a princess.

298
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,802
Um, she's hypotensive.

299
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,837
- Hypotensive can be a good thing.
- What are you talking about?

300
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,065
Leave her systolic at
80, right, Dr. Dubenko?

301
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,541
Right. Permissive hypotension.
Landmark papers by Bickell and Mattox.

302
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,943
With vascular injury, you need a
low pressure to stabilize the clots.

303
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,980
You usually blast
away blood and fluids.

304
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,745
And then you raise the
pressure and blow out the clot.

305
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:30,151
Lots of sub-Q air in the
chest wall, but the belly's dry.

306
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:34,055
Okay. We never allow the pressure to
drift this low, so I'm checking with Kovac.

307
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,061
Abby, the chief of surgery
agrees with our plan.

308
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,964
We're gonna make you
brand-new, all right, sweetie pie?

309
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,729
Okay, I'm in. Hooking it up.

310
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,836
Sounds like tension pneumo here.

311
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,002
Okay, 0 silk and Xeroform next.

312
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,977
Five centimeters
in the Thora-Seal.

313
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,275
Pressure's up, 120/70.

314
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,251
Excellent. He just needs
a little blood to his brain.

315
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,615
Nice work.

316
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,018
I heard Gallant's home on leave. I
didn't get a chance to see him last time.

317
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,899
Actually, he gets home today.
Hopefully he'll be here longer this time.

318
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,000
Well, tell him to stop
by. I'll buy him a beer.

319
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,205
Hey, this guy just looked at me.

320
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,702
Four-by-fours and Elastoplasts.
He's got spontaneous eye-opening.

321
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,405
- Calm yourself!
- Son of a...

322
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,244
Stop! You have tubes in your
chest. Push four of Versed.

323
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,682
Stop it! You're hurting me!

324
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,419
No! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Neela.

325
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,285
God! NEELA: I'm trying.

326
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,966
You okay?

327
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,267
Yeah, his head injury
isn't as bad as it looks.

328
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,342
No, it's a clean
frontal-lobe injury.

329
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,310
No vital functions are affected, but he'll
have ongoing impulse-control problems.

330
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,142
- Where's Sydney?
- Safe from you.

331
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,285
I didn't hurt her.

332
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,920
- I took care of her.
- You raped her.

333
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,716
You don't understand. I
need to see her, please, okay?

334
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,051
Sydney! NEELA: Shut up.

335
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,285
- God. I didn't do anything wrong.
- Sounds like the lung is back up.

336
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,120
You think you know
me, but you don't.

337
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,232
She loves me.

338
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,994
- Not much blood from the chest.
- It's all in the belly.

339
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,104
She needed me.

340
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,737
- She wanted me.
- Looks like hemoperitoneum.

341
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,275
- And a grade-four hepatic injury.
- Grade-four?

342
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,504
A.k.a. chopped liver.

343
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,808
I know what you're
thinking. You want me to die.

344
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,508
I want you to shut up.

345
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,918
- Tachy at 120. HemoCue is eight.
- Can you transfuse another two units?

346
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,285
- How soon can he go up to the O.R.?
- No vacancy.

347
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,690
- I can turn over a room in 20 minutes.
- Okay. You've got 10.

348
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,762
Have the blood bank
stay ahead four units.

349
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,125
Maybe you should
just let me die.

350
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,602
- A little more exposure?
- Sure.

351
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,001
Suction?

352
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,967
- I got your blood.
- Great, thanks.

353
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,873
Give it to her,
and get over here.

354
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,946
- More four-by-fours?
- You read my mind.

355
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,309
- You visualize the brachial?
- I'm working on it.

356
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,681
- Eve was complaining about you today.
- I don't even know who that is.

357
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,947
The nurse manager. Tall, blond?

358
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,284
Oh, yeah, that Amazon?
She doesn't like me.

359
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,518
Hey, show some respect. This
is her turf, you're lucky to be here.

360
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,958
You wanna do your community
service in some smelly-ass soup kitchen?

361
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,191
- Well, do you?
- No.

362
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,063
- Better get your act together, then.
- Okay. There it is.

363
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,966
Okay. Ease up on the gauze.

364
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,869
- Whoa, Ray!
- Sorry about that.

365
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,962
Proximal pressure.
I'm telling you, I hear

366
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,069
one more complaint
about you, and your ass...

367
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,982
- One hell of a pep talk.
- Let's get a gurney in here.

368
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,377
- How much saline has she had?
- Very little. It's TKO.

369
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,183
- BP's 80 palp.
- Why aren't you giving her fluids?

370
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,986
Permissive hypotension. We
don't wanna disrupt hemostasis.

371
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,254
- When's she going to the O.R.?
- We're waiting.

372
00:19:56,462 --> 00:20:00,092
You can't do permissive hypotension
without a plan. Give her a liter wide-open.

373
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,326
No. I've had experience
with this, it works.

374
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,697
I don't want our
Residents in the position...

375
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,271
of using unproven
therapies on critical patients.

376
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,374
Dr. Kovac, we need
you back in here.

377
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,477
Get her pressure
up to 100 systolic.

378
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,079
- Dr. Clemente.
- Just a minute, please.

379
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,216
All right, well, CT's calling
about your patient, Darrel Insley.

380
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,443
Yeah? So, what did
Big Darrel do now?

381
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,280
He stopped breathing.

382
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,752
And why the hell
would he do that?

383
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,890
Don't give a fluid bolus unless
the M.A.P. drops below 70.

384
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,561
- BP's down to 60 palp.
- The packed cells?

385
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,636
- Units three and four.
- Hang another two.

386
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,795
Mr. Jansen? Vincent?

387
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,270
- Can you hear me?
- Sux and etomidate, 8-0 tube.

388
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,143
- Can we get him upstairs?
- No O.R. for 10 minutes.

389
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,042
- At least move him to pre-op.
- He'll bleed in the elevator.

390
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,376
Our job is to save
lives, not judge them.

391
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,218
Death is the easy way out.

392
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,782
He deserves to rot in jail.

393
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,282
I'm in, bag him.

394
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,487
What are you doing?

395
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,628
- Exploratory laparotomy.
- Here? Now?

396
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,288
Sterile drapes, cutdown tray,
masks and gowns. Scrub in, Neela.

397
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,902
You wanna save this guy?
It's the only way I know how.

398
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,435
Sydney? Come on, honey.

399
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,108
Come on, baby.

400
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,142
Hey, Luka!

401
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,839
Sydney?

402
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,682
Come on, Sydney.

403
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,611
Come on. Let's stay awake.

404
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,019
Say hi to your mom and dad, huh?

405
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,523
Sydney? Somebody
get Kovac in here now.

406
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,456
Tachy to 150.
BP not registering.

407
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,188
Starting CPR. I
can't get a pulse.

408
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,332
- What do you need?
- Help. She's going down.

409
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,094
Squeeze in saline, give me two units
packed cells. You did type and cross her?

410
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,601
- I did.
- Where's she bleeding?

411
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,467
I don't know. Chest tube
slowed to 300 cc's. Belly's clean.

412
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,233
Stay ahead of a
patient like this.

413
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,674
- My Attending felt otherwise.
- I'm the Attending now. Prep the chest.

414
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,110
If she's not back with a
saline bolus, crack her.

415
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,773
- I was just talking to her.
- Go ahead and intubate.

416
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,317
6-0, ET and suction.

417
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,983
Okay. Got it.

418
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,283
- Here goes nothing.
- All right.

419
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,925
Oh, looking good. Dry as a bone.

420
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,493
Okay, moist four-by-four's.
Let down the weitlaners.

421
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,823
Did you save my arm?

422
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,965
Bleeding is controlled.
Got this from here?

423
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,067
Piece of cake.
Dry Kerlix, please.

424
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,863
- What's his damage?
- One-and-a-half-centimeter scalp lac.

425
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,130
Am I gonna have a scar?

426
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,536
Oh, nothing anybody
will be able to see.

427
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,734
- What if I shave my head?
- Not a good idea. Not with that helmet.

428
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,345
- Two to three staples ought to do it.
- I got this.

429
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,879
I never fainted before.

430
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,313
Probably the best thing
you could've done today.

431
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,884
- What do you mean?
- Eve was gonna give you the boot.

432
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,921
Now she'll probably let
you stay, just out of pity.

433
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,750
Hold still.

434
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,090
- Ow!
- Yeah, that's gonna burn a little.

435
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:45,527
It got a little tricky, but he's a
tough kid. He's gonna be just fine.

436
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,927
Good to see you.

437
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,431
I'll come find you guys
when I have more details.

438
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:55,269
- Got a thing for the boys in blue, huh?
- Oh, no. I know half of them.

439
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:59,378
My dad was a cop,
retired. My brother. Fiancé.

440
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,343
- You're engaged?
- No, I was.

441
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,642
A few years ago. He
was killed on the job.

442
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,012
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

443
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,280
I still have a thing for
that uniform, though.

444
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,048
Yeah.

445
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,122
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

446
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,556
Under what circumstances...

447
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,960
would a prisoner be transferred
from one state to another?

448
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,632
- Your ex?
- He wrote me a letter.

449
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,258
He's being moved from Canyon
City in Colorado to Cook County.

450
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,235
It could be a lot of reasons,
but I can check it out for you.

451
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,704
Thanks.

452
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,974
Sam, this man is
looking for Dr. Rasgotra.

453
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,979
- She is with a patient.
- That's what I told him.

454
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,150
- Dad, please. Can we just go?
- Zoe.

455
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,946
Excuse me, uh, I wanna
talk to this doctor right now.

456
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,921
Yeah, well, you're gonna have
to wait. Unless I can help you.

457
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,117
She wrote this prescription for
my daughter and I wanna know why.

458
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,656
- Doesn't your daughter know?
- She won't tell me.

459
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,821
- Dad, you're making a scene...
- Shh.

460
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,167
If your daughter won't tell you, sir,
there's nothing we can do about it.

461
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,668
Excuse me. Yes, there is.

462
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,671
You can get this damn
doctor for me right now...

463
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,469
before I hit this whole
place with a malpractice suit.

464
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,078
- I got lawyers, lady.
- Yeah? Well, I've got Jerry.

465
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:11,809
So unless you wanna be carried out
of here like a dirty diaper, take a seat.

466
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,220
Come on, Zoe.

467
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,851
Thanks.

468
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,085
You know, I abhor violence.

469
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,492
Yeah, I know that,
but he doesn't.

470
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,529
So give him your
best tough-guy face.

471
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,194
Here we go.

472
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:35,933
From the xiphoid to
the symphysis pubis.

473
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,748
What kind of
retractor do you need?

474
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,777
The human kind.

475
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,973
Lots of exposure.

476
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,943
- What's this?
- Linea alba.

477
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,550
Straight through it to
the pre-peritoneal fat.

478
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,816
Retract the deep fascia.
- Got it.

479
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,859
Neela, you got a call on
line one. It sounds urgent.

480
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,720
- Take a message. You need scissors?
- Nope.

481
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,559
Poke a finger through the
peritoneum and tear it open.

482
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:05,303
It's from a Lt. Strickland. He's
calling from a Camp Claiborne in Iraq.

483
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,803
Okay. Stand back.

484
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,544
Oh, God.

485
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,906
I can't take it,
Jerry. Get a number.

486
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,570
Okay. Suction.

487
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,713
Lap pads.

488
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,053
Not responding to
fluids. She's in P.E.A.

489
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,016
- Brady to 60.
- 10 blade to Abby. Rib spreader to me.

490
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,818
I'm not used to
doing this on kids.

491
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,923
Pretty much the same,
just everything's smaller.

492
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,537
Pleura is dry.

493
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,108
Check the pericardium.

494
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,781
Oh, my God. It's full
of blood. Really full.

495
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,113
- Damn it. She's in tamponade.
- Too much pressure on the heart.

496
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,879
- She collapsed her ventricles.
- Pick up a Metz.

497
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,593
Where's Clemente?

498
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,562
Three lap pads around
the suprahepatic space.

499
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,334
Three around Morrison's.
And the liver is packed off.

500
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,636
Eight units in, pressure's
up to 90 systolic.

501
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,472
- That'll do.
- O.R.'s ready.

502
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:24,310
Okay. It helps to compress the
liver up against the diaphragm.

503
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,543
- That was brilliant.
- Another five minutes...

504
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,278
we'd have been taking
him to the morgue. Let's go.

505
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,386
Sorry about your floor.

506
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,393
Ready for another unit.

507
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,298
- What the hell happened?
- Cardiac tamponade.

508
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:45,529
- Impossible. It was a peripheral wound.
- A bullet's trajectory can go anywhere.

509
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,572
She had a hemothorax. She
was only bleeding in the chest.

510
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,074
She's bleeding in the pericardium.
Pressure kept her heart from filling.

511
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,509
Impossible. There was
no indication of tamponade.

512
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,808
Didn't you check for
effusion on ultrasound?

513
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,918
Of course, but there was sub-Q
air. I couldn't get a clear view.

514
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,487
She needed volume to fill her
ventricle and you withheld fluids.

515
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:07,257
Based on what we knew, permissive
hypotension was reasonable.

516
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:08,689
It killed her.

517
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:12,389
Um, her parents are coming
here to take her home.

518
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,634
They think she was rescued. Can
we keep her alive until they get here?

519
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,465
Okay. Let's
cross-clamp the aorta.

520
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,801
She's not bleeding in
her belly. She's gone.

521
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:28,473
This will help perfuse her heart and brain
till we get more blood in. Vascular clamp.

522
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,579
Vascular clamp!

523
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,455
Dr. Rasgotra. What's
the word on that little girl?

524
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,256
They're working. The guy
you brought in pulled through.

525
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,954
Wish it was the
other way around.

526
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,101
Well, at least child molesters
don't last long in prison, right?

527
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,168
Are you a Hawks fan?

528
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:55,239
- Excuse me?
- Chicago Blackhawks. Hockey.

529
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,605
I have two tickets to Friday's game
against the Kings. You interested?

530
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,303
You, me, hot wings, cold beer?

531
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,914
Sorry.

532
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,182
You more a theater gal?

533
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:08,912
I figured as much. I also have tickets
to the opera and the philharmonic.

534
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,283
- What? You moonlight as a scalper?
- No.

535
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,788
Actually my cousin does.

536
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,120
I appreciate it, but I
don't get much time off.

537
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,093
Yeah, I know that story. You
know what? We'll just stay home.

538
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,927
We'll stay home, order a deep-dish,
you can quiz me on renal pathophysiology.

539
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,466
What do you know about it?

540
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:27,197
Not enough, that's why I need your
help. It's one of my fourth-year electives.

541
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,966
- Fourth year of what?
- Medical school.

542
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,338
You know, I just do
this for the free coffee.

543
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,173
Look, maybe some other time.

544
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,542
I'm sorry. I have to deal
with something urgent.

545
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,149
No problem.

546
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,142
I'll see you around.

547
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,681
Doc.

548
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,787
- You have that lieutenant's number?
- Yeah.

549
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,985
- Did he say what it was about?
- Sorry.

550
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,496
Don't you have something
sarcastic to say, Frank?

551
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,156
No.

552
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,238
Hey! Hey, is this you?

553
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,706
Dr. Rasgotra?

554
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,507
- Yes.
- Great.

555
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,876
You mind telling me
what these are for?

556
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,508
You see the patient's name below
mine? That's who the prescription is for.

557
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,053
Unless you're Zoe Butler,
I can't tell you anything.

558
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,192
Look, if you treated my
daughter, I need to know why.

559
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,658
I'm sorry, sir. There
are confidentiality rules.

560
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,764
Confidentiality?
She's a little kid.

561
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,058
You didn't have my
permission to treat her.

562
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,202
You know what, I wanna
see your supervisor.

563
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,668
- Let's go.
- He won't tell you anything different.

564
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:35,535
- In these situations...
- What situations?

565
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,040
Is she pregnant? Is
she using drugs? What?

566
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,702
- I'm her father. I have a right to know.
- Dad, please.

567
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:45,078
If you want information, it has
to come from Zoe, not from me.

568
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,582
Excuse me.

569
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:49,517
- I'm Dr. Barnett.
- I've got this.

570
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:50,917
- You her boss?
- Ray.

571
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,051
Yeah, um...

572
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,024
Mr. Butler, my name's Ray
Barnett, and the thing is...

573
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,060
I, uh, need to speak
with you in private.

574
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,755
- Neela...
- Ray.

575
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,891
- Let me deal with this.
- No.

576
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,272
- I can handle this.
- You can't.

577
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,636
- Yes, I can.
- How?

578
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,377
By talking? Telling him his daughter
has a sexually transmitted disease?

579
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,609
If you do, it's a breach
of confidentiality.

580
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:17,948
I wanna do the right thing.

581
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,778
You wanna violate
her privacy too?

582
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,254
What you did is a crime, Ray.

583
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,755
If you tell him the truth, you'll
go to jail. You know that, right?

584
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,921
The best thing you can do is just let
it go and allow me to deal with this.

585
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:34,960
Clear!

586
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,930
- Asystole.
- Resume compressions.

587
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,069
See if you can find a
hole in the right ventricle.

588
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,239
- Did she have a high-dose epi?
- Five minutes ago.

589
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,905
Get this cardiac injury to
occlude, and get ventricular filling.

590
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,174
Pulseless V-fib and
asystole for 25 minutes.

591
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,750
Still not perfusing with
open compressions.

592
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:56,150
- I'm giving her another chance.
- All you're giving her is more abuse.

593
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,119
Stop it.

594
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,290
Just stop it.

595
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,469
Three forty-nine.

596
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:32,489
I'll sew up the chest
before the family gets here.

597
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,476
<i>Camp Claiborne.</i>

598
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,049
Hello, I'm trying to reach
a Lt. Strickland, please.

599
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,413
<i>Your name and to what
this is regarding, please.</i>

600
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,089
Neela Rasgotra.
I'm returning his call.

601
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,122
<i>One moment, ma'am.</i>

602
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,718
Come on.

603
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,886
<i>- Miss Rasgotra?</i>
- Yes.

604
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,998
<i>Lt. Strickland. I understand
you're a friend of Michael Gallant.</i>

605
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,658
- Yes, yes, I am.
<i>- I have some bad news, ma'am.</i>

606
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,929
<i>There was an incident
outside of Mosul.</i>

607
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,368
<i>Insurgents struck a
convoy at the airport.</i>

608
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,533
- Hello?
<i>- I'm afraid, I can't...</i>

609
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,337
Lieutenant, can you hear me?

610
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,841
<i>- I can't tell you...</i>
- Lt. Strickland, are you there?

611
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:34,544
<i>Several casualties. Michael's
unit had a heavy patient flow.</i>

612
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,780
<i>He will be unable to make it
home on leave as anticipated.</i>

613
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,720
<i>The CASH is
incommunicado right now...</i>

614
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,690
<i>so he asked me to pass
this information on to you.</i>

615
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:46,263
But Michael's all right?
He's not injured or anything.

616
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:51,028
<i>No, ma'am. A little homesick and
sand-weary, I imagine, but he's fine.</i>

617
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,205
Uh, thank you, lieutenant.
I appreciate the phone call.

618
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,104
<i>You're welcome, ma'am.
Have a good night.</i>

619
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,920
Hey, does this look
like a subdural to you?

620
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,620
Right here.

621
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,691
- No.
- No.

622
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,605
Ninety-five percent of the time,
controlled hypotension would've worked.

623
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,504
- Make sure you tell that to her family.
- Come on.

624
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,838
There's no reason she
should've had tamponade.

625
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,344
All I know is that she did.

626
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,949
And if she'd been given
fluids, she would have survived.

627
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,584
That's not a certainty.

628
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,188
We would've seen the signs. We
could've drained the pericardium.

629
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:49,692
Look, I did what I thought
was in her best interest.

630
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,592
- Even when two doctors disagreed?
- Dubenko agreed with me.

631
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,290
You'd do the same even if
he hadn't. That's your style.

632
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,232
Do whatever you want, regardless
of what anyone else thinks.

633
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:02,135
- You don't like my style? What is that?
- We were all here a long time before you.

634
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,037
We work together.
You're the new guy.

635
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,872
- You need to fit in, not us.
- What is this, a social club?

636
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,775
If you can't, then
we have a problem.

637
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:12,475
- I take risks to save my patients.
- Especially if you suck in the Residents.

638
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:16,088
- They need to be taught fundamentals.
- I'm about cutting-edge medicine.

639
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,486
- Not esoteric unproven studies!
- I see a problem, I fix it, bam!

640
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,359
- What?
- Maybe, you should fix that.

641
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,660
- Ah.
- Here you go.

642
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,494
Does this happen often?

643
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,194
Only after five or six
beers and a bar fight.

644
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,169
People just seem really wired
after what happened here today.

645
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,831
You picked up on that too, huh?

646
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,239
Maybe we should have
a critical incident debrief...

647
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,141
Yeah, that's a great idea.

648
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,006
Dr. Barnett, we'll have a
critical incident debrief...

649
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,209
in Exam 3 after shift.

650
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,411
- Why?
- Why do you think?

651
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,951
This was a tough
shift for people.

652
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:55,093
It helps if we can get a chance to
decompress before we go home.

653
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,424
Yeah, well, that's why
God created beer, right?

654
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,832
- This thing's mandatory?
- Yes. Pass it on.

655
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,563
What do you think?

656
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,069
Kovac versus Clemente
in a street fight?

657
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,399
Kovac has size...

658
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,065
but I have a feeling
Clemente's kind of squirrelly.

659
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,676
I think you need help.

660
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,710
What are you doing?

661
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,079
Nothing.

662
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,385
What happened to your nose?

663
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,289
Kovac.

664
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,224
He hit you?

665
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,195
No, but I bet he
would've liked to have.

666
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,630
You know, the last
time I got one of these...

667
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,238
was when Tina Marino
caught me with her cousin.

668
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:44,240
Let me see. Let me see.

669
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,746
- I think you need to be packed.
- It's tapering off.

670
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,644
- Yeah, that's not working.
- Lockhart, I'm fine.

671
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,444
I'm fine.

672
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,524
I'm really sorry
about the little girl.

673
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,830
Me too.

674
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,166
I was trying to save her, despite
what Dr. Kovac might think.

675
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,737
I know.

676
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,038
Okay.

677
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,812
I'm really, really sorry.

678
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,256
Okay. Put your head back.

679
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,523
Hey, Kerry.

680
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,666
Have you found someone to
replace Susan as chief of the ER?

681
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,994
We're still looking
at candidates.

682
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,034
Is, uh, Clemente the favorite?

683
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,069
He's certainly up there. Why?

684
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,639
I'm just not sure he's the
right person for the job.

685
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:53,677
Yeah, well, if you think of somebody
better, feel free to give me a call.

686
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,643
Uh, what about me?

687
00:36:57,082 --> 00:37:00,143
You? I didn't think
you wanted to be chief.

688
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,118
Luka, it's really
not your style.

689
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,258
Maybe it's time for
me to change my style.

690
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,826
I've been here for a long time. I know
the people, I know the department.

691
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,361
I just wanna put my
name into the mixture.

692
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,163
Mix.

693
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,261
All right. I'll let the committee
know you're interested.

694
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,664
Thank you.

695
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:22,365
Eve's waiting for you guys in
Exam 3 for the big powwow.

696
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,805
- She said it was mandatory.
- So did Clemente.

697
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,673
They want us to express our
feelings about what happened today.

698
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,645
Well, today sucked. Good night.

699
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,580
Great. Was it mandatory for
everyone except the Attendings?

700
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:34,980
Edna Cassleman, 56...

701
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,748
found down in the park,
altered, no sign of trauma.

702
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,790
Thank you, Edna. Tell Eve
I'm with a patient. Ha-ha.

703
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,725
Well, it can't be
that bad, can it?

704
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,229
It's not that. Michael's
leave has been postponed.

705
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,163
I'm sorry. Can I come by the
house tonight, pick up my amp?

706
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:51,564
Yeah. Whatever.

707
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,605
I really don't feel like sticking around
for this damn thing. I'll ditch if you do.

708
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:59,608
I've got dinner reservations at
Gibson's if you wanna grab a drink or five.

709
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,178
Wow, I like the way you
think, roomie. Your treat, right?

710
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:05,875
- As long as you stop calling me that.
- Okay.

711
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,860
How's the nose?

712
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,836
Seems to be working.

713
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,128
Thank you.

714
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,603
The hell with this. Go home.

715
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,843
See you later.

716
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,382
Eve, I thought it was a
great idea. I really did.

717
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,719
This department
needs a lot of work.

718
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,418
This department
needs a kick in the ass.

719
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,905
Her parents show up?

720
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,269
No. They should be here soon.

721
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,335
After all she's been through...

722
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,805
maybe she's better off.

723
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,084
I'm not sure anybody's
better off dead.

724
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,920
We, uh, recovered
this in the parking lot.

725
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,626
She was asking for it earlier.

726
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,458
I gotta go check
in on Officer Howe.

727
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,602
I hear he's driving the
nurses upstairs crazy.

728
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,964
How much trouble will
we get in for not showing?

729
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,731
I'm not working until Saturday.

730
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,535
- Things will have blown over by then.
- You're kidding me.

731
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:15,009
I'm working tomorrow. Great.
Now I'll get punished for both of us.

732
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,641
Whoa! Stop it!
Stop it! Security!

733
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,247
Someone, call security!

734
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,655
Security!

735
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,156
Mr. Butler!

736
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:31,057
Mr. Butler, stop it!

737
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:36,267
You ever come near my
daughter again, and I'll kill you.

738
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,332
You hear me?

739
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,341
Ray...

740
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,179
- I'm fine.
- Ray.

741
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,609
I'm fine.

742
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,062
<i>- Each other.
- Three wide...</i>

743
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,351
<i>Pinpoint across
the Chicago area.</i>

744
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,335
<i>I'm gonna go ahead
and widen the view out.</i>

745
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,692
<i>Big storms across central
Illinois. This is along the...</i>

746
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,771
- Hey.
- Hey.

747
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,033
Wanna come in?

748
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,013
You didn't, uh...

749
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,418
You didn't go to the debriefing.

750
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,713
- Did you?
- Yeah.

751
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,221
It was just me,
Eve and Clemente.

752
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:34,654
You hungry? Want some pizza?

753
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,727
- I can warm it up in...
- I'm not hungry.

754
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,385
Okay.

755
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,064
Mad about something?

756
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:45,964
What do you think?

757
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,732
Yes? Well, I didn't need
to go to the debriefing...

758
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,272
Yeah, I don't care about that.

759
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:54,139
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you and Clemente.

760
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,407
And whatever it is that is
going on between the two of you.

761
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:59,983
If you wanna get into a
pissing match with him, fine.

762
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,779
- Leave me out of it.
- He was wrong.

763
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,478
Oh, yeah.

764
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,850
And that's the most
important thing, isn't it?

765
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,756
He was wrong and you were right.

766
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,289
And while you were arguing
about it, the little girl died.

767
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,933
As if she hadn't
suffered enough.

768
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,800
God. She was 10 years old, Luka.

769
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:32,681
And he had her for
months, and I just...

770
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,309
I just can't stop
thinking about...

771
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:39,714
what she must've gone through.

772
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,690
And I can't stop thinking about
how afraid she must've been.

773
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,058
And I can't stop thinking
about why we couldn't save her.

774
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,721
I just...
