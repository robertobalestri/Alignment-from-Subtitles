1
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:08,038
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,039
I never wanted to be around
this suffering. Who would?

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,408
- I'm glad I came here.
- I'm glad you came too.

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,107
I've been evaluated by the
committee. You know what?

5
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,981
I'm in the clear. You better
start showing me some respect.

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,198
<i>- Getting sleep?</i>
- I'm not doing this.

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,885
<i>- What time you going home?</i>
- I haven't been getting sleep.

8
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,028
And the thing is that I've been
really, really needing some.

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,494
I wish I didn't feel how I feel.

10
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,394
You're the best
friend I've ever had.

11
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:36,025
- Neela, I am a soldier, remember?
- You're also a husband, remember that?

12
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,942
One of the drivers got hit.

13
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,853
Corporal Milton,
can you hear me?

14
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,193
Okay. He's gonna be okay.

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,967
- I want you to hold pressure here.
- I just called the CASH.

16
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,472
- They're sending a chopper.
- That's not gonna work.

17
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,304
How far are we
from the aid station?

18
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,742
FOB Eagle is only about
four kilometers due north.

19
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,179
Okay, okay. On my count,
we'll lift him up onto the truck.

20
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,545
Keep pressure on his neck.

21
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,584
Shouldn't we wait
for the chopper?

22
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,881
He'll bleed out before
they get here. Let's go!

23
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,048
One, two, three.

24
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,790
I don't even think
he's breathing.

25
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,698
Just keep holding
pressure. You're doing good.

26
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,678
His pupils are
fixed and dilated, sir.

27
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,525
We can stop.

28
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,566
Thanks for trying, sir.

29
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,802
He just got engaged.

30
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,104
You got a girl back
home, captain?

31
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,074
Me? Yeah.

32
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,079
I'm married.

33
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,015
My wife, Neela, is a doctor...

34
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,482
Oh, my...

35
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,347
Oh, yes.

36
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,357
Shh, shh, shh.

37
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,831
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

38
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,567
Yeah.

39
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,380
Mothers eat their
own young in the wild...

40
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,841
and we think it's
part of nature, right?

41
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,972
But when women kill their children,
it's a crime, and we think they're crazy.

42
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,153
- What?
- It just makes you wonder, right?

43
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,314
Are the lions crazy too? Or are women
like Susan Smith and Andrea Yates...

44
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,722
just acting upon some
primitive impulse...

45
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,489
that's deep within our
genetic maternal make-up?

46
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,258
- Am I interrupting something?
- Just some girl talk.

47
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,028
Dennis Young,
34, assault victim.

48
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,603
Blunt trauma to head and face.
- Was he mugged?

49
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,230
Looked like a home-invasion
thing. They tuned him up good.

50
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,432
What's your name?

51
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,212
Airway's okay, decent
vitals, moves all extremities.

52
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,316
- Pupils are 5 millimeters. MORALES:
There were two kids with him.

53
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,715
Seventeen's bringing them. They
got worked over, one looks real bad.

54
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,946
Okay, Abby, Trauma 1.

55
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,750
Head, facial and C-spine
CT as soon as you can.

56
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,722
And send Sam out here to help...

57
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,122
- if you see her.
- Okay.

58
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,318
Get out of here.

59
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,735
She invited me in for a drink.
Door wasn't even closed...

60
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,898
- she was tearing my clothes off.
- Yeah, right.

61
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,800
To quote my man Rick James,
"The girl is a super freak."

62
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,633
She had sex toys I've never seen before.
Must have been German or something.

63
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,709
- One took two hands to operate.
- Morris.

64
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,745
Check it out. Oh,
yeah. I tapped that.

65
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,145
- What exactly am I looking at?
- It's Albright.

66
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,410
- Where?
- Right there.

67
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,645
I've seen more convincing
photos of Bigfoot.

68
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,619
But it was dark, I
couldn't use the flash.

69
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,190
Any chance he'll talk to us?

70
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,122
- I don't think so.
- Enlighten me.

71
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,230
- Open skull and facial fractures.
- We got nothing to go on.

72
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,357
- Nobody saw anything.
- Glascow coma scale?

73
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,161
Spontaneous eye opening.

74
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,434
- What's he trying to say?
- He's altered. Don't think he knows.

75
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,525
Withdraws from pain.
- For a total of?

76
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,013
- Twelve.
- We intubate at?

77
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,609
- GCS of nine.
- Excellent.

78
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,938
Blood in the belly?

79
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,951
We were focusing
on the primary survey.

80
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,105
If I wanted excuses,
I'd ask you directly.

81
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,575
Give me the SonoSite.

82
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,084
Any idea why CT scan on
your trampoline guy, Margolis...

83
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,884
- never got to the O.R.?
- I'll have a tech run them up.

84
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,994
- Dubenko wants you to bring them up.
- Hang a gram of Vancomycin.

85
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,187
- Is this about the oral contrast?
- No idea.

86
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,093
It increases the
risk of anesthesia.

87
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,667
If you want my opinion, I'd find
those results and haul my ass up there.

88
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,327
- After we stabilize the patient.
- No. Now.

89
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,473
- We got this. It's okay.
- Belly's clear.

90
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,903
Call me after the scan, Mo.

91
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,544
And have Neurosurg and
Head and Neck take a look.

92
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,411
Did she just call you Mo?

93
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,082
It's a nickname for Morris.

94
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,480
Or homo.

95
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,453
Hey, don't worry, okay?

96
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,386
That little vixen's
getting punished tonight.

97
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,322
Oh, yeah, she's
in store for a little:

98
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,518
<i>Mo-Mo-Morris</i>

99
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,221
<i>How do you like it?
How do you like it?</i>

100
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,390
<i>Oh, yeah, Morris</i>

101
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,860
Hey, stranger.

102
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,834
- Welcome back, Dr. Pratt.
- Thanks.

103
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,201
Glad to see you
survived. How was it?

104
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,240
Well, hot, sweaty, fly-infested.

105
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,378
It was a little
overwhelming, to be honest.

106
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,241
- Did you save a lot of lives?
- I tried.

107
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,094
Three-year-old
Eddie, good pulses.

108
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,185
BP, 100/50. Decided to
stop breathing as we pulled in.

109
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,787
Can you open your eyes, Eddie?
- He's posturing.

110
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,356
He was awake on the scene,
this is all we can get out of him.

111
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,493
- Sam, you're with me.
- He's bradying down.

112
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,683
Probable head bleed.

113
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,059
Thirty mgs of mannitol, call CT,
let's get Neurosurg down here.

114
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,551
Sean, 10 years old, blunt
trauma, face and chest.

115
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,067
Tachy at 135, BP's good,
100 percent on room air.

116
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,102
How are you doing,
Sean? I'm Dr. Pratt.

117
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,534
I wanna stay with Eddie.

118
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,368
He's scared when
I'm not with him.

119
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,376
Don't worry, we'll have you in the
room right next to him. Come on, let's go.

120
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,672
- Damn it, the IV blew.
- Tube.

121
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,449
Who did this?

122
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,053
Ugh.

123
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,880
It must have been the same
guys who busted up the pops.

124
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,425
Looks like the work of meth
heads. What's this kid's story?

125
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,529
Three-year-old,
hypertensive and bradycardic.

126
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,665
Looks like traumatic
head injury.

127
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,461
Okay, I'm in. Bag
him at a rate of 40.

128
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,332
Pupils dilated, left
greater than right.

129
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,331
Step-offs, hematomas.
Could be head trauma.

130
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,436
All right.

131
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,336
Retinal hemorrhage.

132
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,973
Definitely head trauma. Call
Neurosurg and get mannitol onboard.

133
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,618
We've already done that, Vic.

134
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,186
Pulse hanging in the
60s. I still don't have a line.

135
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,947
Okay, throw me an IO needle.

136
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,319
- You don't wanna do that. Trust me.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

137
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,290
Betadine.

138
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,897
The IO drill is the greatest.
Wait till you see this.

139
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,091
- We don't have the pedes model.
- We do. We got it in last week.

140
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,101
I'm gonna show you
how to drive this baby.

141
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,275
- Vic, let me do it.
- No, I got it.

142
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,412
- Come on. I got it.
- I got it. Let me do it.

143
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,413
Vic, come on. Okay, I got it.

144
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,210
Okay, I'll talk you through it.

145
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,148
Tibial tuberosity.
One-finger-breadth medial.

146
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,448
One-finger-breadth
medial, that's what it is.

147
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,715
Are you listening to me?

148
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,519
- He's seizing.
- Two of Ativan.

149
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,630
- I can't. I don't have access.
- Hold on. Hold on.

150
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,559
There you go. That's it.

151
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,929
- Okay, now you do.
- Nice job.

152
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,596
- Get a head CT.
- What's wrong with you?

153
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,869
I'm trying to help
you, that's all.

154
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,876
You don't listen to a word anybody
says. You're all over the place.

155
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,014
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I was...

156
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,292
I just didn't get a
lot of sleep last night.

157
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,151
Seizing stopped.

158
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,776
A hundred and fifty of Dilantin
and pack up for the scanner.

159
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,684
Outside.

160
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,721
- What?
- Now.

161
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,591
What?

162
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,329
- What are you on?
- I'm not on anything.

163
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,735
I just told you. All I ate was
a cup of coffee, that's all.

164
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,837
What? What, you
want a drug test?

165
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,137
You want a drug test
here, now? Go, grab a cup.

166
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,041
- Go ahead. Grab a cup.
- Okay, look.

167
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,773
Why don't you take 20 minutes
and get yourself together?

168
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,281
Because I repeated an order?

169
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,316
Come on, please.
What are you, my moms?

170
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,284
- Luka.
- Frank, not now.

171
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,084
Look, you're an Attending. I need
you to be on the ball. Vic, I'm serious.

172
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,228
Yeah, I'm serious too. You're
seriously starting to piss me off.

173
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,923
Because if you don't wanna work
with me, that's fine. I don't need you.

174
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,566
Vic. Vic... FRANK: Dr. Kovac.

175
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,731
What, Frank?

176
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,599
These gentlemen are
looking for Dr. Rasgotra.

177
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,402
One of them is a
Military Casualty Officer.

178
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,376
Sats are falling, 89.

179
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,916
Can't see the cords, too much
blood. Need a surgical airway.

180
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,485
- Crike tray.
- Slow your roll.

181
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,588
Open a central line
kit. Abby, grab a McGill.

182
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,623
- We're gonna do a retrograde intubation.
- Never seen that work.

183
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,125
You've never seen me do it,
junior. Today's your lucky day.

184
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,856
I'm gonna do a Seldinger technique.
I'm gonna wire up through the cricothyroid.

185
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,263
- It'd be faster to crike him.
- No, you'll get infection and bleeding.

186
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,269
Not to mention subglottic
stenosis and a big, ugly-ass scar.

187
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,839
Sats down to 84. Hypoxia's
not good for you either.

188
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,033
- Where's Neela?
- She got called up to Surgery.

189
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,701
We'll aspirate air, and
then pass the wire through.

190
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,608
There are soldiers
looking for her...

191
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,442
and one of them is a chaplain.

192
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,079
You need to find her.

193
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,084
Yeah, I'm trying to page her.

194
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,524
- Everything okay in here, Abby?
- Yeah, I think so.

195
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,523
We'd be doing better
if you stopped talking...

196
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,787
when I'm trying to show
them how to save his life.

197
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,954
- Listen, Vic...
- Look, I'm all over this.

198
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,895
I'm serious. Go
find Neela, please.

199
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,161
Okay, Abby, look. Look for
the wire in the oropharynx.

200
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,301
- I can't see it.
- You will, you will.

201
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,170
Come on, you son of a bitch.

202
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,805
Damn it.

203
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,172
Come on. MARQUEZ: Got it.

204
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,246
Hey, can you give
this CT to Dr. Dubenko?

205
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,719
I think he wants to see you.

206
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,449
I've been paged to ER. If you
can make sure he gets them.

207
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,925
He was very specific about
speaking with you in person.

208
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,923
Sats, 78, bradying down to 60.

209
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,227
I still can't see your
wire. Open up a crike tray.

210
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,162
- We don't need no crike tray.
- Vic.

211
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,170
Stop staring at me.
Focus on your patient.

212
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,036
Ray, give her more
suction. It's gotta be there.

213
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,102
Wait, wait, wait. I got it.
- All right.

214
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,338
Keep going, keep going.

215
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,813
Stop. It'll guide you
right through the cords.

216
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,851
- Okay. That's enough, Chuny. Thank you.
- Sure.

217
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,450
Hard to pass.

218
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,093
Wiggle it, mommy. Side
to side. Wiggle it, wiggle it.

219
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,922
Okay. I think I'm in.

220
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,031
All right, wire out and bag
him. Call for a portable chest.

221
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,928
- We all good here?
- We're doing great.

222
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,625
- Abby?
- Why you asking her?

223
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,135
I mean, I just told you
we're doing good, right?

224
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,037
I'll go find Neela.

225
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,232
Can you believe this?
It's ridiculous, huh?

226
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,273
What percentage of liver
injuries stop bleeding...

227
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,937
by the time surgical
exploration is performed?

228
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,946
- About half?
- How about 86 percent?

229
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,950
It's okay, you have time to
learn all that in five years.

230
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,143
What?

231
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,380
Seems like all my
complaining's finally paid off.

232
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,355
We've been funded for an
additional slot in a Surgical Residency.

233
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,926
- It's yours for the asking.
- Are you serious?

234
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,415
- Well, if you don't want it...
- No, I want it. I want it.

235
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,758
Sorry, it's the ER.

236
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,425
Ignore it, you're a surgeon.
We never answer the first page.

237
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,094
I'm kidding, go. Come
find me after your shift.

238
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,871
We'll grab a beer
at Ike's to celebrate.

239
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,305
Yeah, that would be great,
but the drinks are on me.

240
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,537
So I guess
congratulations are in order.

241
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,408
Yes, thank you.
Dr. Dubenko just told me.

242
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,839
I'm so excited, can't
wait to get started.

243
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,211
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

244
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,047
Looking forward to
being your Attending.

245
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,382
Right. Wonderful.

246
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,885
Neela, Luka's looking for you.

247
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,293
Yeah, I got his page. Hey, guess
what. I got the Surgical Residency.

248
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,257
- Wow, that's great.
- You should really try to find Luka.

249
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,665
- Yeah, I will.
- Hold up. I need to talk to you.

250
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,737
- Hey, I got it.
- What?

251
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,840
The Surgical Residency.

252
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,873
That's good for you.
That's really great.

253
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,379
Well, try to contain
your enthusiasm.

254
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,174
- I need to tell you something.
- Yeah, Luka's paging me.

255
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,044
I know, and...
Because it's important.

256
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,117
So is my news, but
nobody seems to care.

257
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,914
- Neela, listen...
- It's not like I'm leaving the hospital.

258
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,616
I'm going into Surgery. I'd think you
people would like having me up there.

259
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:26,987
Abby, have you seen Luka?

260
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,256
There are two men
here to see you.

261
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,924
From the Army.

262
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,765
The Army?

263
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,841
We tried to find you.

264
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,889
- Doctor Rasgotra?
- Yes.

265
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,990
I'm Captain Evans,
this is Father Marris.

266
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,025
Is there someplace
more private we can talk?

267
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,325
Can you tell me why
you're here, please?

268
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,095
- I really think it would be better...
- Tell me.

269
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,962
Ma'am, the secretary of the
Army would like to express...

270
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,630
- his deepest regret...
- There must be some mistake.

271
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,675
That your husband, Captain
Gallant, was killed in action.

272
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,437
I'm sorry, you've
got it mixed up.

273
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:23,549
Michael is a doctor. He's
not a "soldier" soldier.

274
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,784
He was killed when his truck
was hit by a roadside bomb.

275
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,884
Again, the secretary extends
his deepest sympathies...

276
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,923
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,386
I'm working. I can't
do this right now.

278
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,944
Please tell Dr. Rasgotra that we're
here to help in any way possible.

279
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,953
Have his parents been notified?

280
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,024
No, but that's something
we can do if she would like.

281
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,717
What about Michael's...?

282
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,090
Her husband's remains?

283
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,665
It will take seven to 10 days for
the deceased to get here from Iraq.

284
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,861
Arrangements will be made to fly him
here to Chicago or wherever she decides.

285
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,061
Okay. I'll pass it on.

286
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,139
All pertinent information
is in the packet.

287
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:26,143
If she has any questions, she
can contact myself or Father Marris.

288
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,838
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

289
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,678
- Hey, was it friendly fire?
- Sir?

290
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,287
How do we really know what
happened over there, huh?

291
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,982
Doesn't this whole war smell to
you a little bit of right-wing cronyism?

292
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,720
With the oil, and the multi-billion-dollar
rebuilding contracts, huh?

293
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,023
You know what real
psychological warfare is?

294
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,463
You coming in here, feeding us a
bunch of lies to placate the masses.

295
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,296
- Shut up.
- Tell me about the deficit.

296
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,495
Why do we have to go
there and kill everyone?

297
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,005
- For democracy?
- I need help with Mr. Engle's blood gas.

298
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,110
- Vic.
- Excuse me. Come on.

299
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,975
Sorry. RAY: I'm
gonna go find Neela.

300
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,173
Make sure she goes home.

301
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,420
Okay, he's doing better.

302
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,652
So why don't we lower
the FlO2 to 70 and then...

303
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,358
we'll grab a...

304
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,097
- Grab an ABG in 20, okay?
- You want me to look at your nose?

305
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,238
No, I'm fine. I'm
fine. Thank you.

306
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,767
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

307
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,033
I'm sorry about what
happened over there...

308
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,440
but those guys coming in here
like storm troopers and just...

309
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,885
It's like I'm a stigmata.

310
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,178
- Why don't you go crash in the lounge?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm really fine.

311
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:47,487
You know there's no rest for the
wicked. You, Abby, should know that.

312
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,762
The intubation was
cool, though, wasn't it?

313
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,763
Gotta put that in your bag of
tricks. I'm telling you, you got...

314
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,896
Look, I gotta take care of this.

315
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,338
- Hey.
- Hey.

316
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,583
- Did you find Neela?
- Ray's looking for her.

317
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,884
You know, I came here today...

318
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,887
thinking about how nice
it is to be back, you know?

319
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,924
I figured I'd come back,
maybe save a few lives.

320
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,460
Maybe even bring somebody
back from the dead, you know?

321
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,256
I damned sure didn't
expect to lose a friend.

322
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,859
Yo, doc.

323
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:33,564
The 10-year-old won't say
anything, and we got nothing.

324
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,033
Did you find mom?

325
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,768
Yeah, she's been in
rehab since November.

326
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,243
Dad's out of it, and
baby's in a coma.

327
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,509
This kid's all we got.
Can you try talking to him?

328
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,209
Yeah.

329
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,547
- How we doing in here?
- Oh, kind of quiet.

330
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,921
Hey, man. You wanna see
something really, really cool?

331
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,297
That's your skeleton.

332
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:05,000
And, see, look right here. This is
where you broke your collarbone.

333
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:09,108
Looks like old rib fractures.

334
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,639
Do you remember
hurting your ribs?

335
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,677
No?

336
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,255
I know you're worried about
your dad and your little brother.

337
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,122
But we got the best
doctors helping them out.

338
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:34,497
So now we need you to help them
too, by telling us what happened.

339
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,328
You do wanna help Eddie, right?

340
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,266
Yeah? Well, then
you need to talk to me.

341
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,010
Eddie wanted to play
with my Bionicle guy...

342
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,845
and I took it away from him.

343
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,652
Then he started crying,
and he wouldn't stop.

344
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,187
So my dad started shaking him.

345
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,594
Did your dad hit you?

346
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,358
He punched me, then
threw me into a chair.

347
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,170
And what about your brother?

348
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,803
Eddie kept crying...

349
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,310
and he kept shaking him.

350
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,808
Telling him to shut
up using the F-word.

351
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,112
And then he grabbed Eddie's
head and slammed it against the wall.

352
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,387
Then Eddie was crying so
hard that he couldn't breathe.

353
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,430
So I got my baseball
bat and hit him.

354
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,199
You hit your dad?

355
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,562
I wanted him to
leave Eddie alone.

356
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,639
How many times did you hit him?

357
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,246
Until he stopped.

358
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,519
I was just talking to
him four days ago.

359
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,638
He was complaining
about the food...

360
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,100
and I was complaining about
how cold Abby's apartment is.

361
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,777
I honestly don't even remember
what else we were talking about.

362
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,711
I'm so sorry, Neela.

363
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,945
We all are.

364
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,847
You know, I was probably ordering
a latte or watching <i>Celebrity Poker...</i>

365
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,584
when he was being
blown up by a bomb.

366
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,954
Just like that, he's gone.

367
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,131
Listen, if you need anything...

368
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,200
- Or you want me to do anything...
- No, Ray, I don't.

369
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,103
I don't need you to do anything.

370
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,176
I just... I need to
go back to work.

371
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,972
No, Neela, look.

372
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,909
You need to go home,
take care of things.

373
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,711
- You need to take care of yourself.
- You know, I don't have a home.

374
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,820
I don't have a husband.
I don't have anything.

375
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:11,719
All I have is this
stupid hospital.

376
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,787
Just stay the hell away from me.

377
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,774
Are you hiding?

378
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,002
Is it that obvious?

379
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,617
I can't believe Michael's dead.

380
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,648
- You wanna go home? I'll cover for you.
- What about Neela?

381
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,760
Well, we can
take care of things.

382
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,022
Who? You and Clemente?

383
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,262
Weaver knew he had
problems before she hired him.

384
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,666
- Now we're paying for it.
- Well, Luka, it's your ER.

385
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:03,136
Let's go away someplace
where it's warm...

386
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,278
and where nobody
knows who we are.

387
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,936
- You mean like a vacation?
- No, not like a vacation...

388
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,776
a vacation. A real one.

389
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,818
Even if it's just for a couple
of days before the baby's born.

390
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,683
We could hang out by
a pool. Or the ocean.

391
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,656
I can dig a hole in the
sand for your big belly.

392
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,856
What is that? Some sort
of Croatian mating ritual?

393
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,692
- Mm-hm.
- What am I, a sea turtle?

394
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,163
Neela.

395
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,066
Neela?

396
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,644
- Hey. Hey, let someone take you home.
- I have patients to pass on.

397
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,613
We can take care of
that. You need to go home.

398
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,701
Why is everyone so damn
insistent that I go home?

399
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,378
I have things to do. I haven't
even told Michael's parents yet.

400
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,734
Well, the guys from the Army
said they could take care of that.

401
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,325
No. I have to do it.

402
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,493
Don't you think it'd be better to do it
from my apartment. Get some privacy?

403
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,995
Doubtless they're both at work.

404
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,134
I wanna tell them at the same
time when they're together tonight.

405
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:06,068
- Neela, go home, please.
- Abby, Dennis Young's crashing again.

406
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,501
I'll check in on you later.

407
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,835
- Hey, Neela, I just wanted...
- Don't.

408
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,672
Um...

409
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,816
The men from the Army
left a package for you.

410
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,213
Frank has it at the desk.

411
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,080
- Neela?
- You know what?

412
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,280
If it makes everyone
else happy, I'll go home.

413
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,721
- What's going on?
- He's bradying down.

414
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,693
Push the damn atropine.

415
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,392
- You sure he didn't have an epidural?
- No. Just diffuse brain edema.

416
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,594
- All right, a hundred grams of mannitol.
- We gave him mannitol.

417
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,104
Bilaterally blown pupils.

418
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,243
Check the ET tube. Maybe it came out.
- No, it's fine.

419
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,605
GCS, three.

420
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,041
His brain stem is failing.

421
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,807
There's not a whole lot
we could do about that.

422
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:53,282
- Heart rate's down to 30.
- I lost the pulse. It's P.E.A.

423
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:55,648
An amp of epi. Two angiocaths.

424
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,585
Maybe it's a tension pneumo.

425
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,316
- He's satting at 100 percent.
- Did he get Dilantin?

426
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,393
Fifty per kilo.

427
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,124
All right, Sam.
Start compressions.

428
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:12,028
Okay, Sam. You call those
compressions? Come on.

429
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,140
New AHA guidelines.
December issue circulation.

430
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,675
A hundred per minute, deeper and
faster. That's how you'll save a life.

431
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,204
Okay, I need to
perfuse his brain.

432
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,315
I need hypertonic
saline at 23.4 percent.

433
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,747
- We don't have that.
- Don't have that?

434
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:29,821
You don't have that? Hypertonic
saline reduces ICP when mannitol fails.

435
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,982
That paper last fall in <i>The Lancet.</i>
Or was it the <i>New England Journal?</i>

436
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,321
It was <i>Neurosurgery.</i>
That's right.

437
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:40,865
I knew it. The author was Weston or
Williams or something starting with W.

438
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,433
Wares, that's it.
That's it, Wares.

439
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,594
<i>- Neurosurgery</i>, 2004, October.
- Hold compressions.

440
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,507
Asystole.

441
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,836
- Okay, let's just call it, Vic.
- Call it?

442
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,035
Lockhart, I never
figured you for a quitter.

443
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,441
All right, he needs burr
holes. We gotta reduce the ICP.

444
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,813
He has an open skull fracture.
Burr holes are not gonna help.

445
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,046
Vic.

446
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,721
Okay, he should have
had an ICP monitor.

447
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,860
Everybody knows he
should've had an ICP monitor.

448
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,518
Time of death: 1420.

449
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,688
Oh, we could do
better than this.

450
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,731
We gotta do a
lot better than this.

451
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,495
- Do a lot better than that.
- Vic, I need to talk to you.

452
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,571
Yeah, and I need a cup of coffee.
Not the crap they serve here.

453
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,799
Not the effluence they
pass at the roach coach.

454
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,695
- I need a real cup of coffee.
- Vic, hey...

455
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,506
Ever been to this Italian place,
Marrinacio's on Randolph?

456
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,945
My God, best coffee this side of
Milan. They even make their own biscotti.

457
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,950
You walk through that door,
it smells... I'll treat everybody.

458
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,385
Everybody. I'm gonna treat everybody
to espresso and biscotti, okay?

459
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,993
Luka, 48-year-old
complaining of chest pain.

460
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,095
Exam 3. Is he on any medication?

461
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,594
Lipitor and aspirin.

462
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,699
- Should I go get Clemente?
- No, let him go.

463
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,597
Just pick me up as
soon as he comes back.

464
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,103
Okay, first-day labs,
12-lead, Lopressor and nitro.

465
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,401
Sir, don't worry, we'll
take good care of you.

466
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,736
One. PRATT: One.

467
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,436
- Following an accidental scalding.
- I'll be right in.

468
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,741
I guess his brother accidentally got his
head slammed against the wall today?

469
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:07,580
- Hey, what's going on?
- I got a kid with a busted collarbone.

470
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,188
He's got signs of old rib
and humerus fractures.

471
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,019
He's the lucky one. His little brother's
in the room next to him in a coma.

472
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,992
- Did you call Social Services?
- Yeah, they're coming.

473
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:21,930
You know, we got CTs, MRIs, PET
scans, Dopplers, 4-D ultrasounds...

474
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,366
and we still can't save one kid
from getting his brains beaten out.

475
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,472
That's right. Had
to kill his old man...

476
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,938
because there was nobody
else there to help him.

477
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,634
I guess that would be too
much to ask, wouldn't it?

478
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,280
It's much better that we
spend... What is it now?

479
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:39,441
6 billion dollars a month in a
war all the way across the world...

480
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:43,521
to kill off a few more of the other
kids who actually get to their teens.

481
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,954
Did you tell the police?

482
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,422
So they could arrest him?

483
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:51,121
Yeah, because that's the one thing
we do well in this country, isn't it?

484
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,293
We got prison down to a science.

485
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,799
Prison and war.

486
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,870
He and Dr. Gallant were friends.

487
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,481
This coffee is good. Italians
know what they're doing.

488
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:13,449
The French... What the hell is a
French press anyhow? Forget that, man.

489
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,088
- I know you.
- Oh, yeah?

490
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,417
- You're a killer.
- No, no. I'm not a killer.

491
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,958
Jerry Lee Lewis is the killer, and
you're the mayor of Munchkin City.

492
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,596
You kill them in the hospital.

493
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,198
You got blood on you.

494
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,334
Oh, damn. My nice, new shirt.

495
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,868
Right through the trauma gown.

496
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,972
- Yeah, I know what you do.
- Oh, man.

497
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,767
You cut them up
into little pieces.

498
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,536
- You gotta step off.
- Feed the surgical waste to the dogs.

499
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,474
- Stop the slaughter.
- Know how I got this?

500
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,842
Know how I got this?
Saving someone's life.

501
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,782
Because that's what I do. I save pieces
of crap like you, okay? You crazy son...

502
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,279
- Hey, watch where you're going, man.
- Hey.

503
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,357
What are you doing,
man? You trying to...?

504
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,859
Watch where you're going, man. I'm
a pedestrian, I have the right of way.

505
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,149
- You're not even looking.
- Want me to kick your ass?

506
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,666
Now you're gonna kick my
ass? Gonna get violent on me?

507
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,768
Gonna kick my ass.
Come on, kick my ass.

508
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,063
- Kick my ass up here.
- Hey.

509
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,399
- Kick my ass up here.
- What the hell you doing?

510
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,566
You're gonna go violent
on me? Go ahead.

511
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,202
What the hell are you doing? Hey,
hey, hey. What are you, psycho?

512
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,473
- Psycho?
- Yes, psycho.

513
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,583
Psycho? You don't
know about psychosis.

514
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,049
I'm the freaking doctor.
I'll show you psychosis.

515
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,920
Oh! Oh! Oh!

516
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,218
- That's psychosis, okay?
- Hey, come on. What are you, on drugs?

517
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,327
Yeah, I'm high. I'm wasted.

518
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,190
I'm flipping. You
wanna dip my urine?

519
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,128
Is that what you wanna do? You wanna
dip my urine? Go ahead. Go ahead.

520
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,269
Oh! Oh!

521
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:40,736
Yeah, watch out, huh? Watch out.
I'm gonna get you all over the place.

522
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,933
Hi, Neela, it's Abby.

523
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,542
I was thinking about stopping
by tonight on my way to Luka's.

524
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,114
And we're gonna
get some takeout...

525
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,683
so if there's anything
special you wanna eat...

526
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,844
or if you need anything,
just give me a call.

527
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,045
You talk to her?

528
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,851
Tried. I think she
just wants to be alone.

529
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,587
She'll have a lot of time alone. Probably
best if she was around people now.

530
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:06,857
Yeah, well, like I said, I
tried, but it didn't seem to work.

531
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,098
Whoa, Abby.

532
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,968
Sam, Sam. SAM: Vic?

533
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,938
I got jumped. I was
going for a cup of coffee.

534
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,907
- They ambushed me.
- Forty-one-year-old male.

535
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,273
- Altered mental status.
- I'm not, you're altered.

536
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,811
There's no connection
with you on a human level.

537
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,916
He was wandering around in
traffic, combative, uncooperative.

538
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,076
You know why I'm uncooperative?
You tied me down, that's why.

539
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,052
What is this, Fascist Germany?
<i>1984?</i> What are we living in?

540
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,885
- Easy, Vic.
- Why is he in handcuffs?

541
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,492
He assaulted several motorists.

542
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:38,187
You know what it is? Xenophobia.
That's what it is. Keep us living in fear.

543
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,387
How about Trauma 1?

544
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,623
- Full.
- It's not H5N1.

545
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,325
- Take him to Exam 2.
- Pulse ox, 99 on two liters.

546
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,061
Pulse ox, 99? Ha.

547
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,570
On room air, mouth breather.
Get him away from me.

548
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,265
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Dextrostick, 102.

549
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,104
Sam, tell them I'm an Attending.

550
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,576
Tell them what a colossal
mistake they've made.

551
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,942
- Please, tell them.
- You cut your leg, Vic.

552
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,481
Yeah, but it's superficial.

553
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,176
I can feel the platelets
already gonna take care of it.

554
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,255
I can feel that. I can fix
that with a get-well sticker.

555
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,619
- Let us check it out.
- It'll only take a minute.

556
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:10,160
All right, all right. Okay,
okay. I get it. It's funny, guys.

557
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,593
The joke's on me. I get
it. Everybody's laughing.

558
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,290
Okay, now get it off me,
okay? Come on. Get it off.

559
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,732
- Four of Ativan.
- Take it off me! Take it off!

560
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,362
- Five of Haldol, IV push.
- Get it off me!

561
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,269
Abby, you can't give me Haldol.

562
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,171
You can't give me Haldol, Abby.
I'm not crazy. You understand?

563
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,714
- It's okay. It's okay.
- X-ray, come here, buddy.

564
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,443
Come here. These freaking
chicks are losing their mind.

565
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,679
- Come over here, help me, man.
- Get Luka.

566
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,517
What, are you gonna
amputate my leg?

567
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,023
Oh, that's it. Run to
Daddy, you little bitch.

568
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,492
Run to Daddy, little bitch.

569
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,498
Sam, don't you dare.
Don't you dare, Sam.

570
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,361
- Sam, don't you dare.
- Just try to relax.

571
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,092
Settle down, doc. Settle down.

572
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,362
See? He said I'm a
doc. You heard him.

573
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:56,201
I'm a doc... I'm a doctor,
not a freaking patient.

574
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,669
Abby. Abby, I'm your Attending.

575
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:01,313
You hear me? I'm your Attending.

576
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,945
- Do no harm, Abby. Do no harm, Abby.
- I know. I know.

577
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,380
I'm an Attending at...

578
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,397
Hey.

579
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,903
I thought it would be okay.

580
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,573
Do you mind?

581
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,176
Oh, sure.

582
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,405
- Sean, you want some more Jell-O?
- Can I?

583
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,075
Yeah, we got tubs of it downstairs.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

584
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,526
Eddie's gonna be
hungry when he wakes up.

585
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,028
You know, since
your mom's away...

586
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,756
you're gonna have to go
stay with a foster family.

587
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,265
Probably until she gets back.

588
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,697
The Fosters?

589
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,265
No, their name's not Foster.

590
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,532
That's what they do.
They take care of kids.

591
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,376
Eddie too?

592
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,706
No, Eddie's gonna have
to stay in the hospital.

593
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,848
Because he's still sick?

594
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,608
He's showing signs
of improvement though.

595
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,015
And we're gonna have him...

596
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,179
in a very special part of the
hospital that's just for kids...

597
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,621
and you can visit him there.

598
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,526
What about my dad?

599
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,324
His injuries were
very, very severe...

600
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,834
and, um...

601
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,762
the doctors, they
couldn't fix him.

602
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,272
He's dead?

603
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,241
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

604
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,149
- But I didn't mean to kill him.
- I know that.

605
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,120
But I'm gonna go to hell.

606
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,555
- What?
- For killing him.

607
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,956
God sends you to
hell if you kill someone.

608
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:04,000
Sean, I think that God
makes exceptions...

609
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,729
if you were trying to
save someone else.

610
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,168
Really?

611
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,068
Really.

612
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,443
- How is he?
- He settled down.

613
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,711
Okay, I'm gonna get out of here.

614
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,821
I'm gonna go to my
place, check on Neela.

615
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,823
- Call me. Let me know how she's doing.
- I will.

616
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,519
- What's with Clemente?
- Have to hear what Psych says.

617
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,823
Too bad, I was starting
to like the little guy.

618
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,400
- Clemente's labs. Tox screen's negative.
- Not so sure that's a good thing.

619
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,537
Come on, guys, let's
give Vic some privacy.

620
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:42,299
We still got a board to clear.
Back to work, everybody.

621
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,713
Do you need me to
sign off on anything?

622
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,816
No.

623
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,884
Everything okay with you?

624
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,384
Yeah. Why?

625
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,654
Well, sometimes it can
be a difficult transition...

626
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,451
coming back to this place.

627
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,623
Yeah, I'll be okay. I was
just a little rattled earlier...

628
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,662
because of the
whole Mike situation.

629
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,568
Well, it's good
to have you back.

630
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,603
Hey.

631
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,009
Thanks for making me go there.

632
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,670
Someday, maybe you
can tell me all about it.

633
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,373
Yeah, someday.

634
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,015
Neela?

635
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,022
- Hi.
- Hey.

636
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,332
I brought you some
dinner and some groceries.

637
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,232
Thanks.

638
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,947
Did you call Michael's family?

639
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,752
Hey, how about I
stay here tonight?

640
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,553
Um, I think I'd
like to be alone.

641
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,628
Really?

642
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,937
I could use a break
from Luka's snoring.

643
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,972
Michael used to snore
when he was drunk.

644
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:32,941
You know, I had to come
home and find a photograph...

645
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:36,145
because I couldn't
picture him in my head.

646
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,926
One day, I'm not even gonna be
able to remember what he looks like.

647
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,997
That's not true.

648
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,470
I'm gonna be fine.

649
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,238
Okay.

650
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,709
I'm sorry.

651
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,084
- I'm putting him on a 72-hour.
- What are you calling it?

652
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,820
Gravely disabled. He's
blaming it on insomnia.

653
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,862
Tox screen was clean.

654
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,557
There's no history of
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

655
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,999
But he's had prolonged
sleep deprivation...

656
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,537
and was recently the
victim of a violent crime...

657
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,833
so there's probably
some PTSD going on too.

658
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,035
- But we'll know better in a couple days.
- Yeah.

659
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,578
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

660
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,148
Hey, Vic.

661
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,459
- What a day you had, huh?
- Yeah.

662
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,662
How are you feeling?

663
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:58,734
I'm pretty good, considering.

664
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,941
I just feel like such an ass for
flipping out in front of the kids.

665
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,847
I'm a passionate man. That's
what makes me a good doctor, right?

666
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,448
Right.

667
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,086
I just can't keep up my pace without
spinning off the road at some point.

668
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,923
I'm just sorry that it had
to happen on your watch.

669
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,391
No, that's okay. That's okay.

670
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,531
The important thing is
that you get some rest now.

671
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,758
Yeah. Yeah.

672
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,300
I'm gonna get some rest.

673
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,966
Oh, yeah.

674
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,767
I'm gonna get some
serious R and R.

675
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,843
- Catch up on my sleep or maybe do a...
- Let me, uh...

676
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:44,312
- Let me take you upstairs, okay?
- All right, sure.

677
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:48,212
- Okay?
- Yeah.

678
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,382
Personal escort
treatment. I like that.

679
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,889
Appreciate it,
Luka. I really do.

680
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,529
You helping me like this.

681
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,127
And don't be afraid to
come up any time to see me.

682
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,067
Especially if you need to run
something past somebody or...

683
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,202
I can still make a
diagnosis on the tough ones.

684
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,571
Take care of
yourself. Okay, Vic?

685
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,041
Yeah, be cool, man.

686
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,405
Yeah.

687
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:18,916
Get back to work.

688
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,817
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

689
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,614
<i>I'm getting the camera ready.</i>

690
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:02,122
<i>- Get out of here, you freak.
- I love you, Neela.</i>

691
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,819
<i>Get out of here.
Get out of here.</i>

692
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,295
<i>You see what I gotta
deal with? You see that?</i>

693
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,770
<i>So hopefully you're
never gonna see this thing.</i>

694
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,775
<i>But if you are,
well, then, uh...</i>

695
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,135
<i>You know, something went wrong.</i>

696
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:27,718
<i>Well, maybe not wrong, but
certainly not according to plans.</i>

697
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,451
<i>I love you, Neela.</i>

698
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,692
<i>Marrying you was the
happiest day of my life.</i>

699
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,325
<i>You just... You make me strong.</i>

700
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,133
<i>Now, I know you didn't
want me to come back to Iraq.</i>

701
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:48,603
<i>And I guess if you're watching
this, you owe me a big "I told you so."</i>

702
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:52,642
<i>But I did what I had to do.</i>

703
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:58,114
<i>You're the most beautiful
and kind person that I know.</i>

704
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,844
<i>I just... I just want
you to be happy.</i>

705
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,582
<i>And just know that
I'll always be with you.</i>

706
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:13,631
<i>I want you to find somebody,
get married, have babies.</i>

707
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,562
<i>Of course, he won't
be as fine as me...</i>

708
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,431
<i>but I guess you'll just
have to live with that.</i>

709
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,972
<i>I love you, Neela.</i>

710
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,198
<i>Forever.</i>
