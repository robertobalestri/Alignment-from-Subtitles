1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,137
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,298
Officer on deck.

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,607
- Me. I'm the chief.
- Yeah, Chief Pain-in-the-Ass.

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,178
- Welcome to County, Inez.
- Thanks.

5
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,340
I don't need anything from you. I
never have. Don't come back anymore.

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,679
But I couldn't leave
without seeing you.

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,702
I need to think
things out by myself.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,257
- Where you going now?
- To look at an apartment before work.

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,158
So that's it? We
don't talk about this?

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,327
Sam's moving out.

11
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,863
Oh.

12
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,790
Why?

13
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,163
I have a feeling it's our
communication problem.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,270
<i>You're watching
the sunrise movie...</i>

15
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:45,207
<i>on WMAQ-TV, Chicago's Channel 5.</i>

16
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,213
<i>What did you say
your name was, again?</i>

17
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,277
<i>I didn't.</i>

18
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,882
<i>No, I guess you
didn't, at that, did you?</i>

19
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,096
Morning, Zoila.

20
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,497
I think you at work.

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,300
First Thursday of the month. It's
when Samantha told me to come.

22
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,170
I'm running a bit late. You
don't have to clean up today.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,810
- But Samantha say...
- Samantha doesn't live here anymore.

24
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:25,009
Um, I'll have her call you.

25
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,714
All these was at the lobby.

26
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,519
- The dishes.
- Hmm?

27
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,060
You're gonna get <i>cucarachas.</i>

28
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:41,898
Currently, patient throughput is
8.7 hours. Now, the problem is...

29
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,334
- Dr. Weaver, can we...?
- Not a good time, Morris.

30
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,565
If they need to be admitted to the
hospital, that goes up to over 19 hours.

31
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,141
Certainly room for improvement.

32
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,835
That's where Caduceus
Systematics come into the picture.

33
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,947
- Houston, we have a problem.
- One moment.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,845
Why don't you...? Here,
take a look at these.

35
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,076
Hey.

36
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,983
Keep it down, doctor, I've
got grant officers with me.

37
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,589
Grant officers?

38
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,522
They're considering funding
a pilot study here at County.

39
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,025
Kudos to you.

40
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,825
Now, what do we do about this new
nurse czar, Eve something-or-other?

41
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:16,061
Peyton. She met with the Emergency
Services Committee, and we all loved her.

42
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,365
- Is it her job to slow the floor down?
- I thought that was your job.

43
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,372
My point being, the nurses
are in there, just yakking away.

44
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:26,104
- They're entitled to a staff
meeting, - Not unless I say so.

45
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,878
We say so.

46
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,374
Not unless Dr. Weaver says so.

47
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,315
Exactly. Who's the
Attending on today?

48
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,683
- Supposed to be Susan.
- That's not gonna happen.

49
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,155
So it's true? She's leaving
for a tenure position?

50
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,454
Not yet, she's just interviewing.
Isn't Kovac coming in?

51
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,756
- He's running a little late.
- What else is new?

52
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,297
- Dr. Weaver?
- Hold down the fort.

53
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,731
When's the last time
anybody even saw a nurse?

54
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:52,395
- Malik did an EKG for me six minutes ago.
- Just let them have their powwow.

55
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,508
No. Chief say powwow over.

56
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,270
Guess he hasn't met the
new nurse manager yet.

57
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,916
As part of the upcoming JCAHO
site visit, any individual practitioners...

58
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,710
- I need you to step out.
- What?

59
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,048
Can and will be asked
questions by the surveyor.

60
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,019
I need you to be
familiar with this booklet.

61
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,488
Shut up.

62
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,286
- I need a nurse, okay?
- I'm sorry.

63
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,520
Dr. Morris, is it?

64
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,760
Yeah, I...

65
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,699
I have a patient with an
abscessed tooth. Needs IV penicillin.

66
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,266
You need one of us to
administer IV antibiotics for you?

67
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,274
That's what nurses do.

68
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,007
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware
of any literature on the benefits...

69
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,205
of IV antibiotics
in dental infections.

70
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,944
- Literature? PEYTON:
As far as I know...

71
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,449
oral antibiotics are still
the standard of care.

72
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,848
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

73
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,422
Oh, good. Then maybe
you can educate the nurses...

74
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,786
about inferior
alveolar dental blocks.

75
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,022
What?

76
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:52,633
Doing a study to track patients is the
best way to determine how to improve...

77
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,566
Uh, hey, Tony, can you give
my friends here a tour of the rig?

78
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,763
Sure thing, Dr. Weaver.

79
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,233
- Your shift started 40 minutes ago.
- Morning, Kerry.

80
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,311
- There's no Attending on the floor.
- We seem to have a shortage.

81
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,244
- Don't make me look for you.
- Can we talk about this later?

82
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,775
Okay. No, I need
to know that I...

83
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,313
<i>Sir, stop where you are, sir.</i>

84
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,893
I need a gurney here!

85
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,308
So did you straighten
those nurses out, chief?

86
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,009
They're autonomous
professionals.

87
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,088
If they wanna have a meeting,
we're in no position to question.

88
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,917
- She spanked you raw?
- It was a blur.

89
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,423
Can't find a femoral
pulse through the eschar.

90
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,822
Got a carotid, two plus.

91
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,292
- Need some help?
- We got it.

92
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,590
Can you check on my
guests? They seem freaked.

93
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,495
Hey, Sam. We need a nurse here.

94
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,101
- Inez, you go too.
- Hey.

95
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,761
Unidentified burn victim.
No history, walked himself in.

96
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,771
Do you want me to start
an IV or check the BP?

97
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,775
- Yeah, fine. WEAVER:
Access, vitals, fluids, let's go.

98
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,444
What's up with the camera?

99
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,983
- Sending Michael a care package.
- To Iraq?

100
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:56,214
Figured I'd include photos of everyone.
Is there anything you wanna send?

101
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,153
Sure. Like what?

102
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,318
Well, something you think he'd
miss, something he can't get there.

103
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,122
Exactamundo.

104
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,231
- Oh, a movie? That's not a bad idea.
- Yeah.

105
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,901
Let me put it this
way: It ain't Disney.

106
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,696
I know you're not
sending him porn.

107
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,965
- Just a three-way, nothing dirty.
- I like the way you think, Frank.

108
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,973
I'm not mailing this. He'll
get in trouble, I'll get arrested.

109
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,169
No. I buried it inside some nature
snoozefest about snow leopards.

110
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,042
That'll get it past
the Army hounds.

111
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,477
This cannot be a good idea.

112
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,517
Listen, dear, I've been to war. I
know how horny a guy can get.

113
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,017
Thanks, Frank, that'll do.

114
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,656
K.J., I need you to
make a run for me, man.

115
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,224
Again? I just got back
from getting her that camera.

116
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,157
Hey, hey, hey, no
slouching, right? Like a shark.

117
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,523
Now, take this $20.

118
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,097
The generous Dr. Pratt.

119
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,202
Catch me in a minute.
And help restock that cart.

120
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,770
What are you doing? We
still getting together later?

121
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,872
I had a case upstairs,
thought I'd stop by.

122
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,064
Oh, what case?

123
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,710
Eleven-year-old Latin Queen
recovering from a stab wound.

124
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,037
- Knife missed her heart by an inch.
- How's she doing?

125
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,172
Says she made one mistake.
She should've stabbed the bitch first.

126
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,250
Aren't they so cute at that age?

127
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,353
You got anything for me?

128
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,220
- I always got something for you.
- I meant work.

129
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,414
- Ah.
- Mm.

130
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,254
No GSWs yet, but
the day is still young.

131
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,920
I saw Charlie Pratt at Ceasefire.
He said he stopped by here last week.

132
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,532
- How'd it go?
- Quick.

133
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:18,096
It was quick. I mean, we
really have nothing to talk about.

134
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,240
Okay. So I'll see
you for lunch, then?

135
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,399
- Definitely.
- All right.

136
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,508
Lungs are wet. He's very tachy.

137
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,618
- I need that line, please.
- I'm working on it.

138
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,420
Morphine and fluids.
We need access, Sam.

139
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,789
- I know.
- No ID, doesn't know what happened.

140
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,125
Worry about ID after
you've got him on monitor.

141
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,597
And start a Foley to
document renal function.

142
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,100
Got it. Eighteen-gauge
in the left antecube.

143
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,599
A liter wide open.

144
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,139
Feet and perineum
are clear of burns.

145
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,607
- Sam, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna hang saline.

146
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,040
I can see that. Why?

147
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,573
Because fluid requirements
are 4 cc's per kilo.

148
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,048
You're familiar with
the Parkland Formula?

149
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,743
Yeah.

150
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,118
So you must know that lactated
Ringer's is the preferred crystalloid.

151
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,124
- Excuse me?
- Oh, Dr. Kovac, I'm Eve Peyton.

152
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,762
- Our new nurse manager.
- It's Kovac.

153
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,754
Sats are down to 78.

154
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,424
This is a bad time to start
pimping the nursing staff.

155
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,969
- Worst times are the best times to learn.
- Didn't Yoda say that?

156
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,299
- Suction.
- Suction.

157
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,873
All right. You've got this.

158
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:32,307
Eve, why don't you come with me and
I'll introduce you to the bean counters?

159
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,311
All right.

160
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,677
Did you call that woman?

161
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,443
Yes, your daughter's on her way.

162
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,349
Oh, hey, hey, you might
wanna check in on Penny.

163
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,784
Penny Nicholson?

164
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,323
If at first you don't succeed...

165
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,220
I believe that
would be my kidney.

166
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,989
- Hi, Penny.
- Nice to see you again.

167
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,962
- I'm Dr. Rasgotra, Mr...?
- Trimbody.

168
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,125
- It's my stage name.
- How apt.

169
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,963
I do elementary
school health shows.

170
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,969
"The Respiratory Rumba."

171
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,631
"Hygiene, Goodbye BO,"
"The Heart is a Lonely Beater."

172
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,107
- We get it.
- Discomfort after a fall.

173
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,145
I slipped on a puddle of Jell-O
in the cafetorium in the middle...

174
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,909
of my number on the reproductive
system, "Ova Here, Ova There."

175
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,149
Breath sounds are equal.
Check for splenic tenderness.

176
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,823
All right.

177
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,818
Take a deep breath, sir.

178
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,427
She was about to feel
my liver, wasn't she?

179
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,492
I mean, come on, you're not in the
fifth grade. My spleen is right here.

180
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,500
There's no need
to get excited, sir.

181
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,663
- Ms. Nicholson is a medical student.
- It's right in front of you.

182
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,503
- The entire human anatomy.
- Actually, sir, it's not.

183
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,680
You have no genitalia.

184
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,545
- Ready?
- Hmm?

185
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,353
- You blocked it.
- What's that for?

186
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,992
Michael's care package.

187
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,459
I'm getting photos of everyone,
plus anything people wanna send him.

188
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,393
Frank's giving him porn.

189
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,433
Ah, the gift that
keeps on giving.

190
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,730
What are you gonna send?

191
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,240
Well, I made this mix
CD, but I don't know.

192
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,076
"Weekend in New
England." "Mandy."

193
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,238
Michael's got a weak
spot for Barry Manilow.

194
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,542
Very weak.

195
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,447
I could send him a menu from
Gibson's, or a Cubs program.

196
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,418
Or I've got some
pressed flowers I could...

197
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,722
You'll figure it out.

198
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:29,124
Yeah. Here, sign this for him.

199
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,726
The lighting in here is brutal.

200
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,535
That's all you got from
him? No family, no address?

201
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,069
The guy was in pain, okay?

202
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,901
Well, I'll go up with you
in case he wakes up.

203
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,976
Maintain the PEEP
around 10 and tell the unit...

204
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,449
they'll need central
monitoring on this guy.

205
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,110
You didn't even get a name?

206
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,916
He really wasn't
up for an interview.

207
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,029
- Nice way to start the day, huh?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,766
How's the new place?

209
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,102
It's okay. You know,
we're getting used to it.

210
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,109
Oh, here. Some of
it's a few days old.

211
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,474
Oh, thank you.

212
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:24,516
Are you gonna take Alex to
that soccer game on Saturday?

213
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,814
- If you still want me to...
- Yeah, no, I think...

214
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,287
- No, I mean, I wasn't sure that...
- I think...

215
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,824
- No, maybe you should.
- Yeah.

216
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,723
Think it'd be good
for everybody.

217
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,591
Well, okay.

218
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,901
I was thinking...

219
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,341
I've been thinking.

220
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:57,541
We let things get away from us,
but we don't have to leave it like that.

221
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,520
- Luka...
- No, a lot happened fast.

222
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,589
Too fast.

223
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,492
Maybe we should just take our time,
make sure we know what we're doing.

224
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,168
I don't want this to be one
more thing I messed up.

225
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,336
We're pretending, Luka.

226
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,203
I don't wanna pretend anymore.

227
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,341
Sam, do you have that...?

228
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,038
Your piggyback. Yes, right here.

229
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,628
How much did you drink?

230
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,530
I'm fine, let me out of here.

231
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,035
All right, sit down
and relax, okay?

232
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,231
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

233
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,070
- Pretty stupid.
- I got a 2200 on my SATs.

234
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,371
You work for the
county. Who's stupid?

235
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,540
Two liters of saline.

236
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:06,880
Send off a BAL, and don't light a
match around our little genius here.

237
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,293
That's why they
call me the whiz kid.

238
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,952
Oh, yeah.

239
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,530
Okay, go with God.

240
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:22,100
Oh, yeah, look at that.

241
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,261
This is an 18 French
Foley catheter, Erik.

242
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,740
What's it for?

243
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,906
I'll need you to
remove your pants.

244
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,543
- Labs are back on your UTI.
- Thanks.

245
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,149
- How's your burn guy?
- In ICU.

246
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,912
- Any leads?
- Cops are looking into it.

247
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,415
He just walked
in here like that?

248
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,081
High tolerance
for pain, I guess.

249
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,962
Okay, well, let me know
if you hear anything.

250
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,099
Robbie Beckwith, 11,
blunt face and head.

251
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,599
He's on a motorized
scooter, hit a lady on skates.

252
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,135
- They're unloading her right now.
- I'll get that one.

253
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,433
- Robbie, can you squeeze my hand?
- Maybe Pratt should take this.

254
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,371
He's altered and he
had no helmet. CT?

255
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,669
Chuny, where's Pratt?

256
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,575
With a new-onset seizure in 2.

257
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,438
Guess it's you and me.

258
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,083
Yeah.

259
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,677
- Trauma panel, C-spine, chest and pelvis.
- And facial CT?

260
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,085
After the plain films.
Yankauer, please.

261
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,122
My mom. I want my mom.

262
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,851
They called her.
She's on her way.

263
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,589
You lost a couple of teeth, Robbie.
Wear a helmet from now on, okay?

264
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,699
- Promise.
- Need anything here?

265
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,994
Probably just gonna tube
him and get him to CT.

266
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,228
- I'll call for a vent.
- We may not need it.

267
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,930
- You're not gonna tube him?
- I don't know yet.

268
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,338
Well, I've got three
nurses here for the traumas.

269
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,842
I can float in a
fourth if you want.

270
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,552
There's a lot of bleeding
from the nasopharynx.

271
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,253
I can't visualize the source.

272
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,358
He's getting wheezy.

273
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,153
Okay, he's gonna
need help breathing.

274
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,160
That's all I was saying.

275
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,731
I'm going in with Abby on
a diffuse abdominal pain.

276
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,492
Show her how to
secure the airway.

277
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,728
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be next door.

278
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,566
7-0 ET.

279
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,868
Sux is onboard.

280
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,510
Pulse ox 99 on 2 liters.

281
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,637
- Pupils equal and reactive.
- What happened?

282
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,738
- We were Rollerblading.
- My first time.

283
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,316
She got dizzy and rammed
into some kid on a scooter.

284
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,510
- No breakfast.
- I tried to catch her, but I...

285
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,279
Why are you
wearing those in here?

286
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,515
We left our shoes
at the rental place.

287
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,683
- Good breath sounds bilaterally.
- Have you ever had any seizures?

288
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,360
- Any heart problems?
- No, I'm healthy.

289
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,364
- You on any medication?
- Nothing, just multivitamins.

290
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,195
HemoCue's low, 6.9.

291
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,701
You ever been anemic before?
- No.

292
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,998
- Luka.
- Is that a burn?

293
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,053
It's probably from
the scooter's tailpipe.

294
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,201
Okay. Belly CT,
ultrasound, 2 units of O-neg.

295
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,108
Call Surgery and hold an O.R.

296
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,044
- What's happening?
- She's losing blood.

297
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,116
- But I'm not even cut.
- No, it's internal.

298
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,809
- You good in here?
- Hemorrhaging?

299
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,317
He needs that lac looked at.

300
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,217
Yes, he does. Come with me.

301
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,721
I'll be back soon, Stephanie.

302
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,054
Hey, how do you like those
things? They hurt your knees at all?

303
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,562
That Morris guy, what's he do?

304
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,459
He's chief Resident.

305
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,928
No, seriously.

306
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,564
- Ton of blood, cords are swollen.
- What if you can't get through?

307
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,003
- Plan B.
- What's Plan B?

308
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,906
- Set up the fiber-optic.
- How long will the paralytics last?

309
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,603
Look it up in the PDR.

310
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,340
I got the scope, but the
light source, I gotta find one.

311
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,246
Morison's is
clear. No free fluid.

312
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,977
Fiber-optic light
source in here?

313
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,382
I saw it in Exam 3.

314
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,388
- How's it going in there?
- It's going.

315
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,753
- First unit of O-neg is up.
- No hemothorax.

316
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,952
- Is that good?
- Yes, it is good...

317
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,393
but it still doesn't
explain the blood loss.

318
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,556
- I'm here.
- Blunt abdomen, severe anemia.

319
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,134
FAS is negative. DUBENKO: BP?

320
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,568
Hasn't dropped yet. She's tachy
but maintaining a systolic of 110.

321
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,640
- Any pain there?
- Not really.

322
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,333
Extra red top, please. You.

323
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,570
- Here you go.
- Microscope?

324
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,771
Obviously, there's an
occult bleeding source.

325
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,939
Dr. Kovac, normally
this might be the part...

326
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,745
where we argue over whether
you were hasty in calling me down.

327
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,911
I'd question the accuracy
of your assessment.

328
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,956
We'd play mind games in a
futile attempt to one-up each other.

329
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,417
But you know what? I'm
just not in the mood today.

330
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,127
Why? I don't know.

331
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,126
Lack of sleep? Stress?

332
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,928
Maybe you people
have just worn me out.

333
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,362
Yet even then...

334
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,596
Dr. Lockhart, what do you see?

335
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,380
- Microcytic hypochromic anemia.
- And is that an acute condition?

336
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,283
- No.
- No, it is not.

337
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,447
It is a chronic condition, the
differential of which includes?

338
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,992
Iron deficiency, thalassemia,
sideroblastosis, lead poisoning.

339
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,685
Are any of those surgical?

340
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,129
Anybody?

341
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,267
New nurse?

342
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,474
Next time, please consider
the innate skills and abilities...

343
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,473
that I suspect led
us to be doctors.

344
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,636
Dust them off and put them
to use before you summon me.

345
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,642
Good luck, dear.

346
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,319
Was it something you said?

347
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,485
- Light source on high.
- Sats are 92.

348
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,150
All right, here we go.

349
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,490
This is Mrs. Beckwith, Robbie's
mom. I've explained the situation.

350
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,066
- Is he in a coma?
- No, ma'am, he's just sedated.

351
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,727
Oh, I told him be careful on
that thing. To wear a helmet.

352
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,841
- Turn up the suction.
- Has Dr. Kovac been in here?

353
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,738
He left to work on that lady.

354
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,805
Sam, cricoid pressure.

355
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,006
Got it.

356
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,280
Is he coming back?

357
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,217
I'll go update him. Here, Penny.

358
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,189
- You're sure you've never been anemic?
- Positive.

359
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,191
Ever had an ulcer? SAM: Luka.

360
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,626
- What is it?
- You might wanna look in on this.

361
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,061
- Not right now.
- PVC's on the monitor.

362
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,712
Okay, is the first unit in?
- No, IV's infiltrated.

363
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,360
- She's only got 50 cc's.
- She needs some blood.

364
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,870
Anything from your medical
history we need to know?

365
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,702
Anything else you can think of?

366
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,207
Nothing important.

367
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,778
I mean, I tested positive
for BRCA1 last year.

368
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,882
- But I'm tumor-free.
- BRCA1?

369
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,711
Genetic mutation
that indicates...

370
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,251
an increased risk of
breast and ovarian cancer.

371
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,390
Try an 85 percent chance, but
I know I don't have cancer yet.

372
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,548
- I cannot get an IV.
- Neither can I.

373
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,661
Okay, set me up for a central
line. Betadine and sterile gloves.

374
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,388
- Sats are in the low 80s.
- Did Dr. Kovac say how long?

375
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,999
Damn it. SAM: Actually,
he didn't say much.

376
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,636
- Let's get those sats up.
- Is he not breathing right?

377
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:34,331
- Maybe you should crike him?
- Too young. Not in children under 12.

378
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,640
Line is primed and ready.
- Dr. Kovac.

379
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,108
- Guidewire.
- Cordis introducer.

380
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,441
Dr. Pratt needs a more experienced
physician to help him get the fiber-optic.

381
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,515
Wire is passing,
100 of lidocaine.

382
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,777
Pratt is experienced
with airways. He'll get it.

383
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,791
Anything unusual you
might have ingested?

384
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,153
He needs you in there.

385
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,086
- Multifocal PVCs.
- This woman is decompensating.

386
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,784
- And that child is hypoxic.
- Run of four.

387
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,259
Because to fix it, we
have to know what it is.

388
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,262
I didn't take anything.

389
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:02,766
- There should be an Attending in there.
- I'll be in as soon as I can.

390
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,703
Okay, then.

391
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,499
- Where's your difficult-airway box?
- It's over there.

392
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,576
Do you work with pottery or stained
glass? Those have heavy metals in them.

393
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,973
Excuse me, Miss Peyton?

394
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,705
I have a Ph.D., so if you'd
like to get formal, call me doctor.

395
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,515
Open the crash cart.

396
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,180
Stephanie, what is it?

397
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,953
I've been going to
Mexico for treatments.

398
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,183
To prevent cancer?

399
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,357
A three-day juice fast
with herbal enemas.

400
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,329
And some natural medicine
to boost my immune system.

401
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,162
Lead poisoning. Send a level.

402
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:40,329
Okay, BAL, 35
milligram, IM for chelation.

403
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,974
Why didn't you say
something sooner?

404
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,111
I was scared. I didn't know
what it would do to my coverage.

405
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,678
- What's going on?
- Laryngeal mask airway.

406
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,909
Tip of the cuff on the palate,
and guide with your index finger...

407
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,384
until you feel the resistance
of the hypopharynx.

408
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,920
And inflate.

409
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,356
And bag.

410
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,188
You might wanna educate about
the LMA as a rescue device...

411
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,262
in can't intubate/can't
ventilate patients.

412
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,695
- Sats are coming up.
- It's working.

413
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,268
Thank you. Thank you.

414
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,373
Take it from here, doctor. I'm gonna
go find a bedpan that needs emptying.

415
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,711
I didn't even know we
had LMAs on the floor.

416
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,083
Been on order since
July, arrived last Friday.

417
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,624
As part of my orientation, I went
through the supply lists, item by item.

418
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,228
Sounds like something
Weaver would make you do.

419
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,762
Actually, I did it on my own.

420
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,390
Is there some sort of history
between you and Dr. Kovac?

421
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,433
Uh, nothing to worry about.

422
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,503
It's a nurse-doctor issue. If I
don't worry about it, who will?

423
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,943
It's a personal thing.
Won't come up again.

424
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,410
Sam, is our kid up in CT?

425
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,607
- Yeah, he's with his mom.
- Hey, since when do we have LMAs?

426
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,752
Since last Friday,
from what I'm told.

427
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,410
Man, I hope I didn't blow it.

428
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,954
- Kovac shouldn't have left you.
- I told him I had it.

429
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,421
Hey, Dr. Pratt. Got it.

430
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,651
All right, we all set
up? Let's go find Neela.

431
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,126
I wasn't a feminist, I'd call
that new manager a bitch.

432
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,527
She's all up in my stuff,
writing everything down.

433
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,098
Are we getting evaluated, Sam?

434
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,962
I guess so.

435
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,036
Beware the Blood Countess.

436
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:23,599
A pizza? You wanna
send a pizza to Iraq?

437
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:27,311
- It's a deep-dish. Mikey loves it.
- I understand that, but...

438
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,948
We got the dry ice, we
got the waterproof shroud.

439
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,710
- It's gonna be a week in transit.
- It will?

440
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,614
I could look into
flash-freezing.

441
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,121
It's all good. Just, you know,
take the picture, come on.

442
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,658
Well, all right. Say cheese.

443
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,921
- Cheddar.
- Cheddar.

444
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,955
- So should I...? PRATT:
No, don't worry about it.

445
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,964
I'll take care of everything.

446
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,061
I got this.

447
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,577
What's with you? This thing
won't make it to Baghdad.

448
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,805
- What were you thinking?
- Hey.

449
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:06,077
CT's on the line. Your scooter
boy's heart rate dropped.

450
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:12,391
Is Stephanie okay? They said
that I still can't talk to her yet.

451
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:16,151
How deep into
this thing are you?

452
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:17,992
What?

453
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,495
Oh, um...

454
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,258
We only met a few nights
ago, at a JSpeedDate.

455
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,570
- But we really hit it off.
- J what?

456
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,662
It's for Jewish singles.

457
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,371
You go around each table, chatting
for a few minutes with each person.

458
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,980
- See who responds to whom.
- Oh.

459
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,845
- Are you Jewish?
- No, no, no.

460
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,618
I had a crush on
a Semitic girl once.

461
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,457
That's a holy prayer
that you just said.

462
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,224
Yeah, yeah. I spent a
lot of time at synagogue.

463
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,425
I guess you could
say stalking her.

464
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,094
Those rabbis,
man, they hit hard.

465
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,571
I think I really like her.

466
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,609
- Ow!
- Sorry about that.

467
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,745
<i>- Oi.</i>
- Aah!

468
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,950
Diffuse brain edema. Facial
CT shows a Le Fort II fracture.

469
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,678
Okay. NORMA:
What does that mean?

470
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,719
Need surgeries to fix
the bones in his face.

471
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,791
- I'll put him back on monitors.
- And set up for a formal trach.

472
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,222
What's that, trach?

473
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,385
We need to put a
surgical airway in his neck.

474
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,226
All right. We're gonna need 12 of
Decadron, IV push, and 60 of mannitol.

475
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,163
Okay. Number
eight sterile gloves.

476
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:33,136
- Betadine and Steri-Drape.
- One percent with epi.

477
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,399
CT report.

478
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,170
- Norma, you need anything?
- 410 blade to Dr. Pratt.

479
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,974
My husband. We're separated.

480
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,082
- Do you need me...?
- Yes, he's been called.

481
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:48,151
Do you have a washroom?

482
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,589
Chuny, I'll get that. You show
Mrs. Beckwith where that is.

483
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,749
- Vertical incision.
- Come with me, ma'am.

484
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:57,260
- Bring you back when they're done.
- Cricoid cartilage to sternal notch.

485
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,627
I'm glad you found time
to supervise your Resident.

486
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,726
Cauterize here
for the hemostasis.

487
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,941
There's no excuse for
what happened earlier.

488
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,385
- I was with another patient.
- She's less critical.

489
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,667
- Not by my assessment.
- Then it was wrong.

490
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,572
Ready to divide
the thyroid isthmus.

491
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:12,803
Two Kellys.

492
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,970
Kid with severe head
trauma takes priority.

493
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,775
Shouldn't need a
nurse to tell you.

494
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:20,681
Shouldn't need a doctor to explain it's
not always clear who the most critical is.

495
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,585
Then next time, you call in a second
Attending or get a more senior Resident.

496
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,692
Hey, I'm an R-4.
I thought I had it.

497
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,455
You and I need to talk about which
nurses you're willing to work with and not.

498
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,258
That way, this won't
have to happen again.

499
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,265
Number 6 Shiley.

500
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,509
- Hard to come up with right thing.
- People sending Michael loser presents?

501
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,772
Well, Pratt thinks he can send him
a pizza, and Chuny got him these.

502
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:52,145
- But I meant from me.
- Well, what's your current plan?

503
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,877
Well, I wrote him a poem.

504
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,217
Are you sure you want me to...?

505
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,687
Scented.

506
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,525
It rhymes.

507
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,535
- Is it too high school?
- Yeah, it's kind of cheesy.

508
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,984
- I'm an idiot.
- No, you're not.

509
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,473
Look, you're his
girlfriend, right?

510
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,872
Well, I guess, yeah.

511
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:23,140
Well, Neela, a man at
war has certain needs.

512
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,147
You're beginning
to sound like Frank.

513
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,754
I get that a lot. Meet me in
the Family Room in 10 minutes.

514
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:33,315
- Dr. Kovac.
- I'm tired of fighting with you.

515
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,724
- There's issue between you...
- It's my job to assess where I'm needed.

516
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,421
- I understand that.
- As for me and Sam, we're a couple.

517
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,157
I mean, it's not a problem.

518
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,098
All right, then.

519
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,568
Look, normally I try to
resolve internal issues...

520
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,674
as calmly, as
civilly, as possible.

521
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:53,370
And you probably don't understand
that, because in this case...

522
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,036
well, I didn't.

523
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,273
Look, from now on, I'm just
gonna focus my attention...

524
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,215
on determining how the
nurses should be utilized.

525
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,789
That sounds good.

526
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,762
Nice. Don't be so serious.

527
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,400
Try to relax a little
bit. Have some fun.

528
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,059
- It just feels too weird.
- It's okay, it'll be fine.

529
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,705
Come on.

530
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,137
Oh, grab those lollipops.

531
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,844
You're kidding, right?

532
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,073
No. Come on.

533
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,146
This guy's asking for you again.

534
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,087
Secret of my success, Chuny,
always leave them wanting more.

535
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,751
Done. Done. Dead.

536
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,727
And done.

537
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,538
You don't need
the bra. Take it off.

538
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,463
No, I can't.

539
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,928
It'll be fine.

540
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,363
Like this?

541
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,833
Nice. More open.

542
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,878
Oh, I just feel weird.

543
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,145
Do my legs look okay?

544
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,648
Yes. You have the
gams of a patriot.

545
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,852
Now, make love to the camera.

546
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,612
That's great!

547
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,658
Excellent.

548
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,324
Smile.

549
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:17,621
Perfect.

550
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,361
Hi.

551
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,001
Thank you.

552
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,864
Where's your Roller-date?

553
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,974
Lou. He said he'd come
back with pizza and sneakers.

554
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,406
Seems like a sweet guy.

555
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:36,144
So your lead levels
came back critical.

556
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,840
Is that from my treatments?

557
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,042
It's probably from the
herbs you were taking.

558
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:44,589
You're gonna need a series of
injections, but the anemia should resolve.

559
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:50,325
More importantly is what
you're doing about the BRCA.

560
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,691
- What I'm doing?
- Yeah.

561
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,356
Can you hold onto
this for a minute?

562
00:28:56,168 --> 00:29:00,606
If you like, I could get an oncologist
to come down here and talk to you.

563
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,332
No. I don't want that.

564
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,604
You okay?

565
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:09,543
I saw an oncologist
when I first found out.

566
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,687
And what made you get tested?

567
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:18,017
My doctor recommended
it, on account of my mother.

568
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,352
Is she positive too?

569
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:26,226
She beat cancer once when I
was little, but it came back to get her.

570
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,034
I watched her getting
smaller and smaller all winter.

571
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:32,899
And then, as soon as the leaves
began to go green, she passed away.

572
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,903
It was right before
my senior prom.

573
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,206
Just 44 years old.

574
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,141
I'm sorry.

575
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,640
Did the oncologist you
spoke with mention anything...

576
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,580
about prophylactic surgery?

577
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:49,722
- You mean having my breasts removed?
- And an oophorectomy.

578
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:54,053
I'd never do that.
That's why I tried Mexico.

579
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,793
I wanna fall in love.

580
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:02,060
I wanna have a child, a
family, while there's still time.

581
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:05,097
Then you might wanna
consider just the mastectomies.

582
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,390
- And wait for the ovarian...
- Just the mastectomies?

583
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,941
Would a man even
wanna look at me then?

584
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:14,010
There have been advances
in reconstructive surgery.

585
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,772
And you need to
protect yourself.

586
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:22,286
Can you promise me that giving
up my breasts would protect me?

587
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:26,124
It would decrease your chance
of getting cancer by 90 percent.

588
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:31,427
And I would lose months of my
life to recovery with no guarantees.

589
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,931
And the clock is ticking,
and I'm not getting younger.

590
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,666
So tell me which poison to pick.

591
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,675
The cancer risk or the surgery?

592
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,472
Well, I can't.

593
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:52,447
But maybe an oncologist could.

594
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,121
- Mr. Beckwith? BECKWITH:
Are you Doctor...?

595
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,851
Kovac. Yeah,
please, come with me.

596
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,495
Where is he? Can I see him now?

597
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,773
I'd like to talk to you
about his condition.

598
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,632
Is my wife here?

599
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,461
- She's in with Robbie now.
- Is he awake? I wanna see him.

600
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,866
- You will, soon.
- I told her not to get him that thing.

601
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,304
She's always making me out to be
the bad guy, spoiling that kid rotten.

602
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:20,571
Why don't we go inside so I can explain
to you where we're at with Robbie now?

603
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,977
I'm not going. I know
why you take people there.

604
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,913
- Sir, please...
- No, my boy is not dead!

605
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,484
Robbie?

606
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,154
- Mr. Beckwith.
- Robbie.

607
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,314
- Where is he? KOVAC:
Sir, can you just calm down?

608
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,824
Where is he? Robbie? Robbie!

609
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,029
- Robbie!
- Mr. Beckwith!

610
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,831
There's swelling in his brain.

611
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,000
We hope it's gonna go down soon.

612
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,846
We had to put an
emergency airway in his neck.

613
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:07,687
Oh, buddy, what did
you do? What did you do?

614
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,859
I'm sorry, Jack. I'm sorry.

615
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,130
No! No! BECKWITH: Oh, God!

616
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,436
Security! NORMA: No!

617
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,578
Stop it! Stop it!

618
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,049
Stop it!

619
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,520
Get off me! Get...

620
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,631
No.

621
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,856
I didn't want that floor to
be without an Attending.

622
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,549
That's all right. My shift
starts in 35 minutes anyway.

623
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,921
- Your shift?
- Yep.

624
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,758
Till we get new faculty, it's just
you, me and the moonlighters.

625
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,696
Hey, doc. Wife doesn't
wanna press charges.

626
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,063
- How about you?
- No.

627
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:27,263
When she leaves the room,
we'll let him go inside, see his son.

628
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,204
Hey, that burn victim who
went up to ICU, how's he doing?

629
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,900
He's hanging in there.

630
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,569
The guy's such a mess, he
can't even tell us his name.

631
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,239
- How you doing?
- That floor came out of nowhere.

632
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,442
Hey, I signed out to Morris.

633
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,088
He's our mini-chief, right?
- Just go.

634
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,917
Neela, you L-train-bound?

635
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,821
- In a minute.
- All right, I'll walk out with you.

636
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,627
- What are you doing?
- Found it in Sutures.

637
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,594
It was wrapped in
a death-kit shroud.

638
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,394
- It's kind of soggy.
- Frank, that was for Gallant.

639
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,935
Hey, try Lou Malnati's.
They overnight.

640
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:02,768
So, Neela, I feel you should
know that I minored in photography.

641
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:05,274
- So if there's anything you need a hand...
- Shut up.

642
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,083
What's he talking about?
- Nothing.

643
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,272
Okay, different tack. As Chief
Resident, I think I need to know...

644
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,440
what you and Abby
were doing in that room.

645
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,176
And by know, I mean see.

646
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,412
You know what, Morris?

647
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,448
Just because you're so cute.

648
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,862
Sebaceous cyst abscess.

649
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,655
On somebody's ass.

650
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,992
Oh, that was my
fat guy in Curtain 2.

651
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,863
Weighing in at an
easy 400 pounds.

652
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,130
Looks like it's leaking, Morris.
You might wanna check that out.

653
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,672
Ew.

654
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,840
I won't have to
sleep up here, will I?

655
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,504
No, we have a bed for
you on the third floor.

656
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,081
We both know what
they're gonna say.

657
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,883
The safest thing would be for
me to have the double mastectomy.

658
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,526
Well, I know it's a sacrifice...

659
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,959
but it's not as though you'd have
to live without breasts forever.

660
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:03,400
It won't be the same. It
won't feel like my body.

661
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:08,568
Well, the things you want,
you can't have if you get cancer.

662
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,202
So if you were
me, you would do it.

663
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:22,149
Well, sometimes, we want life
to stay the same, but it doesn't...

664
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,917
it changes, and if I were you, I hope
I would be brave enough to change.

665
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,055
Hi, Abby. Is this
Miss Lowenstein?

666
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,393
- Yes, it is.
- Dr. Geary can see you now.

667
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,231
I'll check on you tomorrow.

668
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,732
Thanks.

669
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,042
Someone picking you up?

670
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,313
Erica's dropping off Alex.

671
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,876
Heard you had a little
throwdown with a patient.

672
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:32,491
Not a patient. The
scooter kid's father.

673
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,489
Yeah, Robbie.

674
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,791
He was having some
purposeful movements.

675
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,625
Yeah. More than I can
say for myself today.

676
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,799
I shouldn't have left him.

677
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,704
It was the wrong thing
for the wrong reason.

678
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,638
- We'll figure it out.
- Yeah.

679
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,748
Let's start again tomorrow, huh?

680
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,848
Tell Alex I'll be seeing him
for that soccer game tomorrow.

681
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,290
He's gonna be real happy.

682
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,335
Hey. What, are you off?

683
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,837
No, coffee. I got
six more hours.

684
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,497
Hey, walk with me.

685
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,166
Okay.

686
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,776
Is something wrong?

687
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,847
You're sleeping with him?

688
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,513
I was. It's over.

689
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,177
It's never over, hon. Trust me.

690
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,423
I don't think it's appropriate
for you two to work together.

691
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,121
- What?
- Since I can't control physician shifts...

692
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,766
- I guess I gotta rejigger yours.
- Rejigger?

693
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,459
- I took a look at the schedule...
- Come on, wait.

694
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,629
And it seems to work out if you
work Tuesday and Friday nights...

695
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,207
and pick up a third
shift Saturday or Sunday.

696
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:01,039
That's two less than I'm doing, which
I can't afford, and I'll never see my kid.

697
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,132
- I'm doing you a favor.
- Doesn't sound like it.

698
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,080
I could do what any
manager would do.

699
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,911
How do you feel
about ICU or Recovery?

700
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,884
- Geriatrics always has openings.
- Threatening to transfer me?

701
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,545
I am giving you a choice.

702
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,382
I'm an ER nurse.

703
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:17,720
Right. So be here Friday,
8 p.m., ready to work.

704
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,468
- Hey.
- Don't you have work?

705
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,902
Nope, 48 hours off.

706
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,199
- Oh, lucky you.
- Yeah.

707
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,569
Thanks.

708
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:32,370
Oh, there's more in the fridge.

709
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,575
Well, who's the other one for?

710
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,882
Having a sleepover.

711
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,783
Hi. I ordered a Caesar
salad and a root beer.

712
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,326
That should be right out.
- Thanks.

713
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:01,371
Hey, sailor. New in town?

714
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,136
Have a seat.

715
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,606
No, I have to get going.

716
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,112
I took our BRCA
lady up to Oncology.

717
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,649
Yeah?

718
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:15,720
It was sad.

719
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:21,952
She was telling me how
she's at this point in her life...

720
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:26,063
where she's worried that
some of the things she wants...

721
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,426
she's never gonna have.

722
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:33,437
She could never
imagine feeling that way.

723
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,135
It's sad.

724
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,482
You must miss it.

725
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,389
Drinking.

726
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,191
Wow.

727
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,723
You'd be a terrible sponsor.

728
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,524
Yeah, I could never give up.

729
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,290
I'd miss it too much.

730
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,966
Well, you might wanna think
about suspending it for the evening.

731
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,140
Need a ride home?

732
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,402
No, but I think you do.

733
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,011
- I do?
- Mm-hm.

734
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,153
- You're not driving like this.
- I'm not?

735
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,339
No.

736
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:45,008
Ray, I can't concentrate!

737
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,563
Help yourself to something.
- Wow.

738
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,071
Didn't take you long to
embrace the bachelor lifestyle.

739
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,369
No. It's like riding a horse.

740
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,005
Or living in a barn.

741
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,109
Can't get him out of my head.

742
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,875
Who?

743
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,715
That guy.

744
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,187
What a mess.

745
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:42,594
All melted of flesh, but even
so, enough will to keep walking.

746
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:48,501
Body ruined, but
still desperate to live.

747
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,609
And he's alive.

748
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,880
Yeah, I wonder if I...

749
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,781
If I were hurt like that...

750
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:09,956
If you'd keep on walking?

751
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:15,289
If anyone would know who I was.

752
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,232
I would.

753
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,169
Probably.

754
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:35,752
You know, you might wanna
think about getting a housekeeper.

755
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,555
Because it's really
disgusting in here.

756
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,454
In a charming sort
of way, of course.

757
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,995
Do you want a coffee?

758
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:47,303
<i>You're watching the movie...</i>

759
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,024
<i>on WMAQ-TV, Chicago's Channel 5.</i>

760
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,571
Probably don't want a coffee,
but I got you a black coffee and...

761
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:15,691
<i>It's about time we
got out there, huh?</i>

762
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,860
<i>There's plenty of time.</i>

763
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,022
<i>Yeah, but they'll be
here any damn minute.</i>

764
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,498
<i>I think Sam's
right. We ought to.</i>

765
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:26,399
<i>- Yeah.
- What about after?</i>

766
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,700
<i>What about after we do it?</i>

767
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,007
<i>- Hmm?
- What do we do then?</i>

768
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,846
<i>Then you live with it.</i>
