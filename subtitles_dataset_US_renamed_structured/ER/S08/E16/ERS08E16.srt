1
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,684
Sorry. Did I wake you?

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,681
No.

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,789
Did you sleep well?

4
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,895
- Yes. It was great.
- You should have let me take the couch.

5
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:31,361
- It's not very comfortable.
- No, it was. It was. It was fine, really.

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,433
Were you cold?

7
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,726
I should have
turned up the heat.

8
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,475
I'm starting some coffee.

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,372
- Right. That Turkish mud that you like.
- It'll get you going.

10
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,347
It'll eat a hole in
your stomach lining.

11
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,645
- It's all right if...?
- Yeah. You can use the bathroom.

12
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,314
- I was just going to take a shower.
- I'll only take a minute.

13
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,620
<i>Leave a message at the tone.</i>

14
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,264
Susan?

15
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,089
- It's John.
- Carter.

16
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,598
- Time to get...
- Carter?

17
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,601
Hey. I was just trying to
wake you up on your machine.

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,901
- I'm up.
- I brought coffee. I brought bagels.

19
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,109
We were gonna catch
the 7:30 yoga, right?

20
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,646
Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,942
You're out early.

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,951
I was over at Mark's.

23
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,250
- Mark Greene?
- He's having some trouble.

24
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,393
I spent the night.

25
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,726
On the couch.

26
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,059
Come on up. I'll take a
shower, and then we'll go, okay?

27
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,537
Are you coming?

28
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,381
He's a friend.

29
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,151
- A good friend, I guess.
- Oh, would you drop it?

30
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,661
- Lonely too, with Elizabeth moving out.
- Nothing happened!

31
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,993
Were you gonna tell me
that you went over there?

32
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,692
I hadn't thought about it.

33
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,498
Something you don't want me to
know. Something you don't wanna tell me.

34
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,699
This petty, sarcastic side
of you is not appealing.

35
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,572
Oh, right. You'd be cool if
I spent the night over at...

36
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,407
Abby's?

37
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,045
Not Abby's. I was
gonna say Darla's.

38
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,017
- Darla? Who the hell is Darla?
- Radiology.

39
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,383
The one with the collagen
lips and the fake...?

40
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,817
They're not fake, are they?

41
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,790
- You were going to say Abby.
- I wasn't.

42
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,953
- Yes, you were.
- So now you can read my mind?

43
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,726
Well, it's not much of a challenge.
But if you were at Abby's, I'd kill you.

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,732
- That's a double standard.
- No, it's not.

45
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,269
- I'm not attracted to him. You are to her.
- You were.

46
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,670
He was attracted to me. Thanks for
not denying you're attracted to Abby.

47
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,506
How'd this become about me? You spent
the night at an old boyfriend's house.

48
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,511
He's not my old boyfriend.
He's like an older brother.

49
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,913
- And I don't want to sleep with him.
- I don't want to sleep with Abby.

50
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,816
Susan, John, take this one.
Got a head injury on a vent...

51
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,514
I'm not on for 10 minutes.
Tell me this is an easy one.

52
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,183
Cruella De Ville here had this guy
trussed up in some sort of love swing...

53
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:25,321
- suspended from the ceiling.
- The guy swore to me he weighed 275.

54
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,333
The torture swing is
guaranteed to 350 pounds.

55
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,663
He pulled the screws out of my ceiling!
- He's 450 pounds.

56
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,002
- Grab on. I ruptured a disc getting him.
- Gallant, get over here.

57
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,201
Just when you think
you've seen it all.

58
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,217
It hurts! CARTER:
What's he trying to say?

59
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,974
He said, "It hurts."

60
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,014
- Why is the mask still on?
- Refused to take it off.

61
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,518
40-year-old male, 6-foot fall to
his buttocks. Pelvic pain, can't walk.

62
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,020
- BP's 160/95, pulse, 110.
- What's your name, sir?

63
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,022
- No! No name!
- Do you know where you are?

64
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,956
A hospital? CARTER:
Frank, what's open?

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,187
- Trauma 1.
- Everything he's wearing is mine.

66
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,127
You cut it, you buy it.

67
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,698
Hey, Malik, Abby. You guys free?

68
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,199
CBC, dip a urine,
portable chest, pelvis.

69
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,898
What is that? DUMAR: A tail.

70
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,632
Careful. It's attached. Pure
horsehair. That's mine too.

71
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,368
Check his chest. I need
you to take your hood off, sir.

72
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,513
- No!
- I need to check your eyes and ears.

73
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,148
- Use the little flaps.
- All right. Any pain here, sir?

74
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,874
- No.
- Sinus tach.

75
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,814
- How about in here?
- Oh!

76
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,385
- Okay.
- No hemotympanum.

77
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,318
Pulse ox is 98 on room air.

78
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,483
Pupils equal and reactive.

79
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,851
Chest is clear. No rhonchi.

80
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,554
- Knees up.
- Buck up, wimp!

81
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,723
- Am I paralyzed?
- No. You probably bruised your butt.

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,893
We'll take some x-rays to make sure.
- Take your outfit off.

83
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,869
- The zippers screw up the x-ray.
- Can I keep my hood?

84
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,271
- Sure.
- What's going on in here?

85
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,434
- Titrate 10 of morphine.
- Ouch!

86
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,375
- Careful.
- Is that a tail?

87
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,947
Pure horsehair. It's attached.

88
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,949
- Is your hand all right?
- Fatso fell on me.

89
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,921
That's dislocated. I should get an
x-ray of this before I try and reduce it.

90
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,255
I'm not leaving. He's got
$2000 worth of my stuff.

91
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:05,593
I can do it here. It's gonna hurt. You'll
have to wear a splint for six weeks.

92
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,097
Can I wear it over my glove?

93
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,101
You can file for workmen's
comp. It's a job-related injury.

94
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,899
- Sure. It'll fit over your glove.
- Then do it.

95
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,939
This is really gonna hurt.

96
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:19,239
All right. Here we
go. One, two, three.

97
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,772
Ooh.

98
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,713
- All yours.
- What about my hood?

99
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,185
Go with him. We'll x-ray that
finger, make sure there's no fracture.

100
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,449
Malik, hand series.

101
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,459
Show's over, people.
Go back to work.

102
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:42,258
- So what was the tail attached to?
- Believe me, you don't wanna know.

103
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,960
We should have sold tickets.

104
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,299
Hey, what's this?

105
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,971
- I think it's hers.
- The mistress of pain?

106
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,169
After all that bitching about
her stuff, she left her bag here?

107
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,813
What's she have in this thing?

108
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,243
- I don't wanna know.
- I do.

109
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,281
- I'll take it to her.
- Take a look first.

110
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,248
- No, let's just take a peek.
- No.

111
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,752
- Not particularly.
- You guys are boring.

112
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,118
Hey, you need me
anymore, Dr. Carter?

113
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,322
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God!

114
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,995
Nobody could ever
actually use that, could they?

115
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,634
- What is that? Is that a...?
- Yeah, I think so.

116
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,360
What?

117
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,840
Come on, guys. This is a
patient's personal property.

118
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,805
- Oh, God.
- No kidding.

119
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,808
What's this? What's this for?

120
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,407
Ah!

121
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,683
- That is disgusting.
- That is disgusting.

122
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,314
Gallant, catch. GALLANT: No!

123
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:43,358
- What is that big purple thing? Oh, no!
- Oh, my God! Is that an on/off switch?

124
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,928
Ah!

125
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,868
Wow.

126
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,769
That does not occur in nature.

127
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,372
Ew, this is scary.

128
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,012
- Oh, Carter? Come on. Try it on.
- Get away from me with that.

129
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,310
No. I promise I won't
tighten the strap.

130
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,578
What do you think?
Should I quit my day job?

131
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,722
Dr. Kovac...

132
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,719
Do you have any idea what
kind of financial liability...

133
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,921
you could've opened
this hospital up to?

134
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,727
What if I'd been a patient
who just happened to walk in?

135
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,496
- Kerry, we were just blowing off steam.
- Yeah? Well, do it on your own time!

136
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,835
And with a medical
student in the room?

137
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,000
What were you thinking?
Were you thinking at all?

138
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,403
Who does this belong to?

139
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,310
Did someone bring this
thing into the workplace?

140
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,752
I think that we're all aware that
our behavior was inappropriate.

141
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:44,983
Inappropriate, unprofessional,
offensive. Who does this belong to?

142
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,488
Huh?

143
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,259
A patient.

144
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,761
- A patient.
- We treated her for a dislocated finger.

145
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,701
But she left her bag.

146
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,708
So you decided it would be fun to
pilfer through a patient's belongings?

147
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,746
Dr. Kovac, you're a Senior Attending.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

148
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,785
Dr. Lewis?

149
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,389
Abby?

150
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,918
- We're all sorry. LEWIS:
Damn right you're sorry.

151
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,895
I'll contact Human Resources, try to
get them not to convene a hearing...

152
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,967
which this department can ill afford
right now. I'm putting you all on notice.

153
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,764
I will not tolerate another episode of
inappropriate behavior from anyone.

154
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,372
Is that clear?

155
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,941
Is that clear? ALL: Yes.

156
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,076
Get this thing back
to its rightful owner.

157
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,550
And let's hope she doesn't notice
her belongings have been disturbed.

158
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,755
- Thanks a lot, girls.
- For what?

159
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,916
I asked you not
to touch that bag.

160
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,187
You could've left. No
one was keeping you here.

161
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,921
Carter's right. We didn't
want to open it. You two did.

162
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,863
I wonder what she's
saying to him in there.

163
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,998
Well, we should have told
her that Gallant wasn't involved.

164
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,833
You should have told her that
Luka and I weren't involved.

165
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,601
Were you that kid in elementary
school who always told?

166
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,712
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm great.

167
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,681
- She moved out?
- Yeah. That's the rumor.

168
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,217
- No rumor. Shirley told me.
- How would Shirley know?

169
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,355
She changed her number on the
surgical emergency-contact sheet.

170
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,287
- Over what happened with their girl?
- That is so sad.

171
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,553
- Did she move all her stuff out?
- They weren't right for each other.

172
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,562
- She's too much woman for him.
- Hey! If you ladies are done...

173
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,859
with the stitch and
bitch, can I work?

174
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,626
I'm surprised it
lasted this long.

175
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,361
- Poor Mark.
- It's really too bad.

176
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,529
Has Psych been down
to see the woman in 6?

177
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:40,730
Barker? No.

178
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,968
She tried to bite one of the
Salvadorian sisters from Housekeeping.

179
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,478
Chandra from Human Resources
called, said she'd be upstairs for an hour.

180
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,173
Tell Dr. Kovac I'll be
upstairs. He can page me.

181
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,149
Kerry, can I talk to you about
what happened this morning?

182
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,481
I'm heading up to Human
Resources right now.

183
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,888
Well, I think it's only right to tell
you that I was really the instigator.

184
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,819
Carter, Gallant, Kovac, they were
all opposed to me opening that bag.

185
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,989
What about Abby?

186
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,399
It was me. If there's gonna be
any disciplinary consequences...

187
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:15,064
- I should be the one held responsible.
- I appreciate you coming forward.

188
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,939
But they're adults. They could've
chose to leave the room or not participate.

189
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,412
I mean, when I entered, it was clear
that everyone present was involved.

190
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,282
Anything else?

191
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,354
No, that's it.

192
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,782
Oh!

193
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,763
Excuse me. Do you
know where Room 224 is?

194
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,568
- End of the hall, on your left.
- Thank you.

195
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,414
I thought I was late.

196
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,682
You are late.

197
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,325
Does anyone know how
long this is supposed to last?

198
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,463
All day, I think.

199
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,064
What are they gonna
do, show us videos?

200
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,465
Sexual-harassment videos.

201
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,737
Role-playing and long
lectures is what I heard.

202
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,406
Role-playing?

203
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,806
Acting out
inappropriate behavior.

204
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,673
- You two should excel at that.
- Would you drop it?

205
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,476
No. I won't drop it.

206
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,916
Yeah. Well, at least I'm not the
one who put that thing in her locker.

207
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,613
- Right.
- I didn't.

208
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,490
Don't look at me.

209
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,291
Luka?

210
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,406
But you should
have seen her face.

211
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,101
God, I wish I'd had a camera!

212
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,808
This isn't funny.

213
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,448
Sure, it is.

214
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,281
No, it's not.

215
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,785
This is gonna be
a very long day.

216
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,234
I think that's Whitman. - What?

217
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,436
Well, somebody
erased most of it. But...

218
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,810
<i>To be surrounded by beautiful
Curious, breathing, laughing</i>

219
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,146
- That's "I Sing the Body Electric."
- Oh, yeah. I know that one.

220
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,151
You know Whitman?

221
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,488
- Don't sound so surprised.
- No. Just most people don't.

222
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,118
Yeah. Well, <i>Fame.</i> You
know, the movie. It was in that.

223
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:54,427
Please! I love <i>Fame</i>. I've seen it,
like, 30 times. I wanted to be Coco.

224
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,930
<i>I sing the body electric</i>

225
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,935
<i>I celebrate the...</i>

226
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,907
How long are we gonna wait? This
thing was supposed to start at 8:00.

227
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,070
Probably got held
up by the snow.

228
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,509
We all got here.

229
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,952
- I say we go.
- I say we wait.

230
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,115
He speaks?

231
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:25,257
So what if he's late? We were
told to report to Room 224 at 0800.

232
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,966
I'm here. And I'm gonna stay here until
someone in charge tells me otherwise.

233
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,537
And I suggest you
all do the same.

234
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,665
0800. This ain't the
Marines, Gallant. At ease.

235
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,607
- It's the Army, Dr. Carter.
- Yeah?

236
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:42,647
I don't think anybody will court-martial
you because the guy didn't show up.

237
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,046
Gallant's right. We should wait.

238
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,881
I don't want to have to come
here again next Saturday.

239
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,055
Abby! Please! We're
in a public building.

240
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,689
I know. Nobody's here.

241
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,655
I'm here.

242
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,066
Maybe this is the punishment.

243
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,302
Sitting in this room.

244
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,671
Maybe they're watching us
to see how we all respond.

245
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,971
Like a test? LEWIS: Sure.

246
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,310
Hidden cameras recording
us for research or something.

247
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,680
Watching to see how we react
to the stress. How alliances grow.

248
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,583
How our social structures
break down under pressure.

249
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,417
Like on <i>Survivor.</i>

250
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,560
- You watch <i>Survivor?</i>
- Yeah. It's a great show.

251
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:34,595
All the backbiting and the lying.
It's human nature at its most venal.

252
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,396
Reality TV, one of the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

253
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,369
- Have you ever watched it?
- No.

254
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,000
Then shut up.

255
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,376
- I have a confession to make.
- You put the dildo in Weaver's locker?

256
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:55,248
- I watch <i>Fear Factor.</i>
- Oh, my God! I love that show.

257
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:59,119
Did you see the last one, where they
were bobbing for apples with the...?

258
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,126
And the snakes were climbing
into their hair and their mouths!

259
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,026
I thought that television
was just a vast wasteland.

260
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,430
Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to watch
<i>La Bohème</i> on PBS last night...

261
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,399
but I had to go to the symphony.

262
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,764
I watch television. Just
not that dehumanizing crap.

263
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,269
I mean, seriously, what's next? Televised
executions, bearbaiting, Torture Channel?

264
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,381
What is your problem today?
What are you so pissy about?

265
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,779
You know what my problem is.

266
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,749
You are kidding me. Still?

267
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,911
- What?
- You are still mad about that?

268
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,718
- You know what? Grow up.
- What? Oh, come on. Say it.

269
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,189
I spent the night at Mark's the night
before last, and he won't let it go.

270
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,598
I slept on the sofa. I was on the
couch. He thinks I slept with Mark.

271
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,534
- Don't talk about this here.
- Years ago he had a crush on me.

272
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:50,666
Now we're friends. More than I'll be
able to say about us if you keep it up.

273
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,507
Yeah. Okay. A harmless night spent
in a recently single man's apartment...

274
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,411
who's still desperately
in love with you!

275
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,314
- Mark is not in love with me.
- Who's recently single?

276
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,481
- Greene. Corday left him.
- When?

277
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,123
- Couple weeks ago.
- Where was I?

278
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,886
It was an emergency. I wouldn't have
gone over if he didn't really need me.

279
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,531
- Well, if he really needed you.
- He's a friend. I helped him out.

280
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,335
- I'm sure you did.
- Not discussing this with you anymore.

281
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,970
- What kind of emergency?
- None of your damn business!

282
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,639
Are they getting a divorce?

283
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,074
I don't think so. You know, when
you find out why I was over there...

284
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,612
- you are going to feel very small.
- So tell me.

285
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,341
- Very, very small.
- So tell me!

286
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,386
Abby's been sleeping on my
couch. Nothing's happened.

287
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,256
Yeah. I needed a place to stay
until I found a new apartment.

288
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,061
And Luka...

289
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,701
said I could stay with him.

290
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,137
You're more upset about
that than my staying at Mark's.

291
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,971
- What?
- No. I'm not.

292
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,407
Carter's still stuck on you.

293
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,707
All right. Can we change
the subject, please?

294
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,146
Now you wanna
change the subject.

295
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,253
How about them Bears, huh?

296
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,019
What?

297
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,795
Football?

298
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,432
I don't watch American football.

299
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,468
Well, they need to
beef up their defense.

300
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,036
But I think they'll be
real contenders next year.

301
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,107
I watch basketball.
Let's talk about the Bulls.

302
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,009
The Bulls stink.

303
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,178
How long were you
in the Army, Gallant?

304
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
I'm still in the Army. Reserves.

305
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,481
- They're paying for my med school.
- So they can call you up at any time?

306
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:49,695
Yeah, they can. I don't
think they will. Not yet.

307
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,662
You're not worried?

308
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,630
- I'd be fine if they did.
- With everything that's going on?

309
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:01,034
I wish they would give me a gun,
put me someplace where I could use it.

310
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,941
I'm ready to go if my country
needs me. Yes, ma'am.

311
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,910
- Luka was in the army. Right?
- Yeah?

312
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,380
All Croatian men are
required to serve in the military.

313
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,481
My brother Eric's in the Air
Force. He's in Saudi Arabia.

314
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,489
- He a pilot?
- No. He's an air-traffic controller.

315
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,921
I worry anyway.

316
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,926
My brother Gavin's in the
Air Force. Munitions specialist.

317
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,155
- Is he overseas?
- No, Texas.

318
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,301
But he thinks they're going.
My younger brother Frank...

319
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,801
is in the Marines at Pendleton.
My sister Carol's on the <i>Carl Vinson.</i>

320
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,339
How many siblings do you have?
- Six.

321
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,807
- All in the service? GALLANT:
Everybody who's old enough.

322
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,576
- Steve, he's only 14.
- Patriotic bunch.

323
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,880
It's the family business.

324
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,576
My father's got 26
years in as an NCO.

325
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,421
That's only five.

326
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,016
You only named five kids. You
said there were six in your family.

327
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,961
Yeah. My twin sister, Susan.

328
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,363
She's the black sheep.
Teaches Head Start in D.C.

329
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,125
That's disgraceful.

330
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,030
Yeah. We hide it
when company comes.

331
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,003
How did she stay out of the military?
Sounds like a prerequisite in your family.

332
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,438
She has cerebral palsy.

333
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,655
What does your
dad do, Dr. Lewis?

334
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,620
- My dad?
- Yeah.

335
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,259
He's a test pilot
for Barcalounger.

336
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:33,462
He sits all day in front of the TV trying
to get his cholesterol level over 400.

337
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,528
- Is he succeeding?
- He's dedicated.

338
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,500
He'll get there or die trying.

339
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,571
Hm. What does your
dad do, Dr. Kovac?

340
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,202
My father is a painter.
Not houses, art.

341
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,474
- Abstracts mostly. He's good.
- Really?

342
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,017
Yeah. I mean, not that
he's ever made a living at it.

343
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,588
He's a train conductor in
Zagreb. So that pays the bills.

344
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,859
- I didn't know that.
- You never asked.

345
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,193
Abby?

346
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,101
Oh, I have absolutely no
idea what my father is doing.

347
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,603
Okay. Dr. Carter?

348
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,368
- What?
- What does your dad do?

349
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,769
- Oh.
- Spends the family trust fund.

350
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,945
He manages several of
my family's investment funds.

351
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,917
- Sits on some corporate boards.
- Family investment funds?

352
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,285
Carter's loaded.

353
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,289
Really?

354
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,123
How loaded?

355
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,030
- Think Bill Gates.
- Not that rich.

356
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,565
Okay. Paul Allen, then.

357
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,803
How much are you worth, Carter?

358
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,802
Me, personally? Almost nothing.

359
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,174
Okay. Your family, then.

360
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,277
I have no idea.

361
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,572
Guess.

362
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,279
- I don't know. A lot.
- Fifty million?

363
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,122
A hundred million?

364
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,386
Two hundred million?

365
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,291
Five hundred million?

366
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,491
- Honestly, I don't know.
- Oh, my God! I knew you were rich.

367
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,967
I didn't know you
were that rich.

368
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,966
- Gamma's money.
- How old are you, 30?

369
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,268
- Thirty-one.
- How did you last this long...

370
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,640
without some girl marrying you?

371
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,746
We come with a built-in gold-digger
alarm. Gamma installs them at birth.

372
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,320
And I haven't set it off? You
better have that thing checked.

373
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,382
It's embarrassing.

374
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,584
Everybody assumes when you grow
up with money, everything's great.

375
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,026
Must be hard growing up in a mansion.
Was Gamma too cheap to heat the pool?

376
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,829
- Money isn't everything, Susan.
- That's easy for you to say.

377
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,996
We never had much. You know,
always struggled, but we were happy.

378
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,802
Yeah. Same here. I never
knew we didn't have money.

379
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:00,674
I always had everything I needed.
Presents at Christmas, clothing, food.

380
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,144
Seven hundred million.

381
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,814
Hey, I didn't ask
to be born into this.

382
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:15,656
- Is this the sexual-harassment group?
- Yeah.

383
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,024
Dr. Taylor called. He is coming.

384
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:22,897
He's having car trouble. He asks you
to wait. He'll be here as soon as he can.

385
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,101
Great.

386
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,847
I wonder what's in there.

387
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,550
What are you doing?

388
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:52,528
This worked in college when I
locked myself out of my dorm room.

389
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,801
They didn't have much.
Candy and sodas. No coffee.

390
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,072
- Anybody want the root beer?
- It's all yours.

391
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:06,906
Peanut-butter crackers. I love
those. Want to share them?

392
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,639
Sure. What's he doing?

393
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,784
- Breaking and entering.
- Why?

394
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,017
- What's that play?
- What play?

395
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,527
The one with two clowns who wait
for that guy who never shows up?

396
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:25,995
<i>Waiting for Godot?</i>

397
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:30,325
Yeah. I saw that at the
Goodman years ago. I didn't get it.

398
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,599
It's about the futility of
life and human enterprise.

399
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,833
You know, we're
all waiting. For what?

400
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,501
Fulfillment, love,
validation, approval?

401
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,174
It's a waste of time.

402
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,441
Life is an empty,
hollow exercise...

403
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,916
filled with pain, loss and grief.
The only thing we can expect...

404
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,751
to achieve in our lives is
our own inevitable death.

405
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:58,255
Wow. That is the most
depressing thing I've ever heard.

406
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,662
Glad you didn't grow up in the Balkans?
- Croatia is beautiful.

407
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,733
Zagreb, Dubrovnik.
You should go.

408
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,372
Kind of a high chance of
getting blown up, though.

409
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,032
Always discourages me from
adding a country to my travel itinerary.

410
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,602
It's very safe now.

411
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,775
Then why are you here?

412
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,080
Barbecue. You just can't find
good ribs in Zagreb, you know?

413
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,656
Not to mention spoon
bread and sweet-potato pie.

414
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,349
Carson's.

415
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,017
Exactly.

416
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:33,265
So how did you get into Weaver's
locker, Luka? It was locked.

417
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,934
Oh, it wasn't me.

418
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,240
No, I wish I thought
of it. I really do.

419
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:48,141
But I didn't.

420
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,179
Gallant?

421
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,681
Clever.

422
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,480
Very clever to accuse the rest of us
to throw suspicion away from yourself.

423
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,452
You still haven't
said you didn't do it.

424
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,223
Whitman was
writing about slavery.

425
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,897
He was an abolitionist.

426
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,267
The poem, "Body Electric."

427
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:16,198
I minored in
English lit at Howard.

428
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,843
Oh, yeah? I was English lit.

429
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,505
Where? ABBY: Penn State.

430
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,841
Really? You went to Penn State?

431
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,446
Yes. Did you assume I went to
community college because I'm a nurse?

432
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,213
- No. I didn't mean that.
- I think you did mean it.

433
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:33,223
You did it before, about the poem. It's
all right. It's all of you, all doctors.

434
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:36,362
You all think you're smarter than
nurses because you have an MD.

435
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,793
Don't drag me into this, okay?

436
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,262
- I don't assume that.
- You're still a med student.

437
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,402
You'll learn to become
condescending.

438
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,504
It's a test you take
before you graduate.

439
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,902
- I got an A. ABBY:
You got an A plus.

440
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,066
- Does anybody have a penknife?
- That's not true of all doctors.

441
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,711
Sure it is. It's a class thing.

442
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:55,905
It's part of the educational caste
system we have in this country.

443
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,176
Karl Marx went out of fashion
with black leather trench coats...

444
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,551
- and the collapse of central planning.
- You look down on Gallant's family...

445
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,987
because they're military. Like
it's vaguely pathetic to volunteer...

446
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,889
to defend our liberties with
their lives for crappy pay.

447
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,393
Yeah, that's true.

448
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,997
I don't feel that way. - Really?

449
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,293
I quit med school halfway
through my third year.

450
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,265
I was second in
my class when I quit.

451
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,166
Second? I didn't know that.

452
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,269
- Why did you quit?
- That's what I mean.

453
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,206
You can't imagine why
anybody wouldn't want to be you.

454
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,275
They tossed you out because your
ex-husband didn't pay your tuition.

455
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,577
- Yeah, but I chose not to go back.
- Halfway through your third year?

456
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,017
Why not finish? You finished the
hard part. It was starting to get fun.

457
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,090
Because I realized I
was proud of what I do.

458
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:42,854
- I make a difference in patients' lives.
- But you can do more as a doctor.

459
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,931
No. See, that's where you're wrong.
I would be doing less as a doctor.

460
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,762
You guys don't get to spend
any time with your patients.

461
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,904
How many do you
see a day, 30, 40?

462
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:58,903
You don't get to hold a little kid's hand
or teach a new mother how to nurse.

463
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,069
How many patients
do you see in a day?

464
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,774
Ten, maybe 12. And I'm not running
around all day trying to clear the board.

465
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,546
I made a choice. You can't understand
because it's not one you would choose.

466
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,383
I can't believe you
won't let me smoke this!

467
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,423
- I got it!
- Great. Now we're felons.

468
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,053
- Oh, cool.
- What?

469
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,324
There's a bunch of
fencing gear in here.

470
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,730
- I used to fence in school.
- Of course you did.

471
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,369
I fence. LEWIS: Fencing?

472
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,630
Are you gonna eat this cracker?
- No.

473
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,532
You really only see
10 patients a day?

474
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,471
I learned when I was acting.

475
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,404
- When were you an actor?
- In college.

476
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,355
I should warn you. I'm good.

477
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,185
Okay.

478
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,252
<i>- En garde.</i>
- They really say that?

479
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,331
That's a nice parry.

480
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:57,765
- You think they're trying to impress us?
- If they are, it's not working.

481
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,172
Ouch. Doesn't that hurt?

482
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,348
They really are a
couple of freaks.

483
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,225
- To think, you slept with both of them.
- I never slept with Carter.

484
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,261
- Did he tell you that?
- I thought you had.

485
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,867
No. That was a
rumor Carter started.

486
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:33,797
- Oh, God! He is low.
- I thought so.

487
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,813
I haven't slept
with Carter either.

488
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,478
- How long you guys been going out?
- A couple months.

489
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,846
Well, that definitely
violates the second-date rule.

490
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,785
- What rule?
- My friend has this theory.

491
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,983
You should sleep with a guy by
the second date. If it's not good...

492
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:57,651
you shouldn't waste time with
someone you don't have chemistry with.

493
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,923
Hm. I don't know if we
have chemistry or not.

494
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,499
There have been some
almost "spark" moments.

495
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:11,338
I think it's either there or it's not.
You can't force it. Believe me, I've tried.

496
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:21,585
Part of the problem with us is you.
He denies it but he's not convincing.

497
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,813
Why didn't you two happen?

498
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,486
Timing.

499
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,988
Ah!

500
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,597
Ow. KOVAC: You okay?

501
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,058
- Yeah.
- If you're hurt, we should stop.

502
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,027
No.

503
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,634
Come on.

504
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,004
Come on, let's go.

505
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,544
- This is not going to end well.
- Hey, aren't you guys tired yet?

506
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:56,949
Ow!

507
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,250
Ah! LEWIS: Hey!

508
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,891
- Hey!
- Oh, my God! Carter!

509
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,557
- Dr. Carter!
- Knock it off!

510
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,288
- Cut it out, Carter.
- All right!

511
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,236
- You maniac!
- You started it!

512
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,772
- Look at this! Look at this!
- You went for my face.

513
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,807
After you hacked at my side!

514
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,969
I always thought fencing
was a finesse sport. Sorry.

515
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,880
Okay, let me see. KOVAC: Ah!

516
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,848
- Ouch!
- Don't be a baby.

517
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,850
- Crazy bastard.
- Ah, ah, ah!

518
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,983
- He was trying to kill me.
- It looked like it was mutual.

519
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,252
- Am I gonna need stitches?
- No, you barely need a Band-Aid.

520
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,225
I didn't know you had a temper.

521
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,930
I can ask Abby to come over here
and check you out if you'd prefer.

522
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,703
What?

523
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,403
That man is a menace. That...
and I could have lost my eye.

524
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,046
What was that for?

525
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,516
- Just checking.
- For what?

526
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,678
Second-date rule.

527
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,020
What?

528
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,888
What?

529
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,358
How did you get
Weaver's combination?

530
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,622
Michael? Sneak a
look over her shoulder...

531
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,961
when she wasn't looking? When
she was opening it? It is Michael?

532
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,500
Yeah. Michael.

533
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,738
You knew the combination, so you snuck
in the lounge when no one was looking.

534
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,399
- And you put it in there.
- Why would I do that?

535
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,706
She said something that pissed
you off so much you wanted revenge.

536
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,906
The quiet ones are
always the most dangerous.

537
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,678
- I'm a student. I could get expelled.
- Still waters run deep.

538
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,084
It wasn't me.

539
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,254
Where were you living before?

540
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,923
Scottsdale,
Arizona. Land of sun.

541
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,933
And you decided to
move back to Chicago?

542
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:30,469
I don't know. The desert, 120 degrees
in the shade, never a cloud in the sky.

543
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,338
Kind of depressed me.

544
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:36,413
I needed to be back where the
sun doesn't come out for weeks!

545
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:40,609
Bitter cold and overcast skies
better suit my temperament.

546
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,922
But mostly I was running away.

547
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,318
From what?

548
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,756
- A guy. What else?
- Chemistry?

549
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,055
A tanker truck full. Too much.

550
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,822
- What was his name?
- Charlie Dixon. Dix.

551
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,370
He's a cowboy. Can you believe
it? An honest-to-God cowboy.

552
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:03,338
He has the horse, the
pickup truck, the whole deal.

553
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,143
I'm a walking cliché.

554
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,438
Was he cute?

555
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,810
What happened?

556
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:17,950
It's complicated. I'd rather not
talk about it if you don't mind.

557
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,226
Cowboy.

558
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,499
So you were in the army.

559
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,808
- Yeah.
- You see some action?

560
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:44,710
- Okay, sorry.
- It's not what you think it is.

561
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,417
Well, what do you
think I think it is?

562
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:53,892
Noble. Romantic. A crucible in
which to test your young manhood.

563
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:57,118
No, I'm not that naive.

564
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,690
Sure you are.

565
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,697
Luka, how old were you
when you became a man?

566
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,531
- What?
- When you lost your virginity.

567
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,435
How old were you?

568
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,410
- We're playing a game. How old?
- I don't want to play.

569
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,947
Oh, come on. We made a bet which one of
the five of us lost their virginity first.

570
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,548
- Who'd you pick?
- Not telling.

571
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,811
- I picked Kovac.
- No, she didn't.

572
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,784
- Luka?
- I don't want to play.

573
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,290
Told you they don't want to play.
- All right. I'll go first.

574
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,592
I was 16.

575
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:32,856
Howie Thomas.

576
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,599
He was on the lacrosse team.
What's wrong with...? What?

577
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,248
- Howie? ABBY:
What's wrong with that?

578
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,100
He sounds like a
plumber or something.

579
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,900
I was terrified.

580
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,976
So was he. It was the
longest 20 seconds of my life.

581
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,281
- Twenty seconds?
- Yeah, if you count the foreplay.

582
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,643
Okay. My turn.

583
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,881
Mark Greene. No! I'm just
kidding. Just kidding, Carter.

584
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,289
Floyd Walker. I was 15.

585
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,928
Floyd? And you gave me
a hard time about Howie.

586
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,462
In the shed behind his
father's radiator-repair shop.

587
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,754
Very romantic.

588
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:10,932
The smell of antifreeze
still turns me on.

589
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,699
Gallant?

590
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,003
You don't need their
approval. Come on, give it up.

591
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:23,040
Okay. Tanya McBride, in the balcony
of our church after choir practice.

592
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,739
- Wow!
- Your church?

593
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,283
- Yeah, I know.
- How old?

594
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,445
Let's see, I was in ninth
grade, so I was about 14.

595
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,090
All right. We have a new leader.

596
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,952
Carter?

597
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,986
Come on.

598
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,099
Oh, my God!
You're still a virgin!

599
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,666
Ha-ha.

600
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,301
- I was 11.
- Eleven years old?

601
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,337
Really?

602
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,108
How old was she?

603
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:56,740
- I don't know. 25.
- You're kidding me.

604
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,907
Oh, my God!

605
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,476
She was one of the maids.

606
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,312
- Did you pay her?
- My parents did.

607
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,185
To have sex with you?

608
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,050
To be a maid.

609
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,928
I hope you gave her a
hell of a Christmas bonus.

610
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:17,535
All right. Luka, 11. It's going
to be very tough to beat.

611
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:23,173
Don't say how old. Confirm you were
older than 11 and Carter wins the prize.

612
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,833
- I get a prize?
- Don't let your imagination run away.

613
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,172
My wedding night.

614
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,219
I lost my virginity
on my wedding night.

615
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,818
It's okay. It's a good memory.

616
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,689
I hadn't thought
about that in years.

617
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:54,195
We were very young and she
was religious, so we waited.

618
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,736
We loved each other very much.

619
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,409
It's okay. It's okay.

620
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:20,395
What were you in? You said you were an
actor in college. What plays were you in?

621
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,030
We did <i>Hamlet.</i>

622
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,302
I did <i>Hamlet.</i>

623
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,767
I played Horatio.

624
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,766
- Who did you play, Luka?
- Hamlet.

625
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,568
In English or Croatian?

626
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,440
Why would I do it in English?

627
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,445
Were you any good?

628
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,910
My mom thought so.

629
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,577
Do you remember any of it?

630
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,714
No, it's been a long time.

631
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,856
I think I remember some of it.

632
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:57,035
To be or not to be,
that is the question.

633
00:38:57,202 --> 00:39:01,799
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind's
eye to suffer the slings and arrows...

634
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,874
of outrageous fortune...

635
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,941
or to take arms against a sea of
troubles and by opposing end them.

636
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,343
That's the easy part.

637
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,749
To die, to sleep no more...

638
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,151
and by a sleep to say
we end the heartache...

639
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:23,762
and the thousand
natural shocks...

640
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,961
I don't remember the rest of it.

641
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,693
To die, to sleep...

642
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,961
to sleep...

643
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,601
perchance to dream.
Ay, there's the rub.

644
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:34,561
Be all my sins remember'd.

645
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,733
Sorry I'm so damn late.

646
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,902
I spent half an hour digging my car
out, and then the battery was dead.

647
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,518
I appreciate you waiting for me. I
didn't expect anyone to still be here.

648
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,052
I'm John Taylor.

649
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,885
Please, would everybody move
down front? I won't have to yell.

650
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:01,686
Come on. Come on. I won't bite.

651
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,656
Raise your hand when I
call your name, if you would.

652
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,233
- John Carter.
- Here.

653
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,732
- Michael Gallant?
- Gallant. Yes, sir.

654
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,895
- Luka... Oh, boy. Help me out.
- Kovac.

655
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:17,065
Dr. Kovac. Thank
you. Susan Lewis.

656
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,539
- And that leaves Abigail Lockhart?
- Abby.

657
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:24,153
So let's begin by
reviewing current state...

658
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,042
and federal law for
what is appropriate...

659
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,415
and inappropriate
behavior in the workplace.

660
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,756
- Hey, it stopped snowing.
- It's about time.

661
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:38,385
- Anybody need a ride? I got my car.
- I'm on in 20 minutes.

662
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,293
You're working tonight?

663
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,591
Yeah? Me too.

664
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:46,299
- Well, that was fun.
- Let's try to never do it again.

665
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,599
You want me to give
you a lift to the hospital?

666
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,572
- It's a few blocks. Gallant will walk me.
- Sure.

667
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:54,440
- You have your keys?
- Yeah. I'll try not to wake you.

668
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,275
See you guys later.

669
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,749
I had fun talking. We
should have coffee sometime.

670
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,410
Sure. I'd love that.

671
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:04,920
- Ready?
- Yep.

672
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,183
- Good night.
- Night.

673
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,992
- She's pretty great.
- Who?

674
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,363
Abby. I didn't know her before.
I didn't think I'd like her, but I do.

675
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,662
You want to get something
to eat? I'm starving.

676
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,170
You know, you really
made a fool of yourself today.

677
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,138
- What?
- If you're worried about Abby...

678
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,675
living with Luka, don't
be. Nothing's going on.

679
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:31,282
- How did I make a fool out of myself?
- Well, you participated in a duel...

680
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,441
for one thing.

681
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,390
Kiss me.

682
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,694
Just kiss me.

683
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,595
Was it there for you?

684
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,602
- It was nice.
- It wasn't there for me either.

685
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:03,506
- Okay, go before I change my mind.
- You sure?

686
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:08,415
I regret it already. That gold-digger alarm
should be clanging like a school bell.

687
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,316
This isn't because Mark Greene
suddenly became available?

688
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:15,551
Know when I said you were making a
fool of yourself? You're doing it again.

689
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,858
- You should tell her.
- Who?

690
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,596
- Tell her what?
- That you're in love with her...

691
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,432
and can't live a
moment without her.

692
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,339
Really?

693
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,703
You're hopeless.

694
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,375
You'll figure it out.

695
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:38,911
Friends?

696
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,712
No, I hate you.

697
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,721
Hey. I used to have
Weaver's locker.

698
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:51,726
She never changed
the combination.

699
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,896
It was you!
