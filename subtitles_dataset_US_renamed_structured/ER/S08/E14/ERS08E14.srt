1
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,788
Dr. Lewis, you need to get up.

2
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,792
- Dr. Lewis!
- What?

3
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,590
- You need to get up.
- Oh.

4
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,657
- What time is it?
- Almost 7.

5
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,932
Oh, my God, I was just
gonna lie down for a second.

6
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,630
- When was that?
- 1:30.

7
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,808
I need to get home.

8
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,516
Animal attack from
the zoo in 15 to 20.

9
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,278
- Oh, no. I'm not on till noon.
- Weaver needs you now.

10
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,978
Yeah, and I need a hot
shower and some mouthwash.

11
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,981
Dr. Greene is still
up in the PICU.

12
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,491
Someone has to cover him. You
happened to be curled up in the lounge.

13
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,152
- Is she extubated?
- His daughter?

14
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,298
- Yeah.
- They're waiting on a blood gas.

15
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,796
- She triggering the vent?
- No.

16
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,265
- Did Neurology read the EEG?
- I don't know.

17
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,337
- I said, no!
- We're talking bagels and cream cheese.

18
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,337
No one is taking a bribe.

19
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,705
Promotions like this add to
the cost of pharmaceuticals.

20
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:20,177
Marketing expenditures passed
on to mostly elderly consumers.

21
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,542
I'm elderly.

22
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,150
- There's no free lunch, Frank.
- This is breakfast.

23
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:28,449
Yes. This is Susan Lewis in the ER. I
need to speak with the charge nurse.

24
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,888
They weaned her down to
30 percent, she's off sedation...

25
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,618
and the PICU fellow
ordered a CPAP trial.

26
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,526
Oh, uh, thanks. Never mind.

27
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:42,567
I'll take the rack. You clear the
pass-ons and get this borborygmi out of 4.

28
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,399
You wanna ask me to cover
all day after staying all night?

29
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,371
All night was your choice.
Welcome to management.

30
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,068
- No whining allowed.
- You sleep with your eyelids open.

31
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,645
- Partly open.
- Still...

32
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,146
kind of freaky.

33
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,979
Not as freaky as watching you eat
with your mouth open. Any strawberry?

34
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,352
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Looking for a knife.

35
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,355
- Next to the penlights.
- All right. You're gonna eat that?

36
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,758
Why not?

37
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:11,194
The next time you get a pneumonitis
and you have to prescribe Reprotrex...

38
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:15,996
or the cheaper, effective generic drug,
you're not gonna feel slightly beholden?

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,868
By a bagel? No.

40
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,666
Are you sure?

41
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,703
Okay. I'm gonna go to Doc Magoo's,
get some breakfast, find a toothbrush...

42
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,609
change my underwear, and
then I'll clear your borborygmi.

43
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,840
Fifteen minutes.

44
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:33,044
If I stick with the underwear I've got
on, can we at least keep the food out?

45
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,089
It's all right. It's all right.

46
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,618
You can't titrate a little
Versed so she won't remember?

47
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,663
Any benzo decreases
her ventilatory drive.

48
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,865
Then do it.

49
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,936
But if you allow the sedation to
wear off, you have to be ready.

50
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,268
I need to warn you. Extubation's a leap of
faith with little ones. I can't do a NIF.

51
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,605
PEEP's under two,
CO-2 is normal.

52
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,172
- Let's go.
- Okay.

53
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,908
Have the ambu bag ready.
Disconnecting the vent.

54
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,378
And tape is clear.

55
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,189
And tube. Suction.

56
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,396
All right, come on, Ella.

57
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,497
Big cough. Big cough.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,929
She's not breathing.

59
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,564
Blow by O-2. Give
her time. Give her time.

60
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,432
Break open the airway box.
Draw up a milligram of midazolam.

61
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,941
Come on, Ella.

62
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,580
- Positive pressure now.
- No, wait.

63
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,447
That's a happy sound.

64
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,958
We're here. We're
here. It's all right.

65
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,295
Yeah, we're here.

66
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,212
Is his car still there?

67
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:51,822
Sometimes he skips Marketing,
but he won't skip Cost Accounting.

68
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,153
If you wanna wait, I can
be there when you do it.

69
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,266
No. I'm gonna ask him at school. He'll
stay calm in front of his study group.

70
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,096
- You can't ask him, Joyce.
- Right. I know.

71
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,540
- And you have to leave if he doesn't...
- I know. I know.

72
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,536
Do you wanna come
to work with me?

73
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,045
- Can I stay here until he leaves?
- Of course.

74
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,945
Call me after you talk to him.

75
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,146
Abby.

76
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,458
These groups, they really work? He
only lasted two sessions in counseling.

77
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,028
- Joyce...
- I know.

78
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,166
I wanna try and help
him. It's worth a try.

79
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,133
You can go back to him if he gets better,
or file a complaint and a judge can...

80
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,239
He'll do this. If he knows I'm
serious, he'll do this for me.

81
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,172
- Call me.
- Thanks, Abby.

82
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,704
Lock the door.

83
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,822
Abby?

84
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,457
You seen Joyce?

85
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,889
- Abby, my wife. You seen her?
- What? No.

86
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,995
She didn't come home.
I'm getting worried.

87
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,488
- She didn't call you?
- No.

88
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,095
Did you call the police?

89
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,661
No. We had a fight.

90
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,271
- She might just be mad at me.
- Oh.

91
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,101
- If you hear from her, have her call me?
- Yeah, sure.

92
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,603
Thanks. Have a good day.

93
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,163
She's moving extremities?

94
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,344
All four. Fixing and
following. Good color.

95
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,851
Oh, Mark, that's great.

96
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,855
No seizure in the next 48
hours, we should be home free.

97
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,048
What's that for?

98
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,252
The breast pump up in OB
is missing a collection tube.

99
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,522
- She's eating?
- She's about to try.

100
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,861
- Thank you for covering.
- Don't worry. Take care of your daughter.

101
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,368
Positive LOC. Now
GCS 13, postictal.

102
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,869
Uh, this is the zoo trauma?

103
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,406
- Yeah. He got bit by a monkey.
- It was a sloth.

104
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,567
- What is a sloth?
- It's like a monkey.

105
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,975
No, it's not. They're not
anything like primates.

106
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,741
They're not even in the same order.
- Dr. Greene?

107
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,884
I hear your baby's doing better.

108
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,255
- Off the vent.
- Oh, good. That's really good news.

109
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:06,418
- I didn't file a H-5122 with the chart.
- A what?

110
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,892
Mandatory reporting of
illegal substance abuse.

111
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,530
Oh, right.

112
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,265
I just wasn't sure. I thought
maybe you'd want to...

113
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,129
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

114
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,337
Um...

115
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,016
Sometimes it takes a little
longer during shift change.

116
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,450
Shift change?

117
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,990
When one nurse goes
home, another comes on?

118
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,019
Oh, right.

119
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,856
I'll go get her.

120
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,531
- Etoposide?
- Two-CdA.

121
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,328
He'll piggyback in the second phase.
- Hey.

122
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,665
His IV has run out, and
there's an alarm going off.

123
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,468
It's only a pretreatment solution. The
nurse will change it when they move him.

124
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,543
- Move him?
- To the, uh, treatment room.

125
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,772
His cells are almost
100 percent leukemic.

126
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,507
He'll need a second
chemo induction now.

127
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,618
- And then a bone marrow transplant.
- He's already failed one.

128
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,484
Another one's gonna make him
sicker and be more dangerous.

129
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,389
- Chemotherapy alone is gonna save him?
- Maybe.

130
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,359
He's gonna get a set of
drugs he didn't get before.

131
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:22,194
- You've decided to experiment on him?
- I haven't decided anything.

132
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,398
Look, it's as much luck as
science involved at this point.

133
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,370
- You look like you need a rest.
- No.

134
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:34,806
You're gonna pump that junk back
into his veins, I'm gonna stay right here.

135
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,491
I meant to get the ring sized
smaller, but I didn't get the chance.

136
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,722
How did you swallow it?

137
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,832
He likes me to
suck on his fingers.

138
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,199
I see.

139
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,436
Nothing to panic about. It
should pass in two or three days.

140
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,435
- "Pass"?
- Two or three days?

141
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,133
She'll be fine. Add some fiber to
your diet and let nature take its course.

142
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,743
He's not worried about me.

143
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,178
He's afraid his wife'll notice
his wedding ring is missing.

144
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,875
- Oh.
- There's nothing we can do?

145
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,452
Well, I could try an endoscopy.

146
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,121
I don't like the sound of that.

147
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,917
- We stick a tube down your throat...
- I gotta get to work.

148
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,354
Honey, I need my ring!

149
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,893
Well, I need my job.
I'm on stage in an hour.

150
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,463
I gotta get to work. And I
ain't searching my stool.

151
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,724
Abby's ready for
that vag bleed in 1.

152
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,233
- I got Registry to fill in for me.
- You're leaving?

153
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,298
I'm on my second dose of
Compazine. I'm still puking.

154
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,134
Five hundred? GINGER: Hey.

155
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,709
How much would you charge
to stick a tube down your throat?

156
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,903
You two negotiate.
I'll be right back.

157
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,213
Frank, are you sick too?

158
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,186
I ain't praying!

159
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,787
- How many pads?
- Two so far. Started bleeding yesterday.

160
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,898
Hi, Valerie, I'm Dr. Lewis.
When was your last period?

161
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,830
- Uh, two months ago.
- Do you think you could be pregnant?

162
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,994
My parents would freak. My
older sister just had a baby.

163
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,141
Abby, line two.
It's your neighbor.

164
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,244
Just relax. I need to
take a look, all right?

165
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,342
- Joyce? LEWIS:
How old is your sister?

166
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,142
- Eighteen.
- Okay, wait. What? Hold on. Hold on.

167
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,617
What?

168
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,715
Okay. Uh, come here, and
I'll give you my key and...

169
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,855
Do you have a coat on?

170
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,931
- Maybe she's not hungry.
- She hasn't had anything in 12 hours.

171
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,437
Come on. Come on, Ella. Come on.

172
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:41,700
- We could put a little TPN in her line.
- Hey, there.

173
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,106
There. She's taking it.

174
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,837
Yeah, you're hungry,
aren't you? Yeah.

175
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,107
Dr. Greene, your
daughter's on the phone.

176
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,280
I'll call her back.

177
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,681
Where is she?

178
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,652
Home. Katherine stayed over.

179
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,459
- Did they charge her with anything?
- Who?

180
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,522
The police.

181
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,129
No.

182
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,562
Well, what did they do?

183
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,997
You didn't tell them, did you?

184
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,169
I wasn't the
Attending physician.

185
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,038
Mark, she was in possession
of a controlled substance...

186
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,043
that could've
killed our daughter.

187
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,079
She wasn't trying to hurt her.

188
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,252
It was three pills. I don't think
they're gonna waste a lot of time on it.

189
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,150
- Waste time?
- You know what I mean.

190
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,086
You're already
making excuses for her.

191
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,591
- No, I'm not.
- You're not doing anything, are you?

192
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,424
What would you like me to do?

193
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,529
You want me to
have her arrested?

194
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,603
You think she should go to
juvenile hall? Would that be better?

195
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,069
Do something. You haven't
even called her mother.

196
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,233
- Well, I've been a little busy...
- There's a phone!

197
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,442
- She's in court all day.
- No. No, you're avoiding.

198
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,173
Even now you're refusing
to deal with a problem...

199
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,269
you should have handled
way before this happened!

200
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,079
- Are you blaming me for this?
- Oh, damn it!

201
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,285
Her stomach's just upset.

202
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,585
Trauma 2. Have fun.

203
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,785
I'm going home before
it comes out both ends.

204
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,431
- Who's working the desk?
- Personnel is sending a temp.

205
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,930
I'm already down four nurses.

206
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,298
Abby is coming back, but this is
gonna get worse before it gets better.

207
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,534
Anybody who ate those bagels and
that cream cheese is gonna blow chunks.

208
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,775
I ate one of those bagels.

209
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,278
I'll add your name to
the class-action suit.

210
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,353
Oh, my God! Joyce, I thought
you said you were just locked out.

211
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,084
He came back. He left
and then he came back.

212
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,491
Where are your shoes?

213
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:46,155
I just ran. I hid down the
street until he left again.

214
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,766
Okay, let me see.

215
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,128
Can you just let me
inside? It's freezing out here.

216
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,171
- We need to go to the hospital.
- I'm okay.

217
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,603
No. I have to get an x-ray.

218
00:12:56,175 --> 00:13:00,772
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Yes, it is. Your cheekbone's broken.

219
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,815
Pulse ox is 82 on 2 liters.

220
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,079
- Oh, no. Not you too.
- Yeah. I had the garlic.

221
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,246
No breath sounds
on the left. Chest tube.

222
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,685
Am I dying?

223
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,418
- The icicle collapsed your lung.
- Pressure's down to 70.

224
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,927
- God! This is it.
- Squeeze in 2 liters of saline.

225
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm gonna use a
tube to re-inflate it.

226
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,763
I reached Dr. Kovac. Mark's
coming down until he gets here.

227
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,062
- No, we can handle this.
- I have to go home.

228
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,264
If I'm working a double, you're
not stiffing me after a few hours.

229
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,341
No, I really have to go home.
- Wait. Wait!

230
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,103
You ate the bagels?

231
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,941
- It's a teaching hospital.
- I'd still prefer you to do it.

232
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,776
Mm-hm.

233
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,714
What's your mom doing in
there? I thought he was an orphan.

234
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,685
You should at least
be supervising her.

235
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,721
I can see her from here.

236
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:48,028
John, something's wrong,
he's coughing up blood!

237
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,686
They gave him a blood
thinner. Hemoptysis is normal.

238
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,196
- This isn't normal.
- Did you hit the lung?

239
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,925
No. I slipped it
in the subclavian.

240
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,195
Pulse ox is 95. Let's
bring him to 2 liters.

241
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,101
- Is he thrombocytopenic?
- Thirty thousand this morning.

242
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,766
- Pretty low for a central line.
- They transfused him after the treatment.

243
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,208
Please stop debating
this and help him!

244
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,882
- What do his coags look like?
- He got platelets, cryo and FFP.

245
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,882
- He's in pain. Help him.
- Morphine?

246
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,711
Pressure's low already. I
don't wanna bottom him out.

247
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,618
You can always
give him more blood.

248
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,315
Sure. Blood in, blood out.

249
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,091
Let's page Dr. Neiser. CBC, PT,
PTT, portable chest and a blood gas.

250
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,462
And call the blood bank. Have them
prep another 10-pack of platelets.

251
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,262
And an x-ray. Let's
check placement.

252
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,066
How are you doing there, Mick?
Are you having any trouble breathing?

253
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,811
Mom?

254
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,742
Mom, what are you doing?

255
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,248
I can't. Please
take care of him.

256
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,512
I'm only here because
you asked for my help.

257
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,919
I can't see him in that
kind of pain. Not again.

258
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,025
- What did you expect?
- I don't know.

259
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,184
You can't get this kid's
hopes up and leave!

260
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,653
You're gonna do this?

261
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,356
You're gonna drag me back
and bail when it gets tough?

262
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,799
The kid doesn't think he has to
do this alone again! Don't leave him!

263
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,496
Thank you.

264
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,269
She was at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Shortness of breath and wheezing.

265
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,109
Ariel, are you
allergic to any food?

266
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,513
- Did you give epi? OLBES:
It got worse as we pulled up.

267
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,347
- Go upstairs. I got this.
- I saw the board. You're buried.

268
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,013
- I'll close to trauma.
- It's bad enough you got my shift.

269
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,954
- It's not a problem.
- Slide her over.

270
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,452
Are you sure that you've never had
any asthma or trouble breathing before?

271
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,099
Put her on a pulse ox and
get Respiratory down here.

272
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,034
- What were you eating?
- Shrimp and lobster.

273
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,895
- Shrimp and lobster?
- Where do you keep pulse ox cables?

274
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,040
- Second drawer.
- Did you eat a lot?

275
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,207
Fifty of Benadryl, 125 of Sol...

276
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:48,973
Solu-Medrol?

277
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,650
Yeah. IV, now.

278
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:55,721
And let's get a crash cart
ready. 6.5 ET and a two-mac.

279
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,220
No, really, Mark. I got this.

280
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,484
Ella's doing great,
okay? She's sleeping.

281
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,154
- I need the distraction.
- They're not here.

282
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,728
Well, then try next door.

283
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,162
She's not moving air. Get
her on a nebulizer. Push 1cc...

284
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,995
Where are the pulse ox cables?

285
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,830
- Who are you?
- Registry.

286
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,165
Outside, third
supply cart to the left.

287
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:19,036
Most of the time, we totally
click. We totally get each other.

288
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,907
- He makes me laugh.
- Okay, sit back.

289
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,016
- He's considerate.
- Okay, that's good.

290
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:29,349
Other days, he's just a different
person. He becomes a different person.

291
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,454
Chin up.

292
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,921
And then I become
a different person.

293
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:39,161
I know he's all the
same man, it's just...

294
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,797
- Hard to walk away from the good part.
- You have to hold still.

295
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,701
Ninety-five percent of the time,
he's my best friend, my husband.

296
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,774
- That's hard to walk away from.
- Well...

297
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,708
it looks like he
answered your ultimatum.

298
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,044
I didn't have a
chance to give it.

299
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,081
I think he answered
it all the same.

300
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,880
Yeah, well, how long
is that gonna take?

301
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,424
Look, this isn't just any
patient, this is my daughter.

302
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,693
Call another neurologist if you
have to, I want that EEG read.

303
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,074
She smiled at me.

304
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,141
That's good, right?
She's smiling?

305
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,017
Yes. That's good.

306
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,590
I was thinking about
taking one at a party.

307
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,727
They were in my
bag. I forgot about it.

308
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm so sorry.

309
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,608
- Nothing I can do can make it right.
- You can leave.

310
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,606
You can pack up your
things and leave my house.

311
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,787
Uh...

312
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,846
- I have to call my mom.
- Then call her.

313
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,637
Dr. Lewis, I need a
facial-lac repair in 2.

314
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:25,670
Uh, simple or complex?

315
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,967
She's gonna need a couple sub-Q,
and I'm waiting on a facial series.

316
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,305
Okay. Send her over to
CT and clear this hallway.

317
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,004
Why is there a pregnant
woman squatting in the hallway?

318
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,692
- Susan?
- I need you to see her.

319
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,480
Yeah. One second.

320
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,246
- Who's running the desk?
- That's Bouser, from Accounting.

321
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,854
Of course. That makes sense.

322
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,820
She's never been
allergic to anything.

323
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,859
Shellfish allergies come suddenly.
Especially with large amounts.

324
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,428
This is Dr. Lewis.
I'll be right back.

325
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,293
- She's still wheezing.
- Dad, I talked to Mom.

326
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:57,435
And Mom will buy the tickets, you
just have to drive me to the airport.

327
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,596
- Slow down. No one wants you to leave.
- Elizabeth does.

328
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,832
You just gotta give her
space for a few days.

329
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,501
- Once everything's okay with...
- She told me to leave.

330
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,677
- You talked to her?
- Upstairs. She wants me out.

331
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,181
You caught her at a
bad time. I'll talk to her.

332
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,185
No, it's okay, Dad. I
understand. She's not my mother.

333
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,255
She cares about Ella,
and I hurt her baby.

334
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,858
I don't wanna cause more
trouble. I should just go.

335
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,688
You're not going
anywhere, Rachel.

336
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,262
Mom says I should go if
Elizabeth doesn't want me.

337
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,865
Your mom's not here
and she doesn't... Ow!

338
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,135
- Are you okay?
- Ow. Um...

339
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,201
Um...

340
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,806
Just go home, and we'll
figure this out tonight, okay?

341
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,466
- Dad?
- Rachel, please, now? Now.

342
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,236
How long has she
been overweight?

343
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,439
Just recently, she put on 15 pounds
in the last couple months or so.

344
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:46,552
Oh. Uh, I can send a nutritionist
to come speak with you if you'd like.

345
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,154
Yes, please. I can't seem
to stop her from eating.

346
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,835
We'll move her to another room.

347
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,550
We'll monitor her breathing
for the next couple hours.

348
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,161
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. I'll be right back.

349
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,324
Hey, what happened?

350
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,900
Oh, I bit my tongue.

351
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,561
You did a really good
job. How's Rachel?

352
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,570
- I don't know.
- Let me see.

353
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,572
No. I just need to
keep pressure on it.

354
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,901
Come on. Stick your tongue out.

355
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,775
It's on the right. I
can't see if you do that.

356
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,473
- Do what?
- Stick it out straight.

357
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,576
I did.

358
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,982
What?

359
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,758
Well, it's not so bad. Just
keep applying pressure.

360
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,720
- You didn't call for backup?
- That's what you are.

361
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,263
Clear the rack. I'll take the fast
tracks. Dispo the pityriasis in 3.

362
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,626
- Please?
- What?

363
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,964
I've been flying all night. I come
in on my day off and it's a mess.

364
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,105
- You could ask.
- Flying was your choice...

365
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:50,039
and it's not my fault you answered
your phone. Lower GI bleed in 5.

366
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,938
Dr. Lewis, CT shows a
non-displaced zygomatic arch fracture.

367
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,311
- Is she worthy to be seen yet?
- Luka's here. Give it to him.

368
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,952
Hey. KOVAC: Hey.

369
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,815
- You're back.
- Yeah. This morning.

370
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,821
I was getting worried. I thought
I'd at least get a postcard.

371
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,788
You need to get e-mail.

372
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,326
Didn't take long to get
sucked into this insanity.

373
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,464
No. But it's good
to see you, though.

374
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,496
- You too.
- How long you been on?

375
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,159
I was supposed to be off
an hour ago. Joyce Westlake.

376
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,966
Her husband beat her up this
morning, broke her cheekbone.

377
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,475
Don't let me open them.

378
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,172
Good strength.

379
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,942
Check the lower branches.

380
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,443
Show me your teeth.

381
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,712
Nice and symmetrical. Okay,
blow out your cheeks with air. Fine.

382
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:39,188
- Cranial nerves two through 11 intact.
- But not 12.

383
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:42,562
It's an isolated dysfunction
of the right hypoglossal nerve.

384
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,959
- It's a recurrence.
- You don't know that.

385
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,598
I couldn't say "Solu-Medrol."

386
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,230
I do that all the time, especially
if I haven't had my morning latte.

387
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,530
Pedes MVA rolling
up. Air-bag burn.

388
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,298
Okay. In a second.

389
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,172
- If you're worried, get an MRI.
- Yeah.

390
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,545
Mark, it could be a lot of things. You're
under an enormous amount of stress.

391
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,513
You could have inflammatory
changes from your tumor vaccine.

392
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,050
- Air bag?
- First and second degree. BP's 110/70.

393
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,415
- He was in the front seat?
- We were in a rush.

394
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,353
You don't put kids in the front seat!
- It was a parking lot!

395
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,153
- We're good. Luka's here.
- Good. Well, I got this one...

396
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,023
and you can get
out from under it.

397
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,825
- Any medical problems?
- Hay fever in the summer.

398
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,060
Okay. Let's start
with a lateral C-spine.

399
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,710
- What are you doing?
- I'm on a break.

400
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,215
Hello. We're
getting killed here.

401
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,041
I still get a break.

402
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,011
Where is she?

403
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,053
- What?
- Did you bring her here?

404
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,748
- Joyce?
- Yes, Joyce!

405
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,223
Um, no. Why?

406
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:51,023
I know she stayed with you last night. I
know you picked her up, so stop lying.

407
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,892
I know you beat
the crap out of her.

408
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,931
She swung a bat at my head.

409
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,591
- Here. Wanna feel?
- No, thanks.

410
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,034
- Just tell me what room.
- You're kidding, right?

411
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,140
It's none of your business. I
thought you figured that out.

412
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,776
You wanna see
her? I'll take you.

413
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,970
She's talking to police. I'm sure
they have questions for you too.

414
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,245
Abby, can you get
me the slit lamp?

415
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,439
Yeah, sure.

416
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,778
I need to check for hyphema.

417
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,752
- Who's that?
- The husband.

418
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,759
- Any belly pain?
- Soft, non-tender.

419
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,895
Needs a BP. Titrate
four of morphine.

420
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,759
Probably corneal
burn. BP, 120/50.

421
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,424
All right, we need Alcaine,
fluorescein and a Wood's lamp.

422
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,002
What exactly is Alcaine?
And where do you keep it?

423
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,604
Mark?

424
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,940
Can you get gentamicin
ophthalmic from the pharmacy?

425
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,338
Did you get my page?

426
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,478
Uh, I got a page from Neurology.

427
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:43,947
Yeah. I was in Neurology
looking at your daughter's EEG.

428
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,445
- You got this?
- Yeah.

429
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,416
Coat the facial
burns with Neosporin.

430
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,146
Any spikes or sharp waves?

431
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,757
No. Normal K complexes
and spindles throughout.

432
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:56,293
- Good. Good. That's a good sign.
- Yeah, for now.

433
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,955
You missed the consult. I thought you
were only gonna be here half an hour.

434
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,862
They got swamped down here.

435
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,026
- Swamped?
- Yeah.

436
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,171
- What?
- Your daughter's in the PICU, Mark.

437
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,141
- Breathing and showing signs of recovery.
- You run away and leave it all to me!

438
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:15,679
I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna shower,
I'm gonna change my clothes, okay?

439
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,478
Be careful, because the evil
daughter's there, waiting for me.

440
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,887
Just go upstairs and
sit with your baby.

441
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,549
You told her to leave.

442
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,152
She asked me what she could do.

443
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,388
- You're serious?
- I'm perfectly serious.

444
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,362
- I can't do that.
- Can't do what?

445
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,365
I can't turn her away, not now.

446
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,902
What has to happen?
Does she have to kill her?

447
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,037
- Elizabeth...
- No! No!

448
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,698
This time, I'm doing
something. She's out!

449
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,741
I'm not choosing
between my daughters.

450
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,813
You don't have to!
I'm choosing for you!

451
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,382
What am I telling her by
letting you ship her away?

452
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,180
That she needs to grow up! That
she needs to take responsibility!

453
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:58,847
That what she does has very real
consequences for people besides herself!

454
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,256
She realizes that. Do you think
she would actually hurt Ella again?

455
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,990
Either she's out of the house
or I'm not taking that baby home.

456
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,861
Hold on. Calm
down. Take a breath...

457
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,901
- She's my child, Mark!
- I know that! She's mine too!

458
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,539
Then start acting like it!

459
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:20,210
- Ma'am, we're trying to help.
- You called the cops?

460
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:23,372
- He fractured your face.
- No, he didn't! He didn't even touch me!

461
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,881
Where can we find him?

462
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,882
- Did you check the university?
- Abby, no!

463
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,580
- That's a big area. He's not at home.
- He hangs out at a bar down the street.

464
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,247
I don't want to press charges.

465
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,791
It's called The Windbreaker,
on Fourth and Ashland.

466
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,293
There's obvious signs of
abuse. It's not up to you.

467
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,432
Tell them no! Tell
them not to do this!

468
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,965
We'll check it out. Call if
he shows up here again.

469
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,296
He was here?

470
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,939
- Sit down and let the doctor finish.
- What did he say?

471
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,235
We're gonna find you a shelter,
someplace where he can't hurt you.

472
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,640
I don't want to go to a
shelter! I wanna go home!

473
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,711
What if you have a kid with him?

474
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,748
Is this what you want for your
kids? You want him to beat them?

475
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,976
- He wouldn't do that!
- Oh, wake up, Joyce!

476
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:04,717
This is it. This is your
chance to get away, right now.

477
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,587
It doesn't matter how
wonderful he can be sometimes.

478
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,127
If you go back now, you're telling
him it's okay to do this to you...

479
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,594
and it is not okay.

480
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,595
It's not okay.

481
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,611
Your car's here.

482
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,981
I managed to get a flight to
Logan, but I'm on standby.

483
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,024
Can you imagine?

484
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,293
I'll call you from the Cape.

485
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,931
I'm sorry. John, I really am.

486
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,497
Kids, you know...

487
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,038
they get over stuff.

488
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,868
I bet if you went back...

489
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:00,206
Mickey would forget today as
quick as he can down a milk shake.

490
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,307
No, you were right. I
became too involved.

491
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,018
I'm thinking maybe
I wasn't right.

492
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,421
You see that tree?

493
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,535
You and your brother built a fort on
that big limb and you played Tarzan.

494
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,866
Bobby played Tarzan.
I played Cheetah.

495
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,710
You fell down and
you sprained your wrist.

496
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,813
And you never even thought
about telling me that he pushed you.

497
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,011
You knew?

498
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,445
You two had your secrets.

499
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:46,257
You stuck together. I saw
no reason to pull you apart.

500
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,061
I didn't spend much time...

501
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,963
thinking about how your
brother's death affected you.

502
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,371
I didn't spend much
time on anyone.

503
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,738
Do you have time now?

504
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,216
I won't betray
another little boy.

505
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,881
- Betray?
- You don't wanna give up hope.

506
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:19,757
You can't. Hope is
all either of you have.

507
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,252
Your brother believed me
when I told him he'd get better.

508
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:27,530
It didn't matter where he was...

509
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,726
how he felt, what
the doctor said.

510
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,394
I told him he'd get better.

511
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,735
He died believing me.

512
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,076
No.

513
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,903
He was pretending for you.

514
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:47,713
That was another one of our secrets.
I was supposed to not let you be sad.

515
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,823
I was supposed to
make you forget...

516
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,464
to make you happy.

517
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,437
He made me promise
to make you happy.

518
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,440
I'm sorry, Mom.

519
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,481
I love you.

520
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:25,485
Do you hear me? I love you.

521
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,693
Uh-huh.

522
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,483
Well, if there's no
money, it should be fairly...

523
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,291
Can you hold on one second?

524
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,140
- Yeah? MAN:
<i>Campanelli's. I got your pizza.</i>

525
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,797
Come on up.

526
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,578
If there's no money, it should
be fairly straightforward, right?

527
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,814
Well, there's a counselor
there, isn't there?

528
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,183
Well, talk to her tomorrow.

529
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,647
I don't know, I
guess you just...

530
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,221
go and get what you need
when you know he's not there.

531
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:01,316
You know, you did
the right thing, Joyce.

532
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,825
Okay. Can you
hold on one second?

533
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,896
We, uh... We like this
place too. Good fettuccine.

534
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,006
I'm gonna have to call you
back. Where's the delivery guy?

535
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,867
Oh, I got it. It's on me.

536
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,636
- No, that's okay.
- Where do you want it? Over here?

537
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,507
Yeah, that's fine.

538
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,015
We're still planning on
inviting you for dinner.

539
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,915
- Brian...
- Listen, I screwed up.

540
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,821
I have a problem, I need to get
some help for it. But I love my wife.

541
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:39,155
I just have these strong
feelings, you know?

542
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:43,024
And that's not an excuse,
and she might not talk to me.

543
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,696
I understand I don't deserve forgiveness,
but I just wanna tell her I'm sorry.

544
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,206
County Social Services
can get her a letter.

545
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,707
- So she's in a group home or something?
- I can't talk to you about this, Brian.

546
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,945
- I just wanna make sure she's all right.
- She will be.

547
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,719
Tell me where she is. I
promise I won't hurt her.

548
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,084
I think you should leave.

549
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,052
She's my life.

550
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,855
Don't you get that?
She's everything to me.

551
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,726
- You can't take her away from me.
- I didn't!

552
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,562
- Abby, please. Where is she?
- No.

553
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,732
- Where is she?
- All right, listen.

554
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,305
You have to leave now,
or I'm gonna call the police.

555
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:25,171
And I'm pretty sure you're not
interested in talking to them again, right?

556
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,872
You're right.

557
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,808
I'm sorry.

558
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,818
Good night.

559
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,763
<i>91 1, what is your emergency?</i>

560
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,276
Brian. Brian!

561
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,770
Oh, my God.

562
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,295
Did she recommend a diet?

563
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,124
- Did she talk to your parents?
- My mom.

564
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,426
Tim is my stepdad.

565
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,834
Well, I know it'll
be hard at first.

566
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,803
But if you start eating better,
you'll start feeling better.

567
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,001
I know I'm fat. I don't care.

568
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:15,773
I'm glad you're comfortable with
your body. That's very important.

569
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:21,318
But you put on a lot of weight in a short
time and that can cause health problems.

570
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,647
And, you know, you'll be
going to high school soon.

571
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,588
- You'll be interested in boys.
- I don't like boys.

572
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:31,161
Well, you say that now, but trust
me, in a couple of years, you'll want...

573
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,265
No, I won't. I hate boys.

574
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,831
Why? Why do you hate boys?

575
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,174
Do you have problems with boys?

576
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,342
With men?

577
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,512
I don't want boys
to touch me. Ever.

578
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:54,016
Ariel, when did your mom
marry your stepfather?

579
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,383
- Dr. Lewis, we need you.
- In a second.

580
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,190
Was it within the last year?

581
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,353
- Three months ago.
- Dr. Lewis, it's Abby.

582
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,689
- She was assaulted.
- What?

583
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:08,231
Pupils are 4 millimeters and reactive.
How long were you passed out?

584
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,392
- I don't know.
- What happened?

585
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:14,164
My neighbor got pissed because I sent
his wife to a battered-woman's shelter.

586
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,538
Follow my finger with your eyes.
The guy that came here today?

587
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,746
Chest is clear.

588
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,211
He's your neighbor?

589
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:27,648
Yeah. He wanted to know,
uh, where we placed Joyce.

590
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,414
- Good bowel sounds. Any belly pain?
- Not really.

591
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,888
- And he knows where you live?
- Obviously.

592
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,250
Ow!

593
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,659
- Tender at the right costal margin.
- No, my nose.

594
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,059
Oh. Sorry. Sorry.

595
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,063
Um, can I get a gown?

596
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,827
Right here.

597
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:53,675
Okay. Head and facial
CT. CBC and dip a urine.

598
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,405
- And titrate up to 10 of morphine.
- No, Tylenol.

599
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,378
Abby, you may have
broken your nose.

600
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,950
Yeah. I don't
want any narcotics.

601
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,915
- At least some Vicodin.
- Just Tylenol.

602
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,920
Six-centimeter contusion,
medial aspect of the right thigh.

603
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,389
Did you get kicked?

604
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,187
I don't know. Maybe when I fell.

605
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,592
- Is there a chance you were raped?
- No.

606
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,257
No, I don't think so.

607
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,265
Set up a lighted
speculum and rape kit.

608
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,404
I was unconscious,
I wasn't in a coma.

609
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,540
We just need to be sure.

610
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,630
Did she eat?

611
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,966
Just passed out.

612
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,638
Have you?

613
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,970
- What?
- Eaten.

614
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,474
No.

615
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,642
Go. I'll take her.

616
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,288
- We need to talk.
- No.

617
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,156
I don't want to discuss
it anymore. Not tonight.

618
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,173
Okay. Just one more swab.

619
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,178
And then a vaginal aspirate...

620
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,044
then we're done.

621
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,354
Have you had intercourse
in the last 72 hours?

622
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,825
No.

623
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,626
No signs of abrasion.

624
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,526
No signs of trauma.

625
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,895
No semen.

626
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,195
I didn't think so.

627
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,568
You can put your feet down.

628
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:06,870
- So, uh, this guy lives on the same floor?
- Yeah.

629
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,911
I'd think about moving.

630
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,982
No, I'm not moving. He's moving.

631
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,319
Well, you definitely
have a nasal fracture.

632
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,184
But it's non-displaced, so
when the swelling goes down...

633
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,655
you'll look good as new.

634
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:25,056
CBC's normal, no
blood in the urine.

635
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,325
Could've been a lot worse.

636
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,326
Yeah.

637
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,662
You should be careful
about getting into these things.

638
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:37,042
You know, I was
trying to help the girl.

639
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:43,510
I did help the girl. I mean, somebody
needed to do something. Something.

640
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,748
Is there someone I can call?

641
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:49,677
- Your mom?
- No.

642
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,949
We don't need to admit you. Is
there somewhere you can stay tonight?

643
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,922
Yeah, I'll be fine.

644
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,527
You can't go home until they
find him. You can stay with me.

645
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,261
I'm... I'll...

646
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,598
I'm just gonna get a hotel or
something. Really, I'll be fine.

647
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,467
Mm-hm. And do
you have your wallet?

648
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,608
- I'll figure something out.
- Abby, stop it.

649
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,942
It's a pullout, but it's
comfortable. It's free and it's safe.

650
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,648
Thank you.

651
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,619
The radiologist
cleared the head CT.

652
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,227
- And the facial cuts?
- Uh, just the nose.

653
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:31,624
- Was she...?
- No, no.

654
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,289
No evidence of anything but getting
pummeled in the face. Did they find him?

655
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,435
I don't know. Triage is cleared.

656
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,436
Can you prep the pass-ons?
I still haven't unpacked.

657
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,666
I've lived here five
months, I haven't unpacked.

658
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,969
Yeah, bail.

659
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,448
- We did catch up.
- Yeah, now that you got a professional.

660
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,984
- Jerry?
- Dr. Lewis.

661
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:58,646
- They let this place go, huh?
- Yeah. What are you doing?

662
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,652
- Working.
- Since when?

663
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,192
I've been temping since
I've come out of retirement.

664
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,760
- Where did you get that?
- What?

665
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,158
The bagel.

666
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:10,098
Under the desk. Somebody threw away
perfectly good dip too. You want some?

667
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,999
Ohh. You should go home, now.

668
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,020
- I don't have a problem with you.
- I have a problem with you.

669
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,852
- I got angry. It was a mistake.
- You hit women by mistake? Huh?

670
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,721
I screwed up.

671
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,053
Let's see you hit me, huh?

672
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,298
I didn't mean to.
I lost my temper.

673
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,525
Lose your temper with me.

674
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,363
I'm gonna go to the cops
now and turn myself in.

675
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,036
- Wait. Just wait!
- Better start swinging back!

676
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,536
Hold on! Wait!

677
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,875
I was wrong. I got angry.

678
00:41:58,383 --> 00:41:59,715
She took away my wife!

679
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,385
You took away your wife!

680
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:09,355
I know, I know, I
know. But I loved her.

681
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,655
She's everything
to me, and I lost her.

682
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

683
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,899
I won't mess with Abby
again. I won't even talk to her.

684
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,361
I'll move. I'll move
out of the building.

685
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,563
Please, I'm sorry. Please.

686
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,746
You touch her again...

687
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,674
I'll kill you.
