1
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,969
<i>Who? Who was it? Who
the hell were you talking to?</i>

2
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,808
<i>The shopping network, I
swear.</i> MAN: <i>At 3 in the morning?</i>

3
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,144
<i>I couldn't sleep. I just
wanted some earrings.</i>

4
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,851
<i>- Don't lie to me.
- Stop it, Brian!</i>

5
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,818
<i>Who were you talking to?</i>

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,583
<i>Nobody.</i> BRIAN: <i>Who?</i>

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,249
<i>Nobody, I swear. Brian, please.</i>

8
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,324
<i>Somebody, help
me!</i> BRIAN: <i>Shut up!</i>

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,624
<i>- Help me!
- Shut the hell up!</i>

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,360
<i>- Stop it, Brian! Stop it!
- Shut your lying, filthy mouth!</i>

11
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:52,042
- Rachel, can't sleep?
- I was hungry.

12
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,779
- What are you eating?
- PB and chips.

13
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,357
- It's good.
- Pass them over.

14
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,662
I miss the part where the giant tomato's
chasing Mason Dixon down the sidewalk?

15
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,232
- You know this movie?
- It's a classic.

16
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,529
- I don't really get it.
- What's to get?

17
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,696
- The tomatoes are killers.
- Yeah, I figured that part out.

18
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:16,310
- This is good.
- Told you.

19
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,207
This reminds me of when I'd
get up at 5:30 in the morning...

20
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,870
to watch <i>The Smurfs</i> with you.

21
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,985
- You like <i>Smurfs?</i>
- You liked <i>The Smurfs</i>. I liked the news.

22
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:28,145
- So we did what I wanted to do?
- It's hard to argue with a 2-year-old.

23
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,260
It seems like last week.

24
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,498
We need some milk.

25
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,728
- Watch this.
- What?

26
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,839
Watch.

27
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:52,341
Ew, that's gross.
This is so stupid.

28
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,348
- You weren't out, were you?
- No, I went for a walk.

29
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,385
- Where?
- Nowhere.

30
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,955
- Three in the morning?
- It's the only time I can.

31
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,354
- Except you can't.
- I'm under house arrest now?

32
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,552
Not yet, but you're
making me think about it.

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,426
You talk to my teachers, screen
my calls, search my room...

34
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,233
which even my guidance
counselor considers uncool.

35
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,563
- Enough.
- I have to report to the hospital.

36
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,471
- It's like living in a prison.
- Go to bed.

37
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,437
- Mark?
- Here comes the warden.

38
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,632
Hey.

39
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,971
Why won't you treat me
like a thinking person?

40
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,080
- Hey, what's going on?
- Show better judgment, maybe I will.

41
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,911
Yeah, I should have when I
decided to come live with you.

42
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,553
- I said turn it off.
- I just want to watch the movie.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,086
Well, that's too bad.

44
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,223
I'm calling Mom. I'm
moving back to Saint Louis.

45
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,471
It's not that easy.

46
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,321
Why? You don't
want me here anyway.

47
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,588
Hey, quiet, both of you.
You're gonna wake the...

48
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,726
baby.

49
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,626
Okay. Thank you.

50
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,242
All set, ma'am. Your
complaint will be kept on record.

51
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,605
My complaint? What about hers?

52
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,778
- She says it was just an argument.
- Yeah, it was an argument.

53
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,143
- He was beating her.
- She says he wasn't.

54
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,013
- She was screaming for help.
- Not anymore.

55
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,350
Is that it? COP: Not
much else we can do.

56
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,789
But we appreciate the call.

57
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,191
Okay. Let's get
some rest, honey.

58
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,923
You must be a
real light sleeper.

59
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,555
- Did I wake you?
- Late shift.

60
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,458
- I'm sorry.
- No, I had to get up in two hours anyway.

61
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,657
- You don't drink coffee.
- Actually, I do.

62
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,736
- I distinctly recall you hating coffee.
- Yeah, when I was 15.

63
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,965
It wasn't that long ago.

64
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,279
What would you
like for breakfast?

65
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,281
- Ha, are you offering to cook?
- Momentary weakness. Take advantage.

66
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,578
All right, eggs.

67
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:51,350
Have you, um, spoken
to your father recently?

68
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,791
Uh, yeah, he called
a couple days ago.

69
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,423
Where's he staying?

70
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,693
He, uh, rented a
place on Michigan.

71
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,303
- Scrambled?
- Whatever.

72
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,708
- Do you have his number?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,868
- Why?
- He didn't give it to me.

74
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,277
- Well, I'm sure that he intends to.
- Did he say something?

75
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,486
Maybe you should just
let it sit for a little while.

76
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,856
Actually, I was hoping that
you would call him for me.

77
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,297
Sure. Or better yet, the three of us
could dip ourselves in a vat of acid.

78
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,674
We made mistakes, John.

79
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,334
I made mistakes, I know.

80
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,038
But I don't believe
that it's too late to fix it.

81
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,822
Sorry.

82
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,997
I know we argue a lot. We
didn't mean to bother you.

83
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:09,296
- You were screaming for help.
- I know.

84
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,062
I called help.

85
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,502
Brian and I have been
together since high school.

86
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,339
And there's a lot of
history and a lot of passion.

87
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,674
Passion?

88
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,580
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

89
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,858
- Is it your ankle?
- I'm okay.

90
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,463
- Let me take a look at it.
- I don't need any help.

91
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,624
- Joyce.
- I'm sorry, I'm late for work.

92
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,531
It's gotta be hard. CARTER:
She should deal with it herself.

93
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,298
- Maybe she doesn't know how.
- Mom's not the retiring sort.

94
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,600
She's tougher than he is.

95
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,766
Nobody's tough when
your life's falling apart.

96
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,878
Ah, you haven't met her yet.

97
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,605
- They're out of vanilla.
- Thanks.

98
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,875
Jennifer Lampkin.
Her ex-husband.

99
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,915
Where are we on Mrs.
McCabe's gallbladder?

100
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,713
- I convinced Surgery to take her.
- How'd you manage that?

101
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,322
I explained that she'd been
to the ER over 10 times.

102
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,459
The pain meds were
no longer appropriate.

103
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,493
- They accepted that?
- Even got her Medicaid paperwork started.

104
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:12,394
That's excellent. I have Attendings that
can't turf a stable patient to Surgery.

105
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,798
Have her call me at the
hospital. It's about Rachel. Thanks.

106
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,667
- What?
- Someone's a teacher's pet.

107
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,172
Rumor is he's about to
be promoted to hall monitor.

108
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,071
- You snitch on somebody, Gallant?
- No.

109
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,577
- What's all this?
- Weaver's got a crush.

110
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,578
I thought I noticed a
little something there.

111
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,668
- Mm-hm.
- Or I'm doing well on my rotation.

112
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,910
Whatever it takes.

113
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,987
Michael, have you ever
seen the erythema multiforme?

114
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,522
- Just in the books.
- Come here. Now's your chance.

115
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,126
Oh, so it's "Michael" now, is it?
- Anybody home?

116
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,695
Dr. Greene, 42-year-old prisoner,
stab wounds to the face and abdomen.

117
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,921
Good vitals. ETA, 10.

118
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,124
Uh-huh. Give it to Susan.
She's great with inmates.

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,834
David Zachery, beat up in a brawl in
an after-hours hip-hop club. No LOC.

120
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,166
- Have trouble breathing, David?
- Ain't my name.

121
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,468
- He goes by "Dimon Z."
- Do you have chest pain?

122
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,306
- BP, 120/70. Pulse, 90.
- No, my back. And the twins is moping.

123
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,108
- What?
- I got some serious junk damage.

124
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,217
- What does he mean?
- My boys hurt.

125
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,818
- Ah. Did you get kicked?
- Not there.

126
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,855
Okay. Can you wiggle your toes?
ZACHERY: Oh, damn! That kills!

127
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,618
- Whoa, what happened to your lip?
- Some bitch with a ring.

128
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,819
- Who started all this?
- Bunch of thugs looking to crank a name.

129
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,194
- Oh, yeah? Dimon's famous?
- A major label signed him a month ago.

130
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,164
- Hey, Chuny, can you give...?
- Aisha.

131
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,666
A room? MARQUEZ: Sure.

132
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,464
You take care of
my man, all right?

133
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,232
What's a common etiology
other than drug reaction?

134
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,466
- Viral infection.
- Any one in particular?

135
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,168
- Dr. Weaver, Sandy Lopez called back.
- Herpes?

136
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,211
- What?
- That girl firefighter.

137
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,646
- Right.
- Sandy Lopez from the 38th?

138
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,512
- That hot one?
- The gay one.

139
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,983
Get out of here.

140
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,088
My cousin Rico used
to have a crush on her.

141
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,851
- She wouldn't give him the time of day.
- I saw your cousin. I don't blame her.

142
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:50,828
Abby, 50 of Benadryl in Exam 1.
Cover the lesions with 1% hydrocortisone.

143
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,863
- I just got here.
- Clock in, get busy.

144
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,865
She said she'd stop
by before her shift.

145
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,266
- What?
- Lopez.

146
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,838
- You guys friends?
- I treated a man in her unit last night.

147
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,408
Fifteen-foot fall, femur
fracture, blunt head trauma.

148
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,604
Gallant, let's get a good
neuro exam on Mrs. Barisch.

149
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,613
Abby, you okay? ABBY: What?

150
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,548
- You look a little tired.
- Thank you, Frank.

151
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:17,748
Grab a gram of cefotetan. BP's
stable. Pulse, 100. Protecting his airway.

152
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,859
- That your prisoner?
- Yeah. What happened?

153
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,791
Jumped in County holding.
He's testifying against a lifer.

154
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,465
I didn't snitch. I
was subpoenaed.

155
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:29,694
No blood in the nares. Foreface,
stable. Neck, non-tender.

156
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,633
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

157
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,741
Four, maybe five superficial
cuts no deeper than the sub-Q.

158
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,538
Draw up 40 cc's of lidocaine.
No rebound or guarding.

159
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,271
- Push a hundred mics of fentanyl.
- No. No drugs.

160
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,917
- You're in pain.
- Reminds me I'm still alive.

161
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,212
- Push the meds.
- They must be next door.

162
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,314
You get the narc keys, Yosh?
- No scrubs?

163
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,082
- I didn't have time to change.
- Where's a Foley?

164
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,886
Belly's benign, non-tender.

165
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,255
Dimon, we're gonna have
to put a tube in your penis.

166
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,831
- Ah, you are so wrong.
- It might be uncomfortable.

167
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,492
- For you, because I ain't doing it.
- We have to check your urine for blood.

168
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,572
I'll pee in the cup, dog.
Keep that tube away from me.

169
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,299
- Carter, your dad's on line two.
- Take a message for me.

170
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,935
DTRs are two plus and equal.
Toes down, going bilaterally.

171
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,675
- Where's the fentanyl?
- They haven't restocked. Try the lock-up.

172
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,412
HemoCue is 14, urine dip is positive
for heme and leukocyte esterase.

173
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,614
- Gross blood?
- No, but it's cloudy.

174
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,818
Okay. Send a UA. Over 50 red
cells, and we'll image the kidneys.

175
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,327
Where did Abby go? I
need a 20 of lido with epi.

176
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,762
I'll get it. He says he'll
call from New Orleans.

177
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,130
- What?
- Your dad's flying to New Orleans at 3.

178
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,638
What?

179
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,706
- How about a head CT?
- It's not necessary.

180
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,366
She's never had headaches
before. Subarachnoid bleed?

181
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,638
That presents as sudden onset of severe
pain. She's got a mild chronic headache.

182
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,784
She could have hydrocephalus.
I think a CT is a good idea.

183
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,441
An out-patient
workup should be fine.

184
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,118
Okay.

185
00:10:56,723 --> 00:11:00,023
Hi, it's Kerry. I heard you were
gonna come by before your shift...

186
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:04,358
but I'm a little backed up
here. So let me call you later.

187
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,324
Thanks. Bye.

188
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,904
- Where's Aisha at?
- Getting her lip sewed up.

189
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,203
- Marcus Welby, I'm gonna live?
- No internal injuries.

190
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:22,372
- I was worried they put a cap in you.
- When I go, I'm taking the world with me.

191
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,450
- Can I talk to you?
- This is my boy CC.

192
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,712
- Hey. I want to go over your lab results.
- It's cool. He can stay.

193
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,652
I got to stay in bed for a week,
be waited on hand and foot.

194
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,793
The LS, uh, spine
series looks good...

195
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,052
but your urine was cloudy.

196
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,796
Is that why it
burns when I whiz?

197
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,264
- You got chlamydia.
- Chlamydia?

198
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,596
The good news is,
it's very treatable.

199
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,104
- You get that from nasty booty, right?
- It's sexually transmitted, yeah.

200
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,341
No, Aisha's clean.

201
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,106
- Got any other partners?
- No, man. I love my girl.

202
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,944
- Are you two practicing safe sex?
- Ain't hurt nobody yet.

203
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,848
- That would be a "no."
- Are you saying Aisha's stepping out?

204
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,853
Well, let's run some more
labs. We'll see where we are.

205
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,357
- I need your consent for the HIV test.
- No, man. She's true.

206
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,826
No, it's standard for
any patient with an STD.

207
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,126
- He needs one of those?
- I'll have the nurse come draw blood.

208
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,003
Whatever. Hey, can I
get some more pudding?

209
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,502
I will see what I can do.

210
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,040
- Abby, can I get a red top in 2?
- Yeah.

211
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,371
- You okay? You look a little...
- Don't say it.

212
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,047
- Tired.
- That seems to be the general consensus.

213
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,116
- Too much clubbing?
- Well, I was up most of the night.

214
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,049
- Really?
- Not for fun.

215
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,885
I don't know, but I think I saw Frank
a little drag-assed this morning too.

216
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,324
You caught me. I was up all
night slapping Frank's ass raw.

217
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,691
- Raw?
- Have you seen him sit down today?

218
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,629
Come to think of it... Hey,
Frank, have you sat down today?

219
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,859
- What?
- Nothing.

220
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,334
- You a little sore today?
- No, why?

221
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,872
Uh, your split lip vagalled when
she saw the lidocaine needle.

222
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,907
- Aisha?
- Mm-hm, the rapper's girlfriend.

223
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,569
Better add on a DNA probe.
He's got chlamydia. Dad, hey.

224
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,079
<i>- John.</i>
- I got your message.

225
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,217
No, I was wondering
if you wanted lunch.

226
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,183
- Dr. Weaver, Romano called again.
- What'd you tell him?

227
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,685
I told him you were tied up.

228
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,882
He said to leave your personal
life at home and get to his office.

229
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:15,085
No, if you're already at Midway,
I'll just come meet you there.

230
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,594
Yeah. Okay. See you then. Bye.

231
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,394
- John, do you know why Dr. Chen's here?
- Deb's here?

232
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,933
Did she say anything to you?

233
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,765
No. Actually, I haven't
really talked to her lately.

234
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,772
Doctor, uh, listen. I
wanted to ask you...

235
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,103
- can I get me one of them tests?
- What tests?

236
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,438
Chlamydia.

237
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,615
You know that's only, uh,
contagious through sexual contact?

238
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,910
Right.

239
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,250
- Right.
- Okay. Right.

240
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,117
Uh, Abby, can you
start a new chart here?

241
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,348
Sure.

242
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:48,188
You can never trust these ETAs.
I'm still waiting on that hypotensive TC.

243
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,421
- It got diverted to Mercy.
- Oh, great.

244
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,395
I'm waiting for a chest pain.

245
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,262
- Hey, did you reach her?
- Who?

246
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,903
- Jen.
- Mm-hm.

247
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,699
- What did she say?
- She wants to think about it.

248
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,738
Think about it?
She's her mother.

249
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,570
We can't let Rachel
make these decisions.

250
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:10,310
Act up, get angry at one and then
punish us by moving back to the other.

251
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,475
You know, you might
consider boarding school.

252
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,655
- She could use some structure.
- Yeah, I could sell her off to pirates.

253
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:21,285
You develop a sense of
self-worth, community, responsibility.

254
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,623
It worked well for me.

255
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,231
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

256
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,096
You're British.

257
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,568
- Mark, she's out of control.
- Thank you, Elizabeth. I'm aware of that.

258
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,126
Yes. And she's
disrupting our entire life.

259
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,301
I am working on it.

260
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,640
Are you? Or are you just
waiting for it to blow over?

261
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,613
Julio Echeverria, passed out in
the cab line at the Bismark Hotel.

262
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,776
GCS, 14, complaining of
shortness of breath and chest pain.

263
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,321
- Mr. Echeverria, any heart problems?
- I don't think so.

264
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,223
How many am I getting?

265
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,098
- Maybe three more.
- Oh.

266
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,757
You got lucky. These aren't deep.
Whoever did this didn't want to kill you.

267
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:06,167
- Yeah, I'm well-liked.
- Or you did it yourself.

268
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,333
Misplace that "get
out of jail free" card?

269
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,378
Yeah, something like that.

270
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,039
You're the first woman
I've talked to in 14 months.

271
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,879
Yeah, I get that a lot.

272
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,955
In high school I was voted
"most likely to marry a convict."

273
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,654
- You know, you don't have to do that.
- It could get infected.

274
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,995
Yeah, I wouldn't want to die
before they get a chance to kill me.

275
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,367
- You're on death row?
- Cell number FD414.

276
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,567
Scheduled June 6th, 02.

277
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,075
Almanac says it's gonna rain.

278
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,382
Who believes the weatherman?

279
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,247
Yeah.

280
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,912
Well, at least I know
how, when and where.

281
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,753
Not like all these poor
saps you see every day.

282
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:05,592
Go to work in the morning
after fighting with their wives.

283
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,791
They never get
the chance to say...

284
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,531
I'm sorry...

285
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,766
or...

286
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,433
goodbye.

287
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,602
Uh...

288
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,009
- I'm out of gauze.
- Would you...? Would you, uh...?

289
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,943
Would you keep me here a while?

290
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,611
Just so...

291
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,055
I don't have to be
there a little bit longer?

292
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,095
Uh...

293
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,256
You might need to be
observed for a couple hours.

294
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,201
Thank you.

295
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,872
Kinney, let her go.

296
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,581
- I'll straighten him out.
- Uh.

297
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,653
It's all right.

298
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,660
- Don't lose my tie. It's a rental.
- Ah, we'll put everything into a bag.

299
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,261
- Where were you going?
- Our Lady of Grace.

300
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,988
Pulse is 90, sats are 95%.

301
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,656
Bilateral crackles
two-thirds of the way up.

302
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,894
- EKG.
- Rather harsh pansystolic murmur.

303
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,302
You have cardiac damage. Maybe
a heart attack started last night.

304
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,967
- I have to go. It's my daughter's wedding.
- I'm afraid you're gonna miss it.

305
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,339
Uh, emesis basin!

306
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,909
And aspirin. Five of Metoprolol.

307
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,642
Probably mitral-valve
regurgitation. We'll need an echo.

308
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,344
Mr. Echeverria, you're
too sick to go anywhere.

309
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,923
We have to put you on a monitor.
Would you like us to call your daughter?

310
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,985
No, don't ruin it.

311
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,651
She'll wonder where you are...

312
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,024
when there's no one
there to give her away.

313
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,530
She won't.

314
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,222
That was fast.

315
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:53,300
Nucleic-acid
amplification test. It's new.

316
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,170
- What'd it say?
- Positive for chlamydia.

317
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:01,804
But we can clear that up with
a single dose of azithromycin.

318
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,941
- Is that okay with protease inhibitors?
- You're HIV-positive?

319
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,053
For a year now.
I do the clinics.

320
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:14,057
- Does Aisha know this?
- Aisha? No.

321
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,855
- Zachery.
- Thanks.

322
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,658
- Uh, are you on the triple cocktail?
- My CD4's pretty good...

323
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,860
but I'm just hoping they'll develop
a once-a-day before too long.

324
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,065
Wait here.

325
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,173
<i>I'm with this girl,
her name was Lydia</i>

326
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,333
<i>She was so freak,
she gave me chlamydia</i>

327
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,704
That ain't even funny.

328
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,346
- Aisha, can you give us a minute?
- Get me a soda, Boo.

329
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,315
- Root beer?
- You know it.

330
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,890
What's up?

331
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,393
- Your rapid HIV test came back.
- Yeah?

332
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,499
Aw, ha-ha.

333
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,828
No way.

334
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,671
- I come here with a bum back, and you...
- I'm sorry.

335
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,872
I don't do needles,
and I ain't no faggot.

336
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,735
You're positive.

337
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,403
How?

338
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,743
I don't know, but Aisha
should be tested too.

339
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,909
- I told you, she's clean.
- She needs to be tested anyway.

340
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,517
I got confidentiality, right?

341
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,422
Mm-hm.

342
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,687
- You can tell her.
- What if I don't want to?

343
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,398
She's at risk. You
need to tell her.

344
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,758
The high-five is heavy. I
ain't letting that word spread.

345
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,873
Dimon, it is really important that we
find out how you contracted the virus.

346
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,443
- No root beer, D. Grape?
- Let's jet.

347
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,877
- You need to sit in the chair.
- This is messed up. We're out of here.

348
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,573
No. Aisha, I need
to look at your lip.

349
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,945
We need to run some tests.
- She's fine.

350
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,998
You could be at risk for STDs.
- At risk?

351
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,884
- What's going down?
- Don't get into it.

352
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,080
- You got it?
- Back off.

353
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,816
- You got to come clean!
- Shut it!

354
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,119
We're past the
fronting here, dog!

355
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,160
- You a punk, dog.
- D, are you tripping?

356
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,958
- Shut up! We're going.
- What are you doing?

357
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,465
Enter.

358
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,334
Ah, Kerry, your response
time is impressive as always.

359
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,171
I didn't know that
we had a meeting.

360
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,740
- You remember Dr. Chen.
- I'm on shift, Robert.

361
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,907
Dr. Chen would
like to be reinstated.

362
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,684
We're fully staffed
at the moment...

363
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,847
but if something opens
up, I'll keep you in mind.

364
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,788
I'm not asking
you to consider it.

365
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,792
It was your choice to step down.

366
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,765
I've changed my mind, then.

367
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,095
I'm sorry that only with
hindsight you decided...

368
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,768
I didn't decide anything. You
decided I was expendable.

369
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,141
I'm not the doctor that
blew out that man's aorta.

370
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,336
No, you're the doctor
who wasn't there.

371
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,043
You were reprimanded
for making a mistake.

372
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,616
The only mistake I made was
allowing you to sacrifice me...

373
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,314
like you did Malucci,
to save your own ass.

374
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:58,219
Easy, ladies. If I want to see a
good catfight, I'd watch <i>The View.</i>

375
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,859
Let's try to keep this civil.

376
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:07,966
I respect your abilities as a doctor,
but the position's already been filled.

377
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,905
We're prepared to file suit unless
that and two other conditions are met.

378
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,835
Dr. Chen's record
needs to be expunged.

379
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,138
And an official statement of
correction attached to her file.

380
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,908
- We're trying not to tarnish reputations.
- I don't respond well to threats.

381
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,745
- Dr. Weaver.
- You know what? You can't screw up...

382
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,254
and then whine about being
mistreated. Jing-Mei, you need to grow up.

383
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,597
No, I don't think it's broken...

384
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,062
but I want to get an
x-ray just to be safe.

385
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,360
He's got it, doesn't he?

386
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:46,870
- What do you mean?
- Dimon. He's got the high-five.

387
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,900
- What?
- HIV.

388
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,875
We can't discuss Dimon's
medical status with anybody but him.

389
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:58,882
I feel you. But I see he's tripping,
because he never hit me before.

390
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,283
Does he know that
you're HIV-positive?

391
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,820
My viral load's been
zero. He only gives.

392
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,054
I told him, "Wear
a rubber anyway."

393
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,224
He said, "What for?"
It wasn't sex to him.

394
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,168
He's on the DL.

395
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:24,066
- Uh, the DL?
- Down low.

396
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,576
See, he ain't gay.

397
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,582
You can't be a
faggot and be legit.

398
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,412
He only does guys because
women get so stressful.

399
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,260
Uh, does Aisha know about this?

400
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,820
I was just keeping it going...

401
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:48,434
waiting for the day he'd
come around and get real.

402
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:53,602
- I didn't even think about her.
- CC, it's really important we find her.

403
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:58,409
- She has a pager. I don't know the digits.
- Think you can get it?

404
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,043
- I can try.
- Thank you.

405
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,282
Order a Water's view to
rule out an orbital-rim fracture.

406
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,287
Page me if he gets that number.

407
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:16,054
- So "down low" is bisexual?
- No, "on the side," "in secret."

408
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,959
- "In the closet"?
- To be in the closet, you have to be gay.

409
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:23,125
- He is gay.
- Uh, CC's gay. Dimon's on the down low.

410
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:25,828
Well, if he's having anal
sex with his friend, he's gay.

411
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,998
Not to him. He's got a girlfriend.
He just gets down for release.

412
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,040
- So "down low" means "in denial"?
- Yeah.

413
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,042
Have you injured it before?
- No.

414
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:37,308
- You feel a pop or a snap?
- Uh, I'm not sure.

415
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,475
Over the bone or to the side?
- Both.

416
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,644
- Okay. There?
- Yeah.

417
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,722
All right, that's a pretty good
sprain. How'd you do that?

418
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,722
Oh. My husband bought
me those roller shoes.

419
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,088
I was practicing
in the apartment.

420
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,595
- It turns out I was worse than I thought.
- Has the swelling increased?

421
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,832
- You triage her?
- We're neighbors. I saw her this morning.

422
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:02,373
Oh. Could be an avulsion off the
lateral malleolus. Get an ankle series.

423
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,010
Is it broken?

424
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,671
I don't see a fracture, but
Dr. Weaver's gonna have to check it out.

425
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:13,580
- Am I gonna have to get crutches?
- Maybe until you can bear weight.

426
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,847
You're gonna need help getting
around. How are you getting home?

427
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,116
I called Brian.

428
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,753
It's not all him, you know.
I give as good as I get.

429
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:32,469
Well, I don't see him sitting
in an ER needing x-rays.

430
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,698
Well, it's not the way it seems.

431
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,543
Our walls are
pretty thin, Joyce.

432
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,040
He's the only guy
I've ever loved.

433
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,643
Will you talk to
a social worker?

434
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,722
Someone with experience who
could maybe help you lay out...

435
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,121
some ways you might
want to deal with this.

436
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:59,931
Joyce, I think you came here
for a reason. I can help you.

437
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:04,332
Yeah. I came here because I didn't
want to answer a bunch of questions.

438
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,071
If a patient with the same
history presents again tomorrow...

439
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,675
I expect you to order the
workup I requested today.

440
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,072
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

441
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,679
Dr. Weaver, glad I caught you.

442
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,078
You can go away now.

443
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,246
I was gonna page you, but I couldn't
be sure you'd be wearing your pager.

444
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,152
Robert, you're not gonna be
intimidated by these baseless accusations.

445
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,419
- They have someone on record, Kerry.
- About what?

446
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:32,588
A waitress at that dump across the street
said you were looking for your pager...

447
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:37,032
the night Chen and Malucci killed
that guy. That's an important detail.

448
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,864
- Robert...
- I don't need to hear it.

449
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,606
No explanation.
No spin. Just fix it.

450
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,775
- Fix what?
- All she wants is an Attending position...

451
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,612
with standard pay scale and
a personal apology from you.

452
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,046
- I can't do that.
- A first time for everything.

453
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,776
I wouldn't have any
kind of authority over her.

454
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,353
We've settled with
this dead kid's family.

455
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,549
I won't open it up again because
you have a management problem...

456
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,524
created by your own
negligence and deceit.

457
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,721
She's not interested in taking
you down. All she wants is her job.

458
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:10,962
Give it to her today. And super-glue
the pager to your forehead if you have to.

459
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:16,708
Excuse me, I'm looking for Julio
Echeverria. He had a heart attack.

460
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,471
- Check in at the desk down the hall.
- Dr. Weaver, I need help in Trauma 2.

461
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,810
- That's Dr. Lewis.
- Sats are dropping.

462
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:28,246
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

463
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,358
Fifteen liters by mask. Sir, I
need you to take a deep breath.

464
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,687
- Did you get a 12-lead?
- No ischemic changes.

465
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:39,491
- What happened?
- Decreased breath sounds on the right.

466
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,395
Lung exam was
normal 15 minutes ago.

467
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,694
Is this new?

468
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,734
Yeah, they had to
straighten me out.

469
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,395
Prep for a chest
tube. I need lidocaine.

470
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,906
- What are you doing?
- A broken rib collapsed your lung.

471
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,442
We need to put a tube
in to help you get oxygen.

472
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,771
- No.
- We have to.

473
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,845
- I don't want it.
- You'll die if we don't inflate your lung.

474
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,211
- I don't care. I'm ready.
- Ten blade.

475
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,785
Hold on, Kerry. We need consent.

476
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,356
- I'm done anyway. Please.
- Kerry.

477
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:09,017
A curved Kelly. Susan,
I need the Kelly now.

478
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,187
Please. They'll
keep beating on me.

479
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,096
Susan, open up
some Vaseline gauze.

480
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,536
Susan, now.

481
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:25,734
- Sorry. I was looking for a parking place.
- You want a drink? I'm, uh, boarding.

482
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,881
- I should be boarding now.
- Oh. No, thanks.

483
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:33,382
- So, what's so urgent?
- Nothing really. I was just checking in.

484
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,220
- So how's the new place?
- Sparsely furnished.

485
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,334
But there's something
to be said for that.

486
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:39,119
For sparseness?

487
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,725
<i>Final boarding...</i>

488
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,253
<i>- for all passengers.</i>
- Clarity.

489
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,919
If I knew your mother
was moving in...

490
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,395
I would have taken some
of the New York furniture.

491
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:49,125
Yeah. She mentioned to me that
she doesn't have your new number.

492
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,599
Mm.

493
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,601
You should give
her a call, check in.

494
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,605
- Why?
- You were married to her.

495
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,903
She wants to negotiate. Who knows
when she started looking at life...

496
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:03,742
the way other people read the
stock reports, but, uh, it's over.

497
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,851
I don't think she
shares that assessment.

498
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,749
- You're her ambassador now?
- No.

499
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:13,222
I'm just suggesting you take time
to make sure this is what you want.

500
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,794
I do. Thanks to you.

501
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,191
- Me?
- I was part of this lie...

502
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:24,632
this illusion we were living
in order to hold it together.

503
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,329
It took losing Dad and
thinking about what you said...

504
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:32,001
to make me see that I was lost.

505
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,976
I can't find my
way back with her.

506
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,716
<i>Final boarding call
to all passengers.</i>

507
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,351
I don't know.

508
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,454
I've never, ever seen her
reach out like this before.

509
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,617
That's my flight.

510
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,023
Careful, John, she's
an emotional vampire.

511
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,663
Is he dying?

512
00:28:55,367 --> 00:29:00,829
He's had a pretty big heart attack. He
may need surgery to replace a valve.

513
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,980
Why didn't you tell
me you were coming?

514
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,351
I was scared you
wouldn't want me there.

515
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:19,350
After all this time, you show up
now? I've got 200 people waiting.

516
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,153
Go. Go.

517
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,796
Be happy.

518
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:33,869
Six years and nothing?

519
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,837
Why, <i>Papi?</i>

520
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:39,069
I should have let
you come back home.

521
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,038
It was a mistake.

522
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,184
Why now?

523
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,011
My little girl's
getting married.

524
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,423
It's supposed to be
the best day of my life.

525
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,053
I'm sorry.

526
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,453
I didn't mean to ruin it.

527
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,929
And you're not going to.

528
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,095
I'm happy now. Rene
is a wonderful man.

529
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,935
And I don't need you anymore.

530
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,538
Maria?

531
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:16,909
Miss Echeverria.

532
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,916
I've got the best caterer in
Chicago setting up at the Hilton.

533
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,054
- Let me talk to you.
- Nothing's refundable.

534
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,951
- Your father is very sick.
- I don't care.

535
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,059
- Don't leave it like this.
- He didn't care when I called him...

536
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,422
from Wichita, begging
him to let me come back.

537
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:34,054
- He wanted to see you get married.
- Look, he abandoned me. Okay?

538
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,361
Turned his back. Nobody does
that. Only a stubborn, heartless man.

539
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,897
- He's trying to reconnect.
- You're not gonna make me cry.

540
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,374
This makeup took three hours.

541
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,746
- He was fine when I left him.
- I didn't touch him.

542
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,749
He has broken ribs
and a collapsed lung.

543
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,946
He was flailing against the
side rails. We had to restrain him.

544
00:30:57,122 --> 00:31:00,422
- With your nightstick?
- Why do you care? He's a murderer.

545
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,118
He killed two teenage
kids on the way to a movie.

546
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,793
Oh, my God. Get it off
of him. What happened?

547
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,435
I was looking at the x-ray,
and he flipped the gurney.

548
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,595
- Are you all right? Help us!
- Chest tube's out of his Thora-Seal.

549
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,934
- Asystole! LEWIS: No, no,
no, he pulled his leads off.

550
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,771
One, two, three.

551
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,616
- Mr. Kinney.
- Low sats. He's dropping to 85.

552
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,445
- Mr. Kinney, open your eyes.
- Blood from the ear canal.

553
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,611
Mr. Kinney?

554
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,885
Left pupil is 9
millimeters and sluggish.

555
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,119
GCS is 1-2-1. Probably
an epidural bleed.

556
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,958
Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.
An 8-O ET tube. Bag him, Susan.

557
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,328
- Kerry...
- Get a head CT and call Neurosurgery.

558
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,198
The guy's gonna die in a
couple months by lethal injection.

559
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,737
- Bag him now.
- He asked for no heroic measures.

560
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,965
He's a death-row
inmate attempting suicide.

561
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,475
He can't ask for a DNR.

562
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,974
Tube him now.

563
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,809
Whatever you say, Kerry.

564
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,987
- Hey.
- I got your message.

565
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:09,254
- Yeah, we've been backed up all day.
- You told me to come by.

566
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:14,263
Actually, I left another message on your
machine that I'd get back to you later.

567
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:18,335
Well, I'm here. Okay? I came
to see Marty from the 38th.

568
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,530
- What do you want to say?
- Dr. Weaver, Dr. Chen's looking for you.

569
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,607
Yeah, tell her to wait.

570
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,769
I just wanted to make sure that you
were all right. I heard it was a big fire.

571
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,505
- I'm fine.
- Good. Good.

572
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,242
Can you sign an order for
a social-services consult?

573
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,580
- They won't come without a signature.
- Not now.

574
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:39,885
Well, it's Joyce Westlake. The ankle.
There is domestic violence involved.

575
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:43,551
Yeah, I'll come
down and talk to her.

576
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,522
So that's it?

577
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,763
What?

578
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:54,703
- You're gonna keep playing this game?
- I'm not playing a game.

579
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,806
- So you just want to check on me?
- Is that all right?

580
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,706
Just write the order,
I'll take care of it.

581
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,974
No, I'm the treating
physician. Okay?

582
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:09,283
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

583
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:15,551
- Why are you avoiding?
- I'm not. Can you tell I'm a bit swamped?

584
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,959
Kerry, excuse me, you want
to talk to me, talk to me. Okay?

585
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,258
I'm not gonna hang
around for your convenience.

586
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,129
- You know, forget it.
- Please wait.

587
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,293
No. Bye. WEAVER:
Let me just check on...

588
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,234
- Sandy...
- You know...

589
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,447
Goodbye, Dr. Weaver.

590
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,122
- You packed me a lunch?
- We call this an escape kit.

591
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,791
Money, medication, phone numbers,
anything you might need is in here.

592
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,266
For what?

593
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,905
In case one night you decide...

594
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,406
you don't feel safe
and you have to get out.

595
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,307
He's my husband. I don't
need that to feel safe.

596
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,845
Okay. Um, but it can't
hurt having it around. Right?

597
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,154
So I'll put it with
the rest of your stuff.

598
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:14,418
Hi.

599
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:18,489
Hi. Joyce, this is Adele. She's a
social worker here at the hospital.

600
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,855
- I told you I don't need a social worker.
- In situations like this...

601
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,394
it's policy for me to
interview the patient.

602
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,226
- Situations like what?
- Abby, I need you.

603
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,994
Brian's gonna be here. If
he finds her, he'll get upset.

604
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,330
- Okay, I'll be back.
- Well, has that happened before?

605
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,501
Kid named Ricky gets on the
phone, transfer to Trauma 1.

606
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:37,904
- Who?
- Choirboy.

607
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,705
He's gonna hold up the
phone from the church vestibule.

608
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,848
Did you see it?

609
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:47,509
- What?
- Me either, but I heard it was steamy.

610
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,018
Your rehiring will necessitate the
scaling back of the hours of others...

611
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,718
so don't be surprised if your
return is not met with open arms.

612
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,762
I'm sure they'll look to you
for any scheduling complaints.

613
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,956
You start tomorrow at 7.

614
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,101
- A.M.? Hmm.
- P.M.

615
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,238
- You're putting me on overnights.
- Under the circumstances...

616
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,863
I don't think you're in any position
to complain about your schedule.

617
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,739
You know that's not true,
Kerry. So let's stop lying. Okay?

618
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,583
I'm getting my job back
with the following conditions.

619
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:22,084
- I didn't agree to any conditions.
- I'm returning as an Attending.

620
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,882
I expect shift equity
and equal pay.

621
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,754
I'll report to more experienced
faculty, but not to you.

622
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,258
We both know what you did here.

623
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,396
Yes.

624
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,229
And we know what you did too.

625
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,338
So while we're being
truthful, let me just say...

626
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:44,738
it's not me with blood on my hands.
If you were a more thorough doctor...

627
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,812
you wouldn't have needed
me there in the first place.

628
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:55,085
- A kiss could mean anything.
- Not that kind of kiss.

629
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,746
I guess Kinney's gonna
get executed after all.

630
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:02,360
The inmate. He's in a post-op
coma, not even triggering the vent.

631
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,086
Well, we did what we had to do.

632
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,164
$4000 a day to keep this
guy alive so they can kill him...

633
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,528
hardly seems like the
best use of resources.

634
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:15,106
You know what? Just save the patient.
I'll worry about our resource management.

635
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,468
Oh, John.

636
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,940
- Is Dr. Carter here?
- Welcome back.

637
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,669
Carter. CHEN: Thank you.

638
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,939
- Aisha. See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

639
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,676
I got a page. Dimon's always had an
act, but I thought he was real with me.

640
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,514
No, no, I'm just
glad you came back.

641
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,892
- What do you need, Malik?
- Nothing.

642
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,121
Yeah. Well, then why don't
you find something to do.

643
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:44,068
Warm for January. Maybe we'll
luck out and have a mild winter.

644
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,596
Why are we going this way?

645
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,797
Thought it'd be nice
to walk by the river.

646
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,739
- I have a lot of homework.
- I called your mom today.

647
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,469
And did you tell
her I'm going back?

648
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:58,708
We talked about it, and I
decided that it wasn't good for us.

649
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:03,186
- You and me, or you and Mom?
- You and me.

650
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:09,257
- I don't have a say?
- Maybe in a few years, but no, not yet.

651
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,523
Rachel, I want you to stay here.

652
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:18,269
I missed too many things in your
life to let you leave angry with me.

653
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:24,035
I'm your father. I'm not gonna
pass you off when things get rough.

654
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,203
And what makes you
think things will get better?

655
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:32,544
We both try harder. Neither
one of us is very good at listening.

656
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,879
I just don't want to
be treated like a kid.

657
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,418
Good. I don't want to be
treated like an old man.

658
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,756
- Brian? Brian? BRIAN:
Hi. What happened?

659
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,921
Hi. Uh, everything's okay. Uh,
Joyce's ankle was bothering her.

660
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,623
She sprained it pretty badly.

661
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,259
I told her those things don't have
ankle support. She's not a great skater.

662
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,906
They can be dangerous.

663
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:58,805
Listen, I'm sorry you got pulled
into this little domestic drama.

664
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,412
- I think you got the wrong idea.
- Evidently, I did.

665
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,379
We have tempers. And once
in a while things get out of hand.

666
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,918
- This is really none of my business.
- If it infringes on your life, it is.

667
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,148
Our neighbor in San Francisco
thought there was an earthquake.

668
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:15,885
It was just Joyce smashing all
my softball trophies because...

669
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,792
I went to a game instead of going out
with her folks when they were in town.

670
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:23,130
Right.

671
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,128
They told me Room
3. It's over here.

672
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,295
Yeah, it is. Uh, Joyce
is almost finished.

673
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,237
You could pull your car
around, and I could wheel her out.

674
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,070
- And we can meet you.
- I can get her.

675
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,109
But it's a long walk
to the parking lot.

676
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:38,444
And she's really supposed to stay
off the ankle for a day or two. So...

677
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,415
Well, is there a problem?
- Abby?

678
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,488
- I'll, uh, talk to you later.
Mm-hm. ABBY: Thank you.

679
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:50,118
- Hey, baby. How's it going?
- Better. The throbbing stopped.

680
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,155
Did they give you lots of drugs?
- A few.

681
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,769
- You hungry?
- A little. Yeah.

682
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,939
Why don't we go
over to Angelino's...

683
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,836
and get some pasta,
a bottle of merlot?

684
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,103
- Mm. I feel more like a cheeseburger.
- Ah, it's your call.

685
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,180
- Thanks, Abby.
- Uh, is this yours, Joyce?

686
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,477
No, I have what I came with.

687
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,117
Bye.

688
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,775
- Who are you? LOPEZ:
We got a call, Kerry.

689
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:29,459
- No. I mean, who the hell are you?
- I live my life without apologies.

690
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:33,469
Right. You make choices for your
life. You don't make choices for mine.

691
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,130
I didn't choose to be lied
to or have my time wasted.

692
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,800
- I never misrepresented myself.
- You pretend to be something you're not.

693
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,804
- Lopez, let's go!
- You know what?

694
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,540
It's my employees, my
colleagues, my workplace.

695
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,413
I choose to keep my
private life to myself.

696
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,747
You can't separate who
you are from what you do.

697
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:53,824
- That is not your decision to make.
- I stand up and face it every day.

698
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:57,224
You want the life without hardship.
You don't get one without the other.

699
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,330
Not with me anyway.

700
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:03,161
So you did this out of spite to
teach me some kind of lesson?

701
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:07,734
I did you a huge favor.
You just don't know it yet.

702
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:29,684
- What are you doing?
- The light went out.

703
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:33,195
- Why don't you tell Henry?
- I'm not incompetent.

704
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,855
I'm capable of
changing a light bulb.

705
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,397
- Damn it.
- Here. Come down from there. I'll get it.

706
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,938
- No, screw it. I'll get it later.
- Whoa.

707
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,710
Have you been drinking?

708
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:51,105
Um. Norman Tucker
sent Millicent a bottle...

709
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,946
of 40-year-old Bordeaux
as a get-well gift.

710
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,213
And you what,
helped her open it?

711
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:03,555
I spent the entire afternoon at that
children's cancer center for Millicent.

712
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,926
There was this, uh, one boy...

713
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,337
I came home, and I made the
mistake of getting in the middle...

714
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:19,739
of an argument between
Millicent and her physical therapist.

715
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:24,439
Yeah, Gam's having a little
trouble losing her independence.

716
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:31,012
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Sit down.

717
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:38,993
She told me that my presence
was, in fact, hindering her recovery...

718
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:44,160
that if she needed a caregiver I
would be the last person she'd call.

719
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,598
That's a defense mechanism.

720
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,934
- What are you doing?
- Checking your pulse.

721
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,936
Did you speak to your father?

722
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,013
Sixty and weak. Are
you taking something?

723
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,479
Xanax.

724
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:03,444
- He's giving up on me.
- When did you start taking Xanax?

725
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:07,125
- I have a prescription.
- And you took it with alcohol.

726
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:20,237
- How many pills did you take, Mom?
- I'm so sorry.

727
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,636
I'm sorry. You shouldn't
have to go through this.

728
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,799
How many?

729
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,138
Two.

730
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,175
I just took two.

731
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,223
She asked me to leave.

732
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:44,790
Do you want me to leave, John?

733
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,493
No.

734
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,369
You're right.

735
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,603
I've failed you.

736
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:04,942
I failed your brother.

737
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,187
- And then I failed you.
- Mom...

738
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:14,417
- He was tired before we left for France.
- That was 20 years ago.

739
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,859
Millicent insisted he just
needed some fresh air.

740
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,896
He'd been inside all winter.

741
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,199
It delayed the diagnosis
by less than a month.

742
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,838
It wouldn't have
changed anything.

743
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,435
I was his mother.

744
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:42,379
I just stood by while
it was eating him alive.

745
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,884
I just stood by.
