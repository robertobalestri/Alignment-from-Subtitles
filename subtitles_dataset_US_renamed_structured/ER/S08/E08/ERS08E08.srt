1
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,308
<i>We had a break in the system
for a couple of hours around noon.</i>

2
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:14,380
<i>- But now a second cycle...</i>
- Did they clear the Eisenhower yet?

3
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,416
- Forget about it.
- I swear I took out $40 yesterday.

4
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,315
Are we doing this? Because
I have a pilonidal cyst waiting.

5
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:24,424
- She's finishing her last patient.
- Chuny, Nolemad's PTT is 96.

6
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,254
Hold up heparin for an hour,
then reduce the rate to 1100.

7
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,055
- After the party.
- How long is that?

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,697
Five minutes. Don't go anywhere.

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,856
Stick this back in
the fridge. It's melting.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,526
- Malik, I'm waiting on the L-spine series.
- She had a couple sutures to go.

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,172
- Does she know we're waiting?
- It's a surprise.

12
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,099
- What surprise?
- Dr. Finch's last day.

13
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,005
- Already?
- Yep, and you owe me $10...

14
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:47,045
- for the massage and facial we got.
- It's not here. Can I pay you tomorrow?

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,877
- Whatever. I offer rolling credit.
- Are you backing up?

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,044
No, kicking butt. Storm knocked
out six traffic lights south of Division.

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,713
There's three sets of
multiple MVAs all tucked in.

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,054
Construction on Wacker's all
mud. A crane fell in the river.

19
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,130
Hey, Abby, when you get a chance, I
need a repeat CBC and a Beta HCG in 4.

20
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,233
- Where are you going?
- Come get me when she gets here.

21
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,597
- Me too.
- Wait. You leave, other people leave.

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,796
- No one will be
here. I have to pee.

23
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,304
- Well, then pee fast.
- Gallant.

24
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:17,467
I got a disimpaction for you in 3. Go help
Cleo with her sutures when you're done.

25
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,809
- You're gonna supervise my first couple?
- Don't send him. She'll just take longer.

26
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:24,076
All right. Just clean
the old girl out, then.

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,619
- Haleh, Medical Records needs help.
- I don't work for Medical Records.

28
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,781
- Basement is flooding. Losing charts...
- Then call Housekeeping.

29
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,450
- Payroll.
- Be right there.

30
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,153
Dr. Weaver? Michael Gallant,
third-year on ER rotation.

31
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,492
I know. Frank, did Maintenance get
those sandbags out in the bay yet?

32
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,157
- Doubt it.
- I didn't see any.

33
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,668
Call them. I don't want water coming
through the doors. Then help Haleh.

34
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,932
- Can we talk about this warning letter?
- I write a lot of letters.

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,907
I missed journal club last
night. I had another commitment.

36
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,410
We all have commitments.

37
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,515
ER conferences are a
requirement of your rotation.

38
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,618
- Is she here yet?
- Hey, Abby, can you call Telecom?

39
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,983
The switch is in the basement. I
don't want internal lines going down.

40
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,283
- Do you know the number?
- Find it.

41
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,518
I had a mandatory exercise
involving my scholarship.

42
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,864
- Financial aid offers multiple meetings.
- No. This is Army Reserve duty.

43
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,432
Oh. All right, just
review the notes.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,627
- You'll remove the letter from my file?
- Yeah. Get me a schedule.

45
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,365
Stab wound to the abdomen en
route. Five to 10, depending on traffic.

46
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,339
Prep Trauma 2, break out a
cutdown tray, and page Surgery.

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,844
- So did I miss the cake or what?
- We're still waiting for her to finish.

48
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,609
Messenger dropped this
by for you. Genetadine Labs.

49
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,809
What, are you having
yourself cloned?

50
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,386
Genetadine. That's
the cloning place, right?

51
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,785
- They mainly do DNA analysis.
- Yeah, cloning.

52
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,696
- Hi.
- Hey.

53
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,459
- You need something?
- No.

54
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,514
- I said, any history of heart disease?
- You didn't.

55
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,017
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

56
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,155
- Yes, I did.
- Do you get spiral CTs...

57
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,813
- to rule out PEs now?
- Hold on.

58
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,950
- How many heart attacks have you had?
- Just one. Angioplasty fixed me right up.

59
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,121
- Angioplasty?
- Until this morning when I woke up.

60
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,734
So instead of seeing a doctor, you
stayed on your feet directing traffic.

61
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,927
- Aren't you a doctor?
- Now it's too late.

62
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,961
- What, I'm gonna die?
- No.

63
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,132
I just meant any damage you
did to your heart is already done.

64
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,606
I'm gonna be okay, right?

65
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:41,272
I need you to stay overnight for
observation, and stay on the monitor.

66
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:46,148
And no. We're still doing V/Qs because
they keep promising us a better scanner.

67
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,652
What kind of bedside
manner is that?

68
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:53,123
The idiot has had an MI after stenting,
he stands out in the rain for eight hours.

69
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,024
- I don't think yelling's gonna help.
- It might.

70
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:59,132
You know, you might want to
think about getting out of the ER.

71
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,066
Oh. That advice is only about
nine years too late, but thank you.

72
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,705
Seriously. You never
talked to patients like that.

73
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,670
I've had an epiphany.

74
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:08,968
Dr. Greene.

75
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,839
Medevac coming in. Diverting
from Children's. Near-drowning.

76
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,310
- Did he arrest?
- I don't know.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,040
He must be pretty sick if
they're flying him in the rain.

78
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,321
- It's supposed to be a surprise.
- I hate chocolate mint.

79
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,356
- Yeah, I didn't pick it.
- You think I should stick around?

80
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:29,189
- They're going to gather everyone soon.
- Hey, you're not supposed to see that.

81
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,025
I'll be upstairs. Page me if
anyone needs me for anything.

82
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,034
- I'm sure that we will.
- Carter, isn't it? John Carter?

83
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,536
- And you would be?
- The girl by the pool.

84
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,334
Oh, right, yeah. The one
without the answering machine.

85
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,034
It broke in the move. I haven't
had time to go shopping.

86
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,373
- That's convenient.
- Hey, I called you.

87
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,243
- Did not.
- I spoke to your manservant, Harry.

88
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,884
Henry? The night butler?

89
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,077
- He didn't say anything about it.
- Uh-huh.

90
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,722
It is the 21st century.
You can get voicemail.

91
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,381
- You need to get better help.
- You volunteering?

92
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,891
- Any benefits?
- Well, there's the outfit.

93
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,257
- Dream on.
- Hey, Carter.

94
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,296
- Hey, how'd it go?
- He did good.

95
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,399
Couple pounds of
stool. Only gagged once.

96
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,900
Yeah, those old ladies
can surprise you, huh?

97
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,700
- Yeah. How do I know when I'm done?
- You develop a feel for it.

98
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,138
- Where's the stab wound?
- Should be here by now.

99
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,404
Call Dispatch. Make sure it's
rolling up. Gallant, you're with me.

100
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,447
Don't worry about it. It will
only hurt for a day or two.

101
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,477
Do you think I'm
mean to the patients?

102
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,111
- Only the ones who deserve it.
- What about the ones who don't?

103
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,849
- You're nicer than I am.
- That's not much solace.

104
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,049
Sorry.

105
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,592
Oh, my God.

106
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,428
- I distinctly heard him.
- Who?

107
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,231
The weatherman this morning. He
said, "Party cloudy, chance of rain."

108
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,896
Well, he warned you.

109
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,437
Twelve-year-old boy.
One-story fall and near-drowning.

110
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,079
Moderate respiratory
distress, crackles on the right.

111
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,578
- What's his name?
- Daniel.

112
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,240
- Daniel, having trouble breathing?
- I let go of him.

113
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,579
- Who?
- Joey. I couldn't hold on.

114
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,745
His brother. They were
playing by the river.

115
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,585
- Where is Joey?
- Rescue's still looking for him.

116
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,454
All right, let's slide him out.

117
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,125
Ah. Here it comes.

118
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,455
Must be a police car.

119
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,797
- Does it usually take so long in the rain?
- Shouldn't.

120
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,472
- You need a jacket?
- No. We won't be out here long.

121
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,508
- I can go get one for you if you...
- I'm fine.

122
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,846
Sorry I haven't looked at
your file. You're military?

123
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,450
- Yes, ma'am. U.S. Army Reserve.
- ROTC?

124
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,280
No, I did a year of active duty.

125
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,615
- Now I'm in a scholarship program.
- Oh.

126
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,349
So work in the ER might
not be so crazy to you.

127
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,621
I think it's a whole different
kind of crazy, ma'am.

128
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,691
- There you are. I was looking for you...
- No, listen, I need to see you.

129
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,335
I'm gonna pick up my
son and drive to your office.

130
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,994
Well, if you're not there,
I'll get another attorney.

131
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,471
You're damn right I'm
upset. You told me not to...

132
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,408
You told me not to fight this thing.
Now Roger's gonna try to hang me with it.

133
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:03,015
- Fine. I'll see you in a half an hour.
- What happened?

134
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,415
The DNA analysis shows that
I'm not Reece's biological father.

135
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,485
Oh, God, Peter. I'm so sorry.

136
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,853
I told myself a long time ago it
wouldn't matter, that I'm his father.

137
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,235
I won't let that son
of a bitch change it.

138
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,325
I'm going with you.

139
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,862
No. They're getting ready
to throw a party for you.

140
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,432
I don't give a damn
about a party. Let's go.

141
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,034
- Frank, where the hell is this thing?
- What thing?

142
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,365
- Cleo, are you done?
- I'll call to say goodbye.

143
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,336
- Where's the stab wound?
- I don't know.

144
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,568
I was sloshing around downstairs.
I'm billing you for these shoes.

145
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,407
- Find out what happened.
- Dr. Weaver, it's here.

146
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,914
Twenty-four-year-old female
pedestrian, hit by a car in a crosswalk.

147
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,110
- Miss, can you tell me your name?
- Jill. He hit my dog.

148
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,587
Probable LOC. GCS,
13. BP, 100/75. Pulse, 95.

149
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,386
- Where were you stabbed?
- What?

150
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,222
- No, she was hit by a car.
- Wait, where's the stab wound?

151
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,887
- What stab wound?
- Get her inside.

152
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,262
Your dispatch needs to get it together.
We didn't know you were coming.

153
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,767
The one we're waiting
on is over half an hour late.

154
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,338
Dr. Weaver, Unit 37 got slammed
by an SUV in a downed intersection.

155
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,271
- Ashville and Western.
- Who's 37?

156
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,740
- Our stab wound.
- Pickman.

157
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,539
- Rescue is trying to cut him out.
- Is she okay?

158
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,581
Don't know about the driver. The
pregnant woman is in bad shape.

159
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,684
- The stab wound's pregnant?
- And bleeding.

160
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,253
- Okay. Wait! I'm going with you!
- What, you're leaving?

161
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:19,325
She could be a dropsy. Have
Carter take this case. I'll be right back.

162
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,428
- What do I do?
- Get in.

163
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,090
I couldn't hold him.

164
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,132
Daniel, I need to listen.

165
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,270
He's retracting.

166
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,929
ABG. He's
decreased on the right.

167
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,904
BP's 80 over palp.

168
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,101
- Got ahold of the parents?
- Firefighters did.

169
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,939
Get on the radio and make sure.

170
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,142
Sucking chest wound.

171
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:46,617
Abby, Vaseline gauze, Elastoplast,
chest tube tray, and page Surgery.

172
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,621
Daniel, you got a hole in your chest
sucking in air every time you breathe.

173
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,759
We need to plug
it up, all right?

174
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,691
BP's 110/70. Still no sats.

175
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,854
- Ready?
- Yep.

176
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,827
- That should be better.
- They find Joey?

177
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,762
I don't know. We're
gonna ask the firemen.

178
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,965
- Please, they have to find my brother.
- Everything's gonna be okay. All right?

179
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,165
10 blade.

180
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,316
Stay close to me and
watch where you're going.

181
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,023
- You okay?
- Yeah. Both airbags deployed...

182
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,860
- but he has a bad seat belt side.
- Sir, do you know where you are?

183
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,026
- The middle of the street.
- Lake had a flail chest. We moved him.

184
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,002
- Pickman's in back with an open tib-fib.
- She conscious?

185
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,165
Yeah, but her patient
might be hemorrhaging.

186
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:46,211
Listen to his lungs on the way
in. You might need to needle him.

187
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,277
Okay, got it!

188
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,311
You okay, Doris?

189
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,455
I messed up my leg bad. It's
open, but I got a pulse in the foot.

190
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,148
- I had to move it myself.
- I need you to stand back!

191
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,123
- I'm an emergency physician at County.
- Good for you.

192
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,856
Stand back! We need to
open up this can. You help us.

193
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,829
What's the status
of your patient?

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,027
A 28-year-old woman, eight
months pregnant, mugging victim.

195
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,297
Aah! Son of a bitch!

196
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,065
- You okay?
- I cut my hand!

197
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,903
Gallant, help them.
You have vitals?

198
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,375
- Okay, again!
- BP, 90/60.

199
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,215
- Grab yourself anything?
- I couldn't reach the bag.

200
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,378
- Okay, get her out, then 10 of morphine.
- I'll get the board.

201
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,354
- Get the C-collar. What's her name?
- Vicki.

202
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,791
Vicki, my name is Dr. Weaver.
Where are you having pain?

203
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,362
All over.

204
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,096
- Can you see the bone?
- Careful. Careful.

205
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,965
Does it feel like you're
having contractions?

206
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,084
Brody!

207
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,086
No! Don't touch him!

208
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,797
Gallant!

209
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,000
Brody! Brody, are you okay?

210
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,402
He's unresponsive. Get a
monitor, and let's roll him.

211
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,304
Airway's patent.
Checking for a carotid.

212
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,808
He's not breathing. No pulse.

213
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,105
- You know CPR?
- Yes.

214
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,943
Start compressions.

215
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,678
- I'll do it!
- No! I need you to check on that woman.

216
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,481
- He's in my unit!
- Check on her!

217
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,648
Zadro, I need the
defibrillator and an ambu-bag.

218
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,090
- Coming.
- Come on, breathe!

219
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,096
That was stupid. That was really stupid.
You could have both been electrocuted.

220
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,757
- Stop.
- Sorry. It was instinct.

221
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,459
I told you not to touch him.

222
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,037
You're okay if your feet
don't touch the ground.

223
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,640
Guess what? It's raining.
Water conducts electricity.

224
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,639
- I'm all right.
- You were lucky.

225
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,507
- Still no pulse. Bag him.
- Got it.

226
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,707
- It's charging to 200.
- She's okay.

227
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,715
- Clear.
- The tires are insulating the rig.

228
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,014
I can't get in. That hot
wire keeps lighting it up.

229
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,657
- Is she conscious?
- Yeah. She's in labor.

230
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,816
You go back and tell
her it's gonna be okay.

231
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,723
- He's one of my men!
- Do it.

232
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,659
Three hundred. Clear.

233
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,163
- He's venting.
- Got it.

234
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,995
- You got a rhythm?
- Yeah.

235
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,363
Intubate him.

236
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,132
A hundred of lido down
the ET until you get a line.

237
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,004
That's two milligrams a minute.

238
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,312
Please help me. I'm bleeding.

239
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,675
Hang in there. We're
gonna get you out of there.

240
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,977
Vicki, it's Dr. Weaver
again. Did you feel a shock?

241
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,485
- No, I don't think so.
- Is he breathing?

242
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:46,058
We got him back for now. Vicki, tell
me if you're bleeding from your vagina.

243
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,419
The baby's not moving.

244
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:52,031
I need you to feel down there
and tell me if you're bleeding.

245
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,437
Hold on! I'm coming in.

246
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,768
- No, no. I can't let you do that.
- Her baby's probably in distress.

247
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,206
First rule of an accident site,
don't create more casualties.

248
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,539
Casualties?

249
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:07,874
We need an engineer out here.

250
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,539
They're not showing
fault in the power grid.

251
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,079
- It looks like a fault to me.
- That's what they're telling me.

252
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,055
- Hey, I told you not to do that!
- Just turn the damn power off!

253
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,787
Did you hit your head,
lose consciousness?

254
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,296
I don't know. I remember walking in the
street, seeing Gordon lying in the rain.

255
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,060
- Gordon?
- Her dog.

256
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,965
BP's 100/40.

257
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,266
He kept scratching at the
door. I had to take him for a walk.

258
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,409
- Breath sounds equal.
- No hemotympanum.

259
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,045
- But I wanna get a head CT.
- Is this the hit-and-run?

260
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,874
He didn't stop?

261
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,142
- Pulse ox is 94 on 4 liters.
- Miss...

262
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,412
- can you describe the car that hit you?
- It was silver, I think.

263
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,782
- Are you sure?
- No. Uhn!

264
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,288
Does that hurt? JILL: Yes.

265
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,884
- Did you take my dog to the vet?
- I'm afraid your dog died.

266
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,792
Full trauma panel,
C-spine, chest...

267
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,626
AP pelvis, Foley,
10 of morphine.

268
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,300
HemoCue's 9.8. Let's get
an ultrasound before a CT.

269
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,838
- Dr. Greene is using it.
- Go see if he's done.

270
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:12,069
- What kind of dog was he?
- He was a terrier mix.

271
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,938
Those are the best kind. You
know, he probably went really fast.

272
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,017
Don't hear a dorsalis pedis
pulse. Go get me a Doppler.

273
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,245
Check an ICON before
she goes to Radiology.

274
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,151
Little fluid in
Morrison's pouch.

275
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,791
- Can we have that when you're done?
- It's all yours.

276
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,689
Page Pedes Surgery.
Another crit in 20 minutes.

277
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,922
- You want to cath urine?
- On a CPK and another portable chest.

278
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,935
Daniel, you're
doing much better.

279
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,833
We need to keep an eye on
you for the next couple hours...

280
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,974
just in case you
need any surgery.

281
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,336
- He's dead, isn't he?
- What?

282
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,978
Joey. He drowned.

283
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,604
- I don't know. They're looking for him.
- He didn't want to go.

284
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,512
- Where?
- To the river.

285
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,482
He was scared, but
I called him a baby.

286
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,316
You didn't know this would happen.
- He's only 6.

287
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,391
- Parents are on their way.
- They're gonna hate me now.

288
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,997
- They're gonna be happy you're safe.
- It should have been me.

289
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,459
- Watch the monitor. His heart's irritable.
- Looks like regular sinus rhythm.

290
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,196
- Okay, let's go! Shut the door.
- Okay.

291
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,508
Hey, stay clear of that rig!

292
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,346
- Hey, hold on.
- It's okay.

293
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,644
- Is she okay?
- Hypertonic contractions.

294
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,583
BP's dropping, 68/40.

295
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,019
That's way too low, right?

296
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,557
- What?!
- Nothing, Vicki.

297
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,059
I need you to be quiet.
I just need to listen.

298
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,394
- What was that?
- It's the power line!

299
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,566
- Fetal heart tones are 70.
- Is that bad?

300
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,277
Maybe the transformer
will blow out and kill the line!

301
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,379
Dr. Weaver!

302
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,078
I need your help. Can
you get in here safely?

303
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,555
- Yeah, I'd have to jump.
- Okay, then jump.

304
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,588
Got it.

305
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:14,530
Search through the cabinets.
Find me an amp of cardiac lidocaine.

306
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,862
- Lidocaine?
- Just do it.

307
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,903
Vicki, your placenta is detaching.
It's bleeding into your uterus.

308
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,202
Oh, God!

309
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,211
Hey! I told you to stay
away from the damn vehicle!

310
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,815
She's bleeding out!
Why is the power still on?

311
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,450
There's a crew on the way!

312
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,483
The only way to stop the bleeding
is to deliver your baby surgically.

313
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,717
- It's too early.
- It's not. Thirty-six weeks is full-term.

314
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,054
Take me to the hospital!

315
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,721
Honey, I want to. I want to,
but I can't right now, all right?

316
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,126
Shut it off from the plant!

317
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,793
It's supposed to burn
through on its own.

318
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,439
They need to
authorize the shutdown.

319
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:57,907
Vicki. Vicki, I need you to listen
to me. I'm an emergency physician.

320
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,639
I'm trained to perform a C-section
only after the mother has died.

321
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,750
And in about 15 minutes,
that's what's gonna happen.

322
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,979
Meanwhile, your baby is in danger.
But I might be able to save you both...

323
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:12,250
if we take the baby now and
stop your internal bleeding.

324
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,793
Are you willing to
take that risk with me?

325
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,721
- I think so.
- You sure?

326
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,703
- You've observed a C-section?
- I haven't done OB before.

327
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,098
- Well, you'll be ahead of the curve.
- Lidocaine.

328
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,675
- Know how to take a blood pressure?
- Yeah.

329
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:35,008
Okay, take one. I need it
every couple of minutes.

330
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:40,482
Squeeze that saline bag and find
me every 4-by-4 and bandage we have.

331
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,147
Okay, Vicki. Vicki,
hang in there.

332
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:50,388
I'm gonna give you a shot in your
spine that will numb your belly and legs.

333
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,224
All right, find me a 10 blade.

334
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,329
- That's a scalpel.
- When's the last time you've done this?

335
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,355
- Peter, the DNA test was inevitable.
- There has to be a precedent.

336
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,205
Not in a custody battle between two
men without genetic ties to a child...

337
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,682
they raised. It's stepfather
versus stepfather.

338
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:17,017
- I'm not his stepfather. I'm his father.
- Sorry. Father.

339
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,557
Until Carla died, Roger never
questioned that Peter was Reece's dad.

340
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,355
- Irrelevant.
- She put my name on the birth certificate.

341
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,226
If she were alive, Carla
couldn't contest the paternity.

342
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,095
- But Roger can?
- Ironically, yes.

343
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:32,261
Peter, you are going to have to
allow Roger to resume partial visitation.

344
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,737
- No. No way.
- As we speak...

345
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:38,241
Roger's attorney is drafting a
pre-trial motion for visitation...

346
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,743
until this is resolved.

347
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,612
You don't stipulate now, you'll lose
that hearing and be painted as the heavy.

348
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:48,084
I'm the heavy? He's trying to take
my son from me and I'm the heavy?

349
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:51,190
You need to be seen by the judge
as someone who's interested...

350
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,258
- in Reece's well-being.
- I am.

351
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,691
Good. Then you
need to listen to me.

352
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,197
You have to stay
focused on the endgame.

353
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,699
And not let anger or
fear impede that goal.

354
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,601
Vicki, stay awake. I
need you to stay awake.

355
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,799
- BP's dropping. 50.
- Spike another liter.

356
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,944
- "Spike"?
- Take the pointy end of the bag...

357
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,808
and hang it up.
Hey, you! Firefighter!

358
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,439
- Lopez!
- Lopez, I need more light!

359
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,416
Scotty! Scotty,
turn up the brights!

360
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,953
I need you over here. Get out.

361
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,091
- You're doing a vertical incision?
- Yeah.

362
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,885
Be ready with that hemostat.

363
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,053
We're gonna clamp the big bleeders
and pack up everything else with gauze.

364
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,496
All right, here we go.

365
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,913
I need you to put your
hands there and pull back.

366
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,174
- Where?
- Just do what I do from the other side.

367
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,617
Vicki, you feel that?

368
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,782
- Just some pulling.
- Okay.

369
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,486
Okay, fascia's exposed.

370
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,664
Okay, separate the
rectus, down to the fascia.

371
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,665
All right, more retraction.

372
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,698
- Okay.
- Pull back.

373
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,498
- My baby.
- Hang on. Hang on, Vicki.

374
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:24,781
Okay. I'm into the peritoneal cavity.
Here's the uterus. Give me the scalpel.

375
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,153
You want me to let go?

376
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,852
- Scanner 1 will be ready in 10.
- Do a sound on the chest.

377
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,018
They're gonna take you upstairs and
scan your whole body for other injuries.

378
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:40,496
I want you to tell the nurse if you
need any more pain medication, okay?

379
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,295
I'm sorry about your dog.

380
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,005
What?

381
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,698
- "He probably went really fast."
- She was upset.

382
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,174
She could have solid-organ rupture.
The dog's the least of her concerns.

383
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,337
It can be traumatic to lose a pet,
especially if you saw it happen.

384
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,846
- What was his name?
- Who?

385
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,348
Your dog.

386
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,420
Happy. He was a Lhasa apso, and
he got run over by a car when I was 11.

387
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,853
Oh, did he go really fast?

388
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,492
No. Crushed his pelvis.

389
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,890
<i>- In the river today...</i>
- Someone drowned?

390
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,087
Brother of the boy in Trauma 2.

391
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,925
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did they find him?

392
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,068
- Not yet.
- You can't leave anything around here.

393
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:19,000
- What?
- Some derelict stole my Palm Pilot.

394
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,606
- Maybe you misplaced it.
- I had it two minutes ago.

395
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,676
- Dr. Carter.
- Alger. Alger, what are you...?

396
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,838
It's your grandmother. I found her in
the driveway. I think she broke her hip.

397
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,414
Get a gurney!

398
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,211
There's a cut on her head.

399
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,843
- She was driving?
- She went during the break in the storm.

400
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,287
- Gamma?
- Oh, John, it's terrible. It hurts.

401
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,189
- Okay, I know it does. Just lay still.
- Aah!

402
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,854
- Did she fall down?
- Right leg shortened, externally rotated.

403
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,091
- I think I broke my hip.
- I think you did too.

404
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,396
- What happened to your head?
- I thought it was best if I drove home.

405
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,699
I didn't realize how much I
was bleeding, so I slipped.

406
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,469
- You were in an accident?
- Well, I don't...

407
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:00,977
It was raining. I couldn't
see. I think I hit a dog.

408
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:07,918
- Where were you driving?
- It was supposed to be clear and sunny.

409
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,919
Retract the bladder anteriorly.
- Like that?

410
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,889
More. Watch your fingers.

411
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,058
I'm opening the
lower uterine section.

412
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,663
Is that the amniotic fluid?
WEAVER: Yeah. I'm in.

413
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,335
It looks like a lot of blood.

414
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,872
Auto recloser is stuck open or
something. He's trying to bypass it.

415
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,602
- I don't care. Just shut it down!
- It ain't that simple, lady!

416
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:32,801
- Damn it!
- What?

417
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,379
I cut a uterine vein.
Another clamp now!

418
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,541
- BP's dropping. 60 systolic.
- Keep squeezing in that saline.

419
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,278
- Doesn't she need blood?
- I don't have any blood!

420
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,820
- Fundal pressure.
- What?

421
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,754
Push the baby down towards
me from the top of the uterus.

422
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,157
- Okay. Right here?
- Yes. Yes. Now.

423
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,264
- Is the other ambulance here?
- It's pulling up.

424
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,766
Call County General. Say we need an
O.R., OB Attending, and a neonatologist.

425
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,072
- Grab the bulb syringe.
- Okay.

426
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,576
Suck out his nose and mouth.

427
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,950
- Is there an exit wound?
- Sure is. Blew off his boot.

428
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,610
A transthoracic current pathway.

429
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,916
- You saw it?
- He lit up like a Christmas tree.

430
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,286
I need the room.
Post-arrest electrocution.

431
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,587
- What's open with a monitor?
- He's a fireman.

432
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,129
Daniel, we're gonna
shuffle you to another room.

433
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,735
CK is normal. Tox screen
tested positive for marijuana.

434
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,565
- Marijuana? Were you smoking dope?
- C-spine, chest, pelvis.

435
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,001
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

436
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,505
For getting high and
taking Joey out to the river?

437
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,178
- I didn't smoke today.
- I knew it. I knew it.

438
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,644
We saw the river on the
news. We wanted to see it.

439
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,511
- "We"? Joey's 6 years old.
- He said he wanted to see it.

440
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:47,118
- You're gonna blame it on him now?
- No, it's my fault.

441
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,482
- You're damn right it's your fault!
- Hold on.

442
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,988
I'm Dr. Greene. We need
to get Daniel into a room.

443
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,786
Then I'll come out and brief
you on your son's condition.

444
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,486
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- You heard from the fire department...

445
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,189
- about Joey?
- Not yet. They're still searching.

446
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,991
- Between these clamps, right?
- Yes.

447
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,462
- Vicki! Vicki, are you still with me?
- Is that my baby?

448
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,206
Yes, honey. You have a boy.

449
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,005
He's crying. Do you
hear that? He's crying.

450
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,841
Could be stronger. We
need to get a heart rate.

451
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,315
Okay, 10 minutes! They're
gonna shut the entire grid off!

452
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,147
Why can't they do it right now?

453
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,553
They have to warn emergency
facilities they're going off-line.

454
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,257
- Okay. It's 88, I think.
- You think or you know?

455
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:30,657
It's 88.

456
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,288
- One-minute Apgar is seven out of 10.
- It'll get better, right?

457
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:39,029
We need to wrap him up. He
needs fluids, oxygen, maybe blood.

458
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,503
You said we didn't
have any blood.

459
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,537
You need to get
him to the hospital.

460
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,876
Nine minutes!

461
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,514
Vicki?

462
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,308
Vicki, wake up!

463
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:55,216
Damn it! She's exsanguinating! I
have to clamp off the uterine artery.

464
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,049
- Oh!
- Okay, I'm going!

465
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,283
Get out of the way!

466
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,724
- No!
- It's this or I throw him to you!

467
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,888
- No! No! Tell him to stop!
- Go.

468
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,270
- Is he okay?
- I got him.

469
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,645
- Okay, get him out of here.
Go! LOPEZ: Let's go. Let's go.

470
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:28,413
Transformer just blew. Does
that mean the circuit's dead?

471
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,086
I'm gonna sew this up.

472
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,623
You won't feel anything.

473
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,355
You okay?

474
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,128
I see a lot of fathers
who come in here...

475
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:45,738
and they're upset when
their kids are hurt or missing.

476
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,896
Sometimes they say
things they don't mean.

477
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:53,273
He's not my father. He's my
stepfather. Joey's the real kid.

478
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,108
- And that makes you...?
- A pain in the ass.

479
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,145
Did it come back?

480
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,082
- What?
- You were waiting for a chest x-ray.

481
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,986
Right. Lungs re-expanded.
Tube's in a good position.

482
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,219
I'm repairing the
chest laceration now.

483
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,919
- Mom?
- So he's fine?

484
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,396
For now. He'll need to
be monitored in the PICU.

485
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,970
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't have been out there.

486
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,470
- Yeah, I know.
- Mrs. Pendry...

487
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,940
Why did you take him there?
You didn't think. You never think.

488
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,875
I know. It should have
been me that drowned.

489
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:31,312
- Yes. But it wasn't, was it?
- Mrs. Pendry...

490
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,884
- It was Joey.
- Mrs. Pendry...

491
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,948
I need to talk to you outside.

492
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,160
In here.

493
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,165
- What are you doing?
- My son is missing. No one can find him.

494
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,498
Right. And your other son is in there
who needs your comfort and love.

495
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,163
This is none of your business.

496
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,208
You want him to feel responsible?
Guess what? He already does.

497
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,675
You want him to
hurt? He already hurts.

498
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,816
You want him to hate
himself, keep it up.

499
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,679
- They found him.
- What?

500
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,717
- He's stuck down river.
- Is he all right?

501
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,219
I don't know. They're
trying to get to him.

502
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,390
It'll be okay, Peter.

503
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,289
We don't know that.

504
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,328
I see you two together. I know.

505
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,899
Hey. Hey, hey.

506
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,365
What did you do that for?

507
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,996
You wanted to?

508
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,906
Are you expecting someone?

509
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,910
- Yeah?
- Peter.

510
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,674
No, Peter! This doesn't
have to go any further, man!

511
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,376
Look, please. Just
hear me out, okay?

512
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,786
Come on.

513
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,817
Look, Reece lived under my
care and my roof for most of his life.

514
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:52,192
All I'm asking for is some kind of
arrangement that recognizes that.

515
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,300
- It's too late for that.
- Look, come on, brother.

516
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,397
- You want to put him through a trial?
- I'm keeping my son.

517
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,297
- I guess I'll see you there.
- Yeah, you will.

518
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,305
<i>There's been a
search going on...</i>

519
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,910
<i>ever since the boy's brother
was pulled out this evening.</i>

520
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,158
Stand by.

521
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,838
Swift Water 43.
County General waiting.

522
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,525
- Open, channel two.
<i>- Copy.</i>

523
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,949
- Is he alive?
- They don't know.

524
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:16,248
Frank, call the burn unit. Brodoff is
going to the O.R. for a fasciotomy first.

525
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,912
Is that your electrocution?

526
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,424
Compartmental pressure is
almost 60. Otherwise, he's lucky.

527
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,461
- Anyone want anything from the store?
- It's pouring outside.

528
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,862
Malik and Yosh don't like the
lounge coffee. It hurts their stomach.

529
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,832
- Grande vanilla cappuccino.
- It's okay. It's on me.

530
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,030
He's in arrest, but they're
flying him in. ETA, 15 minutes.

531
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,970
- Does he have a pulse?
- P.E.A.

532
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,406
Luka, our new med
student's coming in BOA.

533
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:41,240
Weaver opened up a pregnant
woman trapped in an ambulance.

534
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,041
- Opened up?
- C-section.

535
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,741
- In the field?
- She'll have some explaining to do.

536
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,943
- Can I get you something, Abby?
- Nope.

537
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,160
- Cigarettes?
- No, thanks.

538
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,122
- What's that?
- What?

539
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,487
- What time is it?
- Seven.

540
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,128
- What's wrong?
- Give me your bag!

541
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,093
- Let me see inside your bag.
- No!

542
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,287
What are you doing?

543
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,798
My Palm Pilot alarm goes off at
7 to remind me to take my Vioxx.

544
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,267
- Come on, let go of her bag.
- After I see inside.

545
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,769
- Frank!
- For chrissakes.

546
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,172
Fabulous! First you
steal it, then you break it!

547
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,647
- That's not yours.
- I'm calling the police.

548
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,615
Hey, hold on. This is a mistake.

549
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:23,517
Oh, yeah! Yeah, my
stuff just leapt into her bag!

550
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,482
Nicole?

551
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:30,126
And it's not just me, pal, she's
ripping off everybody. Ask Abby.

552
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,988
Nicole!

553
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:37,261
- I need some help here! Newborn!
- Luka, the baby.

554
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,996
Dr. Weaver says he
might need a transfusion.

555
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:44,868
- Is he premature?
- No. We gave him O-2. He needs an IV.

556
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:49,777
Elevate her legs. Cycle the dynamap.
Tilt the monitor toward me. I got it.

557
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,788
- I got it. How bad is that hand?
- It'll keep.

558
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,791
Sats are plummeting.
She's not moving air.

559
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,049
Stop! Airway blocked!

560
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,987
- I thought you had to move her!
- Need to protect her airway.

561
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,353
Cricoid pressure.

562
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,696
Cover!

563
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,829
Exposed flexor tendon. You're
gonna need a hand surgeon.

564
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,994
I need to control the scene.

565
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,072
Get somebody else.

566
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,732
All right, I'm in.

567
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,242
Bag her! Let's go!

568
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:24,975
Draw a milligram of epi and
have atropine standing by.

569
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,948
- Get in!
- No, I'm good.

570
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,147
- No, you're not!
- Go on, get out of here. Come on.

571
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,273
People think kids don't listen
to their parents, but they do.

572
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:52,104
If they tell you you're nothing,
you think you're nothing.

573
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,558
- How cold do you think that water is?
- I don't know, 40.

574
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,246
Hope it's colder than that.

575
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,025
- You got a pulse?
- No. No pulse.

576
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,627
No spontaneous
resps. GCS, 3. For real.

577
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,730
- How long was he under?
- I don't know.

578
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,298
We found him in debris a
mile from where he fell in.

579
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:17,265
- I thought it was P.E.A.
- No. Asystole the whole flight.

580
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,403
Hey, Gam.

581
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,767
Does it still hurt?

582
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,142
- On a scale of one to 10...
- It hurts, John.

583
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,336
- Did she get the full amount?
- In two doses.

584
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,504
- Give her four more of morphine.
- Okay.

585
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,583
But I'll put her on the monitor.

586
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,413
Well, Gam, you
definitely broke your hip.

587
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,421
Looks like an impacted
fracture of the femoral neck.

588
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,582
Please speak English, John.

589
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:44,761
I need to get a more sophisticated scan
to determine if you need surgery or not.

590
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,093
I should have listened to
you about the car. I'm sorry.

591
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,030
Gamma...

592
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,838
I think you hit more
than just a dog.

593
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,804
You also hit a young woman.

594
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,072
She's okay. We're
taking care of her here.

595
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:05,308
I called Mr. Stern in case
you need an attorney.

596
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,783
- I hit a girl?
- Yeah.

597
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,456
- I left. I drove away.
- You didn't know.

598
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,287
But I should have checked
to see. Oh, my God!

599
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,091
Gam, you were confused, okay? It's
crazy out there. Visibility's terrible.

600
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,928
I'm gonna be right back,
then I'll take you for that scan.

601
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,162
- What's wrong? What is it?
- Nothing. It's just another patient.

602
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,970
- Page Surgery. I need a HemoCue.
- What happened?

603
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,905
- Dropped her sats in the elevator. 88.
- Any chest pain?

604
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,945
No. Just passed out. BP's 80/60.

605
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,344
I can't see the cords. I
need a fiber-optic scope.

606
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,680
ABG, set up the ultrasound,
and mix up 7500 units of heparin.

607
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,754
There's a lot of fluid in here.
Could be pulmonary edema.

608
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:47,950
Grab the thrombolytics box.
DIC panel. Troponin, CK, EKG...

609
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,288
- and a portable chest.
- Two large-bore IVs.

610
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,864
Nuke the saline in the
microwave. Get that collar off him.

611
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,796
- We'll need a bear-hugger.
- Coming.

612
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,407
- Tube's out.
- God, he's blue.

613
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:01,472
Number 5 1/2 uncuffed
ET tube. Suction.

614
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,973
Still no pulse.
Asystole on the monitor.

615
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:07,340
- Joey, wake up. Baby, wake up.
- Ma'am, you need to back up.

616
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:11,678
- Oh, my God!
- What is that?

617
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,081
- What is that?
- River water.

618
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,518
Cords are closed. I need
a fiber-optic laryngoscope.

619
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,420
Prep the neck. I
might have to crike him.

620
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,520
Daniel, get back to
bed. I'll come get you.

621
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,521
Can't get a line, and
he's totally clamped down.

622
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,189
Two cutdown trays.

623
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,165
Daniel, now. Lily, can you...?

624
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,204
- You heard him, out! Get out of here!
- You too.

625
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,840
- What?
- Out!

626
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:40,741
Cross-match her for 6 units. Two
units FFP. Stick her and send a clot.

627
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:43,245
- Is the O.R. ready?
- Oh. They're waiting for you.

628
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,179
- I have an emergency C-section.
- No kidding. I can see that.

629
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:49,844
Coburn called me, screaming. I
said she must have heard wrong.

630
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,753
28-year-old woman trapped in an
ambulance, abrupted and hemorrhaging.

631
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,861
And ER docs don't perform
C-sections until the mother arrests.

632
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,497
- She will if we don't get her upstairs.
- BP's up to 90.

633
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,656
Have dopamine standing
by. Add a coag panel.

634
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,860
I got it from here, Kerry. Go
back in the ER and stay dry.

635
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,938
I don't want you dying of
pneumonia before your public flogging.

636
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,541
- I could've let everybody die.
- That's the safe play.

637
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:14,111
Now if she lives, you're a hero.
If she doesn't, I don't know you.

638
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,616
The baby.

639
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,513
Chuny, where's the baby?

640
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,814
He's pinking up. They're
waiting for the NICU fellow.

641
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,385
Nice save, Dr. Weaver.

642
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,694
One milligram of vitamin K, I.M.

643
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,061
Erythromycin ophthalmic
ointment, 0.5 percent.

644
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,428
Good neuro check?

645
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,537
Moves all four symmetrically.
Lungs are clear. No retractions.

646
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,607
- You get a heel-stick?
- Glucose, 70. Pulse, 120.

647
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,105
You did it.

648
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,254
Okay.

649
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,183
CBC, lytes, BUN,
creatinine and a bilirubin.

650
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,630
Luka?

651
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,596
Can I talk to you?

652
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,894
- Bradying down to 60.
- Hurry up, she'll arrest.

653
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,469
I'm in, I think.

654
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,299
Sats are falling.

655
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,476
There's too much edema. Is Mark
done yet? I need that fiber-optic.

656
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,543
- Air in the stomach.
- What are you doing?

657
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,907
Try to suction the
cords. Inflate the balloon.

658
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,279
- Keep it in, you'll have a better shot.
- No, just... Pull back really slowly.

659
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,816
There we go. Slowly, slowly.

660
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,956
Little more.

661
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,786
All right, there are the
cords. Give me the tube.

662
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,897
Open a crash cart. Draw one
of atropine and an amp of epi.

663
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,301
Got it.

664
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,237
Come on, hold on.

665
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,435
89, 90.

666
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,512
Pulse ox is climbing.

667
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,909
Good breath sounds. Nice work.

668
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,343
Saline's running.

669
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,955
Dilute two mgs of atropine
and one mg of epi down the tube.

670
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,023
How high does the
temp go on that vent?

671
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,682
Forty centigrade.

672
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:13,457
- Set tidal volume at 200 on 100 percent.
- Still no pulse and no pressure.

673
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,657
All right, keep warming him.

674
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:19,271
We got to get that Foley in.
We're gonna irrigate the bladder.

675
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,138
We're gonna save this one.

676
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,208
- You want me to...?
- No, no, he can stay.

677
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:30,405
Cycle the lavage fluids. Repeat
the temp, max out the blower.

678
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,211
Cardiac activity on the monitor.
- What?

679
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,376
- Looks like P.E.A.
- That's good.

680
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,886
Amp of bicarb. Charge
the paddles to 60.

681
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,719
- We don't have anything to shock.
- We will.

682
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,793
- Pacing pads.
- Good lung sounds.

683
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,760
- Come on, Joey. Come on.
- V-tach.

684
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,695
Yeah, baby, let's go. Clear.

685
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,535
- Polymorphic.
- Okay, charge to 120.

686
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,936
Check for a pulse. Clear.

687
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,705
Bingo. Normal sinus.

688
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,110
Thank you, God.

689
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:08,885
Fem stick him for labs. Full
trauma panel, ABG and an art line.

690
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,617
Get a second cutdown.
Eighteen-gauge angiocath.

691
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,557
Anything after the line?
- Wait and see.

692
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,165
- 10 blade.
- Hey, it stopped raining.

693
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,395
Impaction with mild or no
displacement. Probably a type 1.

694
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:28,199
The fracture line traverses straight
from the greater to lesser trochanters.

695
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,365
What do you think,
orthopedic surgery?

696
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,569
Depends on the orthopod, but
I'd try to keep them away from her.

697
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:37,773
One third of the elderly who go under
the knife for these kind of injuries...

698
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,850
die within a year from
post-op complications.

699
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,448
She's panicking. Heart
rate's up. BP's falling.

700
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,419
Get her out!

701
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,955
Gam? MILLICENT: John.

702
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,592
- John, are you there?
- I'm here.

703
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,955
I want to go home.

704
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,630
- Not quite yet.
- Call your grandfather to pick me up.

705
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,698
I want to go home.

706
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:57,199
- Grandpa's not here.
- Get him.

707
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,568
Grandpa's dead.

708
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,636
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

709
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,145
You were in a car accident.
Remember, Gam? You broke your hip?

710
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,840
Oh, yes.

711
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,047
Of course.

712
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:19,784
I hit a dog. I hit a dog. He
was in the middle of the street.

713
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,187
Is she okay?

714
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,123
No.

715
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,357
Not really.

716
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,165
That baby okay?

717
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,996
Yeah.

718
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:12,702
Dr. Greene revived a drowned
hypothermic boy tonight.

719
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:17,542
Came in ice-cold and not breathing,
no pulse, and he got him back.

720
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,882
It was a miracle.

721
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,748
You all right?

722
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,457
What is it?

723
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,298
- She's pregnant.
- Who?

724
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,893
Nicole.

725
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,576
I see.

726
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,273
- Is that why she was stealing?
- No. That's a...

727
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:57,345
That's a habit. She doesn't
know how to trust people.

728
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,388
Trusting people isn't
really the problem.

729
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,423
Her father kicked her
out when she was 16.

730
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,993
She's had to learn
to live on her own.

731
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,562
Her father?

732
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,792
She panicked, I
guess. I don't know.

733
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:16,441
I was just trying to help her.
I didn't think I'd be with her.

734
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,247
It just happened.

735
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,449
You sure it's yours?

736
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,948
- And that she's really pregnant?
- She's not like that. You don't know her.

737
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,389
Do you?

738
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:44,469
We gave him what's called
an EEG, which is a brain scan.

739
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,729
Everything looks
completely normal.

740
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,136
- So that's good?
- That's good.

741
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,268
You're gonna get your
brother back, Daniel.

742
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:57,347
- Thank you for saving him.
- You're welcome.

743
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,208
Is my mom with him?

744
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,152
Yeah. They're gonna
move him upstairs...

745
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,016
and you're gonna be up
in the same room soon.

746
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:11,090
I'm gonna tell you something, but
you can't tell any other kids, okay?

747
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,060
Okay.

748
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,734
Parents don't always
know what they're doing.

749
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,167
Just because they're adults
doesn't mean they know what's right.

750
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,272
In fact...

751
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,536
some adults are
wrong most of the time.

752
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,882
- I know that.
- Good.

753
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,683
And I want you to
promise me something.

754
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,613
What?

755
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,755
Don't listen to them.

756
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:48,665
Don't believe that you're not
just as good as your brother.

757
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,734
Just as smart.

758
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,904
Just as special.

759
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:01,543
One day they may realize that...

760
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:07,547
but you can tell them it doesn't
matter because you already knew.

761
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,284
You knew before they did.

762
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:24,668
Dr. Weaver, Dr. Romano is looking
for you. The mother came out of surgery.

763
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,806
They had to perform a
hysterectomy, but she's doing all right.

764
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,441
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

765
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:33,907
He also told me that I should
try to stay away from you...

766
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,706
if I'm gonna survive med school.

767
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,315
Well, nobody actually listens
to Dr. Romano down here.

768
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:40,679
Yeah, I figured that.

769
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,087
It was pretty amazing
what you did out there.

770
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,482
I was a little out
of my element.

771
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,422
Well, you wouldn't know it.

772
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,358
Thank you.

773
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,090
Why don't you go up
and take her baby to her?

774
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,097
- They'd let me?
- It's one of the perks.

775
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,203
- She's gonna think you're an angel.
- Yeah, well...

776
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,067
- she did almost see me glowing.
- You did great.

777
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,178
I mean, you took a risk, stayed focused,
listened. You did what was necessary.

778
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:10,907
- That's an ER doc.
- I was scared out there for a while.

779
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:14,678
- Gallant, I was scared the whole time.
- Right.

780
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,921
The fireman is sitting well in
ICU. He's gonna keep his hands.

781
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,391
- Cardiac activity is normal.
- Good. He got quite a jolt.

782
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,291
We saved everybody, didn't we?

783
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:28,160
Those people are all right
now because we were there.

784
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,528
Some days are good days.

785
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,294
Yeah, I like the good days.

786
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,170
Enjoy them when they come.

787
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,638
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.
