1
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,476
Problem with the
office supplies?

2
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,745
- I just pronounced Bertha.
- Blue Bertha?

3
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,324
I admitted her 10 times for
COPD in the last six months.

4
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,254
She must have liked you a lot.

5
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,625
Every time, she swore to me
she'd quit smoking. Every time.

6
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,323
Behind the crack, no rim.

7
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,769
As soon as she was discharged,
though, boy, back to two packs a day.

8
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,934
I even saw her light
up under the arch once.

9
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,344
Intubated her three times this year,
high-dose steroids, home nebulizer.

10
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,417
Dragging her O-2
tank around with her.

11
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,913
- That's an H for you.
- What's the point...

12
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,355
if you're not gonna take a little
responsibility for your health?

13
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,290
I call this the "spirit killer."

14
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,663
- Is it supposed to rain again?
- That's an O for you.

15
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,035
I think it's gonna rain again.

16
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,873
We offer them a service. Whether
they take our advice or not is up to them.

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,640
She'd still be alive if
she'd listened to our advice.

18
00:01:55,816 --> 00:02:01,847
Hard as it was to deal with Blue Bertha,
it's still harder to be Blue Bertha.

19
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,715
- Not anymore.
- Dr. Carter...

20
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,126
there's a rig rolling
in with an MVA...

21
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,786
and I got a researcher
at the Art Institute. LOC.

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,558
- Greg Pratt? Mark Greene.
- How you doing?

23
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,635
- What did he do to deserve us?
- He just finished nine months at the VA.

24
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,826
Ouch.

25
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,906
- Three months of internship?
- Yes, I'll be a Resident in July.

26
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,235
- Here?
- Only if the match screws me, ha.

27
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,704
- Nice.
- No. But I'm ready to jump in.

28
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,848
Seen it all, one way or another.

29
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,143
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

30
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,751
You want us to grab that?

31
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,683
No, no, no. You've
got your museum lady.

32
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,756
I'll help you with
that crossover later.

33
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,257
- I think I got it.
- Uh-uh. You're palming it.

34
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,273
The idiot chucked the
ball right at my head.

35
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,886
There's a little blood.
You have a tiny perforation.

36
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,249
He popped my eardrum.

37
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,187
We see it all the time. Give
you some drops to help it heal.

38
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,851
- Some "clops"?
- Some drops. Cortisporin suspension.

39
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,622
Okay.

40
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,790
- Thanks. So what should you be?
- What?

41
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,766
- Frank's career-aptitude quiz.
- He hasn't cornered me yet.

42
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,304
- What is this?
- It's green tea with echinacea.

43
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,534
- Good for the immune system.
- Ahem, I'll stick to the normal sludge.

44
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,075
You have to get that yourself.

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,043
Would you rather pose
nude or be bit by a ferret?

46
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,046
- Uh, ferret.
- How's he doing?

47
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,708
Uh, somewhere between
rock star and lion-tamer.

48
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,286
- Did you cheat?
- Just a hint of Mick Jagger.

49
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,481
- And a whole lot of Siegfried and Roy?
- I have a patient.

50
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,627
Nursing orders, IV's,
medications go on that rack.

51
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,888
If you've got both clerk
and nursing orders...

52
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,929
Start with the clerk rack.

53
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,589
- Frank.
- Pratt.

54
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,464
- Got a first name?
- At the VA, they called me "Doctor."

55
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,229
Well, here we'll
call you "Junior."

56
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,738
Luka, can you take the chest
pain in 3 and the kid with the UTI?

57
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,002
- I already have three criticals.
- I'll take it.

58
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,409
Oh, no, that's okay. Carter,
uh, grab my rule-out appy.

59
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,243
And the hunt for
the lost condom.

60
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,851
- Sounds like fun.
- Abby, uh, your landlord called.

61
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,284
- My landlord?
- This the respiratory distress?

62
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,617
Norma Cruz, 46 years
old, choking episode...

63
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,157
severe multiple sclerosis.

64
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,317
- Abby?
- Carter.

65
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:59,432
- I'm good. Is this her base line?
- Not sure. The son should be here soon.

66
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,467
All the bay-station calls
come in over the MICN.

67
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,628
- Okay.
- Don't touch it, Junior.

68
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,966
Don't call me that.

69
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,041
My point was, it wouldn't hurt
us to lighten Dr. Greene's load.

70
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,471
- Right.
- Yeah, sure.

71
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,943
- Why? What's the problem?
- Uh, nothing.

72
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,947
- Can't get a line in.
- Chem panel, UA and a Foley.

73
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,348
- Is she moving air?
- Sounds like rhonchi at the bases.

74
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,216
This is Jeffrey, Mrs. Cruz's son.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.

75
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,722
Is your mother
normally this sick?

76
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,621
They said she'd be
dead a month ago.

77
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,228
He filled me in on her
history. I can take this.

78
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,888
Is it my birthday or something?

79
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,564
It's okay for me to
treat my own patient?

80
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:35,792
Sorry.

81
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,470
- Did your mother throw up?
- No, we never feed her by mouth.

82
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,699
Might be obstructed.

83
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,707
She have a "do not
resuscitate" order?

84
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,346
Her veins are shot. I'm
never gonna get a good line.

85
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,750
Jeffrey, your mother probably
has an aspiration pneumonia.

86
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,377
We can have a surgeon look at her, but
she'll need an IV to give her antibiotics.

87
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,489
- I need to wait for Linda.
- Who's Linda?

88
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,716
My sister, a lawyer.
She drew up the papers.

89
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,828
- Pressure's dropping, 80 systolic.
- I don't think we have time.

90
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,931
Do you want us to administer
drugs to push up her blood pressure?

91
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,330
- I can't. I need to wait.
- You gotta tell me.

92
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,671
Central-line kit now.

93
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,076
Willa Goment. Egyptologist from the
Art Institute. Syncopal episode at work.

94
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,237
She have any, uh, medical
conditions you know of?

95
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,678
- The curse of the mummy.
- The what?

96
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,182
I found her on the
floor of Nefertiti's tomb.

97
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,911
Guy in Curtain 1 is hurting.
Can I give him something?

98
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,116
- I'll take it.
- Do a quick exam and then call Uro.

99
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,521
- You got it. CARTER:
It's a penile fracture.

100
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,823
- Penile fracture?
- Mm-hm. Up to 100 of fentanyl.

101
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,931
- One, right?
- Yeah, it's over there.

102
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,433
I'm all over it.

103
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:47,233
- So no history of these episodes?
- Carter, he's going in the wrong room.

104
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,103
He'll figure it out.

105
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,803
Let me take a look.

106
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,381
You wanna unbuckle your belt
and pull your pants down, please?

107
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,747
- My pants? What?
- It's okay, I'm a doctor.

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,788
I'm still waiting
for some drops!

109
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,757
That's not gonna do
it. The pants, please.

110
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,834
- Are you sure this is necessary?
- Hmm.

111
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,062
Could you lean
back a little bit?

112
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,970
- Oh! Easy there.
- Were you having vigorous sex?

113
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,907
What? No, I was hit in the head!

114
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:30,578
Most sprains happen along the shaft,
but yours seems to be pretty minor.

115
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,514
Nothing personal.

116
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,884
Dude, I have an earache.

117
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,125
Well, then come down here, then.

118
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,392
Fine.

119
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,464
Don't worry, it's not always as simple
as it seems on the other end of the phone.

120
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:55,473
No, she's right. Mom told us she
wanted to die at home in her own bed.

121
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,168
I should never have
called the ambulance.

122
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:02,612
It's okay if you don't
want to let her go.

123
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,776
But that'll never stop.
I'll always want more.

124
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,355
Dr. Greene, her
sats are down to 86.

125
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,220
Decreased on the right.
Portable chest, page RT.

126
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,861
- Surgery see her?
- Dr. Corday said she'd evaluate...

127
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,557
- in four hours, depending on the DNR.
- Pressure's down to 70 systolic.

128
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,965
- What's happening?
- She reaspirated or collapsed a lung.

129
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,469
I thought you said
she was okay now.

130
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,837
Jeffrey, your mother's not gonna be
able to breathe much longer on her own.

131
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,502
- Do you want us to help her?
- Linda said not to.

132
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,875
Well, she's not here right
now. You have to tell us.

133
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,979
Save her.

134
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,985
- You sure?
- Just do it. Do everything.

135
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:45,592
Okay, rapid induction.
7.5 ET tube and a 3 Mac.

136
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,991
500 of Levo, 600 of clinda.

137
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:52,098
- Drugs are onboard.
- Bag her.

138
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,030
Sats are down to 80, Mark.

139
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,502
Let's go, let's go.
Give me the tube.

140
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,348
My fault. Sorry.

141
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,713
Abby, I need a stress
dose of 125 of Solu-Medrol.

142
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,478
Here.

143
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,486
I'll do it.

144
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,388
All right, give me
a straight blade.

145
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,694
Okay, get steroids.

146
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,971
Sensor, intuitor, judger.

147
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,936
I never thought of
myself as judger.

148
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,542
Yeah, right. Check judger, Frank.
- What?

149
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,701
Mind your own business.
This is my career.

150
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,712
- Won't work if you're not honest.
- Oh, who's judging now?

151
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,577
I've earned it.

152
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,548
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey.

153
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,153
Oh. Dr. Greene, your ex
called. She'll meet you at 1.

154
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,389
- I thought she said noon.
- She's running an hour late.

155
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,094
- What'd Weaver get?
- She ain't playing.

156
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,490
Give your best estimate.

157
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,497
Uh, "Subgroup P3:
Beauty pageant organizer...

158
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,567
or warden at a women's prison."

159
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,933
- Carter, where's your intern?
- Either Radiology or the cafeteria.

160
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,473
Find him.

161
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:16,178
- You all right?
- Early-onset arthritis. Coffee?

162
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,410
Maybe you should
ease up a little.

163
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,489
- I'm fine, Kerry.
- You do triage for awhile if you want...

164
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,591
or take a half-shift.

165
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,091
Working is good.

166
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,095
You need to make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

167
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,132
There's no need to overextend.
We can handle the load.

168
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,634
I just want to keep doing
what I've always done.

169
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,467
- You couldn't hold that ET tube.
- It's little spasms in my hand.

170
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,974
Is that from the vincristine?

171
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,676
A side effect of the treatment
or a progression of the disease.

172
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,344
You pick the poison.

173
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:00,287
Still, I'd like you to take
over Pratt's orientation.

174
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,189
Whatever you want, Kerry.

175
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,961
It might be best if you left
critical procedures to the rest of us.

176
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,233
You're pulling me out
of the Trauma Room?

177
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:18,009
Anybody else I'd send home. I trust
you to recognize your own limitations.

178
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,182
I take pills for my blood
pressure and my water.

179
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,480
Water in your legs or
to make you urinate?

180
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,352
Hytrin. It helped me pee for a
while, but it's worse now. Ow.

181
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,152
- That hurts?
- You bet.

182
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,490
- Put the med and back pain together.
- Alpha-1-blocker.

183
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:40,225
- And if you take too much?
- Hypotension, could make you dizzy.

184
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,996
- You had any falls, Mr. Seidel?
- Nope. Good question, though.

185
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,504
- Who's your primary physician?
- Allanson. Service said he went skiing...

186
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:48,937
I should come here.

187
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:53,170
Hypotensive at 140/90.
Pulse, 96. Oral temp, 98.6.

188
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,713
I've had two Foleys
since Christmas.

189
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,545
Has Dr. Allanson ever asked
you to use a catheter at home?

190
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,849
Last time, I twisted his arm for a blood
test. I still haven't gotten the results.

191
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,958
- What do you want to do, Dr. Pratt?
- Full set of labs.

192
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,425
Urine, culture, Accu-Chek, a
post-void residual and a rectal.

193
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:14,193
- Are you sure? My guy never does those.
- Dr. Greene, it's 1:00.

194
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,799
Add a PSA. I'll be
back in half an hour.

195
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,770
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks.

196
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,543
- Milk shake, huh? GREENE:
I decided to let myself go.

197
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,412
I can't stay long. I just
wanted to stop by and say hi.

198
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,453
- Did you see Rachel?
- We had breakfast. Her favorite.

199
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,488
Waffle House?

200
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,558
That'll score you some points.
- Mm-hm.

201
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,697
She couldn't stop crying, Mark.

202
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,562
It's a lot for a
teenager to take in.

203
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,998
It's a lot for anyone.

204
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,566
It's really that bad?

205
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,905
<i>Yeah.</i>

206
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,976
There are always
breakthroughs, right?

207
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,238
I mean, look what
happened last time.

208
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,015
I'm kind of beyond that.

209
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,451
We agreed Rachel would be with me July
and August. If you want to change that...

210
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,857
- No, that sounds like a good plan.
- She could stay with you longer.

211
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,999
I mean, she's gonna want
to spend time with you.

212
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,862
As much time as possible.

213
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,434
Thanks.

214
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,941
I'm sorry, Mark.

215
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,308
I'm sorry we had
such a rough go.

216
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,615
Maybe if I hadn't switched
jobs or been more patient...

217
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,450
We made choices, Jen.

218
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,026
Both of us.

219
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,535
We weren't so bad
together, were we?

220
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,880
I wouldn't change a thing.

221
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,412
None of it.

222
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,325
Okay. So I gotta get to Midway.

223
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,158
Wait. I updated my
will last year, but...

224
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,665
Look at it out there. It's
gonna take me hours.

225
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,404
I want to start a college fund.

226
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:39,068
Well, you'll drop Rachel off in
St. Louis in July. We can talk then.

227
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,033
I don't know if I'll
be able to make that.

228
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:43,080
Yes, you will.

229
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,718
I want to set something
aside for her wedding, too.

230
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,815
July, okay? Let's
not do this. Not today.

231
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,260
I don't know if there'll
be another time.

232
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,364
She's my daughter. I want to
make sure that she's taken care of.

233
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,693
- She will be.
- Jen...

234
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,530
I'll see you in St. Louis.

235
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,994
- Heads. Heads up.
- Slow down. Hey!

236
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,163
- Enrique, the new orderly.
- He's gonna kill someone.

237
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,842
He keeps the rooms clear.

238
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,841
- So what did he want?
- Who?

239
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,242
Uh, your landlord?

240
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,908
Oh, yeah. Uh, Brian, um, he
moved back to Idaho a few days ago.

241
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,782
- And he took all his stuff with him.
- So you have your place back?

242
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,483
- He offered it to me. Yeah.
- Good, good.

243
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,289
- I mean, all my stuff's there, so...
- It'll be nice to sleep in a bed again.

244
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,159
- Yeah, ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.

245
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,357
But, um...

246
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,196
Thanks for the hospitality.

247
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:15,000
Except, of course, for that
Croatian lamb gruel stuff. Ha-ha.

248
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:19,612
- It's not gruel. It's called <i>jujenca juha.</i>
- It's a gastrointestinal adventure.

249
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:26,015
Take your time. I mean, if you want
to make sure that he is gone for good.

250
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,347
I've mooched off you long enough.
- Dr. Greene!

251
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,046
Okay, you need to sit still.

252
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,692
Mr. Ervin, how is
the junk business?

253
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:36,626
- I'm having some trouble with my feet.
- But he refuses to take off his shoes.

254
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,698
- I don't know her.
- Dr. Chen. She's very capable.

255
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,892
- She touched my cart.
- Don't touch AI's cart.

256
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,061
- I moved it 2 feet.
- Okay, meet Dr. Pratt.

257
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,536
- Hello.
- Hey.

258
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,231
What's the trouble?

259
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,503
- The ghouls put spikes in my sneakers.
- The ghouls?

260
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,477
The ones from the burned jeep
or the ones that roam rooftops?

261
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,310
There are new ghouls.

262
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,308
Everywhere.

263
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,680
Um.

264
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,981
- Psych consult.
- Screw you, Junior.

265
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,058
Take it easy, Al. Take off your
shoes so we can look, okay?

266
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,387
Okay.

267
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,998
Let Dr. Chen help you.
I'll be back in a minute.

268
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,669
It's not a good idea to openly
show disdain for our frequent flyers.

269
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,203
He sees ghouls. What's
wrong with a Psych consult?

270
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,067
A little help?

271
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,069
All right, go back
in there. Try it again.

272
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,540
- Freddy Harrison. Looks about 30.
- He's 28.

273
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,737
- No, I'll hang with you.
- Grab his old chart and get a history.

274
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,578
Carter said I should get my hands dirty.
- Go.

275
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,282
- Go.
- Found down an alley...

276
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,352
with agonal respiration
and pinpoint pupils.

277
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,888
- You shooting up?
- We're in rehab. He's clean.

278
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,494
- Hey, Dr. Greene, I got this.
- I'm already on it. One, two, three.

279
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,425
Gave 2 of Narcan down
the ET with no response.

280
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,896
- I'll cover this.
- You've listened to Weaver...

281
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,629
now back off. CBC, chem panel,
tox screen, Foley and a portable chest.

282
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,296
- You're ruining his clothes.
- We're trying to help him.

283
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,476
Okay, step back.
You're in the way.

284
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,373
- Whoa. Narcan is working.
- You want some Ativan?

285
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,377
And some Pavulon.
Check the ET tube.

286
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,539
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Freddy.

287
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,981
- Oh, Freddy, lie back down.
- Freddy, you're okay.

288
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,554
- I thought you was dead.
- I want my wallet. Give me my wallet.

289
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,658
- We need to take care of you.
- Don't touch me. I want my wallet.

290
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,659
Maybe it fell in the parking lot.
- Abby, call Security.

291
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,093
He wants his stuff. You
people, you're crooks.

292
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,961
- You know you are. GREENE:
Carter, I need your help.

293
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,396
You know you stole his things.

294
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,332
Freddy, come back.
You're bleeding.

295
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,438
- Ung. Oh, God!
- I'm sorry.

296
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,131
Son of a bitch!

297
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,970
- It was an accident.
- Hey, hey, break it up.

298
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,736
- You okay? GUARD:
Give me a hand here.

299
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:36,007
- My baby's coming out!
- Just try and breathe slowly. Don't push.

300
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,344
- Oh, God! GREENE: Keep
breathing. Keep breathing.

301
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,417
Get the gurney. CBC,
Chem-7. Get an ultrasound.

302
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,356
- Looks like I missed the fun.
- Chest is clear.

303
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,237
- She break her water?
- I don't know.

304
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,827
Set up the SonoSite.

305
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,089
- Why is the floor wet?
- Because this window leaks.

306
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,700
- Diffusely tender with guarding.
- Did they sedate that maniac?

307
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,996
Didn't have to. He passed
out and smashed his face.

308
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,435
- Pressure's only 80.
- Oh, man. Okay.

309
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,440
Uh, let's type and cross for
four. And get some O-neg.

310
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,373
It hurts! It hurts!

311
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,513
- How far along are you?
- What?

312
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,078
- When are you due?
- I don't know.

313
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:15,288
- She's having contractions.
- Okay, get a fetal monitor.

314
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,984
- How big?
- It looks like about 28 weeks.

315
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,220
Okay, terbutaline, .25,
sub-Q. And mix the mag.

316
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:27,959
No evidence of previa. Call OB. She may
need a crash section if she's abrupting.

317
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,394
Pulse ox, 85.

318
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,903
- No, bag him.
- Midface fractures?

319
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,974
I can't see the cords. You
want to give this a shot?

320
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,409
Set up the fiberoptic scope
and prep the neck for a crike.

321
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,981
She's crowning. It's coming now.

322
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,917
- Don't push. Just breathe.
- I can't! I can't stop!

323
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,316
Don't push.

324
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,752
Okay. Bulb suction, clamp.

325
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,159
Call the NICU.

326
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,334
2.5 ET tube.

327
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,241
- And draw up .02 of epi.
- Is that my baby?

328
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,270
Come on, breathe, little guy.

329
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,575
- Why isn't he breathing?
- He's very sick.

330
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,351
I want to see my baby.

331
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,785
Bag him.

332
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,423
Pulse is 50. Starting
compressions.

333
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,088
My beautiful boy.

334
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,559
What's the Apgar?

335
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,962
One for heart rate, zero
for color, respirations.

336
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,159
- Let me go see my baby!
- Not right now.

337
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:42,304
- Shane, what kind of drugs you using?
- I'm not.

338
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,637
If you want us to help your baby,
you have to tell us if you're using heroin.

339
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,178
I don't do that anymore.

340
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,645
- Cocaine? Crack?
- No, nothing.

341
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,648
Damn it, there's
blood in the airway!

342
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,686
Baby's pinking up.
Heart rate's 120.

343
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,093
Start working on
the umbilical line.

344
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,135
You all right?

345
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,076
No, too much
blood. I can't get this.

346
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,267
He's bradying down.

347
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,675
- All right, let's do the crike.
- Amp of atropine.

348
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,179
He needs an airway unless
you want to give a shot.

349
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:27,286
Let me just take a quick
look, and then you can cut.

350
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,848
- I thought you were right-handed.
- I'm a switch hitter.

351
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,859
I need you to advance
the tube when I say so.

352
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,493
- Ready?
- Here we go.

353
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,196
- Run of five.
- Hundred of lidocaine.

354
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,706
- Damn it.
- Let's do the crike.

355
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,606
No, no, no, here we go. There,
there. Go. Advance the tube, Carter.

356
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,371
Go, go, go, go.

357
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,281
Good breath sounds.

358
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,357
- Sats are coming up.
- That's nice.

359
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,618
- Lucky.
- Very nice.

360
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,729
Let's get a post-intubation
film, head and facial CT to follow.

361
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,832
Five-minute Apgar is six.
- Better.

362
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,128
Dr. Greene, mom's tox screen.

363
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:20,398
Shane, we're taking your baby
up to the Intensive Care Unit.

364
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,405
- I want to stay with him.
- Take him up.

365
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:26,706
- No, you're stealing my baby.
- Shane, let us take care of him.

366
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:30,316
You'll keep him. You won't
bring him back. I love him!

367
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,417
You almost killed him.

368
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,812
- That's not what I wanted.
- Your urine's positive for opiates.

369
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,083
You shoot up. You've
never been to a doctor.

370
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,157
- But I was going to.
- After seven months?

371
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,421
Are you too strung-out
to know you're pregnant?

372
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:47,089
- Dr. Greene?
- I've been stressed out.

373
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,859
Well, that explains why
you've been using cocaine too.

374
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,494
Don't tell me you haven't been
drinking. Your blood-alcohol level is 54.

375
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,836
- I had a beer last night.
- You've been lying to us.

376
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,275
- I want to see my baby!
- You want to see him? There he is. Look.

377
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,938
Premature. A third of the
weight of what he should be.

378
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,778
If he's lucky enough not to have
brain damage from the coke...

379
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,216
he's still gonna suffer from
fetal alcohol syndrome...

380
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,289
- No! Please, stop it!
- Developmental delays.

381
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,017
Next time you see him he's
not gonna look any better...

382
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,924
because he's gonna be
suffering from heroin withdrawal.

383
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,224
Just stop it!

384
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,193
Congratulations,
you're a mother.

385
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:28,131
- Can you take the baby up?
- Yeah.

386
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,238
You a basketball fan?

387
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,349
- I saw you playing from my window.
- Try and hit it the first time, Marni.

388
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:42,011
- Doctors are the worst patients.
- So I hear.

389
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,282
I took my grandson to see
his first Bulls game last week.

390
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,758
They're not what
they used to be.

391
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,388
He fell asleep at halftime,
but I think he enjoyed it.

392
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:57,900
That's okay. Their guards
fall asleep all the time.

393
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:02,399
- We'll let that infuse.
- Twenty minutes, I know.

394
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,343
It's the ER on line two.
- Dr. Weaver?

395
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,642
Someone named Pratt.

396
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,676
Pratt, I'm with a patient
right now. I can't talk.

397
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,953
- What? PRATT:
<i>He's bradying down.</i>

398
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,786
<i>- I don't know what's happened.</i>
- I'll be right there.

399
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,953
Ahem, Marni, can you send
someone down with the vincristine?

400
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,154
- Dr. Greene.
- Marni.

401
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,098
- We don't do house calls.
- I am not going home.

402
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,408
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thanks.

403
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,108
What happened?

404
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,843
He barfed on Pratt's
shoes and passed out.

405
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,455
- Dr. Greene, where were you?
- We didn't want to call you...

406
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:24,988
but he wouldn't calm down.

407
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,616
- Oops. Oh, here you go.
- Sorry.

408
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,330
- Don't go too far.
- Thanks.

409
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,523
- What's that for?
- Reduce my blood alcohol.

410
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,827
- No luck with the IV.
- Right saphenous.

411
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,062
- What?
- It's the only one that's not sclerosed.

412
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:42,174
You want to get it, Carter?
- No, Pratt's got it.

413
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,500
Accu-Chek's through the roof.

414
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:50,240
- Did you take your insulin, Al?
- There's so much to remember.

415
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:54,346
- He's diabetic?
- It's news to me. Line's in.

416
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,183
It shouldn't be news to you.
Did you get a good history?

417
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,916
I have a glorious history.

418
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:03,221
- I told you to get his old chart.
- So what was that, like a test?

419
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,526
Make sure he flushes all three
lumens. Don't give him an air embolus.

420
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,563
CBC, Chem-21 and a urine.
- He's good.

421
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,205
Sats are 90, pulse
is 110. Dr. Greene?

422
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:18,534
Add a hemoglobin, A1C, serum
ketones, blood cultures and 12-lead.

423
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,576
Liter up, good 18
in the right foot.

424
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,274
Add 40 of K in the liter,
intubation tray, 8-0 ET tube.

425
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:27,043
- Why? What's that for?
- Sats are dropping.

426
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,983
Come on, Al, breathe.

427
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,384
Carter, get ready to bag him.

428
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,951
- Do the Sellick.
- The what?

429
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,289
The Sellick. Give me your hand.

430
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,405
Okay. Okay.

431
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,565
When his blood sugar's over
700, sometimes he stops breathing.

432
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,073
Thanks for mentioning that.

433
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:56,045
Give him 10 of regular, IV push.
Start him on 8 units per hour. Dr. Pratt.

434
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,078
Dr. Greene.

435
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,816
Thanks.

436
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,424
- You could've told me he was diabetic.
- I said to work him up.

437
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,459
I was looking for
chronic athlete's foot.

438
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,291
You missed the DKA because
you didn't follow instructions.

439
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,265
- It didn't seem necessary.
- That assessment is up to me. Okay?

440
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,631
You do the learning,
I'll do the teaching.

441
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,670
- Do I seem like a punk to you?
- No.

442
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,603
Then stop trying
to treat me like one.

443
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,300
I'm sure that you think that
you're ready for anything.

444
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,345
Wait. Is this the one about
the old guy and the young guy?

445
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:32,746
- Because, see, I've heard it all before.
- There's a door there that goes outside.

446
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:36,355
If you don't like the way
I'm doing this, keep walking.

447
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,356
- He's a good doctor.
- He's a burnout if I ever saw one.

448
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,656
- I learned a lot from him.
- If I had my call, I'd stick with you.

449
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,130
- You don't.
- You saw him in there.

450
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,860
I just can't figure out
what's going on with this guy.

451
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,202
A tumor.

452
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,307
- What?
- He has a brain tumor.

453
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,536
An inoperable GBM that's recurred.
That's what's going on with him.

454
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,704
- That's what the IV's for.
- He's in his second cycle of chemo.

455
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,146
- And he's still working?
- Everything okay?

456
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,047
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Pratt was just saying...

457
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,211
how much he's
benefiting from Dr. Greene.

458
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,687
He's a good teacher.

459
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,656
You could start feeding me
this information a little earlier.

460
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,091
- Labs back for Seidel.
- Thanks.

461
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,497
His PSA's higher
than his Alk Phos.

462
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,032
Six hundred? Did
you call his doctor?

463
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,171
Left three messages on his
service before I got the cell number.

464
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,377
- Son of a bitch. PRATT:
What do you think? He knew?

465
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,007
He should have.

466
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,006
This guy shouldn't
have to find out...

467
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,838
from doctors he's
never met in the ER.

468
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,709
Hey, listen, um, in med
school, uh, I was a hotshot.

469
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,579
And I forgot I'm not one
here. Well, not yet at least.

470
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,913
Like I said, no rush.

471
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,716
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. Yeah, is your father there?

472
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,860
Uh, this is Dr. Greene
from the County ER.

473
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,358
<i>Hold on.</i>

474
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:53,727
Listen, um, I didn't mean
any disrespect earlier.

475
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,532
- Someone told you I'm dying.
<i>- Dr. Greene, is it?</i>

476
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:00,901
- Yeah.
<i>- Call my office. I'm not taking any calls.</i>

477
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:05,704
I understand you're on vacation.
Your patient's PSA set a record high.

478
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,436
<i>Oh, well, how can I be of help?</i>

479
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:10,514
Well, for starters, when was
the last time you examined him?

480
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,446
<i>- About two years, I'd say.</i>
- Two years?

481
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:17,248
<i>- Have you made a diagnosis?</i>
- In fact, yes. Metastatic prostate cancer.

482
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,357
<i>Really? I never
saw any indication.</i>

483
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:24,189
Well, the huge irregular mass on his
enlarged prostate may have been a clue.

484
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,855
You want me to put
him on the phone?

485
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:30,594
Why don't you put down your hot cocoa,
and get your ass on a plane to Chicago...

486
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,535
He hung up.

487
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,265
- Very persuasive.
- I try.

488
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,075
Should we tell him?

489
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:41,573
Uh, let him sleep.
Call Urology for a bed.

490
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,706
I panicked.

491
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,045
Okay? You weren't here,
and I didn't know what to do.

492
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,121
You knew this wasn't what she wanted.
- You're extubating?

493
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,123
You should have never
intubated her in the first place.

494
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,557
- What about the obstructions?
- It's a mild ileus.

495
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,720
I don't care what it is. I have
durable power of attorney.

496
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,664
And we want to take our mother
home now. Get that line out of her.

497
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,269
You may wanna leave that
in, in case she needs fluid.

498
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,305
Don't you get it?
She wants to die.

499
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:13,309
You people can't accept
that. It's like a defeat to you.

500
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,976
Do you have the DNR?

501
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,592
Okay.

502
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,627
Pull it.

503
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,541
Just at the bed right around the corner.
- All right.

504
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:54,151
What's this about?

505
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,689
I got called down from Oncology, so
the nurse is here with my vincristine.

506
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:04,259
- You sure you're feeling all right?
- Wish people would stop asking me that.

507
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,129
Could you unplug
her and let them go?

508
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,826
Yeah, sure.

509
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,570
Dr. Greene, I want my cart.

510
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:18,972
What? ERVIN: They
threw my cart outside.

511
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,511
- Ready?
- Sure.

512
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,015
I want my cart. I
always have it with me.

513
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,882
It's okay, Al. I'm right here.
Everything's gonna be all right.

514
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,854
I almost had to call an
Oncology staff meeting.

515
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,422
They weren't crazy about
my doing this down here.

516
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:39,361
Please, I want my cart.

517
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,228
Give me my cart!

518
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,030
These new needle-less
systems are a pain.

519
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,367
Give me my cart.

520
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:56,037
You know what? I'm not doing this.
- I can't come back.

521
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,275
You don't have to. I'm done.
- Please!

522
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,545
- Dr. Greene...
- I want my cart.

523
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,748
Al, let me help
you find your cart.

524
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,418
Thank you. Thank you.

525
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,689
Aspergilloma is what people
used to superstitiously take...

526
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,698
as the curse of the mummy.

527
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:20,066
I'll never hear the end of
this at work. How did I get it?

528
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,031
You went to Egypt recently
on an excavation, right?

529
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:27,813
Pulmonology will bronch
her. Give her 200 of itra...

530
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:35,210
Itraconazole, BID, will
help with the oral steroids.

531
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:39,722
- I work too much, that's why I'm sick.
- You'll be okay soon.

532
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,122
You know that song,
"Don't it always seem to go...

533
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,729
that you don't know
what you got till it's gone?"

534
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,388
- Joni Mitchell.
- Story of my life.

535
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,762
I hate that song.

536
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,230
Mark.

537
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,234
I spoke with Oncology. I
told them you'd be up soon.

538
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:03,143
- You shouldn't have.
- They're holding a room for you.

539
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,443
I'm finished. I've had enough.

540
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,143
You can go up now,
and I'll drive you home.

541
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,583
Elizabeth.

542
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:14,021
This isn't something that you decide
by yourself on the spur of the moment.

543
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:17,424
This might be the last
important decision I get to make.

544
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,589
You haven't given it time
to work, Mark. Please.

545
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,929
I dropped an ET tube today. I
couldn't wrap my thumb around it.

546
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,934
That doesn't mean the
chemo's not working.

547
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,437
It's a game, Elizabeth.
I don't wanna play.

548
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:32,942
Look, it's only the second cycle.
This treatment could prolong your life.

549
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,013
Maybe. For a couple of months.

550
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,615
Well, then give yourself that
time. Give it to me and Ella.

551
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:47,782
Give it to Rachel. Who
knows what might happen?

552
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,053
We see patients
here every day...

553
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,164
who are told that they should
have been dead long ago.

554
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,495
I need to be realistic.

555
00:33:56,368 --> 00:34:01,466
- You mean give up.
- It's not giving up. It's making a choice.

556
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:08,044
I'd rather have two good months
than twice that chained to meds...

557
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:13,208
and needles and IV
stands, stuck in a bed...

558
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:18,316
sitting next to other clock-watchers,
being prodded and small-talked to...

559
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:24,361
by doctors and nurses, all of
them with that look in their eye...

560
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,693
like you're already gone.

561
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,730
I don't want to
end it like that.

562
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:37,169
Look, we can look into
some new regimens.

563
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:42,508
We can find some alternative
therapies that we haven't heard about.

564
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,112
Uh, Mr. Seidel is awake.

565
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,010
I'll be right there.

566
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,379
Please?

567
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,754
There's no alternative.

568
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,863
Just dying the way I've lived.

569
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,435
I'll see you at home.

570
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,207
I love you.

571
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,056
- You ready?
- I can do it.

572
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,759
- Not the easiest news to give someone.
- I know the job.

573
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,139
Mr. Seidel.

574
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:47,075
My old lady's waiting with my
daughter, so can we get this over with?

575
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,415
Um, your presentation is consistent
with metastatic cancer of the prostate.

576
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,077
Cancer?

577
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,950
Are you sure? Maybe
you got it wrong.

578
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,319
Allanson never said
anything about cancer.

579
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,518
He may have overlooked it.

580
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,960
He always acted like I
was a hypochondriac.

581
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,423
He should have caught it.

582
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,434
Maybe we should call your
wife before we explain everything.

583
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:14,300
Tell me, is it bad?

584
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,941
Possibly, it could be.

585
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:22,604
What? Do I need, uh, chemotherapy
or an operation or what?

586
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,317
I mean, it's not like
I'm gonna die, right?

587
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,957
I could die?

588
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:41,455
We need to admit you for tests. The
cancer appears to be very advanced.

589
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,464
You need to prepare
yourself for the worst.

590
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,441
I know what a shock this is...

591
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,839
and what must be going
through your mind right now.

592
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,874
You can't.

593
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,140
Yeah, I can.

594
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,352
I'll call his family.

595
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,840
- Go in and sit with him.
- What did you say to him?

596
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,574
Wasn't anything I learned
from being a doctor.

597
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,346
No, no, no, we need
to keep that in. Okay?

598
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,013
- I want to go.
- It's wet out there. It's raining.

599
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,524
- It stopped. I don't want to be here.
- Me either.

600
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:46,529
- When can you get him upstairs?
- Oh, um, I'll call the Telemetry Unit.

601
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,860
- Last serum ketones?
- Still positive.

602
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,127
- Urine?
- 200 cc's in the last hour.

603
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,965
I'll take it out. You
know I know how.

604
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:58,736
Al, it's gonna become harder for
you to be able to take care of yourself.

605
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,805
Do you have any
family you can go to?

606
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,380
No. There's nobody.

607
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:07,542
- Then let me admit you.
- You know I don't like this place.

608
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,950
I don't belong here.

609
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:15,788
Whatever's going to happen,
I want it to happen outside.

610
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,959
Please.

611
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,325
Okay.

612
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,096
It'll be over soon.

613
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:30,902
- Right?
- Yeah, it will.

614
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,307
How much longer
do I have to sit here?

615
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,311
Ms. Raskin, it's
been a long time.

616
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,575
The service isn't
what it used to be.

617
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,085
- What's the trouble?
- I have this hangnail, it is very painful.

618
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,122
I have a brain tumor,
and it's inoperable.

619
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,249
- What?
- I win.

620
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,519
Excuse me.

621
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:53,096
Excuse me, can somebody
please see my daughter?

622
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,099
A nurse will be right with you.

623
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,498
I've been here
for over two hours.

624
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,704
- I'm Dr. Greene.
- Hi, doctor.

625
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:05,776
- No, it'll hurt, Daddy.
- Oh, what will hurt?

626
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,970
Katie's class mythology project.

627
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:10,877
Why they let kids play with
wooden spears, I'll never know.

628
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,984
I like your outfit. Can
I put you up here?

629
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,015
- There.
- It hurts.

630
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,714
I know. I'll be gentle.

631
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,486
It's up under the nail. She
won't even let me near it.

632
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,228
Can I look?

633
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:31,301
- I don't want a shot.
- No, no, no. No shots. I promise.

634
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,661
Let's play a game.

635
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,001
- Close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

636
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,978
- What do you see?
- The sky.

637
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,639
- What's up there?
- Orion's Belt.

638
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,381
- Orion's?
- He couldn't beat the scorpion.

639
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,991
- So he jumped into the sea.
- Really?

640
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,650
Artemis put him in the sky,
where the scorpion never gets him.

641
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,696
I didn't know that.

642
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:05,330
- There. That didn't hurt, did it?
- Is it over?

643
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,670
It's all done.

644
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,004
- Thank you, Katie.
- What did I do?

645
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,181
You just became
my very last patient.

646
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,347
- Your shift over?
- Yeah.

647
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,352
Thank you.

648
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,192
Haleh, can you give that
hangnail lady a cast shoe...

649
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,692
sign her out and tell
her to never come back?

650
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,058
If you say so.

651
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,631
Dr. Greene, I set up Seidel for the
biopsy, and his family's on the way in.

652
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,068
Okay.

653
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,438
Hey, I just wanted to say, uh,
you know, I learned a lot today.

654
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,876
Good. Come back tomorrow.

655
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,314
How's Pratt doing?

656
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,121
A little eager, a little cocky.

657
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,493
He should fit right in.

658
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:07,632
Think he'd want to take
on some extra shifts?

659
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,896
Pretty safe bet.

660
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,132
What about you?

661
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,273
Me?

662
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,811
How many shifts should I
put you down for next month?

663
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,489
Never let your work
become your life, Kerry.

664
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,924
Live a little.

665
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,594
No rest for the weary, Carter.

666
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:49,138
I've been on since 4 a.m., ahem.

667
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:52,106
- You leaving early?
- Not early enough.

668
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,178
Fisher in the hall's an
alcoholic. Knocked himself out.

669
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,942
Check a head CT and road-test
him before you let him go.

670
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,551
- Withdrawal?
- Just your usual midweek party.

671
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,561
Chakarova has hives.
Got prednisone, Benadryl.

672
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,996
Feeling better. Watch
her for half an hour.

673
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,329
Send her on her
way. Dispo's written.

674
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,669
- Anybody actually sick?
- Just the doctor.

675
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,877
Hey, did you see the guy in 3?

676
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,885
Pacio, 56-year-old, chest pain.
Ruled out going to Medicine.

677
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,649
Got aspirin, beta-blockers,
heparin and an Ace.

678
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:41,383
28-year-old girl. LOC. Fell
through a plate-glass window.

679
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,050
Just keep pressure
on that dressing.

680
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,162
Bleeder in the left
lung is the worst.

681
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,991
Good night, Dr. Greene.

682
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,600
- BP, 100/70.
- Bye.

683
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,869
So EKG for Pacio?

684
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:05,346
Flip T's in lateral
leads. X-ray's clear.

685
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,682
Check his troponin and
repeat EKG in 10 minutes.

686
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,351
- It stopped raining.
- Yeah.

687
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:17,350
Clear sky. I'm out of here.

688
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,463
You on tomorrow?

689
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,294
Your ball needs air.

690
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,529
It's not my ball.

691
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,207
You set the tone, Carter.

692
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,900
What?

693
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,273
Work on your jump shot.
