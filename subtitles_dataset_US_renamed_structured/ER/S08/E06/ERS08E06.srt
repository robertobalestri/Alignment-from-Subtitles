1
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,440
One more shot! One more
shot! Come on! Dribble!

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,976
Come on, come on, come on.

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,874
Five, four, three, two, one!

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,244
Slam-dunk.

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,417
We're going to see
Joanie on campus.

6
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,919
Oh, yeah? That's good.

7
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,557
I'm glad to see you getting out.

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,489
- What time you getting him?
- Roger will pick him up at 4:30.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,457
Roger? BENTON: Yeah.

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,463
- Why?
- His cousin's having a birthday party.

11
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,397
- His cousin on Carla's side?
- No, on Roger's.

12
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,332
So it's not his real cousin.

13
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,938
Well, anyway, he
wanted him there. So...

14
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,599
- So he's setting the schedule now?
- Jackie, we've already had this argument.

15
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,245
It's important to
the guy, all right?

16
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,614
- I'm sure he misses Reece.
- More importantly, Reece misses him.

17
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:53,242
But you're just confusing him.
Roger isn't part of his family anymore.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,824
Ah, Jackie, I'm just giving him time.
That's something you should understand.

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,093
I didn't mean, uh... Jackie.

20
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,662
Say bye-bye to Daddy.

21
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,101
That's right.

22
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,668
I'll have him ready at 4:30.

23
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,668
Keep her pressure above 90.
When did she spike the fever?

24
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,677
- Dad, how do you program numbers?
- Read the instructions.

25
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,476
When was her last dose
of imipenem? Well, find out.

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,882
- Pretty big hammer for post-op fever.
- Her kidneys are shutting down.

27
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,716
I'm missing algebra, you know.

28
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,687
Just testing.

29
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,658
So, Rachel, Katherine
has to leave at 5:00.

30
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,397
- Yeah? GREENE: So
Ella should nap until 6:30.

31
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,662
But if she wakes up crying, give her 4
ounces of breast milk from the fridge.

32
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,309
- You put it in the Avent warmer and...
- For two minutes on low. I know.

33
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,877
Yeah. Yeah. Who's
the ID fellow on call?

34
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,506
What?

35
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,151
- You're sparkling.
- So?

36
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,719
- You starting a trend?
- Dad, everyone wears glitter.

37
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,253
I'm pulling up right now.

38
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,982
Mix some dopamine. I'll
be there in five minutes.

39
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,820
Okay.

40
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,056
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,195
Sorry about the detour, Rachel.

42
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,902
Which entrance?

43
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,339
- What?
- Your school. North or south?

44
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,909
Oh, um...

45
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,910
How about a few blocks away?

46
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,509
- I thought you were late.
- I am, but...

47
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,676
Just don't wanna be
seen with the old man?

48
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,254
No, it's just, you
know, the van.

49
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,692
- I'm not even breaking a sweat.
- Aerobic activity is a secondary benefit.

50
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,059
Primary effects are
strength and balance.

51
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,461
Good Warriors.

52
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,468
Now down to Cat and Cow.

53
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,233
This is doing
nothing for my back.

54
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,137
Did you try some Tylenol? - No.

55
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,709
- Take some. CARTER:
I avoid pain medication.

56
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:01,872
If you're gonna be macho about
pain, then you can't whine about it.

57
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,644
Downward-Facing Dog.

58
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:11,254
- How's your grandma?
- Her doctor did an MRI, MRA...

59
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,395
stress echo, carotids.
Everything's fine.

60
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,725
- He did all that in one day?
- It's rich-lady service.

61
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,458
She's been very smug
about the whole thing.

62
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,661
Straighten your legs and exhale.

63
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,598
- Good.
- I got singled out.

64
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,142
- If it's too hard, don't push it.
- No. It's no problem.

65
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,076
So, what's the deal
with you and the nurse?

66
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,011
Nurse? LEWIS: Abby.

67
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,446
What do you mean?

68
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,086
It just seems like
there's something there.

69
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,085
We're friends.

70
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:47,451
- You're shaking.
- I know. I'm going back to Cow.

71
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,590
It's actually kind of
undefined with Abby.

72
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,929
- She just broke up with Luka.
- I get it.

73
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,937
- What?
- You don't want to be the rebound guy.

74
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,336
Not exactly. TERRY: Good.

75
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,641
Downward-Facing Dog now,
with your left leg extended in the air.

76
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,313
This is sadistic.

77
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,454
Pretend like you're
playing Twister.

78
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,054
- Uh-oh.
- Are you breathing?

79
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,556
Are you seeing the colors?
- Oh, boy.

80
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,027
Carter? Carter!

81
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,580
I've got three people heaving
and we're out of emesis basins.

82
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,845
Central Supply is
slow today. New runner.

83
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,352
What happened to the old one?

84
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,683
Nurses complained about
not having emesis basins.

85
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,450
County General on
Bravo 1. Go ahead.

86
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,288
I think I twisted my knee
doing that damn Locust position.

87
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,827
It's "Lotus," like the flower.

88
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,591
That explains why it hurts. I
was doing the Grasshopper.

89
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,428
Ha, I give up.

90
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,502
Good morning.

91
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,195
- Is it raining?
- Oh, no.

92
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,602
Susan dragged me
to this torture session.

93
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,472
We got an apartment fire. One major,
four minors. Mostly smoke inhalation.

94
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,340
- Uh, ETA's 10 to 15.
- Page the Burn Unit.

95
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,540
Tell the fellow we got one sick player.
Can you clear the Trauma rooms?

96
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,945
Well, they're gonna
have to puke on the floor.

97
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,450
- There she is.
- Who?

98
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,351
- Central Supply.
- Oh. Hey.

99
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,349
Excuse me. We're
completely out...

100
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,017
of emesis basins, and I
need at least 10 liters of...

101
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,060
- Hi.
- Hi, Abby.

102
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,630
- Luka got me a job.
- Oh, he did?

103
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:12,068
Yes. He knew I was out of work, so he
called me last week about this opening.

104
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,868
- It was so nice of him.
- He's... He's nice.

105
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,203
Yeah.

106
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,074
- Do you know where these go?
- Yeah. The linen closet.

107
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,476
- It's down the hall, to the left.
- Thank you.

108
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,709
And, uh, oh, I'm sorry,
do you need something?

109
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,912
I'll get the Ringer's. Could you
bring down some emesis basins?

110
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,681
Oh, what are those?

111
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,087
Barf bins.

112
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,221
- Vomit buckets.
- Oh.

113
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,094
Systolic BP's
70. Febrile to 104.

114
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,234
Bolus a liter of saline and
change all the IV and central lines.

115
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,330
But you... You
did that yesterday.

116
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,803
We need to do it again, in case
they're the source of the infection.

117
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,241
I've never seen her so bad.
- It's reversible.

118
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,211
But we will need to start her on cardiac
medication and dialysis immediately.

119
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,745
Put her on a machine?

120
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,375
Her kidneys aren't removing the toxins
from the bloodstream as they should.

121
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,015
- No, no. If this is her time...
- It's not. Not yet.

122
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,684
Jacy, start the dopamine and
titrate to a systolic above 90.

123
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,228
She's a DNR, you know.

124
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,602
She never wanted to end
up the way my dad did.

125
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,203
I understand.

126
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,432
She always said, "Push me over a
cliff before you put me on any tubes!"

127
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,134
April, her kidney
failure is temporary.

128
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,472
She could bounce back
after a few treatments.

129
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,146
It's worth trying.

130
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,280
Page the nephrologist
and the dialysis nurse.

131
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,982
- You really want to do that?
- Yes. Now.

132
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,160
The fire was right
outside our door.

133
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,596
- Eden was choking.
- She was holding her daughter.

134
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,258
- Broke the fall.
- And my legs.

135
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,837
Deformity in the right
tib-fib. Left femur looks open.

136
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,998
- Surgery and Ortho?
- Took your daughter in. She'll be okay.

137
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,610
- I'm sorry. You wanted me to wait.
- Everyone's safe.

138
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,473
- Here. Lean on me.
- I'm good.

139
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,114
That ankle doesn't look so good.

140
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,807
- I don't wanna crush you.
- It's okay. I'm used to it.

141
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,419
- How is it so far?
- Everyone's been very friendly.

142
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,747
Yeah, we like her.

143
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,356
- Has someone showed you around?
- I keep getting lost.

144
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,685
Yeah. Don't be
afraid to ask for help.

145
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,521
- I need some help.
- Oh, sorry.

146
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,255
- Want to have lunch?
- But you're busy.

147
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,865
No, 1:30. Find me.

148
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,662
I was halfway up the ladder,
and she panicked and jumped.

149
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,429
I think I would panic too.

150
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,371
- Can you bear weight on it at all?
- I'm fine. Just get me a bag of ice.

151
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,943
- You've got some burns too.
- Yeah. Occupational hazard.

152
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,640
Okay, no blistering.
Skin's intact.

153
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,876
Polysporin, then
dress with Kerlix.

154
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,352
- We'll probably need a splint for him.
- Uh, we're out of fiberglass.

155
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,855
I'm gonna have to
call Central Supply.

156
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,286
- I was gonna tell you.
- Uh, wow. Ow.

157
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,487
Tenderness of
the fifth metatarsal.

158
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,026
You thought firefighters
were tough guys, right?

159
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,827
Your secret's safe with me.

160
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,471
Let me take a look, Eden. Can
you tell me if your throat hurts?

161
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,540
Trauma panel, C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

162
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,700
Lateral C-spine, chest,
AP pelvis and Foley.

163
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,743
- Is that my daughter?
- Yeah.

164
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,040
- Is something wrong?
- I don't think so.

165
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,550
Conni, can you have Dr. Greene come
in and talk to Ms. Mintry when he can?

166
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,315
- What do we have? CARTER:
A two-story fall without LOC...

167
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,650
multiple fractures.

168
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,157
- Who's this?
- This is Carmen.

169
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,261
- Follow the light.
- Systolic's 90.

170
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,591
- Let's run another liter NS.
- Pupils equal, round and react to light.

171
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,564
I'll do an ultrasound to check
for signs of internal injury.

172
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,828
- Mrs. Mintry?
- Yes.

173
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,562
Eden inhaled some smoke.

174
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,673
And she has some
scrapes. That's all.

175
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,933
Uh, can I see her?

176
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,269
- Wait!
- What?

177
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:39,173
Your stethoscope. You
haven't cleaned it since using it.

178
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,779
Alcohol wipe, please.

179
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,347
We wanna keep her
on oxygen for a while.

180
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,076
Eden seems more concerned
about your dog than anything.

181
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,016
- Okay?
- He jumped out the window...

182
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,589
before we did, then ran off.
- Mm-hm.

183
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,216
- I'm sure he'll make his way home soon.
- Breath sounds clear bilaterally.

184
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,886
Dr. Carter, could you start
the ultrasound, please?

185
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,622
Mm-hm. ABG, carboxyhemoglobin.

186
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,927
Titrate 10 of morphine and 10
liters humidified O-2 by mask.

187
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,128
- How's Mrs. Wilson?
- Ah, not good.

188
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,535
She's not responding
to antibiotics or pressors.

189
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,969
Did you try ampho?

190
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,406
She's still in
multi-organ failure.

191
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,808
Do you mind? I'm
talking with my husband.

192
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,243
I need to watch
you at all times.

193
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,748
Fine! Watch!

194
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,477
- I'd like to deck that woman.
- Infection Control?

195
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,317
They feel the need to
follow me around at all times.

196
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,119
Mark, I can't lose
another patient like this.

197
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,317
I know.

198
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,123
When did you last clean your
stethoscope between patients?

199
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,458
She's justifying her job.

200
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,061
- ICU?
- Oh, damn it.

201
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,673
- I can't let this happen again.
- You can't save everyone.

202
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,809
I shouldn't kill everyone
either, should I?

203
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,946
That's okay, I'm gonna
wait for the doctor.

204
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,637
- Don't be embarrassed.
- Uh-uh.

205
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,612
I really messed it up.
- Let me see.

206
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,149
No! No, I need the doctor.

207
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,480
After you've been
seen by a nurse.

208
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,850
What I got to show you,
you don't want to see.

209
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,151
Yes, but I can't help you
unless I see what the problem is.

210
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,195
The pro... The problem is
that I got a bum pair of scissors.

211
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,493
Take the towel off. I'm
not gonna be shocked.

212
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,002
- You can't say that. You haven't seen it.
- I'm a professional.

213
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,803
I'd never agree to this if I didn't
think I might bleed to death.

214
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,211
Wow.

215
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,212
The pain is, like,
wrapped around my head.

216
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,185
Did you drink last night?

217
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,951
- There were a lot of parties on campus.
- Is that a yes?

218
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,527
I never felt this way
from being hung-over.

219
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,097
I woke up all achy, and
I keep getting the chills.

220
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,598
- Sounds like the flu, Laura.
- That's what he said.

221
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,572
You saw Dr. Mau?

222
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,303
- He asked me, like, a thousand questions.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

223
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,415
Sophomore at U of I woke up with a
hatband headache, fever and myalgias.

224
00:11:56,616 --> 00:12:00,917
History includes childhood chickenpox,
ER visit for food poisoning two years ago.

225
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,588
What are you doing?

226
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,020
In this position, there's
hardly any pain at all.

227
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,759
- Tylenol, I'm telling you.
- Yeah. We need to talk.

228
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,396
Stand up. Let me see.

229
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,102
- You know, I can help you with that.
- Ah, pass.

230
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,101
Uh, hold still.

231
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,002
Patient carries an Epipen
for allergy to <i>Hymenoptera.</i>

232
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,439
- History of yeast infections.
- Cut to the chase.

233
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,408
- What's the diagnosis?
- A viral illness of unknown etiology.

234
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,740
The flu. I agree.

235
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,748
- Ibuprofen and drink plenty of fluids?
- Sounds like a winner.

236
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,386
- Next time, sign up for it, Stanley.
- Sorry.

237
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,751
- How does this feel?
- Mm, not as good as squatting.

238
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,189
Hi.

239
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,261
- Fresh pot.
- Great.

240
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:47,532
- Did you do the splint in 2?
- Not yet, but I'm going to.

241
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,727
So, um...

242
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,465
- Listen, um, about Nicole...
- You don't have to explain.

243
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,404
- I want to.
- No, really.

244
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,374
It's none of my business.

245
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,743
It just seems like you're going way out
on a limb for someone you barely know.

246
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,912
- She lost her job.
- Yeah, but is that your problem?

247
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,955
Why not help?

248
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,291
Is she, like, your
girlfriend now?

249
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,423
I got her a job, that's all.

250
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,430
So it's not like
she's living with you.

251
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,770
She's living with you?

252
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,909
Just till she can save some
money for her own place.

253
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,068
- She was staying at a hostel.
- So?

254
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,477
So she's a sweet
girl. I'm trying to help.

255
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,640
You don't have
to help everybody.

256
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,582
What's your problem?

257
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,285
Nothing.

258
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,828
- Still fighting?
- No.

259
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,693
Luka has a new project.

260
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,835
- Oh, like what? Coin collecting?
- Nicole.

261
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,528
That cookie girl,
she works here now.

262
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:02,004
- Why do you care?
- Well, I don't.

263
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,535
- What? I don't.
- Okay.

264
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,941
BP's holding at 80. Another
run of ectopy on the monitor.

265
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:16,221
Seven beats. Lidocaine, 70 milligrams,
IV push. Start a drip at 4 cc's an hour.

266
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,652
Have the crash cart nearby.

267
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:21,056
- Are you sure?
- Stop saying that and do as I ask.

268
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,058
Run of V-tach.

269
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,890
Pressure's
dropping. Systolic, 59.

270
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,329
After the lido, get
ready with procainamide.

271
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,526
- What are you doing?
- Treating my patient.

272
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,967
- Do I have to push the drug myself?
- She's a DNR.

273
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,403
- I can save her.
- You have to respect her wishes.

274
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,736
If we can support her
till I find the source...

275
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,969
M.A.P. down to 40.

276
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,413
- Start CPR.
- No. Jacy, hold compressions.

277
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,413
Peter, this is none
of your business.

278
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,854
- V-fib. BENTON:
Look at that woman.

279
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:52,355
Look out the window. That woman
wants to sit with her mother. Let her.

280
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,925
- I can help her.
- No, you can't.

281
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,584
Agonal.

282
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,935
Hi. CHRIS: How you doing?

283
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,766
- Is it still wet?
- Yeah.

284
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,603
- What do I do when my foot itches?
- You live with it.

285
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,680
Can I get you something?
Water, Popsicle?

286
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,843
- How about a soda?
- Sure.

287
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,883
Your boyfriend get
mad if I buy you one?

288
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,113
- Well, I'm not thirsty, but thank you.
- Come on. Live it up.

289
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,053
- Is this the surgical consult?
- Uh, yeah.

290
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,352
It's... It's a delicate, um...

291
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,860
All right. So,
what's the problem?

292
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,861
She didn't tell you?

293
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,158
Rick tried to
circumcise himself.

294
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,567
All right. Ice and
sponges. Let's have a look.

295
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,937
I'm not nuts, okay?

296
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,106
You didn't consider
having a doctor do this?

297
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,211
I thought I could take the
pain. Snip, snip, done deal.

298
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,821
You know, there's no medical
reason for circumcision.

299
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,423
- There's a personal reason.
- There you go. All right.

300
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,890
Apply direct pressure.

301
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,222
Laceration's 2 inches,
no damage to the glans.

302
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,558
- So, what now?
- Well, you're halfway done.

303
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,701
I can finish the
job or sew it up.

304
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,602
- Can I ask my girlfriend?
- Would that be the personal reason?

305
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,969
She's a neat freak.

306
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,271
- Foreskin just didn't do it for her.
- Sure. Why don't you call her.

307
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,075
Either way, we can do it
upstairs, treat it as plastic surgery.

308
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,579
- You want a Psych consult?
- No, I just think he's stupid.

309
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,118
Not to mention devoted.

310
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,754
You passed out.
Someone called 911.

311
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,916
People can't mind
their own business.

312
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,461
- Sorry, am I too early?
- No, have a seat.

313
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,999
- Your blood doesn't seem to be clotting.
- I have a factor-lX deficiency.

314
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,467
Do you get regular doses
of factor somewhere?

315
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,630
Children's. I guess I
missed a couple of rounds.

316
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,504
- Mary, call Hemo/Onc.
- Sure.

317
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,611
It's very important
that you go every time.

318
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,179
I know. I just couldn't
get there lately.

319
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,943
- What's your dose?
- Twenty-one hundred units.

320
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,315
- See if the pharmacy has that much.
- I'll go check.

321
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,814
- Do they have bag lunches here?
- I don't know.

322
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,892
Some hospitals do.

323
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,995
Okay. After the factor, I want
to clean and irrigate that hand.

324
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,563
- Is there someone we can call?
- No.

325
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,961
- Parents?
- No.

326
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,367
- Okay. Let's start an IV.
- I have a Port-A-Cath.

327
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,806
- For how long?
- Two years.

328
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,171
Couldn't stand the
needles every day.

329
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,779
Okay. We'll use that.

330
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,145
- I'll bring you a sandwich.
- Thanks.

331
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,556
- Oh, that thing.
- Yeah. It ate my dollar.

332
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,355
- You want to borrow one?
- No, I got it. Thanks.

333
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,090
So is it hard working
with Dr. Kovac?

334
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,737
- Carter told me.
- Oh.

335
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,840
- Sorry, am I not supposed to know?
- No, don't worry about it.

336
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,909
- Yeah. Dating at work can be messy.
- Yeah.

337
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,046
- Abby?
- Want some change?

338
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,704
Uh, the girlfriend of the guy is here.
- What guy?

339
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,442
The self-circumcision.

340
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,195
- Your patient?
- Yes.

341
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,402
- Sepsis.
- Bad luck you've had.

342
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,403
- Did you find any nidus of infection?
- No, not so far.

343
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,770
No abscesses or localized
infection anywhere obvious.

344
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,774
Would you check the
bowel anastomosis?

345
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,547
You believe there was a leak?

346
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,115
I'm trying to find the
source of these infections.

347
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,411
- Do you mind?
- No. I'll check.

348
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,555
She was a very nice woman.

349
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:53,063
For the record, Dr. Corday, I don't agree
with what people are saying about you.

350
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:57,101
You know, all this talk about the
breast-feeding and the sleep deprivation.

351
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,765
- That part's true.
- Well, I mean:

352
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,431
"Motherhood's
interfering with your work."

353
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,608
- That's sexist crap.
- Yeah, well...

354
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:12,275
- it's not a woman's world, is it?
- Not until they perfect cloning.

355
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,380
Right.

356
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,323
I thought you went
to the bathroom.

357
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,926
I'll let you know what I find.

358
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,587
- I can't believe you did this.
- What do you mean?

359
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,202
- You said that you wanted me to...
- I know what I said, but it's so extreme!

360
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,304
So are we repairing or removing?

361
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,168
- What do you say?
- I don't know. Whatever's less traumatic.

362
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,173
Well, it's 50-50 now.

363
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,969
Well, I, uh...

364
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,843
I mean, I might as well
finish what I started.

365
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,610
- Don't you think?
- I guess.

366
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,546
Okay. Well, we'll get you up to the
O.R. as soon as there's a room available.

367
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,485
Nurse, do you have a second?

368
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,058
- Sure. What is it?
- Outside.

369
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,660
What? What are you doing?

370
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,956
I'll be right back.

371
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,664
- He'll be okay, right?
- Oh, yeah. They'll fix it.

372
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:08,501
You'll never know. I mean,
except for the foreskin.

373
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,577
- This should never have happened.
- I thought this was what you wanted.

374
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,981
Not really.

375
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,909
I only said that because I
wanted to break up with him...

376
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,577
without hurting his feelings.

377
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,314
- Abby, we need you!
- Okay, hold on. I'll be back.

378
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,050
Got a gag. BP,
130/70. Pulse, 100.

379
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,695
- Did he take anything?
- This is the roommate.

380
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,023
- Does he use drugs?
- No.

381
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,757
He drank a little at a party
last night, but he was okay.

382
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,835
- Did he say anything today?
- Just that he felt sick and his neck hurt.

383
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,029
- Stiff?
- He thought he slept on it funny.

384
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,971
Okay. On my count.
One, two, three.

385
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,603
Skin feels hot. Let's
get a rectal temp.

386
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:47,838
See this? LEWIS: What?

387
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:52,007
- Petechiae. They don't blanch.
- Oh, my God.

388
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,415
- Sats are dropping to 91.
- This is meningococcus.

389
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,680
What's that?

390
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:59,053
Get TB masks and
post-exposure meds for everyone.

391
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,785
CBC, Chem-20, Accu-Chek,
blood cultures times two.

392
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,758
This could be all
over his dorm by now.

393
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,898
- Where do you go to school?
- U of I.

394
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,728
- Get an LP tray. Where's Carter?
- He's in Exam 3.

395
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,028
Get him. Get him now.

396
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,100
Get me a 16
French, triple lumen.

397
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:22,709
Carter? Carter, Lewis needs you.

398
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,374
- What is it?
- Some kid has meningococcus.

399
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,747
All right, take
them out, Stanley.

400
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,784
Okay.

401
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,449
- Ceftriaxone going up.
- Meningococcemia?

402
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,324
Can you intubate?
Twenty-eight of dexamethasone.

403
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,896
You induce yet? LEWIS: No.

404
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,296
Twenty of etomidate.
Give me 120 of sux.

405
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,166
- Did our flu girl go to U of I?
- Yes. Laura Avery. I presented her to you.

406
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,601
She needs to be tapped.

407
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,436
If she's been exposed as long
as he has, we're out of time.

408
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,407
She was discharged. - What?

409
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,058
You said she had the flu.
- We need to find her.

410
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,582
I'll do it. Tube him. Prep
a Swan-Ganz catheter.

411
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,844
She was in Chairs waiting on a ride.
- Mau.

412
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,647
Okay, he's loose. Give me
some cricoid pressure, Malik.

413
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,122
Go check Triage. Find out the name
of her dorm and send an ambulance.

414
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,150
Was there a unit? - Yeah.

415
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,922
What did they say?
- An hour at least.

416
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,122
I found the introducer,
but not the catheter.

417
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,200
We need to monitor
his pressure here.

418
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,768
Well, nothing's where
it's supposed to be.

419
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,634
Frank, where's the girl
that was in Curtain 2?

420
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,367
- Mm, pretty college girl?
- Yeah.

421
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,478
She asked where to
buy some orange juice.

422
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,809
- Where did you tell her?
- Cafeteria, where else?

423
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,281
Whoa.

424
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,723
- Oh. Oh. Sorry. Sorry.
- Slow down!

425
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,389
Just be polite.

426
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,031
- "Yes, ma'am. Please, ma'am."
- All right.

427
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,030
Where'd you put the
Swan-Ganz catheters?

428
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,828
- The what?
- Swan-Ganz catheters.

429
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,369
- Uh, they told me in the Trauma Room.
- They're not there.

430
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,007
- I thought that's where I put it.
- Well, show me.

431
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,572
- You got it?
- Yeah. Here. Here's the cordis.

432
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,578
You want me to set
up for an art line?

433
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,114
Either. I'll take either.

434
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:08,518
- Got it!
- No. That is the introducer.

435
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,816
It looks like a
big, yellow snake.

436
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,983
Get me somebody who
knows the difference.

437
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,923
She's new, Carter.
It's her first day.

438
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,097
This kid is dying here.
- I'm sorry.

439
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,426
If you don't know what
you're doing, get out.

440
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,761
Here it is. Don't yell at her.

441
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:26,372
- We're losing time here.
- It's not her fault he's sick.

442
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,507
Flush the ports.

443
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,746
Damn it.

444
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,768
Laura! Laura!

445
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,238
Laura!

446
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,410
Laura!

447
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,812
- Hold on!
- What is it?

448
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,953
Stay right there.
I'm coming down!

449
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,826
If she left a note, you
shouldn't have been late.

450
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:28,229
I did tell her about the party. Take it
up with her. I don't have time for this.

451
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,528
- Nanny?
- No, Roger.

452
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:34,162
- He's my new shadow.
- He should meet Carmen.

453
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,069
What do you have?

454
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:42,579
Revision of a failed circumcision,
25-year-old. Don't ask.

455
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,513
- You?
- Splenectomy and a pilon tib-fib.

456
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,118
Mm.

457
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,518
Listen, uh...

458
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,985
- I'm sorry about earlier.
- Ah, it's okay.

459
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,390
Uh, I thought I
could beat the odds.

460
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,896
Look, I know you're stressed out
with the new baby and everything.

461
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,000
What's that have to do with it?

462
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,729
Not to mention the head-trips
that's going on around here.

463
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,873
My fuse would be short too.

464
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,439
Have you ever seen me do
anything wrong? Lazy? Sloppy?

465
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,078
No.

466
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,374
Look, I think you're
just having a bad run.

467
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,946
That's not very comforting
to my next patient.

468
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:25,716
Elizabeth, if I needed surgery
or Reece did, I'd come to you.

469
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,023
- BP's down to 60.
- How much fluid is in?

470
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,356
Eight. We're gonna put
him into pulmonary edema.

471
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,022
Dopamine's maxed
out. Levo's at 20 mics.

472
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,963
There's no place
to put the pulse ox.

473
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,730
God, this kills fast.

474
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,807
V-fib. CARTER: Crash
cart. Charge to 300.

475
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,607
He's young. Let's give him a
chance. Come on, Andy. Clear!

476
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,110
Charge to 360. Go get
the conducting pads.

477
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,115
And clear.

478
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,810
Okay, Laura.

479
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,957
You're gonna feel
pressure in your lower back.

480
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:01,287
- Can I call my mom?
- As soon as we're done.

481
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,760
It's long-distance. Omaha.

482
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,233
Uh, is he gonna be okay? Andy?

483
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,665
They're working on
him. You know him well?

484
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:15,467
Everyone knows him. He's on
the soccer team, really popular.

485
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,735
Spend time with him lately?

486
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,506
Laura? STANLEY: Fluid's clear.

487
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:24,280
- Laura?
- Well, we sort of kissed last night.

488
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,147
- Did you kiss anyone else?
- Why?

489
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,982
Andy has a very
contagious bacterial infection.

490
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,283
We need to know who
might've been exposed.

491
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,993
I usually only kiss
one guy a night.

492
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,363
Do you think Andy
shares the same policy?

493
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,229
I don't know. Last night was
the first time I talked to him.

494
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,031
Dr. Lewis?

495
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,503
What? What is it?

496
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,212
I can't pay for this.

497
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,352
Don't worry. Half of
our patients can't pay.

498
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,853
And if there's a follow-up or
anything, I don't even know where I'll be.

499
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:09,325
- Your tox screen is positive for opiates.
- Well, my joints bleed. It hurts.

500
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,192
- What drugs do you do?
- Demerol, if I can get it.

501
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,527
And if not, heroin?

502
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,138
- I don't see tracks.
- It's not a regular thing.

503
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,864
- Do you use your Port-A-Cath to shoot?
- All right, look.

504
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,307
- You know, I didn't ask to come here.
- That's not what a Port-A-Cath is for.

505
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,049
Hold on. Hold on. Let
me call someone for you.

506
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,706
Tsch, there's no one to call.

507
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,251
- Let's talk about rehab, then.
- Ha, I don't think so.

508
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,880
I'm not done with your hand.
I can't leave it open like that.

509
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,093
Please?

510
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,177
- Is ham and cheese okay?
- I'm not picky.

511
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,274
- There's fruit in there too.
- Thanks.

512
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,246
Wait here. I need to
get another suture kit.

513
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,354
- Why were you fighting?
- He's using his catheter to shoot drugs.

514
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,516
- It has to be removed.
- Can you do that?

515
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,759
- You all right?
- Me? Yes.

516
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:20,457
Dr. Carter was under pressure.
- That's okay.

517
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,295
Don't you think he would find
some other way to do drugs?

518
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:27,530
He was given the catheter
for clotting factor, not heroin.

519
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:32,438
This is Dr. Lewis again from the
ER in Chicago regarding Laura.

520
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,273
Please call me right away.

521
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,812
Okay, I'm in. Bag her.

522
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,745
- Where's the vent?
- On its way.

523
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,817
Her pressure's dropping.
More dopamine?

524
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,614
No. We're running
in the antibiotics.

525
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,950
- Portable chest?
- Sure. Check the tube.

526
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:48,616
Not that it makes much
difference. It's a waiting game now.

527
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,926
Not so fast. You don't
want to give her a pneumo.

528
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,162
- I missed it.
- I missed it too.

529
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:03,900
- You didn't see her. CARTER:
Well, it presented like the flu.

530
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,075
- You call the college?
- Mm-hm.

531
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,646
Student Health is giving
antibiotics to everybody in the dorm.

532
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:13,650
- And the people at that party?
- They'll get the word out.

533
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,789
They don't want an outbreak.
Abby, 600 milligrams of rifampin...

534
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,789
- for anyone on the meningitis cases.
- It makes me sick.

535
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,586
- Better than dead.
- Here you go.

536
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,161
- There she is.
- Sorry. I got busy.

537
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,322
- Thanks.
- Now all you need are crutches.

538
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,762
Do I have to? ABBY: Mm-hm.

539
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,835
Nurse's orders.

540
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,203
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

541
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:38,143
- How late are you here tonight?
- Hmm. One more hour.

542
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,677
If I were gonna see you
again, I'd be more subtle.

543
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,043
But would you like to go
for coffee or something?

544
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,708
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not available.

545
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,218
- There's a boyfriend.
- Uh, well...

546
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,982
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

547
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,854
But thank you.

548
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,155
Pressure's steady.

549
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,991
Can I have a
little room, please?

550
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,509
I have to see the field.
- And I have to work.

551
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,559
Careful. Mommy's watching.

552
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,571
Releasing the
splenophrenic vessels.

553
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,866
Let's pack it in with lap pads.

554
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,168
Small vascular clamp.

555
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,506
Mobilizing the
spleen. Bowl, please.

556
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,539
Let's isolate the hilar
vessels. We'll ligate.

557
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,480
Did you touch the
circulating nurse?

558
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,244
For God's sake.

559
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,345
- Of course not.
- It looked close.

560
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,121
Carmen, get out. - What?

561
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,693
I've had it with your
intrusive pettiness.

562
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:31,921
I'm doing my job.

563
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,623
No. You are driving us all
crazy. Now, leave the O.R.

564
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:35,890
I can't do that.

565
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,230
Well, then we'll call
Security to assist you.

566
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,395
- Shirley? SHIRLEY:
Are you serious?

567
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,064
I've never been more serious.
- Catfight pending.

568
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,574
Dr. Corday? They want
you in Romano's office.

569
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:46,768
I'm operating.

570
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,540
He said to have you scrub out
and to escort you, or I'm fired.

571
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,412
I'll take that spleen.

572
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,247
Don't follow me.

573
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,586
Isn't Surgery supposed
to take your messages?

574
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,788
- Let me guess. Roger or Jackie?
- One of each.

575
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,795
- Sounds like they're feuding.
- Let them.

576
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,197
I don't think I can.
- Just temporarily.

577
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,895
Is he okay? BENTON: Yeah.

578
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,767
He should be sore
for a week or so.

579
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,774
- And he'll work like normal?
- Should be just what you ordered.

580
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,208
Uh, Sarah didn't have an
issue with the circumcision.

581
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,746
I was trying to let
him down gently.

582
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:26,112
- Let him down?
- I didn't want to hurt him.

583
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,776
You need to go upstairs
and tell him the truth.

584
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,320
- Mm-mm, three weeks.
- No. Now.

585
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:33,117
I backed over a guy's cat once
and stayed two more weeks.

586
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,261
- This has got to be worth at least three.
- Do whatever you want.

587
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:40,729
I'm so bad at relationships. I
can never just say what I feel.

588
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,000
I know what you mean.

589
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,502
- You do know I was in the O.R...
- Sit down, Elizabeth.

590
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,969
No, thank you.

591
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,439
This is Edwin Bane, Cook
County Health Department.

592
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:51,770
Dr. Corday.

593
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,775
- It couldn't wait? ROMANO:
Dr. Bane is an investigator.

594
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,780
So it's an investigation now.

595
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,683
Unfortunate record you've
accrued lately, Dr. Corday.

596
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,283
Yes.

597
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,689
- We are a little baffled by it.
- As am I.

598
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,495
Did something turn up in my cultures?
- No.

599
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,427
Does Carmen have a
problem with my technique?

600
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:21,164
- We're looking at other theories.
- Other theories?

601
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,934
It has to be more than
a statistical anomaly.

602
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,668
What do you think is happening?

603
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,678
Well, if I knew that,
I'd have fixed it by now.

604
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,082
And there's nothing
you want to tell us?

605
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,613
Uh...

606
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:38,018
- What are you insinuating?
- The next step is a criminal inquiry.

607
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,014
Ah, I beg your pardon?

608
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,185
All four of these patients
were elderly, in marginal health.

609
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,131
- Yes.
- All die of post-op sepsis...

610
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,029
under your care. And
on at least one occasion...

611
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,729
- the family asked you to euthanize.
- No! No...

612
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,031
Adrienne Tanzi?

613
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,208
Uh, there was discussion
about the quality of life.

614
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,867
Um, I'm sorry. Am I being
accused of something here?

615
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:04,380
Doctor, you wouldn't be the first angel
of mercy to help end patients' suffering.

616
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,852
Uh, hold on, doctor. I
thought you were fact-finding.

617
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,011
I am.

618
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,254
So if there's something you want
to tell us, you should tell us now.

619
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,521
Like what? That I'm going around
with a syringe full of bacteria...

620
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,392
infecting these
people on purpose?

621
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,896
All right, that's
it. Let's adjourn.

622
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,142
The Chicago Police
will be contacting you.

623
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:37,143
You might want to think
about hiring counsel.

624
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,457
- Is that your dog?
- Yeah. Speedy.

625
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,430
He's lost.

626
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,864
Somebody order crayons?

627
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,400
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

628
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,200
Did you finish your shift?

629
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,468
I'm waiting for Luka.

630
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,612
- Uh, is it always like this?
- Pretty much, yeah.

631
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,979
- I really admire what you do.
- Oh, you get used to it.

632
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,652
No. I meant you.

633
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,288
- I always wanted to be a nurse.
- Really?

634
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,222
At the hospital where my mother died,
the nurses treated me like their daughter.

635
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,790
They gave me ice cream
and dolls to play with.

636
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,455
- They were like angels. KOVAC:
Have you seen my patient?

637
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,828
- Which one?
- Wes. The one you met.

638
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,438
- Uh, I talked to him maybe an hour ago.
- Mm, he's gone.

639
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,471
You finished stitching
his hand, right?

640
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,734
Yeah, but the social
worker has to see him.

641
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,207
Maybe he didn't want
to get that tube removed.

642
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,610
I didn't tell him I
wanted to do that.

643
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,148
Oh.

644
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:49,085
- Did you?
- No. I didn't say anything.

645
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,150
Abby, if you see Adele, could
you tell her that my patient eloped?

646
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,349
Sure.

647
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,162
Don't worry. He'll be okay.

648
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:04,599
He's on the street with a serious
coagulopathy, drug habit, no money.

649
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,534
- Well, if he left home, I mean...
- What?

650
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:11,540
And stayed away this long,
maybe he doesn't want to be found.

651
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,707
Rachel?!

652
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,747
Damn it.

653
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,182
Rachel!

654
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,149
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

655
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,555
Oh.

656
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:33,323
It's okay. It's okay. I know.

657
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,264
Oh, it's all right, darling.

658
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,627
He's cute, but don't you
think he should cut his hair?

659
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,035
Rachel, turn off the music
and get off the phone!

660
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,402
- Two seconds.
- Hang up!

661
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,242
I gotta go. My dad's
wife is freaking.

662
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,904
- What's wrong?
- You're supposed to be babysitting.

663
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,380
- I am.
- Ella was screaming.

664
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,382
- Oh, sorry.
- Did you feed her?

665
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:58,421
- I wasn't supposed to until she woke up.
- Well, she's up now, isn't she?

666
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,751
You want me to feed her now?

667
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,484
Yes, I want you to feed her now.

668
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,431
Listen, I want you
to be responsible.

669
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,831
To think about something
other than yourself.

670
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,028
I said I was sorry. I
didn't hear her crying.

671
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,764
You didn't care to listen.
You were playing that crap...

672
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,068
and talking about
rubbish to your friend.

673
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:21,008
If you're so worried, then why
don't you stay home with her?

674
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,944
I mistakenly thought that you
were reliable enough to do it.

675
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,107
Well, then forget it.
I'm calling Lynn back.

676
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,683
- No, you don't.
- Elizabeth!

677
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,911
- Warm up that milk.
- No!

678
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:30,111
- Now!
- She's your kid.

679
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,416
- You're living in my house.
- You can't tell me what to do.

680
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,560
Oh, yes, I bloody well can.

681
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,561
You know what?
You need to chill out.

682
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,962
This is my house. You
can't talk to me that way.

683
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,127
Boy, my dad sure can pick them.

684
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:49,270
Rachel, you do not want to battle
with me. You'll lose. I guarantee it.

685
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,420
Your shift's over, isn't it?
- Yeah.

686
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,321
What are you, a
med student again?

687
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,483
I sent him home.

688
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,497
I loved being this age, having a crush
on a guy, finally meeting him at a party.

689
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,660
She probably went home all excited,
wondering what would happen next.

690
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,132
She has a chance.

691
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,775
Yeah. I just want to
be here whichever way.

692
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,672
Don't stay all night, okay?

693
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,938
Dr. Lewis, there's a woman
on line two calling from Omaha.

694
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,673
Thanks.

695
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,311
- Good night.
- Good night.

696
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,828
You make me drive
all the way over here?

697
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,267
What is your problem?

698
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,169
You'd know if
you'd take my calls.

699
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,311
- I have 100 things to do during the day.
- More important than your son?

700
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,605
More important than
refereeing you and Jackie.

701
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,215
I was 20 minutes late. She
uses that to keep me from him?

702
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,112
We need to rethink the
visitation thing. It's complicated.

703
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,050
- It's Jackie who's messing things up.
- Jackie is his aunt.

704
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,689
And I'm his father!

705
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,517
- His what?
- I'm one of his fathers.

706
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,127
Look, Roger, I, uh...

707
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,193
I appreciate you
caring for Reece.

708
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,962
I thought this time was
important to make a transition.

709
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,469
- Transition?
- But right now, you know what?

710
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,631
You need to let go.

711
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,869
Peter, look, I'm willing to work
out a schedule or something.

712
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,378
No. Reece has one
father, and that's me.

713
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,017
We both know that's
not true, don't we?

714
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,887
Carla said you're not his
real father any more than I.

715
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,355
- You want to back up with that.
- So don't think you can just dump me...

716
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,087
- like, uh, you're more important to him.
- I am more important to him.

717
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,762
You don't call me anymore.
You don't come near the house.

718
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,766
Stay away from Jackie and
stay the hell away from my son.

719
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,275
- Are you gonna do it again?
- Seriously, I think it worked.

720
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,606
It feels much better.

721
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,841
- Needles in your back?
- Yeah. It was a bonus.

722
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,110
I didn't realize you
were a masochist.

723
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,776
Whatever works.

724
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,853
I should run home
and get my whip.

725
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,786
Yeah, you do that.

726
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:24,859
- You almost off?
- Uh, yeah, 15 minutes ago.

727
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,861
What are you still
hanging around for?

728
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,398
And miss this late-night stroll?

729
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,737
It's starting to get a
little chilly out here.

730
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,366
I got asked out
by a fireman today.

731
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,906
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

732
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,374
- Ankle guy?
- Yeah.

733
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,706
- Hard to believe?
- No.

734
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,481
- He's good-looking.
- Big?

735
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:46,208
- Yeah. Funny.
- Invite me to the nuptials.

736
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,787
All right. You
gotta help me out.

737
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:58,461
I don't know what to
do. Rub your back?

738
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,829
I'm just not exactly sure
what I'm supposed to do here.

739
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:06,232
I'm not exactly sure how I'm
supposed to comment on your love life.

740
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:11,809
I said no because I was
waiting for something to happen...

741
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,540
- with us.
- You've been waiting?

742
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,410
- Yeah.
- You weren't doing much...

743
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,984
- to move it forward.
- No, you gave me an ultimatum.

744
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,644
You gave me an ultimatum,
and I did what you asked...

745
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,847
and you've done nothing.

746
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,322
- What did I ask you to do?
- I broke up with Luka.

747
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,094
First, you didn't break
up with Luka for me.

748
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,128
- I didn't?
- No. Second of all...

749
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:36,132
- you didn't break up with Luka.
- Ha-ha, I'm pretty sure I did.

750
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,031
Well, then why do
you care so much...

751
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,172
about what he does
or what he thinks or...?

752
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,173
I dated the guy for a year.
There's gonna be some history.

753
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,603
Maybe too much history.

754
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,877
Well, yeah, I had a
life before John Carter.

755
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,044
If you want someone
with no history...

756
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,709
you're gonna have to
find yourself a virgin.

757
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,722
No. I'll settle for someone who
isn't hung up on somebody else.

758
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,890
You don't have to settle
for anything, Carter.

759
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:24,114
I talked to her.
She's at Andrew's.

760
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,874
- And?
- He said he'd have her back by 10.

761
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:34,351
End of a great day.

762
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,695
That investigator
was totally out of line.

763
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,196
- He all but accused me of homicide.
- It's crazy.

764
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,495
- What if people believe him?
- They won't.

765
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,831
You know what's
really crazy? I feel guilty.

766
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,908
- Elizabeth.
- I do.

767
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,773
Four people are dead. I was their
doctor, and I can't explain what happened.

768
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:59,077
Well, the answer certainly isn't
that you were euthanizing people.

769
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,849
Then I come back home, and
I take it out on a 14-year-old.

770
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,287
That's a fair fight.

771
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:10,528
She didn't do what she
said she was gonna do.

772
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,427
That's worth a conversation.
I'm gonna have that with her.

773
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,158
I don't think I can
handle this, Mark.

774
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,903
I was barely handling working
and looking after the baby.

775
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,304
You can.

776
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,742
- I can't.
- Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey...

777
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,879
Hey...

778
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,387
We'll work this out.

779
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,218
Okay?

780
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,723
We'll lay down the
rules for Rachel.

781
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,330
- We'll get you a lawyer if we have to.
- Oh, God!

782
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,932
We got fights ahead
of us. We know that.

783
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,574
But we're together.

784
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:01,502
And we got children.
We're happy.

785
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,144
That's a lot.

786
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,013
That's a lot.

787
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:40,943
Hey.

788
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,857
I called your mom.
She's flying in.

789
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,127
You had us a little worried.
