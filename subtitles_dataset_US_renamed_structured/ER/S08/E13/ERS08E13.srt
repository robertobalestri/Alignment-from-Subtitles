1
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,716
- Chamomile tea?
- Oh.

2
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,722
Feeling better?

3
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,394
Well, I haven't been to
the bathroom in 10 minutes.

4
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,688
I guess that's progress.

5
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,362
- Hey, at least someone's happy.
- She should be.

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,231
She T.P.'d the bathroom, the hallway
and half the kitchen while I made tea.

7
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,429
God. She's not even walking yet.

8
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,436
- Did you take your temperature?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,101
- But...
- Okay. Ahem.

10
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,959
- Should I call or do you want to?
- I'm presenting at grand rounds.

11
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,145
- Not with the stomach flu.
- Mark.

12
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,913
Hi, I'm calling for Dr. Corday.
Yeah, she's projectile vomiting.

13
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,920
Do you still want
her to come in?

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,059
- Ha-ha. Very funny.
- Thank you.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,256
I'm calling right back.
I just need loperamide.

16
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,763
- Then I'll be fine.
- What you need to do is stay in bed.

17
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,433
- What about Ella?
- Katherine's coming over.

18
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,462
Who's gonna look
after her till then?

19
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,301
I'm not doing anything today.

20
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,000
- Hey, Rach.
- I can watch her if you want.

21
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,138
I wouldn't want you to
give up your Saturday.

22
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,875
- It's freezing out anyway.
- Sold. I'm late.

23
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,316
You, stay in bed.

24
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,852
Hello.

25
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,922
Haleh, gallstone
in 4 needs Toradol.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,116
Can you check the
labs on Cathy Jensen?

27
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,658
- Upper GI bleed?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,455
- Is Dr. Chen in yet?
- Nope.

29
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,623
Get the message he
was looking for you?

30
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,823
No.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,696
Oh, really?

32
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,463
- In just a swim cap?
- Yeah. And a Speedo.

33
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,268
- You've gotta try it.
- In January in Lake Michigan?

34
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,207
- It has a spiritual quality.
- You wanted to see me, Robert?

35
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,313
Yes. Just discussing with
Dr. Lewis what a tough year it's been.

36
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,814
What with personnel
changes, lawsuits and whatnot.

37
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,818
Can you believe Dr. Romano's a
member of the Polar Bear Club?

38
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,320
- Can you excuse us?
- Stay. I've found a solution...

39
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,856
- for the administrative bottleneck...
- Bottleneck?

40
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,052
- Your QAs are a month behind.
- Which you'll have by day's end.

41
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,221
I'm sorry. Does she really
need to be here for this?

42
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,991
Actually, I have a patient.

43
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,637
- Well, that was elegant.
- Look, you can't expect me...

44
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,673
to do low-priority administrative work
while I'm clocking more clinical shifts...

45
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,368
- than anybody in my department.
- You're overburdened.

46
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,979
- That's why I asked Dr. Lewis to pitch in.
- How?

47
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,844
Covering meetings, overseeing
teaching in your absence.

48
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,715
- Which is what Chief Resident does.
- Carter's not an Attending. Dr. Lewis is.

49
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,584
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm feeling unappreciated here.

50
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,216
- I'm trying to lighten your load.
- No, you're not. You're jerking my chain.

51
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,386
- Why would I do that?
- Because you can.

52
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,930
Well, for the time being, consider
Dr. Lewis your unofficial assistant.

53
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,431
No, I don't need any help!

54
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,696
And try to keep the public
displays of affection to a minimum.

55
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,966
This is a workplace,
not a parade.

56
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,678
- I have messages for you, Dr. Weaver.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,407
So you're gay, huh?

58
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,881
Yeah, Frank. I'm gay, all right?

59
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,783
You know you're
going to hell, right?

60
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:05,408
- An entire bottle of wine?
- Topped off with a couple of Xanax.

61
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,747
Was she embarrassed?

62
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,180
Kind of hard not to be when
you're puking your guts out.

63
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,617
- Know what the worst part about it was?
- You had to put her to bed?

64
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,451
It was a 40-year-old
bottle of Bordeaux!

65
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,820
Is this a new thing?

66
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,628
- She's been taking them for years.
- Really?

67
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,664
Mortality reviews. It seems
you get to finish them for me.

68
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,425
- I guess.
- They're due by day's end.

69
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,536
- Great.
- Should I have some soup sent over?

70
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,002
- Is Elizabeth still sick?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,539
Listen, if you change
your mind, call me, okay?

72
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,701
And hang in there. Love you.

73
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,347
She's been on
the toilet all night.

74
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,983
I'm not sure, but that may
be more than I need to know.

75
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,219
So Romano conned you
into picking up the slack, huh?

76
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,652
Oh, God! I agreed to
help. Was that stupid?

77
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,055
A little bit around the edges.
Kerry's lucky to have you.

78
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,855
I don't think she sees it that
way. She's never liked me.

79
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,554
She doesn't like anyone.

80
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,860
- Don't people work around here?
- Ah. Glutton for punishment, huh?

81
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,469
- Yeah. Something like that.
- Oh, hi. Welcome back.

82
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,503
- Yeah. To you too.
- Thank you.

83
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,698
You're here. I was
hoping you'd come earlier.

84
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,502
- Why?
- I wanted to acquaint you...

85
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,577
with the new forms
for the CPT codes.

86
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,373
I'll be fine.

87
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,413
Suit yourself.

88
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,012
Good for you, girl.

89
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,911
You still owe me $20 for
Cleo's going-away present.

90
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,886
Suddenly I feel like I never left.
- You lost your locker.

91
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,992
Keep your stuff in
here for the time being.

92
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,685
Wait. There's dirt in here.

93
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,721
No.

94
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,128
It's doughnut sprinkles.

95
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,733
Ugh.

96
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,904
Donald Brower, 35. Face,
neck and chest injuries...

97
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,042
from some sort of explosion.
Unknown LOC, GCS 14...

98
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,543
- hypotensive, 80 palp, pulse 130.
- Mr. Brower, can you hear me?

99
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,943
- Can you tell me what happened?
- Mail...

100
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,548
- Sorry?
- Exploded.

101
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,116
- What happened?
- He opened some kind of letter bomb.

102
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,125
- Daughter's in that rig.
- Give it to me.

103
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,722
Jessica Brower, 6. Near
amputation of right hand.

104
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,859
BP is 100/70, pulse 120.

105
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,017
- Estimated blood loss?
- Three hundred cc's.

106
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,629
Couple of liters at wrist,
controlled with the cuff.

107
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,289
I'm Dr. Lewis. We're gonna
take care of you, all right?

108
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,664
- It hurts!
- Yeah, I know it does, sweetheart.

109
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,096
- How's the airway?
- He's talking now.

110
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,935
- GCS 14 here.
- BP, 80/40.

111
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,736
Sir, can you see
out of this eye?

112
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,741
- I'll get it.
- What...?

113
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,473
Peaked iris, probable globe
rupture. Follow the light.

114
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,417
Decreased breath sounds on
the left. He needs a chest tube.

115
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,284
- Betadine and chest tube tray.
- This is her birthday.

116
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,318
- Whose birthday, Mr. Brower?
- I let Jessica pull on the bow.

117
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,759
Do you know why someone
would send you a bomb?

118
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,296
- My wife.
- Your wife?

119
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,499
- Mr. Brower? MARQUEZ:
Sinus tach at 120.

120
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,966
- Is that chest tube in yet?
- That's the pleura.

121
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,144
- Open your eyes, Mr. Brower.
- Pressure's dropping, 70 systolic.

122
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,112
- He's out. Vascular clamp.
- Another thoracostomy tray.

123
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,512
I've got it, Kerry.

124
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,151
I wonder how Susan's
doing over there with the kid.

125
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,923
Okay, I'll put in the second
chest tube and you get the airway.

126
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,854
Airway's fine.

127
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,095
- Gram of Ancef, IV piggyback.
- Where are we?

128
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,135
- Superficial flash burns, face is fine.
- Lungs are clear, pelvis is stable.

129
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,502
- All the money's on the hand.
- Pressure's steady at 100/70.

130
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,666
No visible deformity
to shoulder or elbow.

131
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,037
Ow! Oh.

132
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,713
Hold on. We need to take a
look at your hand, all right?

133
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,872
- Thumb's intact. HALEH:
First HemoCue's eight.

134
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,984
Ring and little
finger are missing.

135
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,211
We need Hand
Surgery, Ortho, Plastics.

136
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,878
- Let the cuff down.
- Surgery'll be here in a minute.

137
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,025
I said take the cuff down.

138
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,519
Oop. CARTER: Whoa.

139
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,996
Okay, Jessica. Okay,
sweetheart. You just relax.

140
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,034
Just need to know
the exact injury.

141
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,398
Well, now you know.

142
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,063
- You want hemostats?
- Yeah.

143
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,902
Just direct pressure.

144
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,806
Blood supply intact.
Probably salvageable.

145
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,002
We're okay here, Kerry.

146
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,975
- Sinus at 100.
- CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine, coags and...

147
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,674
We already ordered pre-op labs.

148
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,747
- Fine. CARTER:
Two more of morphine.

149
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,859
- Let's get an x-ray tech down here.
- Carter, your mom's here.

150
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,552
- Brought a kid from her leukemia center.
- I got it.

151
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,924
Yeah? They come in on a rig?

152
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,725
No. She brought him in herself.

153
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,925
He has weakness
and a slight fever.

154
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:25,595
- Thanks.
- And she's nicer than I remembered.

155
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,870
Oh, John. Thank
goodness you're here today.

156
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,744
- Who's your friend?
- Mickey is the center's Child of the Year.

157
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,909
We were photographing
him for the spring mailer.

158
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,386
And he suddenly became
lightheaded and warm.

159
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,785
So you brought him here?

160
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,120
We tried phoning his
doctors, but it's Saturday.

161
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,455
Is there someplace else
I should have taken him?

162
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,293
- Did they give him anything yet?
- Your friend gave him some Tylenol.

163
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,594
- How long has he had leukemia?
- I'm not sure.

164
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,034
- He's been in remission a year.
- Call his parents?

165
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,867
- He's an orphan.
- So he lives in a foster home?

166
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,705
With three other special-needs children.
And foster parents he barely knows.

167
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,473
Hey, Mickey, how you doing?

168
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,910
- Not so good.
- Yeah?

169
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,143
We're gonna see if we can figure
out a way to make you feel better.

170
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,413
- Okay.
- A private room would help.

171
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,653
Swing your legs up there for me.

172
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,157
Unit six going up.
Pressure, 90/50.

173
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:25,264
AC 12 on 100 percent. Tidal
volume 500, PEEP of five.

174
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,162
- You holding up okay?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,132
- Fluid in Morrison's pouch.
- You can't let Kerry get to you.

176
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,772
And in the left pericolic
gutter. Where is Surgery?

177
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,739
- Like riding a bicycle.
- With square wheels.

178
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,938
- Ectopy!
- V-tach!

179
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,980
Charge the paddles, open a
thoracotomy tray. Get ready.

180
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,446
There's no pulse.

181
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,348
He'll be fine.
Charge to 200. Clear!

182
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,818
- Charge to 300.
- Ten blade.

183
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,482
Clear.

184
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,497
- Asystole.
- Go ahead. Open the chest.

185
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,269
- A-positive is up. BP's 100/60.
- TKO the other fluids.

186
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,166
- Bring another dose of fent.
- Jessica?

187
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,601
- Are you her mother?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,208
She's stable. She's had
extensive damage to her hand.

189
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,435
- We need to get her to O.R.
- Can you hear me?

190
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,012
We've given her pain
medication. She may not respond.

191
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,172
- It's Mommy.
- Why don't you come to Pre-op.

192
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,217
- The surgeon will need to talk to you.
- Where's my husband?

193
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,823
He's in there. They're working
on him. Mrs. Brower? Mrs. Brower?

194
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,619
- P.E.A.
- Don?

195
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,159
- V-fib.
- Oh, God!

196
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,559
Shock him.

197
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,233
You the wife?

198
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,871
Your husband's injuries
caused his heart to stop beating.

199
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,872
- We're trying to bring him back.
- A thoracotomy.

200
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,566
- Charge again.
- You a doctor?

201
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,244
Researcher. CHEN: Clear.

202
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,082
- Still V-fib.
- Witnessed arrest.

203
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,912
- Charge again.
- Ten percent chance.

204
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,747
Clear.

205
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,016
- I told him not to worry.
- Still V-fib.

206
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,558
- Charge again.
- I told him it was safe.

207
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,389
Clear.

208
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,531
Agonal rhythm.

209
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,868
He's been down for 30 minutes.

210
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,939
You can stop.

211
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,604
He's gone.

212
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,324
Are you being treated
for your diabetes?

213
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,925
Look, I'm blind.

214
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,993
I'm not stupid.

215
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,891
I do okay.

216
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,396
It's not easy to get someone
to measure my insulin.

217
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,331
But that's life.

218
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,495
Look, you know, I'm just
here for the toenails, right?

219
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,141
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

220
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,470
You know, they're getting worse all
week. I think it was the new shoes.

221
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,471
When did you have them clipped?

222
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:59,415
- Oh, April maybe.
- They're pretty overgrown.

223
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:03,421
Well, listen. You think it's hard to
get someone to give you a sugar shot...

224
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,583
just try asking them to
clip these puppies. Heh.

225
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,925
Well, you know, I
can do that for you.

226
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,088
Of course you can.
You're a gifted doctor.

227
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,760
Or at least you
will be. Hold on.

228
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,163
Someone smells beautiful.

229
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,432
- A-choo!
- Bless you.

230
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,272
- Hi, I'm Dr. Chen.
- I've heard a lot about you.

231
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,609
I mean, good things.

232
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,346
And the bad things
aren't really your fault.

233
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,612
- Excuse me?
- Manny has a sixth sense about people.

234
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,621
- Or so he says.
- Well, with my eyes...

235
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,452
I had to get something
out of the deal.

236
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,026
What is this?

237
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,390
It's Mr. Kindlevich's
Seeing Eye dog.

238
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,624
- Well, where's his harness?
- He isn't official.

239
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,631
But trust me. He's
my eyes. I need him.

240
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,734
All right. Just keep him
on a leash, a short one.

241
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:53,963
Yes, ma'am.

242
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,972
Dr. Chen, can I speak
with you privately?

243
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,347
What do you want?

244
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,079
You know, eventually
this has to stop.

245
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,419
This attitude, this resentment
you have towards me.

246
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,185
- Does it?
- We have to work together.

247
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,489
I can't allow patient care to be
compromised because you dislike me.

248
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,565
- I wouldn't let that happen.
- Good.

249
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,668
Because the last thing I
need is a divisive medical staff.

250
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,604
Then maybe you should quit.

251
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,344
The police want to talk to you.

252
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,042
I told them to wait until
after your daughter's surgery.

253
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,052
- Has it started?
- Yes.

254
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,683
I should have told
him about the threats.

255
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,559
- We're trying to create stem cells.
- Using embryos?

256
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,760
DNA.

257
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,196
Cloning.

258
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,940
This was meant for
me, not him. Not Jessica.

259
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,214
Could I observe the surgery?

260
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,154
- It's probably not a good idea.
- I'm a doctor.

261
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,658
You're also a mother.

262
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,062
I'll see what I can do.

263
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,945
- Ow! Easy, kid. Easy.
- Almost there.

264
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,542
Hey!

265
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,582
- Sorry about that. FRANK:
Damn medical students!

266
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,612
He's all bark.

267
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,984
You know, you
remind him of his son.

268
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,854
I'm black, sir.

269
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,791
Oh. I can't see. A-choo!

270
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,798
- Did you want two sets of cultures?
- Mm-hm.

271
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:06,363
- My best friend Eddie has the flu.
- Yeah. Lots of that going around.

272
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,269
- We were shooting outside.
- It's freezing.

273
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,843
I tried to tell the photographer.
He wouldn't listen.

274
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,809
Abby is gonna draw
some of your blood.

275
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,176
- I have a good vein here.
- Okay.

276
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,119
Take a deep breath.

277
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,014
Exhale.

278
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,085
You don't have to watch.

279
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,457
I'm fine.

280
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,829
Just a couple more
vials and we'll be all done.

281
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,869
- Where are you going?
- I have other patients.

282
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,323
Yeah. It's the head.

283
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,825
You want to play with it?

284
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,331
- Hi!
- Are you feeling any better?

285
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,338
Hardly.

286
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,038
- Is she keeping you busy?
- Yeah.

287
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,875
I tried to get her down for a
nap earlier, but she wouldn't do it.

288
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:26,748
Ahh. Sometimes stroking her
earlobes helps lull her to sleep.

289
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,615
Can I get you anything to eat?

290
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:32,350
Oh, Rachel, I don't think I
can keep anything down.

291
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,756
How about some tea?

292
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,663
Sure. Sure.

293
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,100
Hello, sweetie pie. Oh.

294
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,371
Careful. You don't
want to get her sick.

295
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,869
Yeah.

296
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,273
Okay. Why did I
wear these shoes?

297
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,107
Ah. Because you
forgot that around here...

298
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,304
Comfort first.

299
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,710
- Yes.
- No, I didn't forget.

300
00:16:56,883 --> 00:17:00,047
It's just I'm not ready to go
back to ugly, sensible shoes.

301
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,712
I heard that you did some really
nice work in that trauma today.

302
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,418
- Doesn't count if they don't make it.
- Why did you treat pyelo with Bactrim?

303
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,960
Because the PMD sent
a culture two days ago.

304
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,098
I have the sensitivities.

305
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,564
- There's been resistance to Bactrim.
- Not for her.

306
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,603
If you don't have a culture, you start
with Levaquin or an aminoglycoside.

307
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,611
- Hey, looks like you made a friend.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, knock it off.

308
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,137
- Gallant, get this dog out of here.
- Thanks a lot.

309
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,576
- This is a hospital, not a kennel.
- What'd I do?

310
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,239
Tried to let her off the hook.
Whose side are you on?

311
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,318
Oh, I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm trying to play this very neutral.

312
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,251
No. You have to be on
someone's side. It better be mine.

313
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,618
- Deb, she's my boss.
- You like her, don't you?

314
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,760
- I don't dislike her.
- Huh.

315
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,920
- That makes a lot of sense.
- What makes a lot of sense?

316
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,498
- Oh, your taste.
- Excuse me?

317
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,364
John, it's obvious. You
have a thing for older women.

318
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,698
- What?
- Yeah. Weaver, Lewis...

319
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,341
and, oh, that pediatric
surgeon. What was her name?

320
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,774
- Oh, come on!
- Come on.

321
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,311
- Younger women just too much for you?
- I can handle myself either way.

322
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,643
- Yeah, sure you can.
- Your mom's asking for you.

323
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,979
What do you want to tell her?
- Where's my kid?

324
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,315
- I'm with a patient. WOMAN:
What'd you do with my kid?

325
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,717
- How's the leg?
- Much better.

326
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,859
- What you got?
- Leslie, unrestrained driver.

327
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,392
Slow-speed MVA. Drove
her car into some bushes.

328
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,793
Found her and daughter on
the curb. Only injury's a scalp lac.

329
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,490
- Where's the daughter?
- Behind us.

330
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,797
- Hey, Leslie. I'm Dr. Carter.
- Oh, I just bet you are, sweet face.

331
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,998
BP, 130/80, no LOC. And
enough alcohol on her breath...

332
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,075
- to start a fire.
- Hey, I resent...

333
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,006
- Hi. What's your name?
- Stacy Miller.

334
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,875
Thirteen years old. No
LOC. Says she wasn't hurt.

335
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,312
We're gonna check you
out, make sure you're okay.

336
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,009
- You feeling pain anywhere?
- Yeah, a big one.

337
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,553
You guys a bunch of
frigging perverts or something?

338
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,588
In my ass.

339
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,386
Excuse me?

340
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,494
- That looks pretty superficial.
- What?

341
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,856
The cut on your head.

342
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,154
There's a cut on my head?

343
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:56,227
Ha-ha-ha. I'm sorry. I'm
just kidding. You know... Ow!

344
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:01,206
- Softer hands, honey.
- I'm sorry. But I ain't "honey."

345
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,503
Why is everybody so
serious around here?

346
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,578
A pretty serious
thing happened to you.

347
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:11,241
No, no, no. See, this is a bump.

348
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,081
What's seriously
wrong is what's in here.

349
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,924
You having chest pain?

350
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,849
I have a broken heart.

351
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,027
Two great weeks, and he
leaves me without a word.

352
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,132
What the hell kind
of fiancé is that?

353
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,201
Trauma panel,
urine tox and a dip.

354
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,099
B.A.L. and hang a banana bag.

355
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,864
- Suture kit?
- I'll get it.

356
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,200
"Banana bag"?

357
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,710
- Is that the daughter?
- Yeah.

358
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,704
Lucky me, huh?

359
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,748
Stacy, we need to
get you into a gown...

360
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,910
- so I can examine your chest and belly.
- I said I wasn't hurt.

361
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,054
You want to get out of here,
right? Go home, clean the house.

362
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,418
Get your homework done.

363
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,460
- How did you know?
- I'm very smart.

364
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,857
Besides, the quicker you get
into this, the quicker you get out.

365
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,100
Ouch.

366
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,070
At least you were
being responsible.

367
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,840
Mom says seat belts
are too confining.

368
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,640
Nice example to set,
driving drunk and beltless.

369
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,976
She wasn't driving. I was.

370
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,084
- You're 13.
- Almost 14.

371
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,948
- You don't have a driver's license.
- Neither does my mom.

372
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:26,752
She still drives. I just take over
when she's had too much to drink.

373
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,091
You been doing
this for a while now?

374
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,753
Three years. Not one accident.

375
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,033
Till now.

376
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,768
Okay. We'll be right back. We
just need to get some more supplies.

377
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,811
That is completely nuts.

378
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,436
Or brilliant, depending
on your point of view.

379
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,279
A 13-year-old driving
her lush mom is good?

380
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,614
No. But neither is a lush mom
driving her 13-year-old around.

381
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,779
Somebody's gotta be the adult.

382
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,357
Everything was
going along fine...

383
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,995
Elizabeth, you awake?

384
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,995
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. She's sweaty.

385
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:15,972
- And she just started crying.
- Let me see. Let me see.

386
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,544
- Did you give her milk?
- No. Just mashed bananas.

387
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,544
Here, just take her a moment.

388
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,047
I'll just get the thermometer.

389
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,412
Oh, sweetie.

390
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,054
- How long's she been crying?
- Oh.

391
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,048
Elizabeth, she just threw up.

392
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,390
Oh, dear.

393
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,860
- Oh, come here, sweetie.
- Maybe she caught what you have.

394
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,498
Oh, it's okay.

395
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,225
- What's this?
- What?

396
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,498
- Get the phone.
- What is it?

397
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,162
It's a pill fragment. She
swallowed something.

398
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,605
Oh, my God! Her heart's
pounding. It's okay.

399
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,768
Rachel!

400
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,573
It's okay, sweetie
pie. It's okay.

401
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,480
It's okay. It's
all right, darling.

402
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,582
- It's all right, darling. Answer, damn it!
- Oh, my God!

403
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,521
It's okay.

404
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,627
- It's E.
- What?

405
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,855
It's Ecstasy. I had
some in my backpack.

406
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,032
<i>911.</i>

407
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,629
Yes, sorry. No,
hold on. Hold on.

408
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,032
- How many?
- What?

409
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:22,198
- How many pills are missing?
- Just one or two.

410
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,540
Yeah, sorry. I have a baby
with an amphetamine overdose.

411
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,241
<i>- What's your address?</i>
- Yes. 1211 Dupont Drive.

412
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:35,878
Please hurry. It's
all right. It's all right.

413
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,682
DUI's a pretty serious offense.

414
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,852
Yeah, but letting her sober
daughter drive was worse?

415
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,429
I don't know if it's worse.
It's child endangerment.

416
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:48,898
- You gotta get Social Services involved.
- Stacy goes into foster care?

417
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,866
That may not be
such a bad thing.

418
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,937
So you want to call
the cops, or should I?

419
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,733
Abby, we need
to find Dr. Greene.

420
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,170
Okay.

421
00:22:56,342 --> 00:23:00,404
- Abby?
- I'll take care of it. Oh, sorry.

422
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,105
Sorry. I got a little busy
there. Has his fever broke?

423
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,841
No. And he's very uncomfortable.

424
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,249
- No one's given him anything to eat.
- I'll make sure he gets something.

425
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,390
I talked to the Pedes Oncology
fellow. He's gonna come see him.

426
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,925
- Aren't you going to do something?
- Yeah. I sent off his labs.

427
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,120
No, I mean in
terms of treating him.

428
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:21,224
There's no obvious infection.
The oncologist can take it from here.

429
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,731
Oh.

430
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,404
It may be a while, if
you want to go home.

431
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,800
I can't leave.

432
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,703
- His foster parents still can't get here?
- No.

433
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,976
Somebody from the
center can relieve you.

434
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,238
I'm from the center.

435
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,050
Are you sure that you want to
do this? I mean, stay involved?

436
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,827
Do you think she'll
remember him?

437
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,226
When my daughter was 6...

438
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,768
she broke her arm in
two places riding her bike.

439
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:02,398
And the only thing she remembers
from that year is seeing <i>Muppets on Ice.</i>

440
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:07,539
They remember the good
things. She won't forget her father.

441
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,580
- Mrs. Brower.
- Yes?

442
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,811
I'm Dr. Romano. I finished my
part of the surgery, which went well.

443
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,349
Will they need to amputate?

444
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,951
- Uh...
- She's a doctor.

445
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,357
Oh. There's stable bone
on the remaining digits...

446
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,997
blood supply and enough
skin to cover grafts.

447
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,294
- So she'll have use of the hand.
- Limited use. But kids can adapt.

448
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,174
Corday and the paramedics are
on their way with your daughter.

449
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:38,811
What?

450
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,140
Came over the MICN
as an Ecstasy overdose.

451
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,875
- Did they say how much Rachel took?
- All I know is, she's vomiting.

452
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,313
- Is she awake?
- Uh... They didn't say.

453
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,514
- Who didn't say?
- I didn't take the call. Haleh did.

454
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,992
- What are her vitals?
- I'm sorry. I don't know anything.

455
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,326
I knew she was doing this.

456
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,330
I knew it.

457
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,171
I should have
trusted my instincts.

458
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,636
I gotta take the stairs.

459
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,543
- Move! Move!
- Sorry.

460
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,082
I got the charcoal! We
need a Pedes ICU bed!

461
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,914
- Where are they?
- Trauma 1.

462
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,851
Move! Move! Move!
How's her airway?

463
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,551
She's breathing on her
own, tachy at 180 and febrile.

464
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,094
- Oh, God! CORDAY:
She's diaphoretic.

465
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,203
- Let's get a rectal temp.
- What the hell happened?

466
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,862
- She swallowed Rachel's Ecstasy.
- What?

467
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,565
I'm not sure how.

468
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,769
She's sympathomimetic toxidrome.
And we couldn't get a line in the rig.

469
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,745
- Where was it?
- What?

470
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,282
It was in her backpack!
She had four pills.

471
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,714
Two have disappeared.

472
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,947
And Ella vomited
a fragment of one.

473
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:02,891
Bolus 100 of IV saline. Ten
milligrams of charcoal by NG.

474
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,930
- Prep a milligram of Ativan.
- They blew two veins in the field.

475
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,865
- I'm gonna try an interosseous.
- No! No! She's got a good antecubital!

476
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,702
- Oh, God!
- Heart rate's 250.

477
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,138
- Looks like a narrow-complex SVT.
- I need a glove full of ice.

478
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,074
And prep one of adenosine.

479
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:23,247
Dr. Corday, what is her weight?

480
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,907
Uh... Ten kilograms at
the pediatrician's last week.

481
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,180
Okay, here we go. Come
on, sweetheart. Come on.

482
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,880
- Twenty-four gauge in right AC.
- Push the adenosine.

483
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,050
- Lungs are wet. She's in failure.
- We need to break tachycardia!

484
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,696
The CHF is rate-related!

485
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,831
Could somebody get
me a stool, please?

486
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,999
- Still in SVT. Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

487
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,002
- Worry about my daughter!
- We're gonna need the crash cart.

488
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,766
- What?
- She's hypoxic with pulmonary edema...

489
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,902
in SVT. The protocol is to synch
cardiovert at half a joule per kilo.

490
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,447
No! No, we're not shocking her.
She's hemodynamically stable.

491
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,448
Maybe we should
get Dr. Weaver in here.

492
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,779
No.

493
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,422
Let's try two of adenosine.

494
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,721
Abby, get Dr. Weaver.

495
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,453
- Mr. Kindlevich, you still being treated?
- No, discharged.

496
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,159
Just waiting for the
van to pick us up. Oh.

497
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:19,471
- Stinky!
- Why don't you have a seat?

498
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,358
- Here we go. Just step straight back.
- Oh.

499
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,305
- There you go.
- He never leaves.

500
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,603
Well, I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

501
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,938
Stinky!

502
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,976
Stinky? Is that you?

503
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,175
Stinky? Stinky?

504
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,315
Oh, Stinky! Oh, Stinky. Oh!

505
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,152
He needed to take
care of business.

506
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,453
Gallant, you're a
student, not a dog walker.

507
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,959
- Bless you.
- I think I'm allergic to dogs.

508
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,726
Apparently.

509
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,701
- Next time use a plastic bag.
- Dr. Weaver!

510
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,739
They need you in Trauma 1.
Dr. Greene's daughter's in trouble.

511
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,668
- Second round's onboard.
- Stats down to 90.

512
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,251
Put her up to 50 liters of O-2.

513
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,903
- Still in SVT?
- Yes.

514
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,412
- Have...?
- Push 3 adenosine.

515
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:07,019
Mark, we both know how difficult it
can be working on a family member.

516
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,315
- Okay, get ready with diltiazem.
- And your own child in particular.

517
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,685
- I got it, Kerry.
- No.

518
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,487
- No, you need to step aside.
- I said I've got it, Kerry.

519
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,827
Calcium channel blockers can
cause cardiovascular collapse...

520
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,592
and death in kids under 1.

521
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,896
Mark.

522
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:31,172
- Push one milligram of Inderal.
- You're soaking wet.

523
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,539
- Please.
- Your pulse's thready. You have a fever.

524
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,681
It's just gastroenteritis.

525
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,311
- Sinus rhythm.
- Thank God!

526
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,124
- Number 8 French NG for the charcoal.
- Let's get Elizabeth to bed.

527
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,762
- And run in two liters of saline.
- I'm not leaving!

528
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,889
If you don't, you're gonna pass out.
That won't help anyone, least of all Ella.

529
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:59,437
She's okay. She's stable
now, okay? Go lie down.

530
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:03,269
- I want to be able to see her.
- I'll set you up in Exam 2.

531
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,544
- Damn it!
- Pulse ox is down to 88.

532
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,943
Lungs are full of
fluid. Fifteen of Lasix.

533
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,709
- Think about intubation.
- I can get her out of failure.

534
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,875
- She's retracting.
- Using accessory muscles.

535
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:17,318
- She's in respiratory distress.
- Give the diuretics a chance to work.

536
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,924
Put her in the Broselow
tape. Bag her on 100 percent.

537
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,119
- No. You'll hyper-inflate the stomach!
- Mark, your baby is hypoxic.

538
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,230
You want to avoid
unnecessary procedures.

539
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,889
But if we don't intubate,
you're making a big mistake.

540
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,558
- Now, step aside.
- Rate...

541
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:34,264
The failure was rate-related.
Uh... We broke the SVT.

542
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,271
But now she's in
pulmonary edema.

543
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,969
If this wasn't your baby, we would
have intubated her a long time ago.

544
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,579
I'm trying to save her life.

545
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:51,749
Pre-medicate with .2 of
atropine, 15 of lidocaine.

546
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,122
Induce with 3.2 of etomidate
and paralyze with 22 of sux.

547
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,735
- What size tube?
- 4.0 uncuffed.

548
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,422
- A number-one straight blade.
- Call for a Pedes vent.

549
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,467
Tidal volume of 100 cc's.

550
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,334
- We should be doing something.
- There's nothing we can do.

551
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,341
They got three doctors. I
think we'd just be in the way.

552
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,311
- Yeah. Did you hear how it happened?
- Yeah.

553
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,315
It is amazing the drugs
that kids can get ahold of.

554
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,180
Oh, my God! Is that Rachel?

555
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,018
Yeah.

556
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,223
John?

557
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,457
Mickey's been upstairs an hour.
He hasn't been seen by a doctor.

558
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,125
Yeah. That's not uncommon.

559
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,669
Well, it's unacceptable.

560
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,171
I was gonna get
coffee. You want some?

561
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,503
Yes. I'd love some.

562
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,413
I was hoping you could
tell me what all this means.

563
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,180
- You stole his lab slips?
- Yes.

564
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:00,315
I heard that they were back
but no one gave us the results.

565
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,664
What is it?

566
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,238
He's in blast crisis.
He's had a recurrence.

567
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,375
His bone marrow's
full of leukemia cells.

568
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,511
He's not gonna be
able to fight infection.

569
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:23,615
- Is there something we can do?
- I'm sure they're giving him antibiotics.

570
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,718
The oncologist will
know exactly what to do.

571
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,381
Yes, of course. But he's
just a number to them.

572
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,786
Maybe if you spoke to the doctors,
they'd take him more personally.

573
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,051
Why are you doing this?

574
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,559
You've been here all day.

575
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,290
You've been holding his hand,
clipping his chart, bugging the staff.

576
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,731
- I'm trying to help a sick child.
- Mom, he has leukemia.

577
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,031
- I know that.
- And he may not survive.

578
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,940
If you've got some kind of twisted
need to relive this, that's fine.

579
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,041
I'm not gonna do it again. I
made my peace a long time ago.

580
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,550
Let's pull the tube
back five millimeters.

581
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,384
- Are you in the main stem?
- At the carina.

582
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,082
You should be in bed.

583
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,752
Heart rate's down to
100. Pulse ox is 99.

584
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,557
When can we extubate?

585
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,064
They'll probably keep
her sedated in the PICU...

586
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,931
rest her overnight in the vent and
extubate her first thing in the morning.

587
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,403
Mark, we need them to
get a rollaway in the room.

588
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,770
- I'm staying the night.
- Elizabeth, you're sick.

589
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,105
- Well, you're not leaving, are you?
- No.

590
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,907
Mark?

591
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,981
- I found her wandering the hallway.
- Dad?

592
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,815
Rachel, where have you been?

593
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,495
I was just waiting
outside. Is she okay?

594
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,927
Does she look okay?

595
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,437
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

596
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:54,437
- Mark?
- Stay out of this.

597
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,599
You bring drugs into our house
and leave them out for a baby?

598
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,642
- It wasn't mine.
- Stop lying!

599
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,508
They were for a party. I wasn't
sure I was gonna take them.

600
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:03,944
Your sister did.

601
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,015
But she's gonna be
okay, right? It was one pill.

602
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,778
Are you really that stupid?

603
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,685
- Ella is 9 months old!
- I know.

604
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,553
- She almost died.
- Dad, don't...

605
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,354
Don't what? What?
Don't call you a liar?

606
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,692
Because that's what you are! You
promised you weren't doing drugs!

607
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,459
- I'm sorry.
- She could have brain damage...

608
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,862
learning disabilities, low
IQ, memory impairment.

609
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,630
- She could still die!
- I know, Dad!

610
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:30,503
Please, please, Dad. I'm sorry!

611
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,200
Dad, I'm...

612
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,809
Daddy, I'm sorry.

613
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,707
Dad, I'm...

614
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,593
- She still seems a little warm.
- We'll get a repeat temp.

615
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,926
- She can have ibuprofen by NG.
- I'll check the orders.

616
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,362
Is this the overdose?

617
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,299
Do we have a
post-intubation film?

618
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,700
Uh, I want someone else.

619
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,074
Let's see how she's
satting on 70 percent.

620
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,234
No, no, no. You're
not touching her.

621
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,437
- What's the problem?
- Page me another doctor.

622
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,141
- There's no one else on service.
- If we're going to control toxicity...

623
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:16,311
- we need to wean down the oxygen.
- Yes. Well, I want my own pediatrician.

624
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:19,253
- Is this your daughter?
- You are not touching her!

625
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:22,251
I have to. I'm the
Critical Care Attending.

626
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,451
No! No!

627
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,893
You do not touch my
child! Do you hear me?

628
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,589
- You stay away from her!
- Lizzie!

629
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,667
- We have to check the blood gas!
- Get out!

630
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,268
You heard what she said. Out!

631
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,399
Get Dr. Rosato in here.

632
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,105
Kerry?

633
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,832
Yeah. How's she doing?

634
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,172
Vitals are stable. Satting
well on 50 percent.

635
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,975
- Sounds like her lungs are drying up.
- Yeah, we've got a long ways to go.

636
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,916
My prayers are with you all.

637
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,220
Kerry...

638
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,297
thank you.

639
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,166
- Taking off?
- Yep.

640
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:14,836
If I hang around here much
longer, I'm gonna start to cry.

641
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,248
- Is your mom still upstairs?
- Don't know.

642
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:21,449
Don't care?

643
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,120
Hi.

644
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,192
- Hey, I thought you left.
- I wanted to say thanks.

645
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,624
The officer said that
they'd book her for the DUI...

646
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,288
but that I could post
bail in a couple hours.

647
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,833
Wait. They're charging
your mother with the DUI?

648
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,972
And I made an appointment
at that treatment center.

649
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,306
- Great.
- But you were driving.

650
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,399
- No, I wasn't.
- I thought you said she was driving.

651
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,478
- No, I didn't.
- What?

652
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,671
Anyway, I gotta catch a bus.

653
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,507
Good luck.

654
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,352
You said you were
gonna call the police.

655
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,980
- You said I was gonna call.
- I asked, "Will you take care of this?"

656
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,822
She's her mother's best chance
for recovery. I think you know that.

657
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,728
- Good night, Carter.
- Good night.

658
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,237
Hey, Gallant.

659
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,613
Your guy's dead.

660
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:44,831
Hey.

661
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,370
Rachel's here.

662
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,742
Did you call the police?

663
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,856
She wants to talk to you.

664
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,961
I can't.

665
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,993
- Elizabeth...
- I'm sorry, Mark.

666
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,570
I can't.

667
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,457
Let's get you
something to eat, okay?

668
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,529
I want to stop by. But they
probably want to be by themselves.

669
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,462
You want to go in
on dinner for them?

670
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,693
Have it sent over so
they don't have to leave?

671
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:53,269
Yeah. That'd be nice.

672
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,770
- Bye, Kerry.
- Bye.

673
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,403
- Good night, Dr. Weaver.
- Good night.

674
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,554
Stinky!

675
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,449
What are you doing here?

676
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,720
I've been trying to catch
him. He's running in circles.

677
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,560
And he comes back here. I think
he knows Animal Control's coming.

678
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,234
Oh, for God's sake! Go inside
and take an antihistamine.

679
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,205
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh.

680
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,738
Come here. I don't like dogs.

681
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,442
And I don't like your name.

682
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,842
Oh. Give me a break.

683
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,315
All right, come on.

684
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,733
You better be housebroken.

685
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:53,262
Because if you're not, you're
going right back to the pound.

686
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,699
- Who is it?
- Abby, it's me. Let me in.

687
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,600
- Joyce?
- Please hurry.

688
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,263
Hey.

689
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,838
What's wrong?

690
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,907
- Joyce?
- Turn out the lights.

691
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,569
- What?
- Turn out all the lights.

692
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,375
- Well, what's going on?
- I'm sorry. I had to get out.

693
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,678
- I hope it's okay that I came here.
- Well, of course it is.

694
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,413
But... Joyce?

695
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,618
Joyce, you in there?

696
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,226
Oh.

697
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,919
No, no, no, no. Don't go.

698
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,622
He's probably just looking
anyplace he can think of.

699
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,290
Open up, damn it!

700
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:33,137
- I'm calling the police.
- No. It'll just make it worse.

701
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,138
- He just needs to calm down.
- Joyce, you in there?

702
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,641
Joyce, we can't
hide in here all night.

703
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,642
Joyce!

704
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,143
He'll go away.

705
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,617
- When?
- Open up, damn it!

706
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,284
Bitch!

707
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,720
I think he's gone.

708
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,732
Can I stay here for a while?

709
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,230
Sure.

710
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,980
She's pretty tired.

711
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,950
Okay.

712
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,124
How you feeling?

713
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,591
- Kind of better.
- Yeah? They treating you okay up here?

714
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,891
They don't tell me much.

715
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,832
They tell her mostly.

716
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,648
You know what's
happening to you, Mickey?

717
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,421
I know it's back.

718
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,253
But...

719
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,252
I don't think it'll be
as bad this time.

720
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,566
I was by myself before.

721
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,970
She looks asleep.

722
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,773
But she's not.

723
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,954
Hey, you want me to...?

724
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,647
You want me to
take over for a while?

725
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,588
No.

726
00:42:56,941 --> 00:43:00,002
She is gonna come out of this.

727
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:07,016
Well, she may not.

728
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,922
She may never
open her eyes again.

729
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,324
Elizabeth.

730
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:21,493
I don't understand
why this has happened.

731
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,033
Shh.

732
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,008
It'll be okay.

733
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,787
Mark, you don't
know that, do you?

734
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,659
No.

735
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,459
No.
