1
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,973
Why is the dog bite still here?
- I don't know.

2
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,583
- Waiting on his IV Unasyn.
- Any particular reason?

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,810
Nurses aren't back
from ACLS class yet.

4
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,683
The sooner he gets his meds,
the sooner he gets discharged.

5
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:26,350
- I've done my share of IVs at the VA.
- There's no "I" in "team," Pratt.

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,691
- People really say crap like that here?
- No. But they should.

7
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,128
Dr. Weaver on line one
with a mouthful of marbles.

8
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,791
- What happened to her?
- Chipped her tooth in Barbados.

9
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,096
I told her not to open
bottles with her teeth.

10
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,763
So, Pratt, you wanna
check orthostatics in Exam 3?

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,536
- Why are you asking him?
- I don't know. He's got a cute ass?

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,009
- We're down three nurses.
- Hey, we can help.

13
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,638
- Point is, why should we?
- Let's all pitch in. Pratt, check vitals.

14
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:53,048
Gallant, why don't you start IVs.
And I'll discharge Martinez here.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,659
- All this because a nurse tells us to.
- Abby is the Obi-Wan Kenobi of nurses.

16
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:03,058
- So, what does that make you? Yoda?
- Learn from her, you will.

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,665
Might have to
separate these two.

18
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,666
Burns to the soles of
the feet from hot coals.

19
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,634
- Fire walkers?
- Lawyers.

20
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,165
- Why walk on hot coals?
- It was a bonding exercise.

21
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,676
- We're partners at the same firm.
- If I could walk, I'd kick your ass!

22
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,872
- Would have worked if she hadn't pushed!
- My feet were burning!

23
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,178
- Anybody smell smoke?
- Yeah, kind of.

24
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,752
Of course you do. We were charbroiled.
- No, it's...

25
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,685
- It's coming from your cuff!
- Oh, my God! I'm on fire!

26
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,992
Flames!

27
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,376
Oops.

28
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:49,025
- This is not a hotel, Stan.
- I got the chills. My teeth are rattling.

29
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:53,401
- I don't get no rest behind a dumpster.
- I have the flu. You don't see me in bed.

30
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,597
I'd like to.

31
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,610
What about that Hippo oath you
guys took? Do some good, be nice.

32
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,079
- Ask Dr. Pratt. He's handling you today.
- Is this because I'm new?

33
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,913
- No. Because you're annoying.
- Sure could do with a rubdown.

34
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,784
- Who wants the first tetanus shot?
- Me, so I can get away from this moron.

35
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,357
You have to come back
for wound-check tomorrow.

36
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,462
- Rather have my feet amputated.
- You don't have to do it together.

37
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,756
Showers?

38
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,474
Don't have to do
that together either.

39
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,263
That's fine. Just pat the
burns dry with a clean towel.

40
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,496
Dirty water running down to the
foot increases chance of infection.

41
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,434
- How about the bathtub?
- How about keeping them dry?

42
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,577
How about y'all kiss and make
up? Multiple MVA, two minutes out.

43
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,115
Marge Satterfield, bus driver
of a gamblers' special, 50...

44
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,445
altered at the scene.

45
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,111
- How's her airway?
- Wide open. Pulse ox, 98. BP, 110/80.

46
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,054
You were in an accident,
ma'am. Let's take her to Trauma 1.

47
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,127
- Busload of senior citizens.
- How many do we have?

48
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,059
I'll work up this
blunt head injury.

49
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,391
First one out triages.

50
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,796
- Could be a hematoma.
- Next one might be worse.

51
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,460
Colin Prentice, 21, driver.
Head-on collision with the bus.

52
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,129
- Was he restrained?
- Not very well. Two-inch scalp lac.

53
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,606
- Broke the steering wheel.
- He driving a Matchbox?

54
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:07,737
Worse, a Gremlin. We intubated for
a GCS 2-2-3. BP, 120/70. Pulse, 96.

55
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,282
- Trauma 2, let's go.
- Not by yourself. Get Dr. Lewis to help.

56
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,818
How's Marge doing? Our driver.
- We don't know.

57
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,253
Ralph Meyers, 73. Obvious
forearm fracture with deformity.

58
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,917
- You having chest or belly pain?
- No. How will I play the slots?

59
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,622
- Just use your other arm.
- I got another one for you, doc.

60
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,164
- Facial lac?
- Broken glass.

61
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,824
Lenore Fong. Neuro's intact.

62
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,993
- How old is she?
- Got me. Doesn't speak English.

63
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,671
- What'd she say?
- "Rude to ask her age."

64
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,936
Take her to Curtain 2.
Get it out of her, Deb.

65
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,804
Good. That might be it.

66
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,313
Or not.

67
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,715
- Did you call the nurses from ACLS class?
- They're all on a break.

68
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,482
Get some clerks or something.
We're dying down here.

69
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,184
Can we have our aftercare instructions?
- I'll be right with you.

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,353
- Miss, my colostomy bag is leaking.
- Just a minute, okay?

71
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,194
- My family has been here for a long time.
- We got hit with a big accident.

72
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,836
- Both of my kids are sick.
- Someone will see them.

73
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,869
Yeah, we were here first.

74
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,872
I hope my passengers
are okay. They're all so old.

75
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,071
- No hemotympanum, toes downgoing.
- She need the O.R.?

76
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,078
Nothing surgical so far.
Marge, any pain here?

77
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,308
Good breath sounds
bilaterally. No tracheal shift.

78
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,316
- I gotta go.
- Not until you get a vent.

79
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,820
- Call for a C-spine, chest and pelvis.
- I don't know the numbers.

80
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,151
- Look at the phone list.
- Systolic's down to 80.

81
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,261
- Run in two liters wide open.
- This really isn't my job.

82
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,473
It is today. Feels
like a pelvic fracture.

83
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,331
Hello, this is
Dr. Pratt at the ER...

84
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,025
<i>- Please hold.</i>
- Draw blood for a CBC and chem panel.

85
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,898
- I'm on hold.
- Type and cross for four.

86
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,732
- Find some O-neg.
- Got the SonoSite.

87
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,568
Oh, good. I need to rule
out intra-abdominal bleed.

88
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,404
- Chem panel goes in red top or green top?
- Abby, help.

89
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,774
- Excuse me?
- Go see if Kovac needs you.

90
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,042
- I need to start a dopamine drip.
- Top-right drawer.

91
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,345
- How's it going?
- Might get more criticals.

92
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,421
Everybody's got multiple medical
problems. Is this 400 and 250?

93
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,353
- It's a premix.
- Where's the head?

94
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,356
- It's not in here.
- Then where?

95
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,223
- No fluid in Morrison's pouch.
- Sir, you can't be in here.

96
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,423
- But I gotta take a whiz.
- Come with me. Hang a left.

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,569
Can you call my daughter?

98
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,763
Everybody move to the admit area
so I can assess all of your injuries.

99
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,464
- Wanna see my bruises?
- Not now.

100
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,405
- It hurts when I walk.
- Hey, Gallant, deal with this.

101
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:21,708
Listen, everybody proceed to the
north. We'll get you all taken care of.

102
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,284
- Where the hell is north?
- All right, got the pressors.

103
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:29,287
- I thought she was hypertensive.
- Probably vagalled with the blood draw.

104
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,755
You could check him for
compartment syndrome.

105
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,120
Why not?

106
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,390
Can you wiggle your fingers?

107
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,328
Damn foreigners ought
to just get their own bus!

108
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,806
- What'd she say?
- "I had a fever."

109
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,801
And then something
about his mother.

110
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,068
Probably set the
driver off, that gibberish.

111
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,442
- Marge was twitching, she was so mad.
- Twitching?

112
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,140
- Like a Holy Roller.
- Excuse me.

113
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,479
- Might have had a seizure.
- After the accident?

114
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,918
Before. She have a
medical alert bracelet?

115
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,147
Check her wallet.

116
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,452
Mental status is consistent
with a post-ictal state.

117
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,790
- I've got a couple of really sick kids.
- I'm busy right now.

118
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,365
- Half-load of phenytoin, send off levels.
- They had fevers a week ago...

119
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,434
- then developed a rash.
- No myoclonus.

120
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,664
- Pretty bad. Think you need to see them.
- Go, Carter. We got this.

121
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,177
- Sir, ma'am, this is Dr. Carter.
- Okay, let's take a look.

122
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:30,784
We thought it was chickenpox,
but I've never seen it as bad as this.

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,618
Can you lift up her shirt?

124
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,019
It's not on her chest
or her stomach.

125
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,022
Adam doesn't have it as bad.

126
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,768
- When did the rash start?
- Three days ago.

127
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,730
- How long have you been waiting?
- Too long.

128
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:57,639
Tried to tell that nurse,
but she said it was busy.

129
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,403
Could it be an
allergic reaction?

130
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:07,154
No. Would you excuse
me? Get masks on them.

131
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,890
- Hey, what's up?
- Where are the, uh, tubes?

132
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,392
- What?
- Those tubes with the posters in them.

133
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:19,226
Oh, those Public Health things?
They should be over there, man.

134
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,436
Oh, man.

135
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,073
What? What's going on?

136
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,082
Michael, would you
go get Dr. Lewis? Now!

137
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,382
I'm gonna move you to a private room.
Can you take Adam? Follow me quickly.

138
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,223
- What is it?
- It's just a precaution. Excuse me.

139
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,384
Coming through here.

140
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,829
Can you move out of the way?

141
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,923
- Why are we running?
- Just stay with me.

142
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,897
Right up here.

143
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,570
- All right, stay here. I'll be right back.
- What is going on?

144
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,945
- Where is she?
- Getting a central-line kit.

145
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,286
Susan, just come with me.

146
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,952
- I think I got two cases of smallpox.
- Oh, my God.

147
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,118
Firm, deep-seated pustules, all
in the same stage of development.

148
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,780
Just a bad case of chickenpox.

149
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:25,925
Centrifugal distribution
sparing the trunk.

150
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,567
It's all the major criteria.

151
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,829
We haven't had a
case here since the '40s.

152
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,303
It's airborne. We need
to lock this place down.

153
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,713
Okay. Elevator lobby, north
stairwell, south corridor are all secure.

154
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,214
- Security's locking the ambulance bay.
- Is that a fire safety violation?

155
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,376
- We're closed.
- Is Public Health on the way?

156
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,021
Do I call the State Department?

157
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,680
- Check the emergency response plan.
- This is the plan.

158
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,122
- I don't know. Call all three.
- Hey, hold on.

159
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,457
- Think you're jumping to conclusions?
- You seen smallpox before?

160
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,532
No, that's my point. It could be
anything. Scabies, pityriasis, chickenpox.

161
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,636
- This is not chickenpox.
- Are you 100 percent certain?

162
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,399
- You wanna risk exposure to the city?
- Whoa! How bad is it?

163
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,736
- Killed half of Europe.
- They have a vaccine.

164
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,969
- The CDC should have a stockpile.
- In Chicago?

165
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,579
- Atlanta.
- Oh, great.

166
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,738
Luka's right. Smallpox
has been eradicated.

167
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,645
I heard the Russians
had some on ice.

168
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,809
- If a terrorist group...
- Shut up, Jerry.

169
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,955
Damn, I should have
called in sick today.

170
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,489
- What?
- Lock it down. They're on their way.

171
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,149
- The entire hospital?
- The ER.

172
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,320
- What do we do about critical patients?
- You're asking me?

173
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,624
- They're brother and sister.
- Yeah.

174
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,893
- Five and 10?
- Yeah, why?

175
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,163
I think I treated them last
Tuesday. They presented with the flu.

176
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,307
I have a fever.

177
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,604
- You need to be quarantined.
- Hey, slow down, guys.

178
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,905
Susan, you gotta come
up with a plan now.

179
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,175
Okay, okay. Deb, Carter's right.
You're quarantined to Exam 4.

180
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,411
Jerry, pull the staff schedule
and patient log from last Tuesday.

181
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,920
Luka, re-assess all the
patients, group the criticals.

182
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,289
- I'll take care of Public Health.
- What about the kids?

183
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,495
Nobody panics. Nobody starts
any rumors. This is just routine.

184
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,638
Then you better tell them
why the doors are locked.

185
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,206
Carter, wait.

186
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,311
Do you know that family
sat in Chairs for 45 minutes?

187
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,038
- Should have been isolated.
- They would, had I seen them.

188
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:25,345
- Pretty hard to miss.
- We're down three nurses. I told you.

189
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,784
- What are you doing?
- If it's smallpox, it could get septic.

190
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,821
- Hope I'm not right.
- You'll need help.

191
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,152
Don't come if you're
worried about exposure.

192
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,659
I've already been exposed.

193
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,394
Who's in charge? I got a
cop telling me I can't go.

194
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,040
- Why are you detaining us?
- I'm about to explain.

195
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,375
If I don't get a
cigarette, I'll go postal.

196
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,178
Ma'am, please!

197
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:55,179
- Okay, Jerry. Does this thing still work?
- It did in '95.

198
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,010
What the hell is going on, huh?

199
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,913
Does this place
even have a license?

200
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,324
Uh, sorry. I'm Dr. Lewis. Uh,
as you may have noticed...

201
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,858
<i>there are guards
posted at all the exits.</i>

202
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,097
<i>This is because we have a
potential public health concern.</i>

203
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,326
<i>I would like to emphasize
the word "potential."</i>

204
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,699
<i>Because at present, we don't
have any conclusive evidence.</i>

205
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,863
<i>City authorities are
on their way to assist.</i>

206
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,600
<i>However, until we
have more information...</i>

207
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:29,010
we ask that no one enter
or leave the department.

208
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,242
What do you mean we can't leave?

209
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,942
This is purely a precaution.

210
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,919
When I know more, you'll know
more. Thank you for your patience.

211
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,528
- I want out of here! I'm getting out!
- My wife is expecting me!

212
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,960
Don't you understand? What kind
of authorities are you talking about?

213
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,726
- That helping?
- Do I look like her?

214
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,429
Not as bad. CARTER: Was
anybody sick around you?

215
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,440
- I don't think so.
- We were at the embassies, hotels.

216
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,134
We stood out. CARTER: Where?

217
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,748
Central Africa. Craig works
for the State Department.

218
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,883
- When did you get back?
- Two weeks ago.

219
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,946
Okay. Okay, we need to
keep you both in isolation.

220
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,116
- Why?
- You could be incubating the virus.

221
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,591
- You probably both are.
- You said 10 to 14 days.

222
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,988
We need to know where you've
been, who you've been with...

223
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,223
since your kids
developed a fever.

224
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,733
- The kids were in school.
- They could get sicker?

225
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,339
We need skin biopsies and smears
to send to the CDC biocontainment lab.

226
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,637
- They could die?
- We're being careful. Nothing's confirmed.

227
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,642
Dr. Carter.

228
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,066
Is she tachycardiac?

229
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,683
I don't know, but
you're freaking them out.

230
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,648
Slow down.

231
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,257
Hey, you okay?

232
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:49,157
Biggest public health emergency
of the century, and I'm stuck here.

233
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,356
Stuck? This is the
damn Ritz if you ask me.

234
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,842
Sorry. You got a roommate.

235
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,268
Oh, come on! Were you
really here last Tuesday, Stan?

236
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,030
Yeah, sure I was.

237
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,366
You know, they say this
could be very serious.

238
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,621
I've had gastritis,
hepatitis, pancreatitis.

239
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:07,538
A little, uh, pox is
not gonna bother me.

240
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:14,516
- You got a temperature too?
- Probably just a flu.

241
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,797
It's not smallpox. It can't be.

242
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,297
It's just gotta be a mistake.

243
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,670
- County.
- How in the hell long is it gonna be?

244
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,815
- Sir, I don't know.
- Will you pay for the hours I miss?

245
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,008
- Gallant, how are the seniors?
- Mostly sprains and contusions.

246
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,585
Thank God for small favors.
What about Public Health?

247
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:52,418
En route. But Chicago P.D. is
here, with billy clubs and handcuffs.

248
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,085
Gee, I feel safe now. Where
do you think you're going?

249
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,196
She needs a head
CT. She's not infectious.

250
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,724
Does she have a blown pupil?

251
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,095
- No.
- Then she can wait.

252
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,202
- She's an older trauma patient.
- Do you know where you are?

253
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:09,398
- Looks like a hospital. A crappy one.
- I'd say she's pretty lucid.

254
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,570
Dr. Lewis.

255
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,270
David Torres, Public
Health. We can take over now.

256
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,940
- The crisis or the patient care?
- This is for contact tracing.

257
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,109
- And this is for you.
- Okay.

258
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,949
The CDC will be flying in from
Atlanta. We need this area for our staff.

259
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,201
MAN <i>Dr. Torres, I'm
down in Engineering.</i>

260
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,955
<i>First and second
floor share ventilation.</i>

261
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,619
- Kill the a.c.
- It's 80 degrees outside.

262
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,823
Welcome to the hot zone. May
I see the infected kids, please?

263
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:39,231
No, the infection's in the bloodstream,
which makes the lungs leak fluid.

264
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,807
- But she's been responding to oxygen.
- We never should have been there!

265
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,238
You could have stayed home.

266
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,311
And your children
don't see you for a year!

267
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,879
100/60. Pulse, 98.

268
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,879
If there was an outbreak,
we'd have heard.

269
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,144
Craig, we were targets. A
maniac is using this as a weapon.

270
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,584
- There are a lot of unknowns.
- There's something wrong with Bree.

271
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,554
Pulse ox is down
to 83 on 15 liters.

272
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,748
What does that mean?

273
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,589
That means she's not
getting enough oxygen.

274
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,824
Come with me, Adam. You're fine. I
just need room to work on your sister.

275
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,468
- Etomidate, atropine and sux.
- What is that?

276
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,400
Medication to sedate her. We
may put a tube down her throat.

277
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,268
Abby, wait!

278
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,470
- We don't want to infect Pratt's patient.
- We need a pediatric intubation tray.

279
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,847
All right. I'll go around. Keep
her on 100 percent non-rebreather.

280
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,315
- We're gonna need another room.
- And a decontamination area.

281
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,019
- You gotta clear out.
- Could have a pulmonary contusion.

282
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,891
- What's his PO-2?
- I can't get an ABG down to the lab.

283
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,694
It's a mucous plug.
He just needs suction.

284
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,096
Then a vent, Neurosurg
consult, a burr hole.

285
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,296
I got an airborne
deadly virus in there.

286
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,533
- What are you doing?
- Moving him.

287
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,178
- He could crash in the hall.
- Smallpox could get him.

288
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,871
Little girl needs an
airway. I need this room.

289
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,607
Why don't you calm down?
We don't know if it's smallpox.

290
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,775
Bag him. Let's go.

291
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,547
- I need to get by.
- You can't.

292
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,217
- I work here.
- ER's been locked down. Move back.

293
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,453
- Why?
- Just trying to secure the building.

294
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,566
I'm the Chief of Emergency
Medicine. I need to get in there.

295
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,531
- I said, step back!
- Dr. Weaver?

296
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,637
- What's going on?
- They wouldn't let us back down.

297
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:23,572
Hi, it's Kerry Weaver. Get Dr. Romano.
No, don't you dare put me on hold!

298
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,905
- I heard it's something contagious.
- Like what?

299
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,912
- Excuse me, are you in charge?
- No, find him.

300
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,142
- They brought my fiancé here.
- They're not letting anyone in.

301
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:36,255
- Yes, it's an emergency.
- He got into a bad accident.

302
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,256
Marta Guzman, 18, GSW to
the right chest. Last BP, 80 palp.

303
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,260
- They shut down the ER.
- Nobody radioed us. I've got a GSW.

304
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,728
- My fiancé may be dying.
- You cannot go inside.

305
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,102
- Take her to Mercy?
- Not with her pressure dropping.

306
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,764
- No breath sounds on the right. Let us in.
- Not this entrance. Not this floor.

307
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,670
She is bleeding into her chest.

308
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,411
How long do you think
we'll be stuck in here?

309
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,176
I don't know.
Maybe a day or two.

310
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,744
Might have to spend
the night together.

311
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,386
You afraid?

312
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,421
Of catching smallpox
or waking up next to you?

313
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,228
Okay, looking good.

314
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,371
- No retractions.
- He likes having his own room.

315
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:29,134
- You like having a little sister?
- I bet you two never fight, do you?

316
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,368
- I didn't think so.
- The alarm's going off!

317
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,405
- Sinus brady at 45.
- Push .4 of atropine.

318
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,051
Kids can drop their heart
rate when oxygen gets low.

319
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,983
I thought you fixed that.
- Lost the pulse.

320
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,556
- V-fib. Starting compressions.
Get Lewis. ROBIN: Oh, God!

321
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,718
Hey, Pratt! Pratt! Get in here!
- Hurry up!

322
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,262
- Help her, please!
- Want me to start bagging?

323
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:56,300
No. Charge the paddles to 50.
- What's up?

324
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,268
- Vascular clamp.
- 0-silk's ready.

325
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,897
My children. They need me.
- Yes, they do, Marta.

326
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:08,173
So hold on. All right,
tube's in. Needle driver.

327
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,407
My kids. ROMANO:
Somebody say "Thora-Seal"?

328
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,418
- Right here!
- Be careful. You break it, you buy it.

329
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,854
- How about some Vaseline gauze?
- How about a 2-ton safe?

330
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,593
- Robert, I need to get her to Surgery.
- Tell me something I don't know.

331
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,197
Security's holding the
freight elevator. Meet there.

332
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,526
- 500 cc's out so far.
- Pressure's up to 100.

333
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,101
Why has the Public Health
Department closed the ER?

334
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,862
I have no idea. Elastoplast now.

335
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,972
Is there a communicable
disease in the ER?

336
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,700
Usually is. Pressure
bags on both liters.

337
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,620
Are you in touch
with anyone inside?

338
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,604
<i>- Yes, I am.</i>
- Who the hell is that?

339
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,000
- Chief of Emergency Medicine.
<i>- How many infected?</i>

340
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,117
<i>We don't know that anyone
is infected with anything.</i>

341
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,015
<i>What disease can
close a hospital?</i>

342
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,382
Don't say it, Kerry.

343
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,150
<i>- Maybe Ebola virus, anthrax?
- I told you, I don't know.</i>

344
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,461
<i>Set the chest
tube on water seal.</i>

345
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,909
<i>Are you aware that the
Smallpox Response Team...</i>

346
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,159
<i>has been dispatched
from the CDC?</i>

347
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,528
Why didn't you tell us?
- We're sitting ducks!

348
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,034
Clear.

349
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,551
Still fib. PRATT: 5
minutes since the last epi.

350
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,541
- Another .2.
- Why isn't it working?

351
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,009
Charging to 80. And clear!

352
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,653
- No change.
- Let's try procainamide.

353
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,547
You wanna give that to kids?
- 200 at 20 per minute.

354
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,017
- She's lighter than that.
- Know what you're doing?

355
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,627
- We're following protocol.
- Charging to 90. Clear.

356
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,214
Call someone! ABBY: Still fib.

357
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,093
I want someone more experienced!
- There's no one!

358
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,856
- Well, call them now!
- Nobody's seen this disease for 50 years.

359
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,023
- Clear.
- Why aren't you telling us anything?

360
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,726
We don't even know if it's smallpox!
- Give us masks!

361
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,235
You've already been exposed.
- To what?

362
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,322
We don't know, but we can help.

363
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:43,934
By letting us go! I
gotta get out of here.

364
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,773
We can't do that. We
won't do that. We need time.

365
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:52,851
Listen! Listen! The exits are surrounded
by the Chicago Police Department!

366
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,954
- The police?
- If you leave, you will be arrested!

367
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,021
We've been prisoners
for four hours!

368
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,214
You will be arrested!

369
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,361
- You better come check on Carter.
- Please return to your seats.

370
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,692
Please, I have to go home! I
don't want my baby getting sick!

371
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,561
Clear. ABBY: Fine V-fib.

372
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,253
- Could be a loose wire.
- It's not the leads, Pratt.

373
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,136
- Charging again to 100.
- Maybe it's not shocking her right.

374
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,774
Everything's
working fine. Clear.

375
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,045
Asystole. CARTER: Damn it!

376
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,478
She could be hypovolemic. Check
for a pulse with compressions.

377
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,151
If you can't feel a pulse,
she needs a fluid bolus.

378
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,913
- That's not the problem.
- Well, maybe it'll help!

379
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,684
Good pulse with CPR. She doesn't
need fluids. How long has it been?

380
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,222
- Forty minutes. PRATT:
How about high-dose epi?

381
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,693
- We've done everything.
- Could be worth a shot.

382
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,765
- That's it.
- What are you doing?

383
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,099
You have to keep
going! He had an idea!

384
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,969
You have to keep going!

385
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,609
Help her!

386
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,609
Tell the CDC we
have our first casualty.

387
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,755
- What are you doing?
- I thought I was helping.

388
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,659
You're not. When I call a
code, that's it. No discussion.

389
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,231
You overlooked high-dose epi.

390
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,767
Especially when the
mother is sitting there.

391
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,268
- It was worth a shot!
- Well, you were wrong.

392
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,374
- Well, now we'll never know.
- Do you ever listen?

393
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,669
- Do you?
- High-dose epi does not result...

394
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,746
in return of spontaneous
circulation, or increased survival.

395
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,905
If you read the literature,
you would know!

396
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,106
Or you could teach me.

397
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,912
I don't have time to stop
and explain things to you.

398
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,250
- I'm supposed to read your mind?
- No. Shut up and follow my lead!

399
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,722
Then lead! ABBY: Excuse me.

400
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,793
The Health Department
wants us to double-shroud her.

401
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,057
- I'll do it.
- You're not going back in there.

402
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,792
- The mother still has questions.
- I'll take care of it.

403
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,528
- She trusts me.
- I said, no.

404
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,106
- You feel hot.
- What?

405
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:59,076
- Abby, can you take his temperature?
- It's 100 degrees in here.

406
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,976
- You feel hotter than that to me.
- I feel fine.

407
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,184
You have a fever.

408
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,286
101.4.

409
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,823
- You always have to be right.
- And you have to be quarantined.

410
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,428
- You've been here for five hours?
- Six.

411
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,764
Six! That's outrageous. I'll
be with you in just a moment.

412
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,771
- Where are you going with these?
- We can't blow germs around.

413
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,342
Forget smallpox. We'll have 100
starvation deaths if we don't get food.

414
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,503
You've got 20 minutes,
then I'm ordering out pizza.

415
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,614
What's the name of
that Public Health guy?

416
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,148
David Torres.

417
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,115
- Your first name?
- Why?

418
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,345
Class-action lawsuit.
False imprisonment,

419
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:44,656
intentional infliction
of emotional distress.

420
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,316
Public Health has the
authority... Malik, who is that?

421
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,191
- What?
- That voice.

422
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,592
Jerry?

423
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,565
<i>Vaccination of contacts can
avert a widespread epidemic.</i>

424
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,093
<i>We refer to this strategy as
"surveillance and containment."</i>

425
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,538
<i>I want to assure the public
that there is no need for panic.</i>

426
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,837
<i>And that only those
in close contact...</i>

427
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,538
with the infected
individuals need the vaccine.

428
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:15,745
What? I was just calling my
mom. I love you too, Mom.

429
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,034
<i>Brian Meadows is on the scene...</i>

430
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,790
<i>talking with two nurses who are
unable to report for duty because...</i>

431
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:33,071
- Do you have to cover her face?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

432
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,241
- Do you want to take a minute?
- Yeah.

433
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,766
- Mr. Turner?
- My wife didn't wanna go.

434
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:06,201
- We don't know how the kids got sick.
- No, it's my fault.

435
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,638
Punch biopsy is next. - Okay.

436
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:14,976
Private jet will take the samples
to Atlanta for EM and PCR.

437
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,041
How's your breathing?

438
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,845
- Dad?
- Yeah?

439
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,013
Was she scared?

440
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,388
- What?
- Bree. When it happened.

441
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,828
She was asleep.

442
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,060
- Am I next?
- No.

443
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,068
You promise?

444
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,167
I promise.

445
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:03,323
- I have been ringing for 10 minutes!
- Hell, I had to ring for an hour.

446
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,521
What do you need?
Have to use the bathroom?

447
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,223
Yes! Not that it's
any of your business.

448
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,098
- How bad is it?
- Argh! Really, really bad.

449
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,034
What are you doing?
What's the point?

450
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,766
If they bring an N95
mask and a gown...

451
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:20,208
- I can at least use the ladies' room.
- Don't hold your breath.

452
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,439
It's not my breath I'm
worried about holding.

453
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,051
- Here, you wanna use mine?
- Ugh!

454
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,847
- Her Dilantin level was eight?
- Lab even re-checked it.

455
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,887
It's a water fountain,
not a birdbath.

456
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,719
Doctor, I can't take my
Naprosyn on an empty stomach.

457
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,555
- We may have some crackers.
- Crackers? You got crackers?

458
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:42,292
Hey, eighter from
Decatur! Boxcars? Oh, man!

459
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,767
Play somewhere else.
I need to talk to Marge.

460
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,929
- But she's our lady luck.
- It's important.

461
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,439
Party pooper.

462
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:54,336
"What's up, doc?" I bet
you hear that all the time.

463
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,643
How'd you get a
commercial driver's license?

464
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,286
- You have epilepsy, Marge.
- Just an occasional tic.

465
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,857
- I haven't had a seizure in years.
- Where'd you get your Dilantin?

466
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,987
Mexico? The Internet?

467
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,830
- You gonna tell the insurance company?
- You had a seizure while driving.

468
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,127
- Could have killed everyone on the bus.
- You said they were okay.

469
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,868
Come here.

470
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,171
That's the guy you
hit. Does he look okay?

471
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,968
What's wrong with him?

472
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,579
- Luka!
- I'll be back.

473
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,216
- Pressure's 60.
- Where's he bleeding?

474
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,617
The pelvic fracture. I
should re-scan the belly.

475
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,985
- Looks like the IV's infiltrated.
- Yeah, throw in a central line.

476
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:43,528
- Be ready to transfuse two units.
- Yeah, if we could get to the blood bank.

477
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,687
- I hear you had crackers.
- Haven't seen any.

478
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:49,335
Are people lying to me? I will kick
someone's ass if I don't get to eat!

479
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,527
Don't come in here!

480
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,535
- Etomidate's on board.
- Sixty of sux.

481
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,476
- You're gonna go to sleep now, Adam.
- Not like with Bree. Just a little while.

482
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,616
- Your mom and dad will be right here.
- Adam?

483
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,841
He's out.

484
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,146
Give me crichoid
pressure, some suction.

485
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,217
Oh, God. His upper
airway is covered in lesions.

486
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,553
- Can you see the cords?
- No, I won't be able to pass that tube.

487
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,059
- Bag him.
- Oh, no.

488
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,063
You have to crike him?
- I can't.

489
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:23,566
If I cut through the pox, it'll seed
his lungs and make him worse.

490
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,909
- No free fluid. It's a pelvic hematoma.
- Systolic's only 50.

491
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,911
- I get a flash, but I can't thread.
- I'm gonna go get a cutdown tray.

492
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,572
- Lost the carotid.
- Start compressions.

493
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,844
Carter's patient's in trouble.
We need a surgical airway.

494
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,045
- This guy's bleeding out.
- What should I say?

495
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,953
To do the best he can, okay?

496
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,328
We need to open the lower
neck to avoid the lesions.

497
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,760
A surgeon will come and
do a formal tracheostomy.

498
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:56,527
- Then he'll be better?
- Definitely.

499
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,870
- Luka's patient's in arrest.
- Get Romano.

500
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,871
- I don't think they're letting any...
- Just get him.

501
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,843
<i>- Dr. Carter for you.</i>
- How are things in the leper colony?

502
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,538
- You're on with Romano.
<i>- Hello? You called me.</i>

503
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,446
The kid needs a trach. I'd
like to bring him upstairs.

504
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,852
Forget it. You'll infect
the entire hospital.

505
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,180
- <i>Why don't you come down?</i>

506
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:19,291
- That's easier said than done.
- Look, I need some help.

507
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:23,687
I'll see what I can work out. Under the
circumstances, you may be on your own.

508
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,388
Just get your ass down here.
- Sats are dropping.

509
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,859
- Prep the neck.
- You sure?

510
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,504
- Yeah, sure.
- You said a surgeon has to do this.

511
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,567
- Yeah, I started out in Surgery.
- What does that mean?

512
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:40,543
- It means Dr. Carter can do this.
- Give me a 10 blade.

513
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,574
- Form a single-file line.
- I need it for my blood sugar!

514
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:50,382
- Damn it, people! We are not animals!
- And we are not children either!

515
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,251
- Dr. Lewis!
- Not now, Jerry.

516
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:56,054
- It stinks! Can we open a window?
- No!

517
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:59,426
- Bitch!
- They didn't bring any diet soda.

518
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:03,592
We're doing the best we can. A
little sugar is not gonna kill you.

519
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,001
Thyroid isthmus is huge.
Suction. Come on, suction!

520
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,505
- I'm trying.
- God, there's so much blood! Oh!

521
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,803
All right, hemostat.

522
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,605
- Bradying down.
- I can't even see the tracheal rings.

523
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,973
Another Kelly, 4x4s,
and keep suctioning.

524
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,345
Okay.

525
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,282
- Mr. Turner, squeeze this bag.
- No. No.

526
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:26,186
Put your hand here, keep the mask
secured and squeeze every three seconds.

527
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,556
One, two, three, bag.
One, two, three, bag.

528
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,697
He's dropping his
pressure. Spike another liter?

529
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,130
No. Keep this field clean so I
can see what I'm doing. 4x4s.

530
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,208
- They're not answering the phone.
- Things are hectic.

531
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:47,835
- Is he still okay?
- As soon as I get in, I'll check on him.

532
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,777
- Dr. Lutz...
- No statements at this time.

533
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:59,288
No comments. I have no
statement at this time. No comments.

534
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,724
Kerry Weaver. I chair the
hospital's Bioterrorism Committee...

535
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,659
- and I'm Chief of the ER.
- Why aren't you inside?

536
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,494
- I wasn't here.
- At least you weren't exposed.

537
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:12,229
- I would like to be able to assist.
- Only necessary personnel at this point.

538
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,566
- This is my ER.
- Not anymore.

539
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,868
Sorry, doctor.

540
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,533
Tracheal hook.

541
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,715
Retract cephalad.

542
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,718
- Short run of V-tach. Lidocaine?
- No, he needs oxygen. 11 blade. Got it.

543
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,015
Bag faster.

544
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,749
All right. Number four Shiley.

545
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,619
Pressure's 70.
Sats are down to 81.

546
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,198
- It won't go.
- What about a heliox?

547
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,030
- I can't pass the tube.
- Help him, please. Help him!

548
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,037
- Maybe I have to switch the tank.
- Do it, do it, do it.

549
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,640
I'll try a cruciate incision.

550
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,380
- You know what? Pull off my mask!
- What?

551
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:03,750
Pull off my goggles, my mask. I can't see.
I can't breathe. Just do it! I don't care!

552
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,287
Multifocal PVCs.

553
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,892
Come on, Adam!

554
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:18,133
- Lost the pulse. Starting CPR.
- Please. Please.

555
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,836
There. There, there, there.

556
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,351
Heart rate's up to 40.

557
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,789
Sats are coming up.

558
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,023
Strong carotid.

559
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,226
Is he okay? ABBY: Yeah.

560
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,764
Thank you.

561
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,698
<i>Somalia was the site...</i>

562
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,706
<i>of the last naturally acquired
case of smallpox in 1977.</i>

563
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,140
- It's a pox. I know it.
- It's a cold sore.

564
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,143
And I don't wanna think
about how you got it.

565
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,652
What are you doing?

566
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,349
That is completely illegal.

567
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,420
- "Necessity has no laws."
- Hey, hey. Come on.

568
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:16,892
Get your hands off!

569
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,888
Now, you are just peeing in there, right?
- Oh, shut up!

570
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,331
I'm getting thirsty.

571
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,805
Water's the best I
can do for you, bro.

572
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,667
Does this help? CHEN: No.

573
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,937
Got a shy bladder, huh?

574
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,944
Thanks.

575
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:42,077
- Why aren't you guys talking?
- We don't have a lot in common.

576
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,121
- Stan? You feel like singing?
- Yeah.

577
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,758
I'm not in the mood.

578
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:13,211
His oxygen level's up to 95.
- So he's better?

579
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:19,154
For now. The lesions are on the inside too.
There's still the risk of organ failure.

580
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,882
But you can prevent that?

581
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,927
We'll have to watch
him very closely.

582
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:28,957
How are you holding up?

583
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:35,097
- Oh, I don't know.
- How about your husband?

584
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,598
You'd have to ask him.

585
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:56,427
Good news is, it's not the hemorrhagic
form, which is 98 percent fatal.

586
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,928
That's a relief.

587
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,641
Do you think it would
have made a difference?

588
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,504
What?

589
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:15,812
If I'd gotten to them sooner?

590
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,843
Probably not.

591
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,418
Abby, Dr. Lewis needs you.

592
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,857
Really nice save, Carter.

593
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,893
- Know what she wants?
- Setting up the vaccine clinic.

594
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,369
- What does that have to do with me?
- I guess you're doing it.

595
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:49,472
We need Ativan! 15 liters
O-2 by mask. He needs a line.

596
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:50,975
He needs a drink.

597
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,085
He's having an alcohol
withdrawal seizure.

598
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,245
Like I said, he needs a drink.

599
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,295
- Okay, I'm in. GALLANT:
Dr. Chen, 4 of Ativan.

600
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,926
Throw it. CHEN: Get
sux and etomidate.

601
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,596
- Benzo's on board.
- I'm gonna bag him.

602
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,760
- Pulse is weak and thready.
- He's cyanotic.

603
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,903
Stan, damn it!

604
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:17,270
You're not dying in
here, you hear me? Stan!

605
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:25,214
- Guess he heard you. Sats are up.
- He's gonna need some Librium.

606
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,545
Not for hours.

607
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,950
That was exhausting.

608
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,714
Oh, yeah.

609
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,356
<i>Prick the skin 15
times as shown here.</i>

610
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,566
<i>This should be done rapidly...</i>

611
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,932
<i>in a perpendicular fashion
within a 5 mm diameter area.</i>

612
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:49,541
- You have enough room in here?
- If we clear this bed out, we'll be fine.

613
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,268
- We took a vote.
- Excuse me?

614
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,141
If we get the shot, we
won't get sick. We're ready.

615
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,511
- Yeah, unfortunately, that's not my call.
- Fine. Right here. Let's go.

616
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,345
- We haven't started.
- You'll get it.

617
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,680
- When?
- After we get confirmation.

618
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,517
We're hot and starving to
death. You haven't done a thing!

619
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,218
- We are running the tests right now.
- Let us leave. Call us when you know.

620
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:13,126
- Move back and give us some room.
- Listen, jack-off! You move back!

621
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,393
Okay, wait. I know you're
frustrated. I know you're upset.

622
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,901
- Forget it. I'm not waiting anymore.
- We have to do things this way.

623
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,869
- Stop stalling!
- You had your chance!

624
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:24,372
- Forget the tests!
- Please, just relax. Okay?

625
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:29,139
It's gonna be all right.
Just relax. Please.

626
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,315
We can use this! - Let's go!

627
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,883
Come on!

628
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,886
Move, move!

629
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,098
Slow down, guys. Slow down!

630
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,359
Hey, slow down!

631
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,009
One, two, three!

632
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:02,986
Guys, you don't wanna... - Move!

633
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,244
One, two, three!

634
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,416
- Keep going.
- One, two, three!

635
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,358
Hey!

636
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,762
- What is going on out there?
- I don't know.

637
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,746
- Where's Abby?
- I don't know.

638
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:39,282
- Why aren't we doing anything?
- I tried.

639
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,623
- Something bad's happened.
- No answer?

640
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,728
- Phone's dead. OFFICER:
Go across the street.

641
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,921
- What happened? Why?
- Expanding the perimeter.

642
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,828
- Just a precaution.
- I need to speak to your supervisor.

643
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,199
If I were you, I would go home and
be glad I didn't come to work today.

644
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,794
Uh...

645
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:34,496
This morning, a 5-year-old girl came
in with a rash that looked like smallpox.

646
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,833
She died quickly. Her
older brother is still critical.

647
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:42,310
We don't know what it is, and
we don't know how they got it.

648
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,507
But it's here and it
needs to be contained.

649
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,617
This is not about denying your civil
rights. This is about protecting you.

650
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:55,283
If we let you go, you could carry the
disease home to your own families.

651
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,057
So please stay here. Help us.

652
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,632
And we'll all get through this.

653
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,144
Uh-huh.

654
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,371
Yeah, okay, good.

655
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,977
- Let's talk in two hours.
- What?

656
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,883
Electron microscopy
shows a brick-shaped virus.

657
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,335
An orthopox? LUTZ: Right.

658
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,391
- So it is smallpox.
- Not necessarily.

659
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,892
- They're still running the PCR.
- How much longer?

660
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,554
Make yourselves comfortable.

661
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,530
Look at the bright side:

662
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,932
Only two critical patients and
we're closed for paramedics.

663
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:43,564
- So, what now?
- Well, we can watch ourselves on TV.

664
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,506
<i>So far, the only suspected
cases of smallpox...</i>

665
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,579
<i>are at County
General in Chicago.</i>

666
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:54,918
- 50 cc's of urine output in the last hour.
- Well, I guess that's something.

667
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,578
- His kidneys are working.
- I cannot wait to leave.

668
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:02,625
- I'm gonna take a two-hour shower.
- I'm gonna sleep for 24 hours.

669
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,458
- How is he?
- He's stable.

670
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:10,625
We know it's some form of
orthopox, so we need to limit contact.

671
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,101
- Haven't we been doing that?
- You've been doing a great job.

672
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:17,606
- The department would like to thank you.
- You're welcome.

673
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:21,735
Unfortunately, the two of you are gonna
have to remain in this quarantine area.

674
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,280
- Why? We're not infectious.
- Just a precaution.

675
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,385
Why don't you just follow
protocol and give us the vaccine?

676
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,646
As soon as we get final confirmation
on what we're dealing with.

677
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,648
- It's smallpox.
- The U.S. hasn't seen this since 1949.

678
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:40,357
Due to the unknown origin of this
outbreak, we're being extra cautious.

679
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,663
Won't be much
longer. Thanks, guys.

680
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,466
Oh, man.

681
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,176
How much does this suck?

682
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:56,906
"The department would like to thank
you, but we can't bring you a fan."

683
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:01,075
Is it me? It's like a
sauna in here. I'm soaked.

684
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:06,182
- Do you have a fever?
- No!

685
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,360
- Sit down.
- I'm fine.

686
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,256
Sit down.

687
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,689
- Take your temperature.
- I'm not infectious.

688
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,698
Stick the thermometer
in your ear.

689
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:26,440
Today started out
like a normal day, huh?

690
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:34,547
- See, 99. I told you.
- Okay.

691
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,188
You're still hot.

692
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:40,651
- Is that better?
- Mm-hm.

693
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,960
Worst of this is over, right?

694
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,870
Tell me we're gonna be okay.

695
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,726
We're gonna be okay.

696
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,563
We're gonna be okay.
