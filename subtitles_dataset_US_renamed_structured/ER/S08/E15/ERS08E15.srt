1
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,485
<i>Dr. Hirsch, please
pick up extension 350.</i>

2
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,719
<i>Dr. Hirsch, extension 350.</i>

3
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,910
I apologize for how
late he's running.

4
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,404
- It's okay.
- I'm sure he'll be with you any moment.

5
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,278
I can wait.

6
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,443
I'll see you in two weeks.

7
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,824
Judy will give you all your pre-op
instructions before you leave.

8
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,590
- Thank you. BURKE:
You've come to the right place.

9
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,126
- Mark, you look good.
- You too.

10
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,132
- How was your flight?
- Uneventful.

11
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,362
Yeah, the best kind.

12
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,005
Elizabeth with you?

13
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,038
Not this time.

14
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,669
See this area? It's called
"ring enhancement."

15
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,009
It encircles the cavity where
we removed your tumor.

16
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,310
Could it be inflammation
from a vaccine?

17
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,918
No.

18
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,622
What about a side
effect from radiation?

19
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,986
The spec MRI shows a
peak of creatine and choline...

20
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,153
with a depressed NAA, which
rules out radiation necrosis.

21
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,160
I'm afraid it's definitely
tumor re-growth.

22
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,992
Don't you need a biopsy?

23
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,538
Spectroscopy was conclusive.

24
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,472
How soon can you operate?

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,351
I can't.

26
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,512
Not this time.

27
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,420
The tumor invaded the areas of the brain
that control speech and motor function.

28
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,359
If I start digging around in there now,
the side effects would be devastating.

29
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,522
You wouldn't be able to
walk, talk, feed yourself.

30
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,328
Which is exactly what'll
happen as the tumor grows.

31
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,700
Some of the cells must've
been radiation-resistant.

32
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:28,740
So what are my options? I mean,
other than sticking a shotgun in my mouth.

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,252
Your best bet now is
stereotactic radiosurgery.

34
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,752
The Gamma Knife's safe and
effective. And they can do it in Chicago.

35
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,023
And if it works?

36
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,091
- The average is four, maybe five...
- Years?

37
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,926
Months.

38
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,899
So I'm back where I started.

39
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,436
You should've been
dead a year ago, Mark.

40
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,540
You got married, saw
your daughter be born.

41
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,082
I'd say that was
time well-spent.

42
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,581
Dad?

43
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,922
Dad, don't you have work today?

44
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,257
I'm up.

45
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,496
- I made you some coffee.
- Thanks.

46
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,568
You want some breakfast?

47
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,132
No. I'm good, thanks.

48
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,372
I'll be down in a minute.

49
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,588
- Elizabeth called. You were showering.
- Should've come and got me.

50
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,922
- Did she leave a number?
- No.

51
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,689
How am I supposed
to call her back?

52
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,130
She wanted you to bring some things
for Ella to work. I wrote them down.

53
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,394
Oh.

54
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,932
I can get all that stuff
and put it in a bag.

55
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,701
- No, no, no. I'll do it.
- I don't mind.

56
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,302
- How'd it go?
- What?

57
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,346
The conference in New York.

58
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,274
Oh, good. You know, the usual.

59
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,044
Boring.

60
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,920
So everything's set for
staying tonight at Kelly's?

61
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,022
Mm-hm. Yeah.

62
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,459
Are you sure you
should be doing this?

63
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,292
- This?
- Working a double shift?

64
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,629
- You seem a little tired from your trip.
- I'll be fine.

65
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,203
Iverson in 4 needs about
another hour of monitoring.

66
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,068
Dunn, also in 4, is probably
gonna need a walking cast.

67
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,641
The foot x-rays are pending.

68
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,744
Dr. Lewis is crashed out in 3.

69
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,311
- Susan?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,846
She... She worked a
double, so don't wake her up.

71
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:53,180
And last but not least is the lovely but
kind of spooky Miss Armstrong in 2...

72
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,915
who's waiting on a Psych consult
before the sewer people come get her.

73
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,322
- What sewer people?
- She's crazy. Hence, the Psych consult.

74
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,894
And there's a bad burn
trauma coming in, so have fun.

75
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,588
- Right.
- He called again.

76
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,700
- Ugh. Randall?
- Five calls in 18 hours.

77
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,166
Sounds like a stalker.

78
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,033
- You want me to talk to him?
- No. Thanks.

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,367
- What are you looking at?
- Theresa Matthews.

80
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,670
Comatose for a year following an
MVA. Mom takes care of her at home.

81
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,177
Called 911, thought her
daughter was in discomfort.

82
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,107
- How could she tell?
- My question too.

83
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:26,243
Dr. Kovac wants you to meet him in
the ambulance bay with Tartaglia's x-rays.

84
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,285
- Really?
- He said it was an emergency.

85
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,014
- Tartaglia from last night?
- The one with the whiplash.

86
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,184
- Just telling you what he said.
- More information might've helped.

87
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,593
- Am I talking to you?
- Knock it off and help me find it.

88
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,800
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,075
Who's your friend?

90
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,140
Would you mind telling
me what's going on?

91
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,807
He was gonna give me a ticket.

92
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:01,614
- Excuse me?
- I told him I had an emergency.

93
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,121
Oh, so you used me
to get out of a ticket.

94
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,759
It would have been a big ticket.

95
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,088
I'm glad you could pull
me away from patients...

96
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,787
so you could
avoid traffic school.

97
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,829
I owe you one.

98
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,335
Nice car. Did he get
the leopard-print interior?

99
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,308
- You off?
- Not till 10.

100
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,072
- What did you do to deserve that?
- I asked.

101
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,916
This way, I'm never
home when my neighbor is.

102
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,985
He's out on bail?

103
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,088
Till the trial.

104
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,121
Then I get my life back.

105
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,623
- How's his wife?
- She's good.

106
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,056
Safe.

107
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,788
How are you?

108
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,193
How's the eye?

109
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,857
Good. I think my Good
Samaritan days are over, though.

110
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,570
You probably saved her life.

111
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,105
Steady midnights, that can be
tough. You getting enough sleep?

112
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,504
Yeah? Eating okay?

113
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,114
- Feeling depressed or anxious?
- I have to get back.

114
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,614
- Call if you want to talk.
- I'm good.

115
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,617
Coffee and pie on me
if you change your mind.

116
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:16,794
Hey. What does a girl have to do
to get a cup of coffee around here?

117
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,693
- Mark?
- Hey.

118
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,460
I just worked two shifts. I'm
supposed to be the zombie.

119
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,900
- Little slow getting started this morning.
- How was New York?

120
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,473
Well, I didn't see as many
Broadway plays as I'd hoped.

121
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,075
And my tumor's back.

122
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,974
Oh, God, Mark, I'm sorry.

123
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,808
I do Gamma Knife today.

124
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,076
- Today? What are you doing here?
- It's best to stay busy.

125
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,585
- How's Elizabeth taking it?
- I haven't told her yet.

126
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,691
What? Why not? Mark, you
shouldn't be going through this alone.

127
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,156
I'll see her this afternoon.

128
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,919
- What time's your treatment?
- 1:30.

129
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,927
I'm gonna go home and get
some rest. But after, I'll come by...

130
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,531
- You don't have to.
- I want to.

131
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,497
Dr. Greene, Dr. Weaver
needs some help.

132
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,535
All right, I'll let you
go. Bye. Good luck.

133
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,401
- What patient?
- She's got an elderly woman in CHF.

134
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,337
An explosion
trauma just rolled in...

135
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,536
and there's an MVA with a
possible spinal injury 10 minutes out.

136
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,045
- They need you in Trauma 2. Burn victim.
- Okay.

137
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,206
- I'm firing that new guy.
- What new guy?

138
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,612
Jerry.

139
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,344
Jerry was here
before you, Frank.

140
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,080
So was the Neanderthal
man, but he didn't last either.

141
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,090
- You can't fire anybody.
- Either he goes or I go.

142
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,421
You... You! You'll be
hearing from my lawyer.

143
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,756
- What'd I do?
- Mark, coffee.

144
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,968
Mr. Nevinger, did you pass out?
- No.

145
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,866
Full trauma panel, portable
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

146
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,701
Start a second IV with LR.

147
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:39,244
Add an ABG with
carboxyhemoglobin and a CK.

148
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,246
Sats, 94. Pulse, 120. Can I
give him something for pain?

149
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,874
Titrate 10 of morphine. But watch
his pressure. Keep him above 90.

150
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,112
Carbonaceous materials
on his nose and lips.

151
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,813
He's not moving much air.

152
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,122
He's in too much
pain to breathe.

153
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,295
- How much fluid?
- One liter per hour for the first 8 hours.

154
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,489
I'll ask my super. I think there's
a waiting list for my building.

155
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,224
There's been an old lady
who's been sick on my floor.

156
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,132
I don't want to live in an
apartment where somebody died.

157
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,570
All you need is some Lysol and
some air freshener, and it's all good.

158
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,299
Are you moving? ABBY: Yeah.

159
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,468
The freak who hit
me moved back in.

160
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,507
You can stay at my place
till you find something else.

161
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,980
Thanks. I don't know
if that's a good idea.

162
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,454
- Why not?
- Yeah, Abby. Why not?

163
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,587
Don't you guys have
something to do?

164
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,926
You shouldn't have to leave
your own place. He should move.

165
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,324
He'll be in jail soon.

166
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,661
I just don't know if I want
to live there after all this.

167
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,831
- What's with the car?
- Like it?

168
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,971
- It's kind of flashy.
- You only live once.

169
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,540
Well, not if you keep
driving like a maniac.

170
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,339
- You look kind of tired.
- Yeah. I was up late.

171
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,104
Oh, really? What's her name?

172
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,010
- Who?
- It's a joke, Luka.

173
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,515
- No, seriously. If you need a place...
- Thank you.

174
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,121
Stay as long as you need. You only
have to sleep with me on the weekends.

175
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,985
- Excuse me?
- It's a joke, Abby. It's a joke.

176
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,218
Who called for a consult?

177
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,884
Burn patient. Trauma 2.

178
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,121
- What doctor?
- Greene.

179
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:07,298
- Make it stop hurting.
- We're trying, Ian.

180
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,468
- How's his PO-2?
- Eighty-nine on 10 liters.

181
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,663
- Borderline.
- I don't want to tube him yet.

182
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,967
Why not? He's hypoxic.
He needs intubation.

183
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,905
Then I can assess
him for escharotomy.

184
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,068
Dr. Greene, his wife's here.

185
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,679
That's why I've been waiting.

186
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,372
Keep an eye on him.

187
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,256
- Mrs. Nevinger, I'm Dr. Greene.
- Can I see him?

188
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,550
- The surgeon's in with him now.
- The surgeon?

189
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,320
The burns caused constrictive
tissue-swelling around his chest.

190
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,988
He may need a procedure to
relieve that so he can breathe easier.

191
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,363
- You have to do an escharotomy?
- Maybe.

192
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,165
- You in the medical profession?
- Yeah. I'm a nurse at Mercy.

193
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,399
- Is he intubated?
- Not yet.

194
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,601
What's the surface area?

195
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,938
Over 50 percent.

196
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,842
Oh, God.

197
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,313
Do you know how it happened?

198
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,678
He was in the garage painting some
new furniture for our son's bedroom.

199
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,755
Did he have a heater
on in the garage?

200
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,360
No. He paints cars. He knows he
has to be careful around that stuff.

201
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,962
Well, we're gonna do
everything we can. Okay?

202
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,760
Repeat the blood
gas in 20 minutes...

203
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,198
and have a fiber-optic
scope standing by.

204
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,201
Elizabeth.

205
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,830
- How is he?
- In need of intubation.

206
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,370
I brought the things
you asked me to bring.

207
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,308
Thank you.

208
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,243
What are we doing?

209
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,908
I miss you and Ella. I
need you to come home.

210
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,781
I can't.

211
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,819
You have every right
to be angry with me.

212
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,322
But staying in a hotel
isn't gonna solve anything.

213
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,551
Mark, I'm not
trying to punish you.

214
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,889
I'm just trying to do
what's best for Ella.

215
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,328
Don't you think it's best for her
to be with her mother and father?

216
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,661
- Yes, I do.
- So when are you coming home?

217
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,632
I don't know.

218
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,241
Aaron, how many
lights do you see?

219
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,575
One. There's nothing wrong with
my eyes. It's my arms and my legs.

220
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,718
Okay, Aaron, I need
you to lay absolutely still.

221
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,877
No sign of cranial nerve
impaction or blowout fracture.

222
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,148
Bilateral TM's clear. No blood.

223
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,554
Does it hurt when I press
here or just the sides?

224
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,387
Both. WEAVER:
Foreface is stable.

225
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,889
No dental fractures. - Ah!

226
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,555
Okay. We're gonna leave
the collar on for a while.

227
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:24,901
Let's tape down his head
and use sandbags to stabilize.

228
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,767
- Can you feel this?
- No.

229
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,099
- How's he doing?
- It's too early to tell.

230
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,007
- Can he tell me what happened?
- It was a sledding accident.

231
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,407
Yeah, his dad got smashed...

232
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,674
and was pulling him and his friend
on a sled behind a snowmobile.

233
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,283
Smelled alcohol on his breath?

234
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,285
No. But he seemed
out of it. Maybe drugs.

235
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,788
Lungs are clear bilaterally.
Normal heart tones.

236
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,216
- You going somewhere?
- What?

237
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,885
That's the third time
you've looked at the clock.

238
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,763
- Aaron, can you feel this?
- No.

239
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,424
- What about now?
- No.

240
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,598
- Anything?
- No.

241
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,263
- Why can't I feel my arms?
- Just relax. We're trying to help you.

242
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,069
I'm gonna go speak
with the father.

243
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,302
Prep the Solu-Medrol,
hold the scanner.

244
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,946
Okay, give me a reflex hammer.

245
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,117
Mr. James, I'm Dr. Greene.
I'm treating your son, Aaron.

246
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,480
He got hurt.

247
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,621
He has no feeling
in his arms and legs.

248
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,780
We're sending him
for x-rays and an MRI.

249
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,892
We'll have a better idea...

250
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,893
once the neurosurgeon's had
a chance to assess his injury.

251
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,587
This is all my fault.

252
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,632
You were pulling him and his
friend behind a snowmobile?

253
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,928
I knew it was wrong.

254
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,573
- You been drinking?
- You mean booze?

255
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,969
No.

256
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,007
I told them.

257
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,003
- Told who?
- Aaron and Chris that we shouldn't.

258
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,148
But they kept bugging me to.

259
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,507
Well, that's where
adult judgment comes in.

260
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,152
- Hey, idiot!
- Is there a problem?

261
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,017
Yeah. My son's got a broken
arm thanks to Dumb and Dumber.

262
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,488
- You could've killed them!
- It was an accident.

263
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,287
- Settle down, sir.
- I'll settle down after he's arrested.

264
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,659
Look, he shouldn't be allowed
to operate a motor vehicle.

265
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,322
He's only got half a brain.

266
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,869
I'm serious. His wife even
left him because he's lost it.

267
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,164
Let's go over
here and talk, sir.

268
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,774
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

269
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,139
He's kind of right. I would've
never done this before I was stupid.

270
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,643
Here, sit down.

271
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,338
What happened?

272
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,781
July 17th, 1997.
It was very hot.

273
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,353
I took off my hardhat so I could
wipe the sweat off my forehead.

274
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,254
And a pipe fell loose from
the fitting above me, and boom.

275
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,723
- Head injury?
- My brain doesn't work like it used to.

276
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,958
- Does Aaron live with you now?
- Sometimes.

277
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,661
We're buddies now. We
don't fight like we used to.

278
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,231
- He's gonna get better, right?
- I hope so.

279
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,706
Dr. Greene, Mrs. Nevinger's wondering
about an update on her husband.

280
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:47,045
- I'll be back to tell you about your son.
- Thank you.

281
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,875
- Get a red top on Mr. James.
- Sure.

282
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,984
- Nobody's telling me anything.
- He's still in with the surgeon.

283
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,053
Why don't you sit down
here, and I'll find out.

284
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,986
Oh, Abby. District
attorney's office called.

285
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,524
Your subpoena's been revoked.

286
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,821
- Revoked?
- Trial's been canceled.

287
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,554
What?

288
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,834
- Why?
- I don't know. Some legal snafu, I guess.

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,233
You know about lawyers. They're half
as smart as doctors but twice as sneaky.

290
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,046
Ian, your wife's here.

291
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,615
She wants to come
in and see you.

292
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,409
Is she alone?

293
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,884
No. Your sons are with her.

294
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,881
I don't want them
to see me like this.

295
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,460
I'm gonna have to put a tube down
your throat to protect your airway.

296
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,424
Once I do that, you won't
be able to talk to them.

297
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,965
I don't care.

298
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,593
Your urine tested
positive for amphetamines.

299
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,466
Want to tell me why?

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,701
I've been working two jobs.

301
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,605
Sometimes I need a little
help to keep me going.

302
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,912
How do you take it?

303
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,452
Do you smoke it?

304
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,124
Did you light up with all
those fumes in the garage?

305
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,954
I wanted to finish the dresser.

306
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,104
Birthday's on Saturday.

307
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,499
Hey, where have you been?

308
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,109
Elizabeth.

309
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,083
I was down in the ER.

310
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,650
Let me guess. A rule-out
appy on a corpse?

311
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,013
- No.
- Well, you're lucky.

312
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,985
I'm starting to think "ER"
stands for "everyone's retarded."

313
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:41,321
Honestly, it's a wonder they all
find their way to work every day.

314
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:45,124
Excuse me, Dr. Corday. Your nanny called,
said they're just leaving the hotel.

315
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,493
Thanks.

316
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,532
That sounds kinky.

317
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,531
- Do you need something, Robert?
- Yes, actually.

318
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:55,106
Your buddy Benton left us with
eight delinquent operative reports.

319
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,334
He said he was stopping
by sometime this week.

320
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,275
He wouldn't be caught dead
here. They are now your problem.

321
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,606
- I'm not the operating surgeon.
- I don't give a damn.

322
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,188
I want a dictated note on every
chart before our JCAHO review.

323
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,245
I'm being paged to the ER.

324
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,686
If I don't have them by tomorrow,
I'll report him to the medical board.

325
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,791
Someone is very popular today.

326
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,861
Oh, Jerry, give me a break.

327
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,188
I could have one of my
buddies on the force...

328
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,560
do a background
check on this Randall.

329
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,635
- Isn't that nice to know.
- Now, what's that supposed to mean?

330
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:28,366
It means that the continuing invasion
of personal privacy by law enforcement...

331
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,635
is appalling, not
to mention immoral.

332
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,338
Well, you have nothing to worry
about if you don't have anything to hide.

333
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,039
- Malcontent.
- Psycho fascist.

334
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,014
- Now, that's it!
- Settle down, you two.

335
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:42,019
- You wanna start something, tough guy?
- Bring it on, gramps.

336
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,054
Gramps? Who are
you calling gramps?

337
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,757
Guys, stop it. Both of
you, stop it! Hey. Hey.

338
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,893
Ah!

339
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,831
- Look what you did.
- You did it.

340
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,558
- Will you both shut up?
- You okay?

341
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,670
- Can I get a doctor here?
- What happened?

342
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:01,774
Dennis Cooper, 32. Multiple GSWs to the
chest. I got his 8-year-old daughter too.

343
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,203
- Was she shot?
- No.

344
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,369
Dad arrested about a minute out.
No BP, but good pulse with CPR.

345
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,777
All right. Somebody page Corday
and open a thoracotomy tray.

346
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,211
Spreader.

347
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,216
Okay, crank it open. Suction.

348
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,117
- What do you need?
- No. It slipped. I need to reset the lip.

349
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,918
- I could use a subclavian.
- Eight French cordis introducer.

350
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,560
Gallant's with the daughter.

351
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,754
Paramedics don't think she's
injured, but she was covered in blood.

352
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,296
I've got it, Kerry.

353
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,094
- Open up the pericardium.
- Pick-up.

354
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,693
What's her status, Gallant?

355
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,740
She has a couple superficial abrasions.
No evidence of any penetrating injuries.

356
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,877
I don't think any
of this is her blood.

357
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,104
Hey, who is your friend?

358
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,783
The first officers on the scene
found her hiding under a table.

359
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,614
By the looks of it, she saw everything,
including who shot her father.

360
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,451
So, what's your name?

361
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,759
- I couldn't get her to say.
- Her name is Brianne Cooper.

362
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,663
Brianne, I'm Dr. Weaver.

363
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,805
And we're trying to make
your daddy better, okay?

364
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,770
- Okay.
- All right.

365
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,275
- Now, are you hurt?
- I don't think so.

366
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,003
Did you see who
shot your father?

367
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,808
- Do you mind?
- I need to know.

368
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,314
Yeah. And I need to make
sure that she's all right.

369
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,352
- Wait outside until we're finished.
- Her father is known...

370
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,988
Outside means outside.

371
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,493
- Should I call DCFS?
- Mm-hm.

372
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,688
Don't worry, Brianne.

373
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:36,165
You and your daddy are safe here.
Nobody's gonna hurt you now, okay?

374
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,334
- She wasn't hurt.
- Physically, no.

375
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,269
But she's showing signs of
post-traumatic stress disorder.

376
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,433
You have to wait until the
psychiatrist is finished with her.

377
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,010
- How long will that take?
- Look.

378
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,046
Some girl just saw somebody
put five bullets into her father.

379
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,116
Yeah. And I need
to know who did it.

380
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,776
Her father's a well-known drug dealer
and a murder suspect in his own right.

381
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:58,686
If whoever did this finds out she was
the only witness, they may finish the job.

382
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:03,395
- What about her mother?
- She's a junkie and a possible suspect.

383
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,966
All right. Post an officer outside
her room, and I'll try to speak with her.

384
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,363
Okay, fine.

385
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:13,870
We did the best we could, but the
bullet passed through Mr. Cooper's aorta.

386
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,741
- How's the little girl?
- She's still in shock.

387
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,041
- You like me to speak to her for you?
- No, I think I should do it. But thanks.

388
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,910
Sorry about the delay.
I got a little backed up.

389
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,984
No problem.

390
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:32,889
The whole procedure only takes about
40 minutes once we get started, okay?

391
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,191
This frame provides
reference points...

392
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:40,060
so we can pinpoint the tumor
with 201 separate gamma rays.

393
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,996
Hope you're a good shot.

394
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,728
Well, the machine's
accurate up to .3 millimeters.

395
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:48,033
- What if I sneeze?
- Just try not to.

396
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,541
It could vaporize all the brain
matter in your skull cavity.

397
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,575
Kidding, Dr. Greene. You won't be able
to move once we lock the frame down.

398
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,911
- Any last questions?
- Nope.

399
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,212
All right. See you
in a few minutes.

400
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,257
Just try and relax, Dr. Greene.

401
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,893
I'm ready.

402
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,901
- Has anybody seen Dr. Greene?
- He left.

403
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,842
Already?

404
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,542
- Did he say where he was going?
- Sorry.

405
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:35,453
- We have an appointment.
- I can page him.

406
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,854
You should take it easy
for the rest of the day.

407
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,256
No problem.

408
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,127
A few people report
headaches, nausea and vomiting.

409
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,528
What about seizures?

410
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,535
Less than 10 percent experience
seizures in the next 24 hours.

411
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,366
But you're on Dilantin...

412
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,771
and we gave you some Decadron
to reduce the risk of brain edema.

413
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,242
- Is there someone to drive you home?
- I took the El.

414
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,879
- Is someone staying with you tonight?
- My daughter.

415
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,314
It would be better
if it's an adult.

416
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,044
Rachel's a teenager.

417
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,588
Well, just have her check on you,
and call if there are any problems.

418
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:16,759
Call Dr. Sanders and tell him I
can't see his patient until Monday.

419
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,420
Yes, doctor.

420
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,657
Reschedule Jenna
Kline for Thursday.

421
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,335
Fax Dr. Horton Brook
Yeung's MEG results.

422
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,166
I'm Dr. Greene. My
daughter has an appointment.

423
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,275
- Ella.
- Yeah. My wife should be bringing her.

424
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,842
You just missed them.

425
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,741
What does that mean exactly?

426
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,041
In the interest of
legal efficiency...

427
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,650
- we cut a deal. ABBY: A
deal for what? For jail time?

428
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,787
No. One year parole, 40
hours of community service.

429
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,582
Community service?

430
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,191
- This guy attacked me.
- This is his first offense.

431
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:49,157
He's pathological. I've had to
call the police on him before.

432
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,924
He has no prior arrests. We're also
insisting he undergo mandatory therapy.

433
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,933
Oh, that's great. So, what, he counts
to 10 before he hits somebody now?

434
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,469
- This is the best we could do.
- The best you can do?

435
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,506
Let's not overlook that someone
beat the hell out of Westlake...

436
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,304
a couple hours after
you were attacked.

437
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,875
- What?
- But...

438
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:11,108
you didn't know
anything about that, right?

439
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,345
No.

440
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,426
Wiggle your toes.

441
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,427
Fingers.

442
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,298
- I'm not paralyzed?
- You are showing signs of improvement.

443
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,964
It's only gonna get better as the
swelling in your spinal cord goes down.

444
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,132
You are lucky.

445
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,244
Put this behind you.

446
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,480
Your dad is gonna
be glad to hear this.

447
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,141
You know, the police
think that he was drinking.

448
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,582
My dad doesn't drink.

449
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:52,052
They're pretty angry
about what he did.

450
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,161
Pulling you behind a snowmobile,
your dad should know better.

451
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,560
- He does.
- Then what happened?

452
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,267
It wasn't your dad's idea to pull
you behind the snowmobile, was it?

453
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:16,607
It was Chris' idea. We were
just trying to have a little fun.

454
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,512
Elizabeth?

455
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,419
- Where were you?
- I'm sorry. Something came up.

456
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,583
- More important than our daughter?
- I was there. I just missed you.

457
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,730
I talked to the doctor.
Everything's gonna be okay.

458
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,195
Yeah. Well, any long-term effects
remain to be seen, don't they?

459
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:39,265
Dr. Greene, Ian Nevinger's
sats are down to 78.

460
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,806
I'm down for a GSW. You better
hope you can still intubate him.

461
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,570
- You still awake in here?
- A little.

462
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,713
Brianne, I have some bad news...

463
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,651
about your father.

464
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,986
The surgeons did
their best to help him.

465
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,062
But one of the bullets hit
his heart and damaged it.

466
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,926
They couldn't fix it.

467
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,166
He died.

468
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,903
I know it's hard...

469
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,407
and you feel really sad.

470
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,543
But it's very important
that you talk with the police.

471
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,314
No.

472
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,578
They just want to make sure
they find out who did this...

473
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,245
so that they don't
hurt anyone else.

474
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,820
Did you see who
shot your father?

475
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,589
Yes.

476
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,189
And do you know who they were?

477
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,263
Yes.

478
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,294
Will you tell the police?

479
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,365
I can't.

480
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,271
Honey, you don't
need to be afraid.

481
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,344
- Was it your mother?
- No.

482
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,347
Then who?

483
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,147
Me.

484
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,650
You.

485
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,317
You shot your father?

486
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,500
He fell asleep on the couch and
left his gun on the coffee table.

487
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,233
Why did you shoot him?

488
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,805
Brianne...

489
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,207
was he hurting you?

490
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,477
Honey, was he doing things
to you that he shouldn't be?

491
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,415
He wouldn't let me watch TV.

492
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,918
So you shot him?

493
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:43,492
He said if I turned on the TV
while he was asleep, he'd shoot me.

494
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,393
So I shot him first.

495
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,010
He can't protect his
airway much longer.

496
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,546
- Can we go in before you intubate him?
- He'd prefer if you didn't.

497
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,583
This is the last chance
we'll have to speak with him.

498
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,249
He doesn't want you to see
him in his present condition.

499
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,684
I've seen worse.

500
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,690
- This is your husband.
- Yes, he is.

501
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,960
- If they stay here.
- Okay.

502
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,794
Brendan, watch your brother.
I have to talk to the doctor.

503
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,567
Carboxyhemoglobin's 30.

504
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,572
- I said no.
- I said yes.

505
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,739
You're gonna be okay, Ian.

506
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,285
How's my hair look?

507
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,046
You might want to get
a wig till it grows back.

508
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,723
Maybe I can get an Afro, huh?

509
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,120
Haleh, suction.

510
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,194
I can do that. I'm an RN.

511
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,568
- I'm sorry.
- Don't talk.

512
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,375
Burn unit have any beds?
- Holding.

513
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,631
He's gonna need a
Swan-Ganz catheter.

514
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,401
- Are these his labs?
- Some of them.

515
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,641
He tested positive
for amphetamines?

516
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:09,474
- Were you smoking up?
- It was an accident.

517
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:13,016
You lied to me. You told me you'd
stay clean. You promised me you'd quit.

518
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,312
I did. PAM: Was it good?

519
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,015
- Did you get nice and stoned?
- I just wanted to finish the dresser.

520
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,160
No, Ian. You just
wanted to get high!

521
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,830
- Pam... GREENE: Let's
get the heliox started.

522
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:55,394
- Chuny, have you seen Mrs. Nevinger?
- No, sorry.

523
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,789
What's going on?

524
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,160
We're trying to decide what to do
with Aaron. Can't reach the mother.

525
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,561
The father's blood
alcohol level was negative.

526
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,862
Yes. But what he
did was still reckless.

527
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,667
I don't want to split up this family, but
the father is as much a kid as his son.

528
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,970
The boys talked him into it. They
should take some of the blame.

529
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,678
- You need to talk to them.
- I did, and they didn't say anything.

530
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,319
Hey. Did you talk to the
social worker and the police?

531
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,821
- Yeah.
- What did you tell them?

532
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,823
What do you care?

533
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,928
- You worried about getting in trouble?
- No.

534
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,928
What is it, then?

535
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,830
- You want your dad to get arrested?
- Maybe it'll smarten him up.

536
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,036
What?

537
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,903
My dad's always doing stupid stuff
and saying things that are embarrassing.

538
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,108
Every teenager thinks
that about their parents.

539
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,578
Yeah. But my
dad's really a moron.

540
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,015
Well, you won't have
to worry about that...

541
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,124
once Child Services puts
you into a foster family.

542
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,593
- He could've said no.
- Could he?

543
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,532
You think your father likes
what happened to him?

544
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,191
He lost his wife.
He lost his job.

545
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,962
He lost himself.

546
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,531
You're the only
thing he has left.

547
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,104
And he still thinks that
you two are buddies.

548
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,071
We are.

549
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,780
Well, then you need to grow
up and start acting like one.

550
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,709
- Are the cops still here?
- They might be.

551
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,984
- Well, can I talk to them again?
- I'll see what I can do.

552
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,717
And could you tell
my dad I'm sorry?

553
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,988
No, but you can.

554
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,814
Why are you still here?

555
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,520
- I'm on till 8.
- You shouldn't be on at all.

556
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,556
- Do you have a headache?
- Just... Just a little stress.

557
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,319
Yeah. That and several
hundred beams of radiation...

558
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,191
zapped into your
brain this afternoon.

559
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,559
You need to go home.

560
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,865
There's just a
half an hour left.

561
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:53,096
- Did you tell her?
- Who?

562
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,898
Mark.

563
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,669
You said you were
gonna talk to her.

564
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,746
Does Rachel know?

565
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,283
Mark, they're
gonna figure it out.

566
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,350
Let them figure it out.

567
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,544
So you're gonna
keep this a secret...

568
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,918
act like nothing's wrong
until you pass out in public?

569
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,925
The moment you tell them,
they start treating you differently.

570
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,763
They start giving you that look.

571
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,193
What look?

572
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:25,030
That look. That look like you're
half-dead, like you're already gone.

573
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,939
Believe me, I've seen it before.

574
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,538
Yeah. Well, you're still here.

575
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,109
Good night.

576
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,475
Oh.

577
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,746
- What is it?
- Nothing.

578
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,254
- Mark.
- I'm just a little nauseous.

579
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,757
- That's it. I'm taking you home.
- No. I am not going home.

580
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,452
You have two choices.

581
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:54,464
I am taking you home right now or I'm
ratting you out to Weaver. What'll it be?

582
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,361
You'd better not
vomit in my car.

583
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,832
The burn unit's ready
for Nevinger, Dr. Corday.

584
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:06,001
- Haleh, do we have Marcaine?
- Right in front of you.

585
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,440
Right.

586
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:11,140
Can you take him up? I don't want
to lose his airway in the elevator.

587
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,478
- Who?
- Nevinger, the surface burn.

588
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,915
I thought he was intubated.

589
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,147
He's stabilized on a heliox,
but he's drifting down again.

590
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:21,452
- He's Dr. Greene's patient. Ask him.
- Dr. Greene went home.

591
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,322
- He did?
- Half-hour ago.

592
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,828
It says "Corday" on the chart.

593
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:27,823
Fine.

594
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,770
Mr. Nevinger, how's
your breathing?

595
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:34,998
Did you find her? CORDAY: Who?

596
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,005
My wife.

597
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,207
She isn't here?

598
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,313
Dr. Corday, sats
down to 9 percent.

599
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,542
Point-eight of Pav, prep
20 of etomidate, 120 of sux.

600
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:50,314
Mr. Nevinger, we're going to
have to intubate you for transfer.

601
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,151
You might not be able
to talk for a few days...

602
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,351
but your wife will
be able to talk to you.

603
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,155
I let her down.

604
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,457
Tested positive
for amphetamines.

605
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,657
Promised her.

606
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,302
All you need to worry
about now is getting better.

607
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,869
8-O ET tube.

608
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:09,974
Even if I live, she'll leave me.

609
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,167
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

610
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,448
Wouldn't you? I
mean, look at me.

611
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:22,381
Things might be difficult for
both of you for a while, yes.

612
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:25,381
But you just need to
give her some time.

613
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,850
- Could you find her?
- Meds are in.

614
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:32,896
Tell her I love her, I'm sorry.

615
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,063
Yes, of course.

616
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:38,067
- Yankauer tip and a 3-mac.
- Got it. Bag him.

617
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,262
No. I had Debbie
pick up the kids.

618
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,735
Okay.

619
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,104
Thanks, Evelyn.
No, I will. I will.

620
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,869
Yeah. Bye.

621
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,446
Mrs. Nevinger? I'm Dr. Corday.

622
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,708
I helped work on your husband.

623
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,443
They told me you were in
Chairs. I was afraid you'd left.

624
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,919
No, I'm leaving now. I just
called Ian's mom. She's coming.

625
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,957
I didn't tell her about
the drugs. I should.

626
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:04,927
I should let the boys see him. Show
them what drugs did to their father.

627
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,530
They'll see that soon enough.

628
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,724
Assuming we're still
around when he gets out.

629
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,233
We've just moved your
husband up to the burns unit.

630
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,099
Look, I know what
he did was wrong...

631
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,706
and obviously you have
some things to work out...

632
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,309
but he really needs
you right now.

633
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,741
Yeah? What about me?

634
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,610
What about my sons? They really need
a father, but they don't have one now.

635
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,112
Yes, they do.

636
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:30,619
No. They have a drug addict in a hospital
with burns over 50 percent of his body.

637
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:33,452
He's still their father.
He's still your husband.

638
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:40,462
You do know that he could succumb to
infection and die within the next week?

639
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,625
That is not my fault. I begged
him to stop using drugs.

640
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,262
- I'm certain he's sorry for what he did.
- Is he?

641
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:51,274
Mrs. Nevinger, he's
in unbelievable pain.

642
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,002
He'll be permanently disfigured.

643
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:56,671
He'll never look like the
father your sons remember.

644
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,317
I think he's suffered enough
punishment, don't you?

645
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,645
You two can go home. You're
both suspended until Monday.

646
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,951
- For what?
- For fighting.

647
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:10,118
- We weren't fighting.
- I was told you two got into a fistfight.

648
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:13,129
I'm afraid somebody's pulling
your leg, chief, so to speak.

649
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,166
Yeah. I love this old guy.

650
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:21,204
Dr. Chen, did you or did you not witness
these two getting into an altercation?

651
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,342
- What altercation?
- You were knocked to the floor.

652
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:28,344
No. I tripped over a phone cord
earlier, but that was my own fault.

653
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,684
Hey, knock it off, you two.

654
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:38,551
Carter. Just the man I want to
see. Look. I got six patients for you.

655
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,521
- Not on for eight minutes.
- You're here.

656
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,217
- But I'm eating.
- Well, too bad.

657
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,884
Jing-Mei?

658
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,358
Randall.

659
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,989
I've been calling you all day. Did
you...? Did you get my flowers?

660
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,159
Yes. Thanks.

661
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:53,800
So are you off?

662
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,631
You know, actually, I have...

663
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,903
- Aren't you covering Dr. Greene?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

664
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,046
Well, what about after that?

665
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:11,018
Look, Randall, you're
a nice guy and all...

666
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:14,626
but I just don't think this is
gonna work out between us.

667
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,759
Well, I had fun.

668
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,429
Yeah. Sorry. I've
gotta get back to work.

669
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,630
Can I call you?

670
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:24,998
No.

671
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,698
Bye.

672
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,334
Don't tell me you just
broke up with that guy.

673
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,037
It was hardly a breakup. I
mean, we just went out once.

674
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:38,547
- One date and he buys flowers?
- Can you believe it?

675
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:42,915
You give a guy hand-release during
<i>Harry Potter</i> and he wants to marry you.

676
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,783
You okay?

677
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,158
Thank you.

678
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,308
Hi.

679
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,809
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

680
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,619
Nope.

681
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,315
- Hey, Abby?
- Hey.

682
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,753
- Come on in.
- No, I...

683
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,728
I just wanted to say hi. I
didn't know you had company.

684
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,390
No. Just a couple of friends.

685
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:33,971
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- You need a place to stay, let me help.

686
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:37,432
- It's okay, really.
- Please? For me.

687
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,405
I need you.

688
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,613
They're kicking my
ass in Pictionary.

689
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,476
Come on.

690
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,318
Three lap cholys, two inguinal
hernias, LeFort Ill reduction...

691
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,982
vagotomy and a
pancreaticoduodenectomy.

692
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,357
I only assisted on the LeFort.
Daniels was the primary.

693
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,361
Well, Daniels has
moved to Las Vegas.

694
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,659
Growing demand for
breast implants, apparently.

695
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,827
Yeah. Well, I guess I should've
moved further away myself.

696
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,633
This doesn't have to
be so clandestine, Peter.

697
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,708
You won't burst into flames
if you step inside the hospital.

698
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,175
I know. I just wanted
to make a clean break.

699
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,678
Yeah. Well, finish those
and you'll be free of us.

700
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,840
Oh, and you owe
me $27 for Xerox.

701
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,848
How's the baby?

702
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,318
Normal background
rhythms, low amp activity.

703
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,616
All right, make
sure you get SSEPs.

704
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,191
You seem to be holding up okay.

705
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,489
Yeah.

706
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,955
What?

707
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,399
What?

708
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,493
I think I may have
left my husband.

709
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:44,072
- You think?
- Well, I moved out. I'm living in a hotel.

710
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,406
What happened?

711
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:51,915
I've never made demands
on him, not real ones anyway.

712
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,053
The only time I ask him to
put his family first, he can't do it.

713
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,322
- Back up. You lost me.
- He won't send Rachel away.

714
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,549
It's like he has to
prove he loves her.

715
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:05,288
- You want him to prove he loves you.
- Yes. No.

716
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,599
I don't know.

717
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,500
I don't know if I'm protecting
my daughter or just angry.

718
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,865
- Look, Elizabeth, I'd be angry too...
- At Mark.

719
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,905
You see, I think I do blame
him for what happened.

720
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:27,207
And I think I've found a way to avoid
being with him because I blame him.

721
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,382
He's different.

722
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,454
It's like he's...

723
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,027
It's like he's disconnected
from us somehow.

724
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,755
Or maybe it's me, you know?

725
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:45,062
I just don't have the
energy to figure it out.

726
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,972
What happens if he sent
Rachel home tomorrow?

727
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,110
<i>Usually this time of year...</i>

728
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,252
<i>Chicagoans are tired
of cold and snow...</i>

729
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:03,445
<i>wondering if winter
will ever end...</i>

730
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,884
You're out of mustard.

731
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,784
- I told you, I'm not hungry.
- You have to eat.

732
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:13,261
That's right. Starve
a cold, feed a tumor.

733
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,866
You need to keep
your strength up.

734
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,734
I need to take a nap.

735
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,235
Well, I'll help you upstairs
if you have some soup.

736
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:23,739
No, I mean right
now, right here.

737
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,571
What if Rachel comes
home? She'll see you're sick.

738
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,271
She's sleeping
over at a friend's.

739
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:34,978
Mark, you have to have someone
watch you following Gamma Knife therapy.

740
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:37,884
- Oh, great.
- What?

741
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,490
I can't close my eye.

742
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,960
I've heard of cowboys who
sleep with one eye open.

743
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,089
I'm glad you
think this is funny.

744
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,965
Okay.

745
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,639
Hold still.

746
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,925
You'll have to start
using artificial tears.

747
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:06,949
Yeah.

748
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,388
How's that?

749
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,857
It's good. Thanks.

750
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,660
Don't let the soup
get cold, huh?
