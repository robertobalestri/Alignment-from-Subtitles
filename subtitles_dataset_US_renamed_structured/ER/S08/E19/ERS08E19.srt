1
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,887
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

2
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,275
You like macaroni and cheese?

3
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,913
Who, me? No.

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,845
- That's all I've got.
- What?

5
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,776
For dinner.

6
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,485
Too bad.

7
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,324
Well, it's not so bad if you kick in a
few bucks for a nice bottle of wine.

8
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,051
I've got your meds, Mr. Walden.

9
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,153
Are you asking me out?

10
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,921
- I'll pass.
- Why?

11
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,657
- I don't like macaroni and cheese.
- Then cook something.

12
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,768
- I don't think so.
- What, you can't cook?

13
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,435
I'm not making you dinner.

14
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,165
Wow. I just figured
you'd wanna eat first.

15
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,569
First?

16
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,768
You know, before
things get hot and heavy.

17
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,972
Ha-ha. Okay, sure.

18
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,983
Come on. You can't tell me you wouldn't
wanna go home, have a hot shower...

19
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,849
a glass of wine,
some great sex...

20
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,320
I can do that all by myself.
- Hmm.

21
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,018
Did someone say "sex"?

22
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,094
Do you like macaroni
and cheese, Pablo?

23
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,924
Oh, yeah, I love it.

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,793
You got yourself a date. - <i>Yuck!</i>

25
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,493
I don't even know
what half this stuff was.

26
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,037
Were you expecting someone?
- No.

27
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,681
Hey.

28
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,019
Come on in.

29
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,917
Hey, Carter.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,153
Would you like some pizza?

31
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,993
I just came by to make
sure you were settled.

32
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,466
- I'm getting there.
- Yeah, I can see that.

33
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,941
Just a little housewarming gift.

34
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,836
Welcome home.

35
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,669
You gotta make it stop, man.

36
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,601
I can't help unless you settle
down and tell me what's wrong.

37
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,104
Need a hand?

38
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,775
It's in my stomach.

39
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,241
- Did you ingest something, sir?
- No.

40
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,674
My brother...

41
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,213
Wait. Your brother what?
Did he give you something?

42
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,442
No. He's inside me!

43
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,586
- Want me to call a Psych consult?
- Not yet.

44
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,416
- Are you taking drugs?
- He's trying to bite his way out.

45
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,581
- I'll get some Haldol.
- I didn't ask for it.

46
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,590
- Stop it.
- And some soft restraints?

47
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,023
No. EDWARDS: Oh, God.

48
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,027
I fly the plane, you
serve the coffee.

49
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,031
I think he's angry. Oh, God.

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,293
Fine, he's all yours.

51
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,563
Did you do a repeat EKG on Feinstein?
- No.

52
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,934
You need to do serial
EKGs to rule out an MI.

53
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,241
- His first EKG was normal.
- He could have pseudo-normalization.

54
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,470
I gotta get him out
before he kills me!

55
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,212
Calm down. Calm
down. A little help!

56
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,352
Hey, Haleh? Let's get hard
restraints, Haldol and a Psych consult.

57
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,988
Better get a wrist film too.

58
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,621
Did you know lesbians
are at a higher risk...

59
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:24,162
of breast, cervical and ovarian
cancers because they are less likely...

60
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,832
to have children by age 30?

61
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,262
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,494
Lesbians are less likely
to seek health care...

63
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,934
because of the
discomfort of coming out.

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,505
Why are you telling me this?

65
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:38,008
Lesbians are also less likely to
get routine gynecological services...

66
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,477
which means later
detection of these cancers.

67
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,671
- Robert.
- Huh?

68
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,444
- Do you have to keep saying that? Don't.
- Lesbians? I'm just reading what it says.

69
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,680
I can't help it. Kerry, this gets
me excited. You wanna know why?

70
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,915
Because this smells like money.

71
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,526
Your sisters are underserviced
and we can fix that.

72
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,717
You're trying to
exploit my lifestyle.

73
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:57,994
No. I'm trying to
accentuate the positive.

74
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,828
- You're chief, you're gay, challenged.
- Ah, challenged.

75
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,835
You can be the poster girl for
the Center for Lesbian Excellence.

76
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,973
- No. ROMANO: You
haven't seen the proposal.

77
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,801
- What proposal?
- In the press packet.

78
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,273
- Read it before the news conference.
- You kidding?

79
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,002
This is gonna be great.

80
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,649
What are you doing?

81
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:20,015
- Damn toaster ate my Pop-Tart.
- Is that a switchblade?

82
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,213
Couldn't get my brass
knuckles in the slot.

83
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,152
- Whose stuff is this?
- Pratt's.

84
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,452
I don't think Weaver's
given him a locker yet.

85
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,720
I hope you unplugged that thing.

86
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,827
Ha. Very funny.

87
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,693
LEWIS: <i>Hi, I'm here.</i>

88
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,635
<i>But I'm not answering the
phone. Please leave a message.</i>

89
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,140
- At least I'm honest.
- Heard about a replacement for Greene?

90
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,177
<i>Your car needs a
new battery. It's $ 180.</i>

91
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,712
<i>Call me back and
we'll replace it.</i>

92
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,076
$180. I barely make that...

93
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,411
- resuscitating somebody.
- Are you covering, um...?

94
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,577
<i>Aunt Susan, are you there?</i>

95
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,587
<i>It's Suzy. My mom's
really sick. We're in a hotel.</i>

96
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,453
<i>I think she needs a
doctor. I can't wake her up.</i>

97
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,689
<i>I gotta go.</i>

98
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,449
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Chloe?

99
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,594
<i>We're not home.</i>

100
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,230
<i>But if you wanna leave a
message for us, wait for the beep.</i>

101
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:20,369
Chloe, hi, it's Susan. Are you
there? Chloe. Are you there?

102
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,208
Your brother-in-law's a cop?

103
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,716
In New Jersey, but I
couldn't get ahold of him.

104
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,789
His precinct said he took a few days off,
but they don't know where to reach him.

105
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,357
Do you have caller ID at home?
- No.

106
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,892
Can't you just trace
the call or something?

107
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,927
- Yeah. I'll see what I can do.
- Okay.

108
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,857
You okay?

109
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,235
- I don't know what to do.
- It's nothing. Kids, active imaginations.

110
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,897
Dr. Lewis, Mrs. Reynolds would like
you to go over her husband's aftercare.

111
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,270
- I did.
- She has a few more questions.

112
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,469
- It's a damn carbuncle.
- I'll go talk to her.

113
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,413
- No, Carter. You don't have to do that.
- It's all right. I rock with carbuncles.

114
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,778
- What room?
- Exam 4.

115
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,586
I'll be right there.

116
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,390
- You got a minute?
- Yep. What do you need?

117
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,423
I need to talk to you.

118
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,925
- Go ahead.
- About Abby.

119
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,131
- What about her?
- She's drinking again. Didn't you notice?

120
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,797
Luka.

121
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:18,098
- Seven-year-old, 15-foot fall, headfirst.
- He was climbing a tree on a class trip.

122
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,263
- Page Surgery.
- Stabilize the neck.

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,102
Get Pedes Neurosurg down here.

124
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,301
- That spinal fluid?
- Looks like it.

125
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,775
Prep 30 grams of mannitol.

126
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,916
- Sats, 93 percent on four liters.
- Blood in the left canal.

127
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,313
Feels like deformity at
the angle of the mandible.

128
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,282
- DTR's three-plus.
- We got this, Carter.

129
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,416
Pupils midrange,
equal and reactive.

130
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,287
Probable basilar skull
fracture. 6.5 ET in a two-mac.

131
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,986
Pre-medicate with 40
of lido and 2.5 of Pav.

132
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,464
So how was it?

133
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,761
- What?
- Your date with Pablo.

134
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,806
Pretty interesting. Did you know
he used to be with a Mexican circus?

135
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,843
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

136
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:05,009
Guy's had a hard life, but intriguing.
He was even shot by Border Patrol once.

137
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,652
You really had
dinner with Pablo?

138
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,381
Not at my place, at Doc Magoo's.

139
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,027
He was hungry and I just
can't stand eating alone.

140
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,493
- Where's Mrs. Pradeep?
- I sent her home.

141
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,223
Excuse us. I didn't
sign off on her chart.

142
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,834
There was nothing wrong.
She just wanted a free meal.

143
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,534
I sign off on every
patient you see. Even if

144
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:26,997
they stop for directions
to Wrigley Field.

145
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,402
- Got it?
- Got it.

146
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,669
Let me know if you hear
anything. Thanks, Dix. Bye.

147
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,674
Anything?

148
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,576
- Dr. Lewis.
- Yeah?

149
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,481
Phone company traced the call. Came
from a phone off a network in New York.

150
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,247
- New York?
- On the Upper West Side of Manhattan...

151
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,154
which is within the jurisdiction of
the 55th precinct of the N.Y.P.D.

152
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,125
- And they're expecting your call.
- Thank you.

153
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,530
Five-five precinct.
May I help you?

154
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,572
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

155
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,273
Please hold. Bosco, you're early.
They fumigating your apartment?

156
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:09,439
Some jerk from second watch is working
out without wiping down the benches.

157
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,244
What do I look like,
the gym monitor?

158
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:15,047
You have to call Parking
Enforcement. We don't tow cars.

159
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,214
How hard is it to take a towel
and wipe the sweat off a bench?

160
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,054
- Five-five precinct.
- Put up a sign, he's still doing it.

161
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,356
I figure out who it is, I'm gonna
put his head in the squat rack.

162
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,626
Let me put you on with an officer
who can help you out. Bosco.

163
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,032
Take a missing-persons report.
- I'm not on yet.

164
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,867
Well, your sweaty
manhunt can wait. Line two.

165
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,573
Be right with you, ma'am.

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,208
Officer Boscorelli,
how can I help you?

167
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,462
<i>I'm Susan Lewis.</i>

168
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,983
<i>- I'm in Chicago right now.</i>
- Okay.

169
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,287
Okay, ma'am, calm down.
Ma'am, you gotta calm down.

170
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,585
Listen to me. When was the
last time you talked to your sister?

171
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,491
Abdomen's soft, no guarding.
Two-by-two abrasion over left iliac crest.

172
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,996
Let's hold off, give Neurosurg a
chance to see him before we paralyze.

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,566
Heart rate down to 60.

174
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,965
Six-centimeter scalp
lac with exposed galea.

175
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,833
I need 3-0 chromic on a driver.

176
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,268
How's Mark?

177
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,601
He's good. He's in Hawaii with Rachel.
He's showing her where he grew up.

178
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,474
Oh, that's nice.

179
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,775
- I didn't know he grew up in Hawaii.
- He grew up in lots of places.

180
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,509
- He's fixed and dilated.
- What? No.

181
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,820
- Eight millimeters.
- BP's up, 160/100.

182
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,355
Cushing's response.
Let's page Neurosurg.

183
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,986
There's no response
to pain. Swab.

184
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,493
There's a step-off.
Pretty big skull fracture.

185
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,597
No corneal reflex. I
think he's herniated.

186
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,462
All right. Let's tube him. 200
mics of fentanyl, 50 of sux.

187
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,235
- Won't the sux raise the ICP?
- No.

188
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,101
It's a myth. Besides, I
don't think it's gonna matter.

189
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,868
I have to go. I made four
calls to find someone to cover.

190
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,840
Wait. Slow down, Susan.

191
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:49,004
My sister and her daughter are missing and
the police aren't helping. I have to go.

192
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,646
Whoa, what's going on?

193
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,549
- I'm, uh, gonna catch an 11:30 flight.
- You're going to New York?

194
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,382
Yeah, I can't sit
around and wait.

195
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,752
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna find them.

196
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,598
Jesus was a healer.

197
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,208
- Who let Reverend Ed in?
- You know the preacher?

198
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,835
- He's a pain in the ass. Get rid of him.
- Me?

199
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,949
In about 10 minutes he's
gonna start trying to heal people.

200
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,210
It's bad for business.

201
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:29,379
You see, the road to recovery begins
when you open your heart to Jesus.

202
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,549
Excuse me, sir. I'm afraid I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

203
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,695
You treat the body
and I treat the soul.

204
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,228
- Watch your back.
- Gallant!

205
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,930
Go with God, my son.

206
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:43,900
Stanley Sherman, 32, security guard.
GSW to the abdomen. BP, 140/80.

207
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,629
Pulse, 100 with a liter in.

208
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,468
Pay attention.
Where's it hurt, Stanley?

209
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,041
Where do you think? Right here.

210
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,009
Eyes are open. One question
and I got the airway and GCS 15.

211
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,575
- Is this the GSW?
- Small-caliber wound, the epigastric area.

212
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,377
No LOC. Good breath sounds.

213
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,949
Haven't see you
around this morning.

214
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,248
It's been busy.

215
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,116
This one's yours, Pratt.

216
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:12,425
CBC, lytes, BUN and creatinine, glucose,
Accu-Chek and a HemoCue times three.

217
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,068
- Hey, big stick, say "Ow."
- Ow!

218
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,464
Told you.

219
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,468
Lateral C-spine,
AP chest and pelvis.

220
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,608
Bilateral TMs are clear, head's
atraumatic. Can I do the airway?

221
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,608
No. He doesn't need an
airway. You can do the rectal.

222
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,440
The rectal.

223
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,946
Play nice, kids. Don't
make me stop this trauma.

224
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,487
There's a big gun show in
Baltimore this weekend. Interested?

225
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,786
- Uh, no, thank you.
- Come on.

226
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,260
- Come on, you can bring the kids.
- Yeah, okay. Let me call Fred...

227
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,798
tell him to pack a bag for the kids
so they can go to the gun show.

228
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,299
What's up, lieu?

229
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,529
Your missing-persons
report from this morning.

230
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,967
Who?

231
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,859
- The doctor with the missing sister.
- I thought she was in Chicago.

232
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,637
- She was.
- She flew here?

233
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,609
- What are you talking about?
- You brought us in for this?

234
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,975
What's going on?

235
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,846
Her sister and her sister's kid go missing
for an hour. So she's coming unglued.

236
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,783
Take her out and
drive her around.

237
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:08,978
You gotta be kidding.

238
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,852
A doctor from Chicago. That
kind of trouble, I don't need.

239
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,288
- Lieu.
- Hey, Bosco...

240
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,224
whatever you told her on the
phone, she hopped on a plane.

241
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,661
- She's your problem.
- I didn't tell her anything.

242
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,800
Maybe that's why
she got on the plane.

243
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,163
Wait, what's going on?
Her sister's missing?

244
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,862
She probably took her
to the zoo or something.

245
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,032
Uh, excuse me, are you the
officer I spoke with this morning?

246
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,645
Yeah, hi. Boscorelli. How you doing?
This is my partner, Officer Yokas.

247
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,542
Susan Lewis. Have
you found them?

248
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,976
Uh...

249
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,618
I made a few calls, but
I'm afraid I don't have much.

250
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,816
I called my niece's school. They
said she hasn't showed up in days.

251
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,252
I'm gonna get a cup of
coffee. You want some?

252
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,327
No, I'm fine.

253
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,326
You know, uh, Susan? - Yeah.

254
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,228
Uh, like, 90 percent of the time,
these things work out to be just fine.

255
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,495
Well, I called their home, his
work, I can't get ahold of anybody.

256
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,697
Well, maybe the whole family
took a trip to Disney World...

257
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,735
or, I don't know, went
fishing or something.

258
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,677
What?

259
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,382
- Where do they live?
- South Orange.

260
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,378
South Orange?

261
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,382
Oh. That's New Jersey.
You know what we can do?

262
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,252
We can call the P.D. over there
and have them send a patrol over...

263
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:22,555
- and, uh, check it out.
- You know, would you just listen to this?

264
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,460
<i>Aunt Susan? Aunt
Susan, are you there?</i>

265
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,692
<i>It's Suzy. My mom's
really sick. We're in a hotel.</i>

266
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,202
<i>I think she needs a
doctor. I can't wake her up.</i>

267
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,302
<i>I gotta go.</i>

268
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,802
- Did you try the hospitals?
- Isn't that your job?

269
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,741
Do you have pictures? - Yeah.

270
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,726
Uh. We can canvass
the hotels in our precinct...

271
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,055
- and see if anybody's seen them.
- Can I come?

272
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,253
- No.
- Yeah.

273
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,058
Thank you.

274
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,799
Stanley, you hear
me? I'm talking to you.

275
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,098
- Run in another liter. Re-page Surgery.
- BP's dropping.

276
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,605
Set up for a central line.
Prep the rapid infuser.

277
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,768
- He's not breathing.
- Bag him. What drugs you want, Pratt?

278
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,436
One-twenty of sux,
20 of etomidate.

279
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,344
- Sats coming up.
- 94 percent.

280
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,008
- 8-0 ET and a three-mac.
- Drugs are in.

281
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,585
- I thought this was my tube.
- Go for it.

282
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,985
- Hey, I'm running this.
- Teaching hospital, Pratt.

283
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,357
- Give him a shot.
- He doesn't get it, it's mine.

284
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,787
Don't hold your breath.

285
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,122
Okay, pressure's
better. 110 systolic.

286
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,289
All right. Keep running it in,
I'll get in and give you cricoid.

287
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,102
- Ready?
- Okay, okay.

288
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,170
Don't chip his teeth.

289
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,702
- Tell me what you see.
- Just the back of his throat.

290
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,745
- Epiglottis.
- Right. Lift towards the feet.

291
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,676
Harder. GALLANT: Okay.

292
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,250
Good.

293
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,480
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, give me the tube.
- Tube.

294
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,850
Just watch it go right
through the cords.

295
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,461
Okay. I got it. I'm in.

296
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,697
Easy intubation.

297
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,001
- Carter was looking for you.
- Oh, he found me.

298
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,145
- He didn't seem real happy.
- No, he's not.

299
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,409
It's gonna be okay.

300
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,884
When Allan fell, he tore
a blood vessel in his head.

301
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,322
Can't you fix it?

302
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,357
The neurosurgeon
will speak to you...

303
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:42,298
but the CT scan shows damage
that they feel is unrecoverable.

304
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,599
- But he's still alive.
- The ventilator is helping him breathe.

305
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:52,370
And we're giving him medicines to
stabilize the pressure on his brain.

306
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,848
But if we discontinue
them, he'll die.

307
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,452
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,218
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What
are you...? Nice, jagoff.

309
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,694
Yeah. What about Mercy?

310
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,858
<i>Mercy?</i> BOSCO: Yeah, Mercy.

311
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,901
<i>Uh, let me check.</i>

312
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,039
<i>Negative. We got
nothing at Mercy.</i>

313
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,640
Okay, 10-4.

314
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,801
There's nobody matching your niece
or your sister's descriptions or names...

315
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,538
have showed up at the
morgues or the hospitals.

316
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,342
That's good. BOSCO: Yeah.

317
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:35,080
This happens all the
time. You know that, right?

318
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,415
People decide to go somewhere,
don't tell family members they're going.

319
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,258
All right. Thank you.
Thanks for looking.

320
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,002
- Any luck?
- None.

321
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,635
Was your sister and her husband
having problems with their marriage?

322
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,072
Not that I know of.

323
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,806
Was he having any kind
of personal problems?

324
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,109
- Like what?
- Like drugs or alcohol or gambling?

325
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,946
No, he's the one who
straightened out my sister.

326
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,783
Straightened her out?

327
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,424
Chloe had a
substance-abuse problem.

328
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,423
She's been clean five years.
Joe helped her get her life together.

329
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,968
- You should've said she was an addict.
- She's not an addict. She beat it.

330
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:28,437
- She's a responsible wife and mother.
- She's so responsible, why are you here?

331
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,314
Surgery's on their way.

332
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,475
You sure you know
how to work that?

333
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,710
Spend almost a year at the VA,
you learn to work the hardware.

334
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,354
They got a whole floor of
vent-dependent gomers there.

335
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,046
Hey, don't call them that.

336
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,125
Why not? That's what they are.

337
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,887
No. They gave themselves
so you can live the life you do.

338
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,621
Nobody ever "gave" me anything.

339
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,495
Third unit of type-specific is up.
Maybe Carter should call Surgery again.

340
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,969
Only so many O.R.s.
They'll come when they can.

341
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,404
Run of ectopy.

342
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:08,014
Open a crash cart.
100 of lido, IV push.

343
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,843
- Pressure holding.
- Start a drip, two milligrams a minute.

344
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,316
No, no. Should I get Carter?

345
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,148
It's V-tach.

346
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,355
V-fib. Charge the
paddles to 200. Come on!

347
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:22,017
- ACLS. We both have a card.
- It's asystole, definitely asystole.

348
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,186
- Thoracotomy tray.
- What?

349
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,491
- I've got it.
- Look, I am going to get Carter.

350
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,226
No time! CPR, Gallant!
Get with the program!

351
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,465
Do not do this, okay? They
are coming. They are coming.

352
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,169
What's that? - Notes.

353
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,536
Oh, God. No, no, no, no.

354
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,005
See one, do one. You
heard what Carter said.

355
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,912
- This is a teaching hospital.
- There's no pressure.

356
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,285
Step back. Step back!

357
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,850
- Okay, fourth to fifth...
- This is so wrong.

358
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,961
Intercostal space,
just below the nipple.

359
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,860
We are not doing this. I
am not doing this. Abby!

360
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,898
Shut up, I'm trying
to concentrate.

361
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,401
Okay, anything that bleeds,
clamp it. Pass me a snap.

362
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,911
- Here it is.
- No. That's a Kelly.

363
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,413
It'll do. Give it to me.

364
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,612
Rib spreader.

365
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,751
Right up here. Yeah. All
right, come on, crank it.

366
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,050
Come on. Come on, wider.

367
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,591
Crank it.

368
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,229
- What are you doing?
- Go get somebody.

369
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,922
Crank it. Wider. All
right, there, there, there!

370
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,597
Carter, your students just
cracked somebody's chest.

371
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,570
Pericardium was full of clot.

372
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,936
Are you guys insane?

373
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,806
I need to cross-clamp the
aorta with that big-ass clamp.

374
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,073
You don't know what it's called,
you shouldn't use it. Satinsky.

375
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,614
Get out of the way.

376
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,911
Page the O.R., get a
trauma surgeon down here.

377
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,452
- Why didn't you come and get me?
- The guy was dying.

378
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,420
Well, if he wasn't, he is now.

379
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:05,292
All right. I'll check this
one out. Hey, Daryl.

380
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,458
How's my good friend?
You're looking dapper today.

381
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,195
I need some information.
You seen any junkies around?

382
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:17,102
I'm looking for a junkie with a
6-year-old girl. You seen her?

383
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,878
- Man, I ain't seen no little girls, man.
- Go get the owner.

384
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,811
You know, Bosco's
not as bad as he seems.

385
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,289
Come on, go get the... What,
are you ignoring me? Huh?

386
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,491
Go get the owner now
before I break your face.

387
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,150
Stupid-ass.

388
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,457
Excuse me.

389
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,464
- What was that all about?
- Daryl wasn't being helpful.

390
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,039
Did he see the mom
or the daughter?

391
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,470
- Did you show him the picture?
- He went to get the owner.

392
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,409
You know, you better tone it
down with a civilian in the RMP.

393
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,111
She's wasting our time.

394
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,744
You guys finally gonna
shut this place down?

395
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,617
Who are you?

396
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,149
- Neighborhood watch.
- Yeah?

397
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,655
They're hookers, you know.

398
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,229
I believe the politically correct
term is "street hostesses."

399
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:15,095
In and out of this dump day and night,
stopping traffic up and down the street.

400
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,669
- I've been documenting their activity.
- Nice work.

401
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,501
Been calling for months. I
didn't think you'd ever come.

402
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,200
Yeah? You see that drunk
outside the deli over there?

403
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,278
- Yeah. I called about him too.
- You got a picture?

404
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,882
Look, I can't arrest
him without a picture.

405
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,553
It might be a custody thing
with her and the husband, right?

406
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,053
Maybe this chick
isn't even missing.

407
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:43,856
Maybe she's hiding from
her controlling, lunatic sister...

408
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,056
who jumps on a plane the minute
she doesn't answer the phone.

409
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,964
She flew in from Chicago.
She's worried and she's scared.

410
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,729
Junkies go missing all the
time. We don't hunt for them.

411
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,875
- Well, the sister said she's clean.
- Right.

412
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,976
Oh, no. This is a bloody mess.

413
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,581
What did you use to crack
his chest, a hand grenade?

414
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,810
- Hey, we saved him.
- Who are you and why are you talking?

415
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,581
You're supposed to be
Chief Resident, aren't you?

416
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,747
- Yeah.
- Better start acting like one...

417
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,088
before your students kill
off the rest of your patients.

418
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,423
What's his problem?

419
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,262
You just hacked up a patient
you shouldn't have touched.

420
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,427
- The guy would've been dead...
- Shut up.

421
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,440
- Go to the lounge, both of you.
- For what?

422
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,901
For once, just do
as you're told, Pratt.

423
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,307
Thanks a lot.

424
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,580
- Hey, where are you going?
- To save some more lives.

425
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,453
Yeah, I rented it to
a woman on Monday.

426
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,087
Seemed like nice
people. Cute little girl.

427
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,321
Just the two of them? - Yep.

428
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:55,957
- Did they have any visitors?
- Around here, we specialize in anonymity.

429
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,536
Yeah, and $20 nooners.

430
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,133
Hello? Hello?

431
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,442
Hello?

432
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,648
The cell's dead.

433
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,782
Yokas?

434
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,556
We should have been working
this angle from moment one.

435
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,476
He moved a little.

436
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,740
It was involuntary.

437
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,920
Trees, monkey bars, fences.

438
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,249
He was always climbing.

439
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,948
I swear he was half monkey.

440
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,158
He's not gonna
get better, is he?

441
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,858
He's got what we
call an axonal injury.

442
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,063
Even if we could
remove the blood...

443
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:07,070
the force of the fall damaged
the connections of the brain.

444
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,748
Is he suffering?

445
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,384
I think he's gone.

446
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,981
This is just his body.

447
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,760
We wanna let him go.

448
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,033
Okay.

449
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,113
Excuse me.

450
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:06,792
Where's Pratt?

451
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,764
- I don't know.
- I told you both to wait in here for me.

452
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,398
Yeah. And I'm here.

453
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,807
- How's Stanley?
- He's still in the O.R.

454
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,778
That was really stupid, Gallant.

455
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,918
Look, it was not my idea.

456
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,482
- You should have come to get me.
- I tried.

457
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,354
If I would have left, he would have
died. What was I supposed to do?

458
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,320
You weren't supposed
to crack the guy's chest.

459
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,524
All right, you're on scut duty for
the rest of the day. Both of you.

460
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,327
Yes, sir.

461
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,133
You know Dr. Malucci?

462
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,802
- No.
- That's because he got fired.

463
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,940
He was a hotshot too.

464
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,871
Killed a guy because he
thought he knew everything.

465
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,647
You two pull another stunt
like that, you're out of here.

466
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,449
Look, I don't blame you for
being angry about what happened.

467
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,618
But, please, don't
confuse me and Pratt.

468
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,704
Gallant?

469
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,534
- I told you to get rid of him.
- I got pulled into a trauma.

470
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,369
Doesn't look like
you're in one now.

471
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,671
- Okay. I'll ask him to leave.
- Forget it.

472
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,974
- Pratt, turf that guy.
- Yeah, okay.

473
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,709
- More suction.
- This the GSW?

474
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:35,218
- What's left of him.
- What happened?

475
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,515
Well, he had the
unfortunate luck...

476
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,885
of passing through
the ER butcher shop.

477
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,821
Where were you? I paged
you about a dozen times.

478
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,327
I had to break bad news...

479
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,658
to the parents of a boy
with a severe head injury.

480
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,892
Ha! Oh, right. That old excuse.

481
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:53,600
Dr. Corday, you
have a phone call.

482
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,832
- She's busy.
- Take a message, please.

483
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,570
It's your stepdaughter calling from
Hawaii. She says it's an emergency.

484
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,915
Go.

485
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,547
Metz.

486
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,256
Rachel, what's going on?

487
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,159
There he is. Oleg?

488
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,894
Oleg, I wanna ask
you a few questions.

489
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,234
Come here. Don't make
me get out of the car.

490
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,245
Damn it.

491
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,609
Hang on.

492
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,971
- You seen them?
- How you been, Oleg?

493
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,442
Get out of there.
Get out of there.

494
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,911
Stand up.

495
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,143
Shut up.

496
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:15,481
Oops. What do we have
here? Illegal narcotics?

497
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:18,283
I'm shocked, man!
Let's do this again.

498
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,085
- Look again.
- You seen them?

499
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,322
- I'm not good with faces.
- Keep looking.

500
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:32,670
Maybe. There's a shooting gallery
in back of the old carpet factory.

501
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,133
- How long ago?
- Maybe an hour.

502
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,333
- Was the girl there?
- No kid. Ow!

503
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,842
You sure? Huh?

504
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,872
Maybe she was there. I
don't know. I didn't see her.

505
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:49,511
Show respect for the badge, Oleg.
You're bleeding all over my car.

506
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,317
You may have broken his nose.

507
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,657
No, he was always that ugly.

508
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:03,359
Ha-ha. All right. Okay. Hey,
Carter. Pratt just did a perfect tap.

509
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,299
Congratulations.
Now you can go home.

510
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,702
- Come on, man.
- I told you to wait in the lounge.

511
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,706
What good does that do anybody?

512
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,310
You wanna stay here, you do
what I tell you, when I tell you.

513
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,143
It's that simple. Don't make
me be a hard-ass, okay?

514
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,341
Okay.

515
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:23,888
Gallant's in Exam 4. Why don't you teach
him how to drain a perirectal abscess.

516
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,093
Uh, did I miss something?

517
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,395
We need to keep our eye on him.

518
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,158
He's good.

519
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,563
He's dangerous.

520
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,254
Any word on, uh,
Pratt's thoracotomy?

521
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,083
I haven't heard.

522
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,958
Do you wanna talk about it?

523
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:08,363
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Oh, no?

524
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,770
This started after your assault?

525
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,468
I said I didn't wanna talk.

526
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:20,271
- You said there was nothing to talk about.
- Whatever. It's not what you think.

527
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,040
- I can handle this.
- I'm not throwing the program at you.

528
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,548
- I'm just trying to help.
- Don't need any help.

529
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,119
Six years, you know? You
were sober for six years.

530
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,622
That's right. That was then.

531
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,626
I'm a different person now.

532
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:44,894
What? I'm not shooting up.
I had a beer. I had a beer.

533
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:48,907
- Stop trying to make it such a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

534
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,168
It's not about the beer
you had yesterday.

535
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,471
Or the two you're gonna want
today or the six you'll want tomorrow.

536
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,276
It's under control. It is. And
it's not a reaction, it's a decision.

537
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,316
My decision.

538
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,080
A 35-year-old restrained
driver in a left T-bone.

539
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,247
Possible DUI. Ran a
red, air bag deployed.

540
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,655
- Can you hear me?
- BP's 110/70 initially...

541
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,091
now 100 palp. Pulse, 100.
Look, you guys got this?

542
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,458
No breath sounds on the left.

543
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,030
Probably put down a lung.

544
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,430
- Is this the MVA?
- Yeah. Drunk driver.

545
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,502
- Trauma 2.
- Satting at 96.

546
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,161
- Robert. ROMANO:
Not now, Lizzie.

547
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,001
I'm not having a good day.
Got beat in the stock market...

548
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,644
some moron from Radiology
backed into my Jag...

549
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:29,009
- I had to put that ER victim together.
- I need some time off.

550
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:32,174
I need a month in France with
Vietnamese twins. Not gonna happen.

551
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,841
It's Mark. He's sick.

552
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,181
- I thought he was in Tahiti.
- Hawaii.

553
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:40,621
Uh, he's got worse. I don't think
he's gonna be able to fly home.

554
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,160
- Well, you'd better go to him.
- I don't know how long I'll be.

555
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,025
We'll survive.

556
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,198
- Thanks.
- Anything I can do?

557
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,997
Pray.

558
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,805
Ha, it's not exactly
my strong suit...

559
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,810
but, um, in this case
I'll make an exception.

560
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,551
Sats are still dropping.

561
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:12,214
This guy smells like a distillery.
Better get that blood alcohol.

562
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,985
- Did he hurt anybody else?
- I don't know.

563
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,391
Well, I guess this is the
downside to the three-martini lunch.

564
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,235
- 7.5 tube and a curved blade.
- Better open the crash cart.

565
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,838
We're gonna need some O-neg...

566
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,071
- and a chest-tube tray.
- I got that.

567
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,915
Chloe!

568
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,341
Chloe? BOSCO: Whew, smell that?

569
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,680
Welcome to Urine Town.

570
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,755
How hard is it to find
a toilet to take a piss?

571
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,026
Fellas, you don't
wanna be here. Split.

572
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,031
Chloe! BOSCO: Get lost.

573
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,724
Over here. Over here.

574
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,761
- I think it's her.
- Let me see.

575
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:32,462
Chloe? Chloe? Oh,
my God. Chloe? Chloe.

576
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:36,438
Where's Suzy? Where
is she? Chloe, wake up.

577
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,237
- Is she breathing?
- Pretty shallow.

578
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:44,482
This is 55 David. I need a bus
at 1047 and East 93rd forthwith.

579
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,175
<i>Ten-four, 1047 and East 93rd.</i>

580
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:49,082
No little girl.

581
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,253
- She's not here.
- Oh, God.

582
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,651
<i>Five-four Charlie.
Five-four Charlie.</i>

583
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,525
- I can't get a line. Kim, stop.
- She needs more Narcan now.

584
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:00,996
- Who are you?
- I'm her sister.

585
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,260
I give up. Let's go.

586
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,371
- No. She's barely breathing.
- I.M. Narcan sucks.

587
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,040
- She needs a central line.
- I can do it. I'm a doctor.

588
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,800
- You licensed in New York?
- Ah, no.

589
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,207
Hospital's only three
minutes out. She'll be fine.

590
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,676
Watch out, she's gonna blow!

591
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,846
- She say anything?
- No, she's too out of it.

592
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,984
You need to tube her
to protect her airway.

593
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,119
- I know. Thanks.
- You guys going to Mercy?

594
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,551
- Yeah. Come on.
- Can I go? You'll need more hands.

595
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:26,282
No. It's against department
policy. Can you give her a lift?

596
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,518
Come on. We'll follow them.
- Let's roll.

597
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:38,700
You know what? Come
on. Jump in. Come on.

598
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,876
- He's dead.
- When was his last epi?

599
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:51,608
Give it up, Luka. You're not gonna
get him back. He tore out his aorta.

600
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:56,612
- Time of death: 7:33.
- What a waste.

601
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,550
She's a big girl, Carter.

602
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,621
Yeah. With a drinking problem.

603
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,525
- I don't tell people how to live.
- She was living in your house.

604
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,931
- I didn't make her drink.
- You didn't stop her.

605
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,128
She's not a drunk.

606
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,702
Yes, she is.

607
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,341
Are you stupid or do you
not give a damn about her?

608
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,172
Or do you want her
to keep drinking?

609
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:24,749
You like them a little vulnerable so you
can play the caring, brooding comforter?

610
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,145
- Don't push your luck, Carter.
- What are you gonna do, beat me up?

611
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,256
You gonna bash my
head into the ground?

612
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,286
Get out of my way.

613
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,655
If you're not helping
her, you're hurting her.

614
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,303
Another two of Narcan, I.M.

615
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:49,702
- What's the total?
- Six.

616
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,775
- What can I do to help?
- Nothing.

617
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,469
Sit on your hands if you
have to. We're good at this.

618
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,437
I promise, she's gonna be fine.

619
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,674
Chloe, what were you taking?

620
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,490
- How we doing?
- BP's 140/80. Pulse, 90.

621
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,985
That's high for heroin.

622
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,956
Chloe, were you doing
coke? Were you speedballing?

623
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,408
Step on it. She's throwing PVCs.

624
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,599
- Chloe, where's Suzy?
- Call Dispatch. Tell them that we're...

625
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,895
- Lost her pulse.
- Out of the way.

626
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,061
- I mean it. What did I say?
- She's in V-fib.

627
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,297
Charging.

628
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,999
- You need to intubate her.
- Clear!

629
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,504
- Nothing.
- Charging 300.

630
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:31,012
You need to intubate her now.
- No. Clear!

631
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,344
Pratt, I told you
to get rid of him.

632
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,951
- Pratt?
- I told him to do it.

633
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:42,458
What is with you people?
You can't turf one lunatic?

634
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,858
- He cured my sciatica.
- What?

635
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,431
I was tossing him out, he put his
hands on my back, my sciatica's gone.

636
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,262
Yeah, so's your brain.

637
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,031
All right. Hey, you. That's
enough. You're out of here.

638
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,936
Worry not, my child. And
put your faith in his powers.

639
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,202
- I need you to... ED:
Believe in his powers.

640
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,608
- Let the passion of his love heal you.
- Hey!

641
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,443
- Believe in his power.
- Let go. Get out. Get out.

642
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,949
Fear not, and put your
trust in his almighty glory.

643
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,848
He's gonna live.

644
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,279
- Stanley.
- I did the right thing.

645
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,550
You were lucky. It
could've gone the other way.

646
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,227
- But it didn't.
- Not this time.

647
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,626
- Dr. Weaver here?
- I'm sorry, is this an emergency?

648
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:24,202
We're from the Illinois Women's Health
Coalition. Dr. Romano said she was here.

649
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,332
All right, I need you to get
out. Get out. Go on, get out.

650
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,532
I don't wanna see you in here
again unless you're on a gurney. Go.

651
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,678
- You will walk by his side renewed...
- Carter.

652
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:44,222
I just wanted to apologize
if I was abrupt earlier.

653
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,915
Um.

654
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,593
But I...

655
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,790
I don't want you
worrying about me.

656
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,297
Well, somebody should.

657
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,500
Not you. It's too complicated.

658
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,295
- What's so complicated?
- You and me.

659
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,605
Us.

660
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,408
What "us"? Is there an us?

661
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,613
Like I said, it's complicated.

662
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,413
But I appreciate your
concern. And I'm okay.

663
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,814
Thanks.

664
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,095
Hi.

665
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,061
I dreamed you were here.

666
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,264
Chloe, where's Suzy?

667
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,372
She's with me.

668
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,605
She's not with you.

669
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,972
Did you leave her
in the hotel room?

670
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,644
Did you take her
with you to get drugs?

671
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,946
Chloe.

672
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,056
- I don't know.
- Chloe.

673
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,126
Chloe, think. Think, Chloe.

674
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,634
- Maybe... Maybe he took her.
- Who, Joe?

675
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,366
Chloe? Chloe.

676
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,442
He broke my heart.

677
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,484
Where is Joe? Is Suzy with Joe?

678
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:23,644
I don't know. I'm sorry.

679
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,017
I'm so sorry.

680
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,187
I screwed up, Susan.

681
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:32,694
Oh, I screwed up.

682
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,335
I'm sorry.

683
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,528
Yeah, Chloe...

684
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,639
you screwed up.

685
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:12,791
Dr. Lewis?

686
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,359
Nothing?

687
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,605
Uh, we've got officers out
canvassing the entire precinct.

688
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,139
How's your sister?

689
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,410
She's stable.

690
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,711
The detectives
wanna talk to her.

691
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,754
She doesn't remember anything.

692
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:42,958
Uh...

693
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,063
The longer she's missing,
the worse it gets, right?

694
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,826
Because I heard that if you don't
find them in the first 12 hours...

695
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:03,144
Do you have a place to stay? If
you want, I can take you to a hotel.

696
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:07,910
No. I couldn't sleep if I wanted
to. Where's your partner?

697
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,185
He's out looking.

698
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,354
When's your shift over?

699
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,663
Oh, um.

700
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,830
It was over a few hours ago.

701
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:39,373
She's only 6 years old.

702
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,942
Yeah.
