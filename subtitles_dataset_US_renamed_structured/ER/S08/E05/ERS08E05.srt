1
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,975
Yeah, it's... No, it's
my pager number.

2
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:17,117
Yes. Dr. Kerry Weaver.

3
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:23,747
No. It's nothing serious. I just have
some personal information for her.

4
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,859
- All right. Thank you.
- Good morning.

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,824
Good morning. You all set?

6
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:32,023
Oh, yeah. I forgot how jammed
the El can be during rush hour.

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,861
- Is there any chance I could get a locker?
- Oh, sure. Fourth to the right.

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,802
I'll have them
take the name off.

9
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,808
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

10
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,807
Hey, watch out! Coming through!

11
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,477
I heard it, but I didn't believe it.
- Malik!

12
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,317
Oh, we missed you!

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,823
They actually talked you
into coming back here.

14
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,620
- Bad idea?
- I didn't say that.

15
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,821
Frank, call Housekeeping.
Someone took a dump in Exam 2.

16
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,803
Our mad crapper's back, huh?

17
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:08,128
- If I catch him, he'll
be pooping in a bag.

18
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,213
- What happened to the board?
- Weaver.

19
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,799
Spanky's in Curtain 3 complaining
of incontinence. I'm not touching him.

20
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,136
- I'll take him.
- I don't think you want that.

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,542
- Here. Leg injury, Curtain 1.
- Welcome back, Dr. L.

22
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:24,742
- Thanks. What's the story with Spanky?
- He likes nurses. A lot.

23
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,217
Dr. Lewis? Are you Susan Lewis?
- Yes.

24
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,323
Cleo Finch, the Senior
on nights this week.

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,549
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,421
- I have a few pass-ons.
- Okay.

27
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,861
Curtain 3, worst headache of his life.
Do a spinal tap if the head CT is negative.

28
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,728
- Okay. No problem.
- Well, well, well.

29
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,200
- Dr. Susan Lewis.
- Dr. Benton.

30
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,362
Just when I thought
it was safe to come in.

31
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,667
- I missed you too, Peter.
- I know.

32
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,268
So can I buy you breakfast?

33
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,437
I just got here, but you
can get me lunch. Oh, sorry.

34
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,550
I have to sign out and
get to Schaumburg.

35
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,618
- Another interview?
- No, the job's mine.

36
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,051
- Meeting the medical director today.
- Congratulations.

37
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,850
Nosebleed in
Suture's got Merocel.

38
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,255
Check on him. Wear
a mask, he's a spitter.

39
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,190
Right. Are you going somewhere?

40
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:12,060
I've been offered the chance to run
a pediatric urgent care. Five doctors...

41
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,792
- eight-hour shifts, no overnights.
- Yeah, but it's...

42
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,561
- What?
- In Schaumburg.

43
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:20,299
It's 40 minutes away. IV drug
user with a shooter's abscess.

44
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,534
Whisked off to Echo
before I could drain him.

45
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,803
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,243
They just brought in a
homeless lady with maggots.

47
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,043
I'd see her before they
start crawling away.

48
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,241
Thanks.

49
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,646
- Mark, can you get the water?
- Did you see my vertigo notes?

50
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,290
I got it. CORDAY: What?

51
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,985
- My vertigo notes. They were right here.
- We need to leave in 10 minutes.

52
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,495
- As soon as I find my notes.
- When did you last have them?

53
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,425
- Last night.
- That will be fun.

54
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,400
Okay, hold on. Dad, can
I go to a party tonight?

55
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,504
- It's a school night.
- Something's burning.

56
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,573
Just for dinner. It's
Claire's birthday.

57
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,936
- Who's Claire?
- A girl from school.

58
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,603
Sorry. Do you want
some cereal or something?

59
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,645
- No. I'll get something later.
- Dad?

60
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,181
- Let me talk to her mother.
- Is your mom there?

61
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,182
Mark, I have an
8:00 thyroidectomy.

62
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:09,346
Hi, this is Mark Greene. Yeah,
Rachel's dad. I just was wanting to...

63
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,459
- So how did you meet Claire?
- She's my partner in art class.

64
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,529
Uh-huh. What are you working on?

65
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,757
Call me after dinner
and I'll pick you up.

66
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,627
Cool.

67
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,934
- Katherine's early.
- Good.

68
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,836
Gonna need to get
dressed in the car.

69
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,203
- Hi. Is Rachel ready?
- Who are you?

70
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,311
This is Andrew. He's
driving me to school.

71
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,312
- Nice to meet you.
- Here are your notes. Dining-room table.

72
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,973
- When did this happen?
- Oh, sorry, I forgot.

73
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,619
Andrew has a car while
his dad's out of town.

74
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,654
- You have a license?
- Yeah. Well, I got it in June.

75
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,316
- I have no accidents, you know.
- We can take you to school.

76
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,361
No, no, it's good. Now you
guys won't be late for work.

77
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,296
Well, I guess she's
making friends.

78
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,654
- I don't like taking my clothes off.
- You have to to be examined.

79
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,692
Can't you just listen to my stomach?
I think something's, like, blown loose.

80
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,853
- It keeps making these weird noises.
- Maybe you're hungry.

81
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,022
And maybe I'm
bleeding into my belly.

82
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,599
Could it be a complication
from my surgery?

83
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,828
I don't know. My x-ray
vision isn't working.

84
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,666
- Are you mocking me?
- No.

85
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,707
- It sounds like you're mocking me.
- I'm taking you seriously...

86
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,709
which is why I'll examine you
as soon as you get undressed.

87
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,109
- You just wanna see me naked.
- I want to examine you.

88
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:18,218
Yeah, examine me naked. Can I get
a male doctor in here? A straight one?

89
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,445
First day of school,
already making friends?

90
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,055
- I'm a shoo-in for homecoming queen.
- So far, so good.

91
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:27,387
Oh, yeah. Foul abscess, a
neurotic granny, naked boy here.

92
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,359
And I had to break
into Chen's locker.

93
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,964
- Did you steal her stuff?
- Weaver gave it to me.

94
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,863
What are you using for
maggots these days? Cetacaine?

95
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,402
Good thought, but
Kerry's immune to it.

96
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:42,566
- You're enjoying this, aren't you?
- Colonel Dixon's Magical Maggot Mix.

97
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,211
Seriously, you
paint it on with milk.

98
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:49,076
Paramedic radios over this. Dr. Greene
and Dr. Lewis, two of our Attendings.

99
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,309
Welcome. Don't kill anyone.
And I'll mix you up a fresh batch.

100
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,047
Dr. Lewis is a wealth of knowledge,
but don't ask her where anything is.

101
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,682
She is just getting re-oriented
after a five-year sabbatical herself.

102
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,987
Five years?

103
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,921
- Posttraumatic stress.
- What happened?

104
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,158
You don't wanna know. Fill
these out and then come find me.

105
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,167
- Do you have a pen?
- Come prepared. Want the tour?

106
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,568
I think I can find my way around
again. New group of neophytes?

107
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,937
- I get to babysit them too.
- It's the burden of being Chief Resident.

108
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,702
- You've heard?
- Yes, I have.

109
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,404
Oh, nurse? Nurse? Nurse?

110
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,742
- Are you talking to me?
- I don't know your name.

111
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,579
You haven't met Abby yet.
Abby Lockhart, Dr. Susan Lewis.

112
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,916
- Susan, Abby. Susan used to work here.
- That's the rumor.

113
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,217
Could you set me up
for suturing in Exam 3?

114
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,053
- Set you up?
- Open a kit...

115
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,593
some 4-0 nylon,
number-seven gloves, Betadine.

116
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,857
It's all in the room. New chest pain in 2.
- Altered LOC over here!

117
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:42,525
Hey, Mooney. Get started on the
chest pain here. You know the routine.

118
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,729
- Oxygen, aspirin, nitro times three.
- I can't believe you're back.

119
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,966
- You look great!
- So do you. I love your hair.

120
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,269
Hey, my brother
could be dying here.

121
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,483
- Ready, steady, lift.
- No response to Narcan.

122
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,911
We were just talking.
That's it, talking.

123
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,983
- Is he taking any medications?
- Not that he's told me about.

124
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:02,111
Lack of disconjugate gaze and conjugate
deviation rules out a structural lesion.

125
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,259
CBC, chem panel, 12-lead,
tox screen and a head CT.

126
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,792
- Did he have a stroke?
- It's too early to say.

127
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:12,956
The abrupt onset suggests CNS bleed,
seizure, even cardiopulmonary anoxia.

128
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,602
- Pulse ox is 99.
- Don't let him die.

129
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,998
No tremor...

130
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,629
asterixis or myoclonus, suggestive
of a metabolic encephalopathy.

131
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,639
I'm trying to listen.

132
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,246
- You want a portable chest?
- Ask Professor Carter.

133
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,109
How would you
describe your pain?

134
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,510
It hurts.

135
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:34,485
- Is it stabbing? Burning? Tearing?
- What's the freaking difference?

136
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,489
Okay. I'm gonna give you some
medicine under your tongue.

137
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,018
And open.

138
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,856
- Let me know if it's better.
- Three sprays?

139
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,000
- Yeah. Nitro times three.
- At once?

140
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,829
I don't feel good.
What's happening?

141
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,164
I'm gonna put your
head down for a minute.

142
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,829
- I feel so dizzy.
- What?

143
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,998
Everything's blurry. - Okay.

144
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,612
You're gonna feel a little bit more
oxygen flowing through your nose.

145
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,610
- How's the pain in your chest?
- Worse.

146
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,946
- 80/60.
- Is it bad?

147
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,848
- No, just a little bit low.
- Was that the wrong medicine?

148
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,615
No, everything's okay. This
just happens sometimes.

149
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,520
Dr. Mooney is one of our best.

150
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,184
- I'll go write my note.
- Yeah, do that.

151
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,724
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- It's in the differential.

152
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,562
- Where did you come up with that?
- Photographic memory.

153
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:26,195
And I delivered a lecture
on coma last week.

154
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,739
- Ridiculous.
- What?

155
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,070
Time. Yesterday it seems
you couldn't start an IV.

156
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,145
It was longer than yesterday.
- Carter.

157
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,872
- Yeah?
- Mooney saw my patient.

158
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,813
- What'd you tell him about nitro?
- The basics. Three sprays.

159
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,386
- Three sprays. Right. Bam, bam, bam.
- All at once?

160
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,217
- No, you give them every five minutes.
- You left that out.

161
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,589
- How's his pressure?
- Zero over zero. He's dead.

162
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,563
- I'm kidding.
- Ha-ha.

163
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,894
I pulled him through. Keep a
short leash on your students, huh?

164
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,003
- All clear.
- I'm gonna go check on this guy.

165
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,730
- You got this?
- Yeah, I think so.

166
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,371
Did you see him get hit?

167
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,171
No. I went to return the shopping
cart and he was just laying by the car.

168
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,327
- What do you got?
- Weak pulse, shallow resps.

169
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,936
What's your dad's name? - Alan.

170
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,916
Alan, can you open your eyes?

171
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,248
- GCS is 2-4-5.
- Is he waking up?

172
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,187
Not just yet.

173
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,856
Mark, look at this.

174
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,594
We need a backboard.

175
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:29,259
Blood count's normal. Chemistry's
okay. Nothing on the tox screen.

176
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,133
- All of his labs look good.
- Why is he still in a coma?

177
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,604
How much longer up there?

178
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,807
- Has he ever seen a psychiatrist?
- I don't think so.

179
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,609
Sorry.

180
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,618
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Coming through!
Need a portable chest and pelvic.

181
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,053
Your brother has signs
of psychogenic coma.

182
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,955
- What's that?
- When we open his eyelids, they flutter.

183
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,962
He responds to a Q-Tip in the
nose. I don't think it's a real coma.

184
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,890
What do you mean, he's faking?

185
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,337
What about the shaking and the
frothing at the mouth and everything?

186
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,133
I'd like to get a
psychiatric consultation.

187
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:12,575
Yeah, yeah. That would be great. He
has been under a lot of pressure lately.

188
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,738
- Hey, what's taking so long?
- You're still dressed?

189
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,649
- We'll move him to a quieter room.
- Great.

190
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,152
Do you have a gown? I could catch
cold. It's bad enough I'm bleeding out.

191
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,587
Go back to your bed.
The nurse will bring one.

192
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,692
How long until the
psychiatrist gets here?

193
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,123
I'll let you know.

194
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,355
Can I just talk to my
surgeon? British chick, red hair.

195
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,964
Will you shut up?!

196
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,835
- Systolic's up to 100.
- Let's roll him. Set up the SonoSite.

197
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,666
- Cross for 6. GREENE:
Large abrasions to the back.

198
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,037
Did the car crush him
against something?

199
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,678
I didn't see. ALAN: Tracey...?

200
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,007
- Daddy? GREENE:
Sir, you're in a hospital.

201
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,515
- Do you know what the date is?
- Daddy, I'm so sorry.

202
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,880
You didn't see me. - Alan?

203
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,352
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

204
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,458
- Sorry for what?
- Were you in the car?

205
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,992
- I'm sorry.
- Looks like a liver lac.

206
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,361
- I'll go get her.
- Let's intubate. Etomidate and sux.

207
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:10,493
- Where were you stationed?
- In Birmingham.

208
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:15,141
- I have an uncle in Birmingham.
- Does he work in the steel mills?

209
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,368
The university.

210
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:21,345
We handled mail
for 7 million soldiers.

211
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,417
Sixty-five thousand
pieces every eight hours.

212
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:30,886
- My goodness.
- Nothing beats a letter from home.

213
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,387
Ooh!

214
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,188
What do you think?

215
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,763
It's a perforation. A
small hole in the colon.

216
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,830
It's from her
diverticular disease.

217
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,937
I'm afraid you'll need
an operation to fix it.

218
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:51,078
- Is that really necessary? She's so weak.
- It's really the only option.

219
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,406
Can't we wait a few days?

220
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,073
Then she'll become extremely ill,
and surgery could be dangerous.

221
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,346
If I were your mother, would
you recommend the operation?

222
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,747
Absolutely.

223
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,758
- Then we'll do it.
- Dr. Corday?

224
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,125
I have a Mr. Ashman who
says you repaired his hernia.

225
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:15,758
- Chubby, drug-seeking hypochondriac?
- Complains of abdominal pain.

226
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,461
- What's his exam like?
- Didn't do one.

227
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,037
Then why are you talking to me?

228
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,198
Some surgeons treat
their patients primarily.

229
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,971
- Not this one.
- Well, he's going to say he's tender.

230
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,149
- You'll be seeing him eventually.
- Maybe, maybe not.

231
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,285
- Oh, I'm pretty certain.
Abby. ABBY: Malik.

232
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,284
Who gets the vent? - Curtain 3.

233
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:38,050
- I have to start a dopamine drip.
- Curtain 2, he's still fully clothed.

234
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,058
- He needs a gown, don't you think?
- Sure.

235
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,891
Stop! Ah!

236
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,827
Hey! HOWARD: Somebody!

237
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,126
Ah! Ah!

238
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,826
- You thought you could fool me?
- Mr. Norden!

239
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,729
Stop it! Security!

240
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,239
You take a loan from Mr. Bennett,
he expects his money back.

241
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,710
You pay it by Monday or next time it's
gonna be your head, you understand?

242
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,943
I need a nurse in here. Oh,
my God. Are you all right?

243
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,818
- He broke my legs.
- He's not your brother?

244
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:19,295
- Want me to call your mom?
- No. No. It's just us.

245
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:24,304
God, we were having
such a great day too.

246
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:29,036
He took me out to lunch
because I got into law school.

247
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,802
Early acceptance?

248
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,339
He even...

249
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:39,611
He even laminated a copy
of the letter to his toolbox.

250
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:46,956
- What is that? What are they doing?
- They're just taking x-rays.

251
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,057
- Is something broken?
- He may have a crushed pelvis.

252
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:58,195
- Is that really bad?
- Possibly. He might need surgery.

253
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,033
God.

254
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:05,201
He had to have been run over
or pinned against something.

255
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,149
It was a wall.

256
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,982
What?

257
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:23,892
Look, I thought
I was in reverse.

258
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:29,161
It was such a tight space. He was
out front waiting for me to back out.

259
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,569
I thought it was in reverse.

260
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,151
- Mr. Stegman's troponin is positive.
- I sent Mooney to the library.

261
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:55,728
- Good call. CPK on Norden.
- That's Susan's patient. Dr. Lewis.

262
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,296
- Has she always been high-maintenance?
- She's not. She's great.

263
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,128
- Could you get a rectal temp in Room 4?
- Anything else?

264
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,463
- That should do it.
- I heard about your hit man.

265
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,072
More like an enforcer.

266
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,641
- Never a dull moment.
- I could use a dull moment.

267
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,176
- Pick a chart. Any chart.
- This is a setup.

268
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,473
No, just go ahead. Pick.

269
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,843
- Are you sure?
- No.

270
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,982
Female abdominal
pain. What did you get?

271
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,382
Suture removal.

272
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,489
- This is definitely a setup.
- On a scrotum.

273
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,056
Maybe not.

274
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,716
All right, where is he? - Who?

275
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,988
Mr. Ashman. You
paged for a consult.

276
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,098
Curtain 2. Epigastric
tenderness on exam.

277
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,531
- As predicted.
- Better hurry before he finds his clothes.

278
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,671
Dr. Corday, there's a code in
the SICU, one of your patients.

279
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,171
You'll have to keep him hidden.

280
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,739
Amal? AMAL: Yes.

281
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:49,076
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis. How long have
you had your stomach trouble?

282
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,843
Since yesterday. How
long is this gonna take?

283
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,010
I don't know. It depends
on what's wrong.

284
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:58,454
Well, I need to be home in
two hours, no matter what.

285
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,525
Pressure's good, 110/60.

286
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,924
TKO the saline. Send
up the last two O-neg.

287
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,462
- Is he okay?
- He's responding to blood transfusion.

288
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,465
- But he needs surgery to repair his liver.
- Hold the elevator!

289
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,695
- Can I go with him?
- Take her to the surgical waiting room.

290
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,863
Wait right here, I'll
come back and get you.

291
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,475
- You want one-shot IVP?
- We'll do it upstairs.

292
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,543
- It's two-plus for heme.
- Got it.

293
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,545
Dr. Greene? Did you get
a BAL on the daughter?

294
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,147
I smelled alcohol on her breath.
A DUI with injury is a felony.

295
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,378
- She wasn't driving.
- Now she says she was.

296
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,717
- Did you get the CT? Radiology's waiting.
- Peter took him to the O.R.

297
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,552
She's changing her story.

298
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,389
- Did you smell alcohol on the
daughter? WEAVER: I don't know. Maybe.

299
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,623
- Are you arresting her?
- You can still draw a level.

300
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,496
Give her a break. Her
father's in critical condition.

301
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,830
Because she hit him
while under the influence.

302
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,403
- Doesn't seem drunk to me.
- Forget it.

303
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,065
I'll call a phlebotomist
from the station.

304
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,736
You'll get your draw. Just wait
until her dad's out of surgery.

305
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,506
- How long?
- A couple of hours.

306
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,412
My sergeant wants me back
on the streets. I can't babysit.

307
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,418
Well, come back. She's
not gonna go anywhere.

308
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,852
Take your time
and think it over.

309
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,185
No, you don't understand.
I have to have an abortion.

310
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,091
- You have other options, you know.
- No, not for me.

311
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,755
My parents are so strict.

312
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:17,030
- They'll kill me.
- Everybody thinks that.

313
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,763
No, it's different for us.

314
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,207
I have to be a virgin
on my wedding day.

315
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,641
- I think if you give them the chance...
- No.

316
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,838
If they find out
that I've had sex...

317
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,780
I'm no longer their daughter.

318
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:36,013
They'll send me away,
out of the country.

319
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,990
And I don't want
to live there. I can't.

320
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,685
- Hmm.
- What?

321
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,892
Do you know what an
ectopic pregnancy is?

322
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,966
A miscarriage?

323
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:54,335
Not exactly. It's where the
fetus grows in the fallopian tube.

324
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,302
- So then I have to have an abortion.
- It's more complicated than that.

325
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,503
- You'll need surgery.
- An operation?

326
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,479
- Right now.
- Well, how long does it take?

327
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,711
- You leave the hospital by tomorrow.
- I have to be home for dinner in an hour.

328
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,381
If you don't have surgery, it
could rupture. You'll bleed to death.

329
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,722
- Then I'll come back Saturday.
- You may not make it to Saturday.

330
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,161
- I don't care.
- I need a doctor in Trauma 1 right now.

331
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,928
Pregnancy is confidential. We
don't have to tell your parents.

332
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:27,163
- Dr. Lewis, status epilepticus.
- You stay right there. I'll be right back.

333
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,332
Amal, okay?

334
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,538
Paramedics gave 4 of
Ativan, but she's still seizing.

335
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,615
- How's the airway?
- Borderline. You may have to tube her.

336
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,274
- Give another 2 of Ativan.
- Oh, you got this one?

337
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,081
- Who are you?
- Susan Lewis. It's my first day.

338
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,847
- Resident?
- Attending.

339
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,924
Tachy at 130.

340
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,023
- We'll do it together.
- Okay.

341
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,874
- How long has she been seizing?
- Got the call 20 minutes ago.

342
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,023
- Any history?
- Husband only speaks Spanish.

343
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,692
- Okay, let's prep a gram of Dilantin.
- We should intubate.

344
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,699
Go ahead.

345
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,397
- Push 70 of Zemuron.
- What?

346
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,408
- Rocuronium.
- I have to go to the pharmacy.

347
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:09,709
- It's the best non-depolarizing agent.
- Maybe, but we don't stock it.

348
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,545
Hundred of sux.
I'll get the airway.

349
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,950
Push the Dilantin.

350
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,820
360. Clear. NURSE 1: Clear.

351
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,327
- Still in fib.
- How long since Cordarone?

352
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,796
- Twenty minutes.
- 360 again. Give an amp of epi.

353
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,629
- I just did.
- Trying to raise the dead, Lizzie?

354
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,930
Clear. NURSE 1: Clear.

355
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,639
Septic hemicolectomy. Maxed
out on dopamine and Levophed.

356
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,743
- Asystole.
- Go directly to the morgue.

357
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,575
- Do not pass "go." Do not collect $200.
- Okay, that's it. I'll call the family.

358
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,742
Not that I'm keeping score, but isn't
this your third post-op death this week?

359
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,285
Congratulations. We
call that a hat trick.

360
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,758
- Thousand of Dilantin onboard.
- Get ready with phenobarb.

361
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,520
The husband.

362
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,221
Sir, does your
wife have epilepsy?

363
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,595
- Can we get a translator?
- No, it's okay.

364
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,980
She's on an anti-TB
med. Isoniazid.

365
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,686
- What?
- It's an overdose...

366
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,559
because the label is in English.

367
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,964
It says, "Take once a day."
O-N-C-E. In Spanish, that means 11.

368
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,468
She took 11 pills a day?

369
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,665
We need pyridoxine, at least 6 grams.
It's the only way we're gonna stop this.

370
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,175
Check the blood gas. She'll need
an amplified carbon. She's acidemic.

371
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,019
- Pavulon while we wait.
- What did you say?

372
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,849
I said we'd help her.

373
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,822
- I am diabetic. I need water.
- Well, then we'll start an IV for you.

374
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,689
- I drink. I throw up. I feel better.
- No. Nothing to drink.

375
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:10,325
You have gallstones
the size of golf balls.

376
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,935
- I have "golf" stones?
- You have gallstones.

377
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,268
- Can you start a line? MAU:
How do you charge this?

378
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,276
The crash cart. He's
crashing. Looks like V-tach.

379
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,846
Does he have a pulse?
- I don't think so.

380
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:26,185
Charge to 200. Stanley, have
you ever shocked a patient before?

381
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,945
- This one's all yours.
- That's okay.

382
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,282
- I am right here. ABBY:
Charged and ready.

383
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,587
Apply firm pressure. And before you
press the buttons, back off, say "clear."

384
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,195
Okay. Clear. CARTER: Ow!

385
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,354
Did you get shocked?

386
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,024
You're supposed to say
"clear" before, not after.

387
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,262
- Normal sinus rhythm! I've got a pulse!
- So does he, thank God.

388
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,565
Were you touching the
bed frame? EKG lead?

389
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,541
- No. His arm right here.
- Oh, ouch.

390
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,372
Hold on. I'll get
you an ice pack.

391
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,209
Feels like someone
kicked me in the chest.

392
00:21:56,382 --> 00:22:00,877
Well, consider yourself
lucky, Mr. Stegman.

393
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,420
- How long has she been seizing?
- Almost an hour.

394
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,221
Four grams of
pyridoxine onboard.

395
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,830
She needs 1 gram per gram
ingested. Give another 4.

396
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,091
- We don't have another 4.
- Go to the pharmacy.

397
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,598
- I can't.
- Send another nurse.

398
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,669
This is all we have
in the whole hospital.

399
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,601
Okay, send couriers to Mercy,
Northwestern, Parkside...

400
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,241
Parkside closed last year.

401
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,401
Every nearby hospital. We
need all the pyridoxine we can get.

402
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,945
V-fib. Starting compressions.

403
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,911
Charge to 200.

404
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,124
- Daughter was driving?
- Crushed him against a wall.

405
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,089
You wonder why
I don't have kids.

406
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,456
- Lizzie, what you got?
- Perfed diverticulum.

407
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,758
Clean under your fingernails.
Don't want another post-op infection.

408
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,892
Dr. Benton, there's a
Roger on the phone.

409
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,958
He's in surgery.

410
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,113
- Take a message.
- He says it's important.

411
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,882
- Hold the phone.
- He's crashing!

412
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,603
Get four more units of packed cells!
- Good news can wait.

413
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:00,041
- Bad news will never go away.
- Tell him I'll call him back.

414
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,113
Hold compressions.

415
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,982
- Asystole.
- Start pacing at 140.

416
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,315
Courier's got pyridoxine from
Mercy. It'll be here in 10 minutes.

417
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,184
Turn up the gain.

418
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,319
- No capture.
- Resume compressions.

419
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:26,470
- How long has she been down?
- No cardiac activity for 35 minutes.

420
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,002
You want to keep going?

421
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,336
PH is 6.8.

422
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,952
We'll never get her back.
I'm calling it. Stop CPR.

423
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,486
Put the husband in a
quiet room. I'll be right there.

424
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,693
Good pickup. <i>Once.</i>

425
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,835
I would have
missed the diagnosis.

426
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,334
A lot of good it did.

427
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,614
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah. The boys bounce back quick.

428
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,512
Ow! I think I might've
tweaked it again.

429
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:14,347
Want one of the doctors to take a
look at your back? Or your front?

430
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,245
- Is that Yetna?
- Mm-hm.

431
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,119
She's tossing her cookies.

432
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,319
No cookies. Chicken,
potato and ice cream.

433
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,158
- Dr. Carter, I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

434
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,858
- Should we order an x-ray?
- No. It's just a spasm.

435
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,129
Could be somatic dysfunction
at the myofascial junction.

436
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,273
I studied alternative
medicine in Hong Kong.

437
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,807
I could try a
muscle-energy technique.

438
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,571
I think you've done
enough for one day.

439
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,191
Help me mobilize the liver.
- Bovie and pickups.

440
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,208
- Get a good look at the IV seal.
- Peter! Where's Reece?

441
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,780
- What?
- Reece isn't in the playroom.

442
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,321
- You were picking him up.
- He wasn't there.

443
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,468
Free up the falciform.
- Where is he?

444
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,461
I thought you had him here.
- No.

445
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,153
- Who let this guy in?
- Carla's mother pick him up?

446
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,492
- No. PERRY:
Systolic's down to 60.

447
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,568
Four-sucker bleed. Lap
pads! Let's pack off the liver.

448
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:07,571
- Her name is on a card at school.
- Okay. I'll try her.

449
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,333
Good idea. You call Grandma...

450
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,672
and I'll roll this guy over so
we can all kiss his ass goodbye!

451
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,979
Sign here.

452
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:20,208
- Corday finally see him?
- No. I drank that Russian water.

453
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:24,551
- Yetna's water?
- Yeah. I'm better now, no thanks to you.

454
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,488
- Take this, you'll need it.
- You seen the girl in Exam 1?

455
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,754
- She took off. She'll be back at 9.
- Why didn't anyone get me?

456
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,831
- You were busy with the arrest.
- She has an ectopic.

457
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,991
- You didn't tell me.
- Where's the chart?

458
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,399
- It's here somewhere.
- Could you find it, please?

459
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,871
Could you pull up "Razavi" on the
computer and print out a red sheet?

460
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,372
Excuse me. We're here to
see Dr. Carter. She fainted.

461
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:51,006
- I did not faint. I was dizzy.
- You'll need to see a triage nurse.

462
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,118
- Is that you?
- Through those doors.

463
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,414
We should go through those
doors and right back to the car.

464
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,057
- Please. John Carter.
- Dr. Carter's very busy.

465
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,248
John!

466
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,123
If you wanna see a doctor,
you need to sign in at triage.

467
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,457
- Gamma, what are you doing here?
- Ask him.

468
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,133
- She fainted outside Marshall Field's.
- I did not.

469
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,565
- Did you hit your head?
- No. I didn't faint.

470
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,570
- This is your grandmother?
- Gamma, this is Susan Lewis.

471
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,208
- Pleasure.
- I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

472
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,243
Well, I guess you're
only rude to strangers.

473
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,405
- John... CARTER: Do
you have any chest pains?

474
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,486
Mrs. Wilson? Mrs. Wilson,
your surgery went very well.

475
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,316
- You're finished?
- Yes. You're on your way to recovery.

476
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,586
Good. I need your address.

477
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,754
Gotta send you a thank-you note.

478
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,594
- Dr. Corday? Dr. Corday?
- Yes.

479
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,896
Carmen Torino from Infection
Control. Do you have a minute?

480
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,268
- What do you need?
- To speak to you in private.

481
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,107
Okay. Keep her fluids at 125
an hour. Vitals Q 15, CBC in 30.

482
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,277
You lost another
patient today from sepsis.

483
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,852
Yes, but he was
debilitated before surgery.

484
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,352
I understand.

485
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:06,321
However, his death triggered
a formal investigation.

486
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,087
- Excuse me?
- You need to be cultured.

487
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,787
- Cultured?
- In case your body's carrying bacteria...

488
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:16,129
that's infecting your patients. Can
you stop by the clinic in an hour?

489
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,100
That's impossible. I have
a patient waiting for me.

490
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:22,036
Your surgical privileges
could be suspended.

491
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,039
If you have concerns,
talk to my chairman.

492
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,472
I already have.

493
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,637
Drs. Romano and Anspaugh
have given us their full support.

494
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,618
- She signed out AMA?
- No.

495
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,879
- Call her back.
- She thinks she'll be deported.

496
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:39,218
Tell her parents that she
needs surgery for an ovarian cyst.

497
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,452
Falsify a consent form? I'd
rather keep them in the dark.

498
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,995
She's pregnant. They
don't have to know.

499
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,726
- You trust her to come back?
- I think so. I hope so.

500
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:52,201
- Dr. Greene, Dr. Corday on two.
- Okay.

501
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,202
- Home yet?
- Susan.

502
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:59,471
Hi. I heard you lost
one, the INH overdose.

503
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:02,012
- Yeah.
- Yeah, those can be tough.

504
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,501
How long is it gonna take?

505
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:06,847
I've been meaning to talk to
you about the nursing shortage.

506
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,921
That blood alcohol came
back just over the limit.

507
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,547
- The girl who hit her father, .092.
- Is he still in surgery?

508
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,523
Want me to tell the cop?
- I will.

509
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,493
Anyway, if you could pitch
in, it'll make everyone happy.

510
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,496
- The nurses are complaining?
- Yeah.

511
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,033
I explained that you're
used to better staffing...

512
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,172
so they'll cut you some
slack until you're up to speed.

513
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,773
Okay, okay. No problem.

514
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,375
Can you cover my last hour?

515
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,704
My first day back,
you're dumping on me?

516
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,370
Elizabeth's stuck. I have
to get home to the baby.

517
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,279
LP results are pending on
Etzler. And Nguyen's getting a V/Q.

518
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,819
- Anything else?
- Yeah, pick me up some milk and Huggies.

519
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,555
BP's 120/80. ROMANO:
Excellent. Take down packing.

520
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,958
Peter. Carla's mom's been home all day.
- Try Jackie.

521
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,223
- I tried. I got Joanie.
- Did she pick him up?

522
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,866
No.

523
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:59,027
- Retrohepatic caval injury.
- Call the police, now! I gotta go.

524
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,538
- Lost another 2 liters.
- Do a Pringle before he bleeds.

525
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,348
- Shirley, get Edson.
- Prep number-eight atrial shunt.

526
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,403
- I need to be relieved.
- Take your hands off, he'll die.

527
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,581
- Your EKG looks good.
- I told you, I'm fine.

528
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,589
Alger means well, but sometimes
he's annoyingly condescending.

529
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,226
You gave him a scare.

530
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,056
I was a little woozy
getting out of the car.

531
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,221
We call that near syncope.

532
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,857
- I call it skipping lunch.
- Well, you need to eat.

533
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,168
I'll do it.

534
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,805
You been sleeping okay?

535
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,172
Are you depressed?

536
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:44,111
- I miss him, John.
- Me too.

537
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,244
- Have you thought about therapy?
- I said, I miss him.

538
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,687
- I'm not mentally unstable.
- Sometimes it's good to talk about it.

539
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:57,192
What's to talk about? He's
gone. And I have things to do.

540
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,921
If I leave now, I can still
make the donors' reception.

541
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,658
We need to monitor
your heart overnight.

542
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,769
In here? I don't think so.

543
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,633
Let's just wait for your
blood-test results to come back.

544
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,708
I've been waiting. I've already
missed two appointments.

545
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,539
If everything checks out, you'll
be back on your feet tomorrow.

546
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:18,775
There are no more
tomorrows, John. This is it.

547
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,718
Your grandfather and I used to
think we had a lifetime of tomorrows.

548
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,819
Hello, is Amal
there? Oh, I'm sorry.

549
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,993
This is Susan, her
friend from school.

550
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,364
I just had a question
about our math homework.

551
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,995
Oh, okay, great. Yeah, I'll call
back after dinner. Okay, thanks.

552
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,473
- Dr. Lewis, Mr. Cardazco's still waiting.
- Who?

553
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:48,739
- His wife died. The overdose.
- Oh, damn it! I completely forgot.

554
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:43,927
No.

555
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,496
No! No, no, no!

556
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,182
Sorry. It has to be a
nasopharyngeal sample.

557
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,757
Oh!

558
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:44,158
Oh, sorry. It felt more
like a brain biopsy.

559
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,766
The enterobacter from your
patients is a very resistant strain.

560
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,765
I'm aware of that.

561
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,798
You may be colonized.

562
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,802
Open wide.

563
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,275
Quick swab of the tonsils.

564
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,574
God.

565
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,539
- So are we finished?
- Just need to do a pelvic.

566
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,151
You've gotta be kidding!

567
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,154
A surgical tech in Ohio was passing
nocardia from her vaginal flora.

568
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:15,454
Thank you for sharing that. I'm nursing.
You want a sample of my milk as well?

569
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:19,291
Absolutely. Then a cath'd
urine and a stool sample.

570
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,866
If you can't go now, take it home
and bring it back in the morning.

571
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:29,703
Inflate the balloon
and tie off the Rumel.

572
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,237
- How is he?
- They're still working on him.

573
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,142
Why are you leaving?
How much longer?

574
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,840
I have another emergency.
Just wait in the room, okay?

575
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,883
They want us to
make out a report.

576
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,216
This is Dr. Benton at County
General. Send a detective here.

577
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,723
My son is missing! So do your
job and send someone down now!

578
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,156
- ETA?
- Two minutes.

579
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,558
- Flip you for the airway.
- He's already intubated.

580
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,995
- What are we getting?
- Mercy's sending a GSW...

581
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,361
- and we're out of beds.
- You coming?

582
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,334
Move Trauma 1 to Exam
1. Whose chart is this?

583
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,733
Oh, that's mine.

584
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,432
Code the charts at time
of discharge for Billing.

585
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:06,840
- I'll do it right now.
- Yeah, and be sure the nurse's notes...

586
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,345
- This patient left the hospital?
- Not sure.

587
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,712
- You're not sure? She's an ectopic.
- It's under control.

588
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,046
What do you mean?
She's not here.

589
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,021
- I'm trying to protect her privacy.
- You should be protecting her life.

590
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,058
- She'll be back in two hours.
- If she's still alive!

591
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,695
Lost his pulse on the scene.

592
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:27,890
- I told her I wouldn't tell her parents.
- You're putting her life at risk.

593
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,058
- Get 4 of O-neg.
- Trust me on this one.

594
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,897
- Prep for a thoracotomy.
- Gown.

595
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,699
Call your patient now.
You're being irresponsible.

596
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:38,310
- If she's sick, they can bring her in.
- Not if she's dead.

597
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,242
- You got too many names on the list.
- Everyone helps out.

598
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,251
The school can't keep
track of 10 people.

599
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,014
Any stranger could
say he was his uncle.

600
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,682
We've never had a problem before.
You sure you got there on time?

601
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,061
What are you doing
here? Where were you?

602
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,258
- What's going on?
- You picked him up from school?

603
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,904
Yeah. He was acting
out. He bit a little girl.

604
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:09,098
- You were in surgery. They called me.
- You had us worried.

605
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,106
I left a message
on your voice mail.

606
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,110
It wasn't Peter's day to
pick him up, it was mine.

607
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,272
- You're still picking him up?
- Every Tuesday and Thursday.

608
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:22,048
He's had three fights
at recess this week.

609
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,620
You fighting?

610
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,021
Teacher wants to know if
there are any problems at home.

611
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:31,061
She thinks he may
need a little more stability.

612
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,731
What are you trying to say?

613
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,924
- Just telling you what she said.
- He wasn't fighting...

614
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,400
when he lived with us.

615
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,199
Maybe he needs to just live
in one home for a while, okay?

616
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,899
Peter, he's my stepson.
We've got an agreement.

617
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,436
Yeah? Well, we need to think
about what's best for Reece.

618
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,775
He's acting out because
he lost his mother.

619
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:56,217
Look, we'll talk about this later. I
need to call the police and get him home.

620
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,925
Dr. Weaver, O.R. called. They don't
think Mr. Pomeroy's gonna make it.

621
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,928
Okay, I'll go up. Can you
do the coroner's forms?

622
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,532
Chuny, tell my grandmother
I'll be five more minutes.

623
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,159
And see if Dr. Lewis
called that ectopic girl.

624
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,572
Gamma.

625
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,200
- What are you doing?
- It's late, John. I've been a good sport.

626
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:22,040
You cannot leave. Fainting can be a
warning sign for heart attack, for stroke.

627
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,545
I'll take my chances.

628
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,911
You'll be signing out
against medical advice.

629
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:30,249
- I've already done that.
- There's still more tests we need to do.

630
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,892
I'll see you at home, John.

631
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:39,092
Don't forget to turn out the
porch light when you come in.

632
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,063
- Check on her in about an hour.
- Certainly.

633
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,930
- Good night. MILLICENT:
I feel like a steak, Alger.

634
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,436
We'll stop at Morton's first.
- Yes, ma'am.

635
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:52,373
Oh, dear, I'm very hungry.
Filet mignon, creamed spinach...

636
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,216
- Sorry if I offended her.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

637
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,610
She never takes me seriously.

638
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,947
What do you expect?
She changed your diapers.

639
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,384
That's true.

640
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:09,818
- Any focal neuro findings, EKG changes?
- No. I monitored her for three hours.

641
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,395
Yeah, she should be okay.

642
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:16,465
- Did you call your ectopic girl?
- I'm gonna give her till 9.

643
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:20,295
- That's a bit of a risk.
- "Danger" is my middle name.

644
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,631
Any other catastrophes?

645
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,945
It's been like an acid
flashback without the good parts.

646
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,581
What was I thinking
when I said I'd come back?

647
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,148
You weren't.

648
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,751
- But at least you're working with friends.
- Yes.

649
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,788
Excuse me. Pickman's
got a woman in active labor.

650
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,791
Showtime.

651
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,988
Denise Frankel,
full-term. She's crowning.

652
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,428
Showtime is right.

653
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,470
- Ah! I need to push!
- Go ahead, push.

654
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,370
- Membrane's ruptured. Fluid's clear.
- How many kids have you had?

655
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,772
- Two. LEWIS: Well,
this one's coming fast.

656
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,844
Take your foot off
the pedal, bed's rising.

657
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,282
- I'm nowhere near it.
- Must be a short.

658
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,445
- What's happening?
- Technical difficulty.

659
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:14,218
Oh, man. When her water broke,
it must have flooded the switch.

660
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,327
Late decel. We have
to get this baby out.

661
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,861
- I can't deliver like this.
- Get Luka. He's tall.

662
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,523
- Carter, take over.
- What...? Where are you going?

663
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,532
What are you doing?

664
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,740
Excuse me. Get down. Get down!

665
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,375
Okay, just blow.

666
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,881
Drop your arm over the
side, I need to start an IV.

667
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,178
- Give me a hand.
- Oh, you're kidding me.

668
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,719
- What are you doing?
- Setting up some equipment.

669
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,881
- Fetal heart rate's 140.
- Don't drop my baby!

670
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,550
Don't worry. Dr. Carter
used to be in the circus.

671
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,559
As a clown, right?

672
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:56,858
- Human cannonball, until I got fired.
- Okay, give a big push. Push!

673
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,937
- Ah!
- Push! Head's out. Relax.

674
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,573
- That cord is tight around the neck.
- Reduce it?

675
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,335
- I don't think so. How about a clamp?
- Toss it.

676
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,178
Second clamp.

677
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,414
Scissors.

678
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,684
Is it a boy or a girl?

679
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,950
One more push and
we're about to find out.

680
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,226
It's a boy.

681
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,857
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he's beautiful.

682
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,558
Can I see him?

683
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,034
Yeah, as soon as we
strap on a parachute.

684
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,105
Oh, yeah.

685
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,265
"Hi, Mom."

686
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,948
- I killed him! Oh, my God, I killed him.
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

687
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,085
I need to see him.
I need to see him.

688
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:55,159
Miss Pomeroy? We have to leave now.
I'm required to place you under arrest.

689
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,955
It was an accident! He was my father!
- Calm down!

690
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,293
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Is this really necessary?

691
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,061
- We only had a couple glasses of wine!
- Let her say bye.

692
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,933
- Where is he? Where did you put him?
- Let her say goodbye.

693
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,802
This way.

694
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,653
God, I'm sorry.

695
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,822
I'm sorry.

696
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,327
- I got Ella's diaper culture.
- You didn't need to do that.

697
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,830
- Hey, not with the food.
- I triple-bagged them.

698
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,332
- Did I hear a phone ring?
- No.

699
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,300
- She still hasn't called?
- Not yet.

700
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,099
- The party was over at 8.
- I know.

701
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,606
- So call her.
- I don't have her phone number.

702
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,007
- Look it up.
- I didn't get Claire's last name.

703
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,511
Mark, you need to
know these things.

704
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,378
I talked to the parents, I
thought everything was okay.

705
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,453
- We don't even know where she is.
- I told you about the party.

706
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,320
- You know what time it is?
- It's only 10:15.

707
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,516
You were supposed
to call two hours ago.

708
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,787
- I'm sorry.
- How'd you get home?

709
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,660
- Andrew.
- I think I'll check on the little one.

710
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,570
All they had were hot dogs and
burgers, so some of us went to eat.

711
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,705
- Some of us, or you and Andrew?
- Dad!

712
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,900
- I need to know these things.
- Sounds like something Mom would say.

713
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:25,014
I wasn't drinking. I'm not doing drugs.
I'm just making some new friends.

714
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,709
- All you had to do was call.
- I tried.

715
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,047
The pay phone was broken.

716
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,986
If you don't believe
me, call the restaurant.

717
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,221
Don't ever let
this happen again.

718
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,832
Okay?

719
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,233
Okay.

720
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,064
If I had a cell phone,
we could keep in touch.

721
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,336
- Yeah, right.
- Seriously, just for emergencies.

722
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,914
We'll see.

723
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,073
Thanks.

724
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,786
You guys do good work.
- So do you.

725
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,522
I'll call you when it's time
to build his tree house.

726
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,436
- Amal.
- Dr. Lewis.

727
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,971
I'm so sorry I'm late. It
was hard to sneak out.

728
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,702
- I am so glad you came back.
- I told the nurse I'd be here at 9.

729
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,109
- Well, people say a lot of things.
- You said it was important.

730
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,718
- Abby, can you find us a room?
- Yeah. Good to see you.

731
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,649
- Where's her chart?
- Weaver's got it.

732
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,790
- Amal's chart? Why?
- I don't know.

733
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,448
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

734
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:45,393
- She's on a call in the lounge.
- Oh, damn it!

735
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,094
- Kerry, get off the phone.
- I work at the ER...

736
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,738
- She's here. You don't have to call.
- Susan...

737
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,965
I told you she'd be back.

738
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,109
- Who?
- Amal, the ectopic.

739
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,643
I didn't call her.

740
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:02,674
Oh.

741
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,520
Hello. Hi. I'm sorry
we got disconnected.

742
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:20,253
No, actually, I got your
number from an investigator...

743
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,095
who specializes in
finding birth parents.

744
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:28,671
Did you give up a
daughter for adoption?

745
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,034
I understand.

746
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,146
No. I...

747
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:40,013
I am sorry. I thought this
was from a reliable source.

748
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:44,019
I will not bother you again.

749
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,553
Good night.
