1
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,866
We were running late. I
threw a bunch of stuff in here.

2
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,444
I got some snacks
and movies for later.

3
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,612
I'll pick him up around 8, okay?

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,580
Jackie?

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,211
I'll pick him up around 8.

6
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,848
Yeah. Sure.

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,220
Listen, I really
appreciate this.

8
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,885
I've got a nanny agency
setting up some interviews.

9
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,530
Don't worry about it, Peter.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,063
All right.

11
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,894
Hey.

12
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,906
John?

13
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,173
John?

14
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,484
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,246
I brought you some aspirin.

16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,686
Oh, Gamma, I just
need to stretch it out.

17
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,849
What you need is to
see my orthopedist.

18
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,156
- I'm making you an appointment today.
- Covering half a shift today.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,266
- Then tomorrow.
- I don't need to see your doctor.

20
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,230
Your back is
nothing to trifle with.

21
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,999
You don't want to end up
with a hunch like Uncle Everett.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,174
This isn't orthopedic, Gamma.

23
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,937
- I was stabbed.
- I know that, John.

24
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,045
All the more reason
to take care of yourself.

25
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,345
- Sorry.
- It's okay, Gamma. I'll get it.

26
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,511
No! Don't move. You
have no shoes on.

27
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,954
- All part of my ninja training.
- Your what?

28
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,965
Oh, no. Sh...

29
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,417
Maybe we should go
back to taking shifts.

30
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,285
Are you gonna make it?

31
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,459
I thought this walk was
supposed to wake me up.

32
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,888
I offered to get you coffee.

33
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,552
I don't need coffee. I need
more than two hours' sleep.

34
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,131
Rachel was 7 before
she slept through the night.

35
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,790
Oh, God. Bite your tongue.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,937
How big is the hundred-gallon
tank in feet? Like 2 by 4, 3 by 5?

37
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,904
Weaver's on the warpath. Run
for your lives. Save yourselves.

38
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,565
- I'm going upstairs.
- Chicken.

39
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,440
Well, how much is a 300-gallon tank?
- <i>$595.</i>

40
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,308
- Without fish? GREENE:
Give me something.

41
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,916
<i>- Is that saltwater?</i>
- I don't know. I didn't taste it.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,083
<i>If it's saltwater...</i>

43
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,152
This guy checked
in at 10:00 last night.

44
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,222
Don't look at me. Weaver's
taking histories on every patient...

45
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,223
- and ordering every test in the book.
- I don't know. Fish.

46
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,726
- There's a red one and a yellow one...
- Unnecessary tests?

47
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,229
You better do something
before somebody shoots her.

48
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,958
- I have to call you back.
- Let's treat and street.

49
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,468
- Any candidates for early parole?
- Take your pick.

50
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,402
- Who's on first?
- Jenny. Possible bladder infection.

51
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,974
Dip's positive for
leukocytes. ICON's negative.

52
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,578
- Jenny, you allergic to any medications?
- No.

53
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,079
All right. I'm gonna give you Bactrim.
One every 12 hours for three days.

54
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,150
Come back if you're
not doing any better.

55
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,583
- Got him waiting on an ankle x-ray.
- I think it's broken.

56
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,017
- Fall off your horse?
- Yes.

57
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,420
- Really?
- It was for the jousting demonstration...

58
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,311
at the Renaissance Faire.
- Cool.

59
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,450
- Any pain here?
- No.

60
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,358
- How about here?
- No. Not too bad.

61
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,431
Okay. I need you to walk for me.

62
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,996
- Yeah, it hurts.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,606
If you can walk on it, it's
just a sprain. Ice it, wrap it...

64
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,435
- and give him some ibuprofen.
- That's it?

65
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,602
Well, normally I'd do some
bloodletting, but we're low on leeches.

66
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,276
- Don't forget about me, Dr. Greene.
- Hi, Candy.

67
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,194
Hi. HALEH: Human
bite to the buttocks.

68
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,382
- Again?
- Some boys can't get enough Candy.

69
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,717
Five hundred of Augmentin
and prep her for suturing.

70
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,020
- Who's sick? You or the pig?
- It's not funny. My hand really hurts.

71
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,721
- Think how the pig feels.
- Mark, what are you doing?

72
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,492
Trying to treat some patients
before they eat each other.

73
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,465
He's already discharged two.

74
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,797
- Thank you, Haleh.
- I think I need Surgilube.

75
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,702
- No kidding.
- You didn't do a proper exam on that girl.

76
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,969
- You could have missed pyelo, PID...
- She was afebrile.

77
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,909
Garden-variety UTI.
Make your hand this shape.

78
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,550
Okay. I want all patients
to be examined thoroughly.

79
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,152
The moment we become
complacent, we make mistakes.

80
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,754
Speak for yourself.

81
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,322
Haleh, put Jenny in a
gown, set her up for a pelvic.

82
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,981
- Dr. Weaver?
- I'm listening.

83
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,186
Twenty-two-year-old woman with
chest pain reproduced by palpation.

84
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,163
- Pulse ox is 97. EKG looks normal.
- Okay. Send her out.

85
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,996
I'm only asking because
she's taking birth-control pills...

86
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,660
putting her at risk for a PE.

87
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,170
- So I was wondering if we should send...
- I got it.

88
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,672
- What?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,334
- You can look at last month's Ql data.
- No, no. I just need to know...

90
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,776
- if we should order a V/Q...
- I'll take it.

91
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,673
Okay. NIKI: Dr. Chen.

92
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,513
I've got an abandoned newborn
female, maybe two hours old.

93
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,678
- How's her color?
- Some peripheral cyanosis.

94
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,518
They dumped her at St.
Anthony's. She's cold to the touch.

95
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,126
- Airway's okay, but a weak cry.
- Uh-huh. Trauma 1.

96
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:37,787
Have you tried letting him fall asleep
with you, then moving him to his bed?

97
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,728
Doesn't matter.
He wakes up crying.

98
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,131
I ask if he's having a
nightmare, he says, "Yeah."

99
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,862
But he can't tell me what they're about.
- About Carla?

100
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,371
Yeah. I found him wandering
around the apartment...

101
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,286
with his little flashlight,
looking for her.

102
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,875
Poor guy. He's confused.

103
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,708
- Yeah.
- It has to get better eventually.

104
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:59,478
I don't know. We were making breakfast
this morning, and it dawned on me...

105
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,655
my son's gonna grow
up without a mother.

106
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,791
Something so basic, such
a big part of who he'll be.

107
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,587
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- Hey, Cleo.

108
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,253
- I reduced your prolapsed rectum.
- What?

109
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,332
- Yeah. I used the old sugar trick.
- You treated my patient?

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,162
- Yeah. She was in pain.
- With sugar?

111
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,305
Yeah. You sprinkle a little on,
water escapes from the mucosa...

112
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,100
the edema subsides, and
you pop that puppy back in.

113
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,675
It could have been a
prolapsed hemorrhoid.

114
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:28,144
- Trust me. That was no hemorrhoid.
- No, wait. Who asked you to see her?

115
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,843
Hey, Dave. Don't treat my
patients unless I ask you to.

116
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,783
- I rectified the situation.
- Anyone could have shoved it in.

117
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,856
"Rectify." You get it? Funny.

118
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,754
- I was waiting for a surgical consult.
- Oh, come on.

119
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,623
- You were gabbing with your boyfriend.
- Is there a problem?

120
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,164
Yes. I never knew anyone so
possessive over somebody else's butthole.

121
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,168
- Just stay away from my patients.
- It's a Freudian thing, isn't it?

122
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:54,104
Who keeps stealing my ultrasound?
We need it for that kid in Curtain 3.

123
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,108
Can somebody get Mrs.
Lorenzo in a gown and put the...?

124
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,543
Who are you hiding from?

125
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,713
- Are you giving yourself a pedicure?
- I think I stepped on a piece of glass.

126
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,553
Let me see.

127
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,727
Ow.

128
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,159
Yeah, you got
something in there.

129
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,959
- Want me to try and take it out?
- Yeah, please.

130
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,806
Luka and I broke
up a few days ago.

131
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,279
Uh... Why?

132
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,711
Both of us realized the relationship
wasn't working a long time ago.

133
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,150
Neither one of us wanted
to be the one to call it.

134
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,157
- So it was amicable?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

135
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,088
Sorry.

136
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,837
- Is that why you're avoiding him?
- Partly.

137
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,170
I had to go to his place this morning...
- Carter.

138
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,805
Chen needs you in Trauma 1.

139
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,543
- What about your foot?
- Sorry.

140
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,172
You're gonna have to find
another excuse to hide out in here.

141
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,285
Have you seen
Mr. Fell's digoxin level?

142
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,943
Ask Abby. She
was working him up.

143
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,715
- Carter, have you seen Abby?
- Try the lounge.

144
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,952
Setup heated,
humidified O2 for blow-by.

145
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,754
- What's this?
- Abandoned newborn.

146
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,057
Needs warm IV fluids, but I can't get
a line. Can you try an interosseous?

147
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,723
- Mm-hm. Where did they leave her?
- A church.

148
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,235
They didn't even bother to dry her off.
- Temp was 91.2.

149
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,737
Boy, she hardly even
reacts when you stick her.

150
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,307
- Damn it!
- What's wrong?

151
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,603
I went through the
bone. I need some gauze.

152
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,339
- Chuny, any luck?
- I can't find the scalp vein.

153
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,497
Carter?

154
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:45,378
- Mm-hm. I'm in. Let's
push 60 cc's of saline.

155
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,418
- How's the Accu-Chek?
- Eighty-two.

156
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,989
We need a cath urine for culture.
- Carter?

157
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,626
- It's infiltrating.
- Damn it.

158
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,957
- Heart rate's 180.
- Okay. This kid needs fluids right now.

159
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,157
- Call Pedes Surgery to do a cutdown.
- What about an umbilical line?

160
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,858
- I can't.
- I did one during my internship.

161
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,103
We won't get it if she's
more than a few hours old.

162
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,071
Fewer complications than a
cutdown. We just need two minutes.

163
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,442
Go get an umbilical-line kit.

164
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,445
- No. Chuny, page Pedes Surgery.
- Just go get the kit, Deb.

165
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,773
What's wrong with
kids these days?

166
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,283
They used to think it was
cool to see me on stilts.

167
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,478
Maybe they're more
sophisticated than we were.

168
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,624
- You mean more vicious.
- They knocked him over.

169
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,852
On purpose. The little buggers
were cheering when I went down.

170
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,087
I made an appointment
for him to see Ortho.

171
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,199
Good. Until then, keep
your wrist elevated and iced.

172
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,197
- Can I get a note for work?
- No problem.

173
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,098
- Hey, boss? Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

174
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,967
Hey.

175
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,532
- Hey.
- Dave, what's your question?

176
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,337
Nothing. Hold the elevator.

177
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,774
- Hold it!
- We're full.

178
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,210
- This is a medical emergency.
- Are you a doctor?

179
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,215
- Yeah. I'm Dr. Dave.
- So I've been warned.

180
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,213
I told you we were full.

181
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,892
- Open your eyes.
- He got caught in one of his traps.

182
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,789
- Traps?
- Jungle Bob lives in the park.

183
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,827
Homeless guys can
be very territorial.

184
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,228
Malik, I need a lateral
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

185
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,061
- Abby's covering Trauma.
- I got this. Go.

186
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,295
My friend Marty's a
mime. He carries a gun.

187
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,803
- I hope you're kidding.
- No.

188
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,237
Some punks love to
hear the mime scream.

189
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,309
Dr. Greene, Weaver wants a
wound culture on your butt bite.

190
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,175
- I've been on my own since I was 10.
- Rachel?

191
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,009
- Hi, Daddy.
- What are you doing here?

192
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,084
- I came to see you.
- How did you get here?

193
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,243
- She took the train.
- From St. Louis?

194
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,581
- By yourself?
- Mom kicked me out.

195
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,590
My mom kicked me out too. Best
thing that ever happened to me.

196
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,852
Need a drape?

197
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,758
Somebody tied off the
umbilical cord with a shoelace.

198
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,443
- Ten blade and umbilical tape.
- Where the hell's Pedes?

199
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,568
- Flush the catheter.
- They should be here.

200
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,100
Come on, Deb. Stay with me.

201
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,762
- Can't get a BP.
- Okay, turn off the alarm.

202
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,441
- Somebody get Weaver.
- Hold on.

203
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,906
I'm cutting the cord.

204
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,742
- What if we can't pass the catheter?
- It's okay. Umbilical vein looks good.

205
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,780
Prep and drape the
ankle, just in case.

206
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,112
What do you think she
weighs, about 3 kilos?

207
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,849
- Maybe a little more.
- Let's get ready with 20 per kilo.

208
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,120
Got it. Okay. In
at 5 centimeters.

209
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,059
Okay, try and draw it back.

210
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,062
- Two-cc return.
- We got a good vein.

211
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,967
- Yeah.
- All right, let's push the 60-cc bolus.

212
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,403
- That's nice work, Deb.
- Thanks.

213
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,543
3-0 silk on a needle driver.

214
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,747
Yeah, okay. Well,
thank you. Correct.

215
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,977
- How much longer?
- They're working on it.

216
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,747
I don't know if I
can wait any longer.

217
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,084
- It's so hot in here.
- Everybody just relax.

218
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,989
- This happens all the time.
- They think I have an ulcer.

219
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,753
Yeah.

220
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,524
- If you get scared, I'll hold you.
- Scared of what?

221
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,564
Plummeting to our deaths.
- What?

222
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,293
He's just kidding, ma'am.

223
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,269
You know, maybe
it would be best...

224
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,996
if you just stopped talking.

225
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:57,071
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No! No, no one's gonna be sick.

226
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,179
No one's gonna faint. We're
all just gonna relax and...

227
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,254
Good song?

228
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,858
- What?
- I love the song.

229
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,427
- You listen to Abandoned Pools?
- I do now.

230
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,030
Along with everybody else
within a six-block radius.

231
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,756
It wasn't that loud.

232
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,060
Don't come to me when
you need a hearing aid.

233
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,296
What about those old Led Zeppelin
records you're always playing?

234
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,964
Okay, they're albums, not
records. And they're vintage, not old.

235
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,270
Whatever. You still play
them way louder than this.

236
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,147
- Chicken or beef?
- Dad, I'm a vegetarian.

237
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,285
I knew that.

238
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,916
Mom thinks it's just a phase.
Hello, it's called a healthy lifestyle.

239
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,317
Maybe you should try it.

240
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,981
Exactly what happened
between the two of you?

241
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,593
I told you, she kicked me out.

242
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,255
She did.

243
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,993
I came home from my friend Stacy's
and she had thrown my clothes on the lawn.

244
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,170
- I left.
- Why'd she throw your clothes out?

245
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,135
She's crazy.

246
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,742
Seriously, I think
she needs therapy.

247
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,240
She grounded me for
being home a half-hour late.

248
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,746
I mean, come on, Dad. A
half-hour. It's summer vacation.

249
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,512
- I'll call her.
- Don't bother. She's beyond reason.

250
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,016
Does she know you're here?

251
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,521
Rachel, you've got to
let her know you're here.

252
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,424
- Why?
- Why? Because she'll be worried to death.

253
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,997
So what? CORDAY: Hello.

254
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,498
- Rachel.
- She dropped in for a visit.

255
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,865
That's a nice surprise.
How long are you in town?

256
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,337
- You here for the consult?
- Yeah, a rule-out appy.

257
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,533
That's mine. End-stage dementia.
- Mm-hm.

258
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,042
I'll be right back.
Call your mother.

259
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,543
Bye.

260
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,774
- You didn't tell me she was in town.
- I didn't know. She ran away.

261
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,715
- Why?
- To join the circus? I don't know.

262
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,117
She and Jen are having
mother-daughter issues.

263
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,951
- I'm sure you know what that's like.
- I didn't run away.

264
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,845
No, of course not. Your
mother would have...

265
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,637
- set the hounds out on you.
- Ha, ha, ha.

266
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,995
This guy's definitely not
breathing. He needs an airway.

267
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,199
Hand me this when
I say "tube." Okay?

268
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,668
- There's no air in here.
- I can't see squat.

269
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,363
All right, you.

270
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,065
- Push on his neck.
- What?

271
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,677
Give me your hand.
Like this. There you go.

272
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,571
Okay.

273
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,045
Forget it. I'm never
gonna see the cords.

274
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,886
- Oh, my God!
- Damn it. Blew the line.

275
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,589
- Bag him.
- I don't know how...

276
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,421
Just squeeze the bag
every three seconds.

277
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,530
One, two, three,
squeeze. All right?

278
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,428
One, two... Hey, hey,
hey! Help her! Help her!

279
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,660
Hey! I said, no fainting!
No fainting! Okay!

280
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,429
Run the fluids
in over two hours.

281
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,665
And give him 50 of
Librium for the shakes.

282
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,443
- Abby?
- What?

283
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,809
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah.

284
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,818
You want a blood-alcohol level?

285
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,617
Um, just a liver panel.

286
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:06,063
- Did you find your sweater?
- Yeah.

287
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,133
Good. I thought you
maybe had some trouble.

288
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,370
- Why would you think that?
- I haven't seen you.

289
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,097
- Well, we've been busy.
- Yeah.

290
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,468
Abby, I'm sorry if I
hurt you. I didn't want to.

291
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,406
You didn't hurt me.

292
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,209
I just want you to
be happy, Abby.

293
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,373
You never seemed
to be happy with me.

294
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,244
- That's all I wanted to say.
- Well, you said it.

295
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,647
Yeah.

296
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,457
So, what now?

297
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,293
You tell me.

298
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,133
Should I send a ProTime?

299
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,066
Yeah.

300
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,085
- What's your biggest angiocath?
- 14-gauge.

301
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,771
Give it to me.

302
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,675
- What are you gonna do?
- Retrograde intubation.

303
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,816
Hold that.

304
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:07,256
The wire should
come out the mouth.

305
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,824
Okay, hold on to that, sparky.
- I got the line.

306
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,900
Squeeze in a liter.

307
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,175
Hold on to that.
Don't stick anyone.

308
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,334
And tube.

309
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,643
I said, tube!

310
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,215
Doctors are human.
We make mistakes.

311
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,356
If this guy had been
properly diagnosed...

312
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,891
and sent straight to the O.R., he'd
be flipping burgers at McDonald's.

313
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,825
Marfan's is difficult to detect.
Residents had never heard...

314
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,659
- Which is why we have Attendings.
- I can't be everywhere.

315
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,562
Wrong answer!

316
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,202
The <i>Trib</i> is writing a feature
story on this screw-up...

317
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,032
and the rise in
preventable deaths.

318
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,902
So come up with a better
excuse than "doctors are human"...

319
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,943
or find yourself a good
old-fashioned scapegoat.

320
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,596
Let me out. - Hurry up.

321
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,481
We got good breath sounds.
- Very cool.

322
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,679
Who's your daddy?

323
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,850
She's pinking up.

324
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,358
She's breathing quietly without
retractions. Heart rate's normal at 140.

325
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,258
- Temperature's up to 97.
- All right.

326
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,092
Someone's got to call
Social Services and DCFS.

327
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,758
This little girl's gonna
need foster placement.

328
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,437
Dr. Carter?

329
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,403
This is Mirissa. She's the
woman who found the baby.

330
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,735
- She wanted to know how she's doing.
- Very well.

331
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,378
Good thing you found her.
Would you like to see her?

332
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,707
- This is my sister Carmine.
- Hi.

333
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,578
Doctor, can you show my
sister the mark on her chest?

334
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,778
The birthmark? Oh, yeah.

335
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,224
There you go.

336
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,400
Doctor, thank you.

337
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,506
Thank you.

338
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,738
Okay. Did I just miss something?

339
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,815
She thinks the birthmark is
the sign of the Virgin Mary.

340
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,318
It does look like
a bleeding heart.

341
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,058
Hey, John.

342
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,818
- Thanks for the help.
- Anytime.

343
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,121
No, no, really.

344
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,127
Anytime.

345
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,261
Hey.

346
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,833
Can I get you a cane?

347
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,266
I've heard that women
find helplessness charming.

348
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,668
- In puppies maybe.
- Are you still evading Luka?

349
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,172
No. Well, yeah, sort
of. It's complicated.

350
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,834
- Most breakups are.
- Here, sit down.

351
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,041
Well, not that way.

352
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:48,687
This morning, I had to go over to
his place to get one of my sweaters.

353
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,322
And I smashed his fish tank.

354
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,186
- Why?
- It was an accident.

355
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,588
Oh.

356
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,619
- Did you replace it?
- No, not yet. I haven't told him.

357
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,459
Is it too broken to fix?

358
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,295
- It was more like a crack.
- Ow!

359
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,438
- You want some lidocaine?
- No.

360
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,436
Just do it.

361
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,846
That is one big piece of glass.

362
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,784
You really should replace it.
He's gonna think you're a little...

363
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,612
- vindictive.
- It wasn't like that.

364
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,549
- I know.
- I'm getting him another one.

365
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,986
- I think that's a great idea.
- I just need help...

366
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,784
getting it into his apartment.

367
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,655
- Don't even.
- Come on. I can't lift it up by myself.

368
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,990
We get there and replace
it before he gets home.

369
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,325
You tell Luka what
happened and the two of you...

370
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,730
May I remind you I removed
a thorn from your paw?

371
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,802
John, did you discharge Ravitz?

372
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,201
- Who? All right. I'll think about it.
- I owe you.

373
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,171
Twenty-two-year-old with
chest pains, taking birth control.

374
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:47,336
- Yeah. Yeah, why?
- Well, Weaver took her from me.

375
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,573
- Oh.
- She gave her to you?

376
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,741
Maybe she thought
you were swamped.

377
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,909
Yeah, more like incompetent.

378
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,215
She made you Chief Resident.
You know, you're the chosen one.

379
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,620
Yeah, by default.

380
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,418
We met when we were kids.

381
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,756
Her family had the
cottage next to ours.

382
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,728
We used to go
water-skiing together.

383
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,562
But now she can't
feed or dress herself.

384
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,830
And she doesn't
even recognize me.

385
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,940
What will happen
if we don't operate?

386
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:19,642
Her appendix will burst, and she'll
develop a life-threatening infection.

387
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,114
- Is that a painful way to die?
- She doesn't have to die, Mr. Tanzi.

388
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,050
- It's a fixable condition.
- I'm not so sure she wants to be fixed.

389
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,052
It's a simple
surgery, Mr. Tanzi.

390
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,524
Look, I don't want her to
suffer, but I want to let her go.

391
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,858
- Can you do that?
- Sure we can.

392
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,563
Let's give her 5 milligrams of
morphine. Keep her hydrated.

393
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,969
Excuse me.

394
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,273
Mark, are you not going
to try and convince him?

395
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,775
He has power of attorney.

396
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,243
- It's his decision.
- Dad.

397
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,642
- Yes, I know, but...
- Dad?

398
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,477
- What's wrong?
- I called her.

399
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,413
- Yeah.
- She started freaking out.

400
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,145
I told you. All she ever
cares about is her stupid job!

401
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,120
- She's gonna send me to summer school.
- Call if you need me.

402
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,760
- And I swear I'm adopted!
- Rachel, what did she say?

403
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,829
She started yelling at me! She
hates me. She's such a bitch.

404
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,931
- Rachel.
- You don't know what she's like.

405
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,566
- You don't live with her.
- I did.

406
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,396
- You couldn't stand it either.
- Mark, we got a GSW coming.

407
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,096
- I'll be there.
- Prep the Trauma Room. Where's Malucci?

408
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,706
Said he was going to Radiology.

409
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,437
- What are they waiting for?
- 104's bringing them.

410
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,915
- Chief!
- You're fired.

411
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,818
- I'm on my break.
- I'm between calls.

412
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:42,826
Go home, Malucci. And
get this rig out of here.

413
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,997
What are we talking? You
want to suspend me a week?

414
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,261
- You no longer work here.
- What do you want? A formal apology?

415
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,736
- I want you to empty out your locker.
- What?

416
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:57,138
Dr. Chen, you need
to check the baby.

417
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,571
Calm down. She's
here. Want to talk to her?

418
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,009
- No!
- When do you get in?

419
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,843
- I don't want her to come.
- She's calling from the plane.

420
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,077
- I'm not going with her.
- Don't yell at me.

421
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,314
I didn't tell her to come here.
Okay, okay. Yeah, I gotta run.

422
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,489
Uh-huh. We'll figure it out
when you get here. Bye.

423
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,991
- She was freaking out, wasn't she?
- She's worried.

424
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,254
Mr. O'Groat, Mr. O'Groat.
Where are you going?

425
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,364
- To the game.
- I need to check your x-ray.

426
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,091
- I'm good to go.
- You may have separated your shoulder.

427
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,329
- It's okay. I saw the baby. Cheers.
- What baby?

428
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,370
- Are you taking her side?
- What? No.

429
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,098
Can you talk to
Weaver? She fired me.

430
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,675
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

431
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,108
I don't even want to see her!

432
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,769
- Why are you still here?
- See?

433
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,676
- What's going on?
- He's out of here.

434
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,448
- Dr. Greene.
- Just a second.

435
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,551
- You gonna talk to her?
- My wife's gone.

436
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,220
- What?
- I went to call our son.

437
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,719
When I got back, she was gone.

438
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,119
- Maybe the nurses took her.
- Her walker's gone.

439
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,988
- She couldn't have gone far.
- Last time she wandered off...

440
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,686
- she nearly got hit by a car.
- Randi, call Security.

441
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,729
His wife might be
missing. We'll find her.

442
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,992
- Dad, I want to stay with you.
- Not now!

443
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:59,127
- So you'll talk to her, then, right?
- You talk to her. She didn't fire me.

444
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,370
- You ready?
- One more patient.

445
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,703
I'll be in the car. I don't
want Luka to see us.

446
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,403
- We gonna wear ski masks?
- Thank you for calling me.

447
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,414
- Yes. CARTER: Did
you win the lottery?

448
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,042
Better. My labs came back.
My HIV test is non-reactive.

449
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,748
- Hey, congratulations. Great.
- I have to take it again in three months.

450
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,917
If you haven't converted by now,
chances are you probably won't.

451
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,922
- God, I feel like I just got my life back.
- I don't think this is working.

452
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,734
- Give it time, Yolanda.
- What's this?

453
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,769
Oh, she just had an allergic
reaction to some mead.

454
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,839
She'd probably breathe easier
if you took the corset off her.

455
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,599
Be my guest.

456
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,567
No, thank you.

457
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:41,612
Slow, deep breaths, Yolanda.

458
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,409
- You got this?
- Yeah, sure.

459
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:49,119
- What happened? She dropped her sats?
- Sinus tach. Heart rate's 180.

460
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,790
- Is she dehydrated?
- Well, definitely not dry.

461
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,119
- She's making good urine.
- Spike a fever?

462
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,353
Repeat temp is 98.4. Chuny,
I need that hemoglobin.

463
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,089
- It's coming.
- Last one was 12.2.

464
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,133
She's not anemic. You're
not anemic, are you?

465
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,794
- Did you check a tox screen?
- Mm. Negative.

466
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,441
Maybe she's worn out from
performing those miracles.

467
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,237
Second HemoCue is 8.2. - Aha.

468
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,609
- I knew she was looking pale.
- Well, that's too low to be dilutional.

469
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,148
- It might be hemolysis.
- Or GI blood loss.

470
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,978
I'll check a stool guaiac.

471
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,212
What are you doing
out of bed, dear?

472
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,879
The baby was crying.

473
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:27,549
Well, let's get you back to
your room, all right? All right.

474
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,561
Send off a retic count, haptoglobin,
Coombs, direct and indirect bilirubin.

475
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,825
I want to transfuse 2 cc per kilo
per hour over the next five hours.

476
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,263
That's a good pickup.

477
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,166
I would never have thought to
repeat the blood count so soon.

478
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,317
Tachycardia will
resolve with transfusion.

479
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:42,773
Baby's anemic, you give blood.

480
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,672
It's not exactly
one for the journals.

481
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,382
- What?
- Thanks, Carter. That was great.

482
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,019
- Where was she?
- Wandering the halls, apparently.

483
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:59,124
I was detained by Malucci, who
seems to think he's out of a job.

484
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,692
- He is.
- The baby was crying.

485
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,692
What happened? Why
is she so much better?

486
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,694
Her appendix probably burst.

487
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,198
Once the pressure's relieved,
the pain temporarily goes away.

488
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,597
- For how long?
- Within 24 hours...

489
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,671
peritonitis will take over.

490
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,038
Causes high fevers and
severe abdominal pain.

491
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,806
Thank you for taking
care of me, Lawrence.

492
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,471
You know, Malucci
is not the first doctor...

493
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,881
to get caught performing an
unauthorized physical in the hospital.

494
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,453
- She knows I've been taking care of her.
- Excuse me?

495
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,219
It's been two years
since she's said my name.

496
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,327
- Is it too late to perform the surgery?
- She's perforated.

497
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:39,795
We'd have to do an open procedure,
which will take much longer to heal.

498
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,730
I want you to operate.

499
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:46,804
Mr. Tanzi, your wife's moment
of lucidity was probably a fluke.

500
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,941
The surgeon says
it's a simple operation.

501
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,176
Why don't you stay
here with your wife...

502
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,575
and we'll have the surgeon come
down and speak with you, all right?

503
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,513
- She deserves to have everything done.
- She will.

504
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,246
What are you doing?

505
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,222
His wife's end-stage
dementia. I'm trying to help them.

506
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,886
- Well, apparently, you're not.
- You want this one too? She's yours.

507
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:15,091
Take all the patients, seeing
that you're firing all the doctors.

508
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,099
- He had it coming.
- For what?

509
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,067
Unacceptable behavior,
insubordination.

510
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:23,573
- I mean, he has no respect for anything.
- So what? Reprimand him.

511
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,267
I am tired of his attitude.

512
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,106
You can't get rid of him just
because you don't get along.

513
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,272
If that were the case,
you'd fire all of us.

514
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,008
You know what? I'm not
gonna justify my point of view!

515
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:38,513
- Where is she?
- Good to see you too, Jen.

516
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,761
- Don't break it.
- You owe me so big for this.

517
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,502
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

518
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,531
I left the keys
in the apartment.

519
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,773
That's it. Mission aborted.

520
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,205
Wait. Hold it. Wait.

521
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,779
- He sleeps with the window open.
- Wouldn't it make more sense...

522
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,313
- to leave it out front?
- So someone can steal it?

523
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,074
Who steals a fish tank?

524
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,618
- Come to think of it, who breaks one?
- I told you, it was an accident.

525
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,050
That's good.

526
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,454
Okay, that's Luka's.

527
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,525
- Can you give me a boost up there?
- No.

528
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,930
- Just bend over.
- You could at least buy me dinner first.

529
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,436
- I got a bad back.
- What are you...?

530
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,970
- What are you implying?
- What if somebody sees us?

531
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,937
All right. Just relax, Opie.

532
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,576
- Are you ready? Okay.
- Yes.

533
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,483
Wait. Okay. It's stuck.

534
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:42,413
Sorry. It's stuck. Carter!

535
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,454
She doesn't listen.
She ignores curfew.

536
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,421
She doesn't do a
thing around the house.

537
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,458
How would you know?
You're never home.

538
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:51,028
I just made partner. Excuse
me for working so hard...

539
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,858
so I can put a roof
over your head.

540
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,328
- You made partner?
- Yeah.

541
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,762
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

542
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,870
- Dad!
- Rachel, sit down.

543
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,973
Obviously, there is a lack
of communication here.

544
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,339
Sounds like to me, Rachel, you
could be a little more responsible.

545
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,605
Jen, maybe you could
spend some more time...

546
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,976
- I am responsible!
- I've given her 14 years.

547
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,880
- I am tired of being her maid.
- Tired of being a mother.

548
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,214
- Can you blame me?
- All right, time-out.

549
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,017
We'll finish this at home.
We get on a plane at 5:30.

550
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,826
Maybe I'm not going back.

551
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:24,463
Rachel, I had to cancel
my whole day to be here.

552
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,895
And now I'm gonna be
up all night doing a brief.

553
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,467
Well, I'm sorry I'm
such a pain in the ass.

554
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,738
Dr. Greene, we need you.

555
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,040
Remember when she used to
push crayons down the toilet?

556
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,306
Seriously, Mark, you've
gotta help me here.

557
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,647
Now, doctor.

558
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,244
I'll be right back.

559
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,023
Auto versus pedestrian
at moderate velocity.

560
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,424
Altered, with GCS of
2-4-4. BP is 80 palp.

561
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,656
Full trauma panel, type and
cross for four. Sign of head trauma?

562
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,095
Nothing I appreciated.

563
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,736
Witnesses say she was
lying in the crosswalk when hit.

564
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,702
- May have been struck more than once.
- Set up a central line.

565
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:11,002
- Pulse ox, 98 on 2 liters.
- Contusion, left-upper quadrant.

566
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,237
Pupils, 4 millimeters and reactive.
- Dr. Benton?

567
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,211
We got a severed umbilical cord.

568
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,101
- Where's the baby?
- There is no baby.

569
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:22,244
- She's got a retained placenta.
- Okay. I'll try to extract. Call OB.

570
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,583
She's missing a shoelace.

571
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,588
- Resuscitate?
- He's been down too long.

572
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,454
- Flush him?
- Think Luka will miss him?

573
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,836
He'll think one of
the other fish ate him.

574
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,960
They're not piranha.

575
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,690
- Fine.
- I was never any good with pets.

576
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,199
I used to like those
turtles at the Woolworth's.

577
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,964
- Don't they carry salmonella?
- I don't know.

578
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,573
Didn't live long if you
paint them with nail polish.

579
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:46,303
- Can we get out of here now?
- I have to wipe the place down for prints.

580
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,943
- Should I get it?
- No.

581
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,828
- No pneumothorax.
- You ready with the ultrasound?

582
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,994
All set. Systolic's up to
100. She's coming around.

583
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,004
- I'm Dr. Greene. What's your name?
- Anna. What happened?

584
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,973
- You were hit by a car.
- My stomach hurts.

585
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,238
Where's your baby?

586
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:25,009
- I don't have a baby. HALEH:
Crit's only 28 after 2 units.

587
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,344
Hang another 2.

588
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,829
- She needs a splenectomy.
- What?

589
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,685
- You need an operation.
- Why?

590
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,915
You have internal
bleeding from the accident.

591
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,583
- And you haven't delivered your placenta.
- No, I'm not pregnant.

592
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,024
You were.

593
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,358
- Did you leave your baby at the church?
- I don't have a baby.

594
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,257
- I'm taking her up.
- Hold on.

595
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,302
- How's she doing?
- Oh, crit's up.

596
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,705
- But she needs another 4 per kilo.
- I need to take her for a second.

597
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,176
- What? Take her where?
- Just next door.

598
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,871
She needs more packed cells.

599
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,211
Send off another CBC from
Pre-Op, and I want plasma in the O.R.

600
00:31:59,384 --> 00:31:59,947
Wait.

601
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:02,047
- Her pressure's
borderline. I gotta take her.

602
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,189
I need to put her
back on the monitors.

603
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,225
- Anna, this is your baby.
- I don't have any children.

604
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,728
You tied off her umbilical
cord with your own shoelace.

605
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,663
- No.
- We need to finish the transfusion.

606
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:20,534
You left her at the church
because you wanted her to be safe.

607
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,042
- I can't have a baby.
- But you did.

608
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,150
- Is she okay?
- She's very sick.

609
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,882
But we're helping her now.

610
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,090
I never meant to hurt her.

611
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,592
I thought God would protect her.

612
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,232
He did. Some people
think she's a miracle.

613
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,429
- What?
- They feel better when they're near her.

614
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,410
Can I touch her?

615
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,170
Yeah. Go ahead.

616
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,503
- What are you doing, ordering pizza?
- I'm calling my lawyer.

617
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,838
They haven't charged us.

618
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:32,872
We're sitting in the
back of a police car.

619
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,945
What are they
gonna arrest us for?

620
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,706
- Aquatic mischief?
- Hope you're this funny in handcuffs.

621
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,442
I am.

622
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,087
Oh, here we go.

623
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,225
- He looks pissed.
- You think he's gonna press charges?

624
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,590
- I don't know. We did kill his fish.
- We?

625
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,593
- Oh, he's really pissed.
- I'm making my phone call now.

626
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,927
All right, Bonnie and Clyde,
your friend cut you loose.

627
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,800
Stay out of trouble.

628
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,567
- Should we say something?
- You should say something.

629
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,944
Maybe tomorrow.

630
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:15,281
Rachel, your mom's
waiting out front for a taxi.

631
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,950
Thanks.

632
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,984
I know growing up can be tough.

633
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,158
You can call me anytime.

634
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,198
Yeah, until Mom takes away
my phone privileges again.

635
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,298
It'll be okay.

636
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,326
No, it won't.

637
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,799
Rachel, what do
you want me to do?

638
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,006
You could let me stay here.

639
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,580
- You can't.
- Why not?

640
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,583
- Your mom would miss you.
- Right.

641
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,814
- You'd miss your friends.
- They're only a phone call away.

642
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,255
I'll make new ones.

643
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:58,420
- What about school?
- They have schools in Chicago.

644
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,465
I just want to spend more
time with you and Ella.

645
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:07,472
I've got a baby sister
who doesn't even know me.

646
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,541
And Elizabeth is
totally smart and cool.

647
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,802
I mean, she's a
great role model.

648
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,503
- Are you serious about this?
- Yes.

649
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,049
It's a big move.

650
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,348
I miss you, Dad.

651
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,653
I'll talk to your mother.

652
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,229
Straight clamp, then 2-0 Vicryl.

653
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,345
Any chance we could speed this
up? I got tickets to the Cubs game.

654
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,409
If you're asking me to
compromise surgery...

655
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:43,064
in order for you to attend a
sporting event, the answer is no.

656
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,004
I did a pre-op
assessment on her.

657
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,544
I've had more intelligent
conversations with my neighbor's cat.

658
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,354
I need to irrigate
with 2 liters.

659
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:52,206
I've only got 500
cc's on the field.

660
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:55,513
Then get us some more.
- Coming right up.

661
00:35:55,687 --> 00:36:00,091
Maybe this is God's way
of saying her meter's out.

662
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,557
If I get to this point, I sure as
hell don't want a trip to the O.R.

663
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,492
I'll keep that in
mind, Dr. Babcock.

664
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,725
Whatever happened
to dignity in death?

665
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,499
Elizabeth?

666
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,265
Dr. Corday?

667
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,172
- Where's my saline, Shirley?
- Ready to go.

668
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,407
Right, then.

669
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,878
Did you just fall asleep?

670
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,946
No. BABCOCK: You did.

671
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,847
You fell asleep.

672
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,113
I was resting my eyes.

673
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,920
Peter, you missed a
good one. Seven gunshots.

674
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,187
Looked like a scavenger
hunt. What've you got?

675
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,093
Twenty-year-old with fractured
spleen and retained placenta.

676
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:41,790
- Call Coburn?
- She's on her way.

677
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,765
She's gonna try manual
extraction under general anesthesia.

678
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,632
Hopefully it's not an accreta.

679
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:50,366
Dr. Benton, there's a young
man out here looking for you.

680
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,645
Jackie?

681
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,781
- I'm sorry, Peter.
- What's wrong?

682
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,049
I can't do this. Not right now.

683
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,968
I'm getting ready
to go into surgery.

684
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,051
I tried. I really did.

685
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,288
Okay, listen. Why don't we just
talk about this when I get home.

686
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,956
Reece is the sweetest
little boy I know.

687
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:18,103
I love him like he was mine.

688
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,298
- But he's not mine.
- Yeah, I know.

689
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,067
And every time I see him...

690
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,567
It's just not fair.

691
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,273
Jackie?

692
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,610
- Jackie!
- Is he scrubbing in with you, Peter?

693
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,117
I just need to find somebody
to keep an eye on him.

694
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,312
- Uch. Don't look at me.
- I'm gonna go to daycare.

695
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,957
- I'll be back.
- I don't think so.

696
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,116
Go home. Get your
personal life sorted out.

697
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,523
- I'm going to perform a splenectomy.
- Not anymore.

698
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,664
She stands a better
chance if I do it. Go.

699
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,699
Spend some quality time with your
son at Chuck E. Cheese or something.

700
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,988
Hey.

701
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:25,570
- Weaver change her mind?
- No. Not yet.

702
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,740
She will. She's just mad at you.

703
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,036
She's always mad at
me. This is different.

704
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:36,173
Well, maybe it'll blow over.

705
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,080
You know, I...

706
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,243
I should have seen it.

707
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,053
I didn't focus on
the mediastinum. I...

708
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:51,026
- I didn't even look at the x-ray, Dave.
- Because I told you it was clear.

709
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:56,232
I mean, I thought I was
doing the right thing. I just...

710
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,337
I just wanted to
save the guy and...

711
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,503
You know, they say
you're not a real doctor...

712
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,769
until you've killed
a few patients.

713
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,414
What are you gonna do?

714
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,021
This is the only thing that
I've ever been any good at.

715
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,693
I'm gonna be a doctor.

716
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,360
You were never arrested or
brought home by the police...

717
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,096
- or anything when you were a
kid? CARTER: No. Were you?

718
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,537
Well, not for anything serious.

719
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,303
What, no counterfeiting?
No grand-theft auto?

720
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,911
Actually, I did get in
trouble for taking this car.

721
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,481
- You stole a car?
- Barely. It was a Gremlin.

722
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,312
And I was only
borrowing it anyway.

723
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,455
- What, no high-speed chases involved?
- Well, a short one.

724
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,819
It was an emergency. We
had to get Wham! tickets.

725
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,153
Now, that's a crime.

726
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,656
Do you want to come in
for a coffee or something?

727
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,130
- No. I gotta get up early.
- Okay.

728
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,735
Well, thanks for helping me.

729
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,168
You can find yourself
another wheelman next time.

730
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:11,241
That's too bad, because I had my
eye on this liquor store on the corner.

731
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,140
- You heard the cop. "Stay out of trouble."
- All right.

732
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,143
Got it.

733
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,681
Sorry I almost got you arrested.

734
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:28,691
You walk outside there, you
gonna find all your stuff on the street!

735
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,125
- My upstairs neighbors.
- Sound like nice people.

736
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,356
They're at it again. - Yeah.

737
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,032
Somebody should go up there.

738
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,636
I'm sure they'll settle down
in a minute, Mrs. Gottschuck.

739
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,964
Why don't you go back to bed.

740
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:47,134
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, good night.

741
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,144
You're gonna tell
Luka this was your idea.

742
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:52,375
Yes. I'm not gonna drop
a dime on you, Carter.

743
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,386
- You look beat.
- I am.

744
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:59,216
- How was Mrs. Tanzi's appendectomy?
- Uneventful.

745
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,053
- Hey, Rachel's still here.
- Yeah.

746
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,958
- I thought Jen was coming to get her.
- Things didn't go quite as planned.

747
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,962
- How's that?
- As in, how do you feel...

748
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,364
- about Rachel staying with us a while?
- For the rest of the summer?

749
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,335
Maybe. Maybe longer.

750
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,000
Could be handy having
a live-in babysitter.

751
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,201
And I'm sure she'll
help around the house.

752
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,243
She's your daughter, Mark.

753
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,904
Of course she's
welcome to live with us.

754
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:28,382
The fact that she's still here suggests
you've already told her she could.

755
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:33,582
- You were in surgery.
- So do you guys have a satellite dish?

756
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,420
No.

757
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,092
No singed nasal hairs.

758
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,393
If you lean back far enough, the
flame burns away from your face.

759
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,163
- That's the key to fire-eating.
- So, what happened today?

760
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,273
Usually, I smear my
mustache with Vaseline.

761
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,376
Today, I forgot it, so I
used hair gel instead.

762
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,903
- I guess it was flammable.
- Guess so.

763
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:59,350
Let's shave off the rest of the
mustache and débride the skin.

764
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,611
You can't shave my
mustache. It's my trademark.

765
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,620
- Dude, it's half gone.
- I'll get an extension or something.

766
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,149
- I'll give you Neosporin.
- Give this to Dr. Carter.

767
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,931
- He left.
- Give it to someone else.

768
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,790
Look, chief, I
know you're pissed.

769
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,362
But let's be real about this.

770
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,591
If you really want to ax me, you
go through the review committee...

771
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,362
and disciplinary committee.
They'd want to counsel me.

772
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,938
- The best you'll get is suspension.
- You have five letters in your file...

773
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,575
- for unprofessional behavior.
- Me and every doctor.

774
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,041
You've been counseled.
You failed two rotations.

775
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,874
There will be a meeting of the
Residency Review Committee.

776
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,574
They will offer you counseling,
but I am telling you...

777
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,310
- you will never work in this ER.
- What's your problem?

778
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,251
- You. You're my problem.
- Because I don't kiss your ass?

779
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,619
I mean, yeah, I like
to have fun sometimes.

780
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,762
I'm a damn good doctor. I had a
half a dozen great saves today.

781
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,488
- Being a doctor is more than great saves.
- Really? What?

782
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,724
I need to adopt your cheery attitude
and sparkling bedside manner?

783
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,097
Hey, this isn't about
my performance, is it?

784
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,968
- Or my rotations. You just don't like me.
- You're right. I don't like you.

785
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,668
You have no respect for me, your
coworkers, this hospital, anything.

786
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,837
You think you have this whole
cowboy approach to medicine.

787
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,074
But you don't have
the goods to back it up.

788
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,686
So you make mistakes.
Mistakes that kill people.

789
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:12,722
I need this job. You can't
fire me. I have a kid to support.

790
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:19,325
Since when? You never said
anything about being a father.

791
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,665
Did you ever ask?

792
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,468
- You don't know a damn thing about me.
- Well, I know you're fired.

793
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,001
You're a sad, cold-hearted
bitch! You know that?

794
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,336
- Somebody call Security.
- Nobody here likes you.

795
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,172
- Get out!
- Know why this stupid ER...

796
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,507
is so damn important to
you? Do you know why?

797
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:39,845
Because it's the only thing
that you've got in your life.

798
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,883
Nazi dyke.
