1
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,976
Elmira. CARTER: Mexico?

2
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:13,375
Upstate New York. Chloe stayed
in a motel there for two weeks.

3
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,244
- The cops told you?
- It showed up on Joe's credit-card bill.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,318
- Who's Joe?
- Her husband. Or ex-husband.

5
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,785
- He's driving up there.
- Can you hold that?

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,391
- Is it numb, Mr. Cannillo?
- My whole face is numb.

7
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,996
Maybe I should too. God knows what
she's doing. Suzy needs to be in school.

8
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,425
- Ow!
- Got it.

9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,896
Okay, watch that back
cast next time, Mr. Cannillo.

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,662
Chloe could lose her in a heartbeat,
and we might not be so lucky again.

11
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,102
- I need the Wooly Bugger back.
- On the tray.

12
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,537
You could have her
declared an unfit mother.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,337
- Then Joe gets Suzy.
- If he wants her.

14
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,514
I don't know. TOBY: Hey, lady!

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,114
Where in the hell's my leg?

16
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,877
- I believe it was amputated.
- Not the real one, moron. My prosthetic.

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,682
- You had one when you came in, Toby?
- Yes. She took it. Give it back.

18
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,416
- Why would I want your leg?
- You tell me, pervert.

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:59,936
Can you describe the leg?

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,290
Looks just like this
one, only it's plastic.

21
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,229
We'll see if we can get you one.
Haleh, fly fisher needs a tetanus shot.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,461
Check central supply, see if
we have extra orthopedic legs.

23
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,435
- Somebody stole Toby's leg again.
- Uh-huh.

24
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,371
- Thanks for defending me.
- The guy needs a free leg.

25
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,534
You got both of yours.

26
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,315
- Is the server down again?
- Half-hour. We're loading new software.

27
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,212
Did we get the LP
results back on Jessup?

28
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,912
- You know where the fax machine is?
- Frank, did a match letter come?

29
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,547
- Do I look like the postmaster?
- Match letters are at the dean's office.

30
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,560
I know that, genius. I forgot to
pick it up. They said they sent it here.

31
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,789
- You forgot to pick it up?
- I had a date.

32
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,934
Hey, when did this come in?
- What?

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,328
This letter. Dr. Greene.

34
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,662
Stick it in his box.
I'll mail it to his home.

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,839
- No, it's from Dr. Greene.
- To who?

36
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,441
- Everyone, I guess.
- What's it say?

37
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,169
- It says, "Dear ER gang..."
- We're a gang now?

38
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,576
- Got a secret handshake and everything.
- While you were in Phoenix.

39
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,910
- Go on, Carter.
- "Dear ER gang:

40
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,350
So here I am out on the
beach at 5:30 in the evening.

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,423
Elizabeth is sitting with me drinking
juice, but I'm all about the mai tais."

42
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,753
- What's he reading?
- Dr. Greene's letter.

43
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:10,694
"The sun is going down. Rachel
is dipping Ella's toes in the ocean...

44
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,265
as they head off on a quest
for the perfect seashell."

45
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,834
- "Wish you were here" would've done it.
- He doesn't have to rub it in.

46
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,935
"would make this moment complete?
Some jogger dropping to the sand...

47
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,136
short of breath, so I can swoop
in with a piece of bamboo...

48
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,804
- to perform a nice, clean intubation...
- What's this?

49
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,143
- Mark.
- Fix the guy up and send him off...

50
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,047
with a good simple dispo."

51
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,815
The day I start fantasizing about
critical procedures is the day I leave too.

52
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,551
"Which is my way of saying that I
miss you all and that dingy place."

53
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,524
- Want another five
of...? KOVAC: Dr. Greene.

54
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,790
"Lots of times, I thought I should
have chosen a different career...

55
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:50,199
or gone into private practice. Something
easier, less grinding, more lucrative.

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,070
But since I've been gone, I realize
outside of what I'm doing right now...

57
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,473
sitting on this beach
with my family...

58
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:02,548
staying at County all those years
doing what we do on a daily basis...

59
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,748
was the best choice I ever made.

60
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:11,148
I know what you're thinking. Trust me, it's
not hard to appreciate once it's over."

61
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,849
I think that's the
mai tais talking.

62
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,251
Shut up. Keep reading.

63
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:19,399
"As much as part of me would like to
believe the ER can't go on without me...

64
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,731
the smarter part realizes that you're an
incredible group of doctors and nurses...

65
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:28,171
who approach every day with such
skill, compassion and thoroughness.

66
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:32,711
And when it comes to patient care, I
know my absence will hardly be felt."

67
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,448
I'm not so sure of that.

68
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,881
"As for friendship and camaraderie,
well, that's another matter.

69
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,454
In order to leave, I
had to go the way I did.

70
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:48,493
But I wouldn't want any of you to think
that meant I didn't value each of you...

71
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,028
and the years that
we worked together...

72
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:55,033
or that I didn't have things of
a more personal nature to say.

73
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,798
Most of you, I think, have an
idea of what those things might be...

74
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,942
without me writing
them down. But still..."

75
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,937
Go on.

76
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,643
There's just a
couple dots and then:

77
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,618
"Ella is laughing and waving
for me. Rachel's found her shell."

78
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,219
Nothing else?

79
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,087
Probably jammed. Damn
machine's been on the fritz all week.

80
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,128
Is there a transmission report?
- So he faxes the letter...

81
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,289
so he doesn't have to
send the macadamia nuts.

82
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,168
What? What is it?

83
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,843
This is from Dr. Corday.

84
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,481
"Mark died this morning...

85
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,247
at 6:04 a.m.

86
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,294
The sun was rising...

87
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,194
his favorite time of day.

88
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,831
I sent this on so that you might
know he was thinking of you all...

89
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,799
and that...

90
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,566
he appre...

91
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,935
He appreciated knowing
you would remember him well."

92
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,962
Post it on the floor, Frank.

93
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,998
That last part?

94
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,167
The whole thing.

95
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,950
It ain't my heart.

96
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,394
Cold, that's all.

97
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,229
And I need some of
that breathing stuff.

98
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,492
BP's 100/76.

99
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,499
Sally bolus?

100
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,048
Sally?

101
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,903
Bolus normal saline,
start an insulin drip.

102
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,065
- Work him up first.
- Where's my cart?

103
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,838
- CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine.
- Wait, he's a brittle diabetic in DKA.

104
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,504
- We need to lower his sugar.
- You don't know his sugar.

105
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,948
- Get Dr. Greene. He knows what to do.
- Mr. Ervin, he's not here today.

106
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,247
- Then I'll come back later.
- No. You might have fluid in your lungs.

107
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,618
- And you have a high fever.
- Fever?

108
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,091
I'm colder than that hawk
out there on a windy day.

109
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,753
- DKA, I'm telling you.
- Send up LFTs.

110
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,458
- You want his bank statements also?
- Last time someone stole my dictionary.

111
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,967
Bet 20 he's over 400.

112
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,264
Dr. Carter?

113
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:57,300
- What?
- Twenty bucks says glucose is over 400.

114
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,270
Just plug him in.

115
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,919
Dr. Weaver?

116
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,950
Ahem, Dr. Weaver?

117
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,358
When did this get...?

118
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,463
You were at lunch.

119
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,365
And you felt the need to
post it on the bulletin board?

120
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,667
Well, he wrote it to the ER.

121
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,312
- Do you want us to take it down?
- No.

122
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,041
- Double MVA coming. Father, daughter.
- Carter and Lewis.

123
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,982
- And George cut himself again.
- In a minute.

124
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:44,024
Auto versus cement truck. 10-year-old,
unrestrained back-seat passenger...

125
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,888
- flew to the front, hit deployed air bag.
- I'm Dr. Lewis. What's your name?

126
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,155
- Melissa.
- Melissa, were you knocked out?

127
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,662
- No.
- Does it hurt?

128
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,231
- My chest.
- Dan Rue...

129
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,732
36-year-old restrained driver.

130
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,996
Throat to steering wheel, knee to
dashboard, with hip and pelvis pain.

131
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,833
- LOC?
- No. GCS, 13.

132
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,602
- Can you tell me where it hurts most?
- Right leg and my throat.

133
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:07,407
All right. Page Surgery. Tell RT to get
the heliox. Has his voice changed much?

134
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,412
- Maybe a little.
- Is my daughter here?

135
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,583
- Tachy at 108. LEWIS:
Full trauma panel.

136
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,414
Follow the light with your eyes.

137
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,885
BP? HALEH: Cycling.

138
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,856
- Melissa, did you hurt your neck at all?
- No.

139
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,721
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

140
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,023
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
We're gonna take care of you.

141
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,530
- Where's my dad?
- Another doctor's helping him.

142
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,533
Okay, I'm gonna take this
off. I need you to be really still.

143
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,034
- Okay.
- Like a statue.

144
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,934
- Yes.
- Okay, here we go.

145
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:36,199
Oh, good girl. Lateral
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

146
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,867
Pressure's 100/70.

147
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,945
- Is the fiberoptic in here?
- Back counter.

148
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,105
What's his pressure?
- Ninety-five.

149
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,910
Dad! LEWIS: Head still.

150
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,451
- Is that my dad?
- Tender at the left axilla.

151
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,019
- Might be a rib fracture.
- HemoCue times three and a Foley.

152
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,315
Pupils 5 millimeters and reactive.
- Abby.

153
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,883
- Sorry.
- Hang two units O-neg. I need a crit.

154
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,926
- Sats are falling, 92.
- Got the scope.

155
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,894
Okay, we gotta crike him.

156
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,557
Get me some cervical
traction and oral airway.

157
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,566
Sinus tach on the
monitor. No ectopy.

158
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,897
Oh, God. CARTER: What?

159
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,404
Large hematoma in
front of the trachea.

160
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,442
- You got to be kidding me.
- Can you cut through that?

161
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,074
No. I won't be able to see
anything through all that blood.

162
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,307
Pulse ox is not corresponding.

163
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,749
- I can't feel the landmarks.
- We need an airway.

164
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,086
- Damn it.
- What do you want to do?

165
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,587
Give me the scope.

166
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,991
- First HemoCue, 13.4.
- What are we talking about?

167
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,098
- Give me some cricoid pressure.
- On what?

168
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,427
- Dial up the source all the way.
- Anybody home?

169
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,435
Swollen airway. Expanding
hematoma blocking trach access.

170
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,444
- How long's he been down?
- Two minutes.

171
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,131
- Crike him.
- Too many vessels.

172
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,936
- 11 blade now.
- No. Just wait, I can't see as it is.

173
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,942
- Trousseau dilater.
- Pulse ox, 84.

174
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,274
- Bradying down.
- Wait, I'm almost underneath it.

175
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,111
- Cutting.
- No, wait. Wait! I said, wait.

176
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,083
His heart rate's 60. Most
chief residents know he'll arrest.

177
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,347
We don't have an
airway. So mg of atropine.

178
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,185
- Dropping to 50.
- Trauma shears.

179
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,455
What are you doing?

180
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,958
- Just clamp. ABBY:
BP's 80 systolic.

181
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,396
No. You're gonna
hit the internal carotid.

182
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,394
Tracheostomy.

183
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,498
- Field airway. JARVIK:
Sats are climbing.

184
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,971
Dr. Lewis? JARVIK: Next door.

185
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:19,704
Call RT for a vent. AC 12, 750 cc tidal
on a 100%. Less whining, more action...

186
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,314
- next time, Dr. Carter. LEWIS:
No deformity. No step-off.

187
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,384
- Dr. Lewis? LEWIS:
How about here?

188
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,750
- A little.
- Five-by-seven mass over the scapula.

189
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,983
- Let's have Surgery take a look at this.
- Susan, it's your sister.

190
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,184
- What?
- She's on the phone.

191
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,489
No. Chloe, you disappear with
Suzy after almost killing yourself.

192
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,692
You don't call for three
weeks. Yeah, well, I hope so.

193
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,500
Are you in an
outpatient program?

194
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,503
Where's Suzy gonna stay?

195
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,665
He took you back?

196
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,833
Oh, damn it.

197
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,513
No. No, not you, Chloe.

198
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,412
You know what? Fine. Fine, fine,
fine. Just give me the number, okay?

199
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,678
Yeah, Chloe, listen.

200
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,946
Yeah, I have to go.

201
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,249
Chloe, I have to go.

202
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,019
Yes, I love you too.

203
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,098
CT's ready. Urine is
dip negative for blood.

204
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,533
Forget the Foley.
Page Pedes, Oncology.

205
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,706
Calcified mass
in the lung field.

206
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,671
She has cancer?

207
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,596
- Keep your ankle cocked.
- You promised...

208
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,803
not to use the knife.

209
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,943
A.J. called in sick.
I tried to be careful.

210
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,583
Don't touch it.

211
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,210
- That was too long.
- It's fine.

212
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,879
- It's too long. It will itch.
- Okay, I'm done.

213
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,726
- Who's picking you up?
- I took the train.

214
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,159
- I'll get you a cab voucher. Keep it dry.
- Plastic bag like before.

215
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,231
Come back in 10 days.

216
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:51,897
I did this last time. I saw on
TV, those cutters where you put...

217
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:56,236
the bun in a covered white thing
and press down on the handle...

218
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,902
and it slices without
using the knife.

219
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,742
I asked Lance to
get one of those.

220
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:08,419
But he said those guys are
crooks and it would break right away.

221
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,657
- What are you doing?
- This one's too long.

222
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,123
Stop it. Stop it. George.

223
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,128
I told you not to touch
it. Damn it, George.

224
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,198
- I'm sorry.
- I don't care if you're sorry.

225
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,927
I don't care if you're stupid. If
you don't listen, it'll never heal.

226
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,094
Kerry, I'll do it.

227
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,500
You should go home.

228
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,670
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
George. I'm sorry.

229
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,623
- Casper's Foley bag is full.
- I know.

230
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,822
I don't know why I bought hoops.

231
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,392
- They were cute.
- Yeah.

232
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,560
The 3-year-old in
4 thought so too.

233
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,277
Did you think it was
gonna happen so soon?

234
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,403
He stopped treatment.

235
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:12,376
Yeah, I know. But still, I
mean, he was just here working.

236
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:16,011
I keep expecting to see him
walk around a corner or something.

237
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,918
He was 38 years old.

238
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,720
Too soon by any calculation.

239
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,291
Yeah.

240
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,332
Hey, when are you off?

241
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:30,095
Now. Just don't
feel like going home.

242
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,738
What do you say we
go out and get plastered?

243
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,771
- I'd say that's an appropriate response.
- Susan, I have to go.

244
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,174
Bohan is an IUP, 12
weeks and spotting.

245
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,847
Ultrasound's otherwise negative.

246
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,948
Okay. Carter's on for
another couple hours.

247
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,676
I'm waiting on a parent to
transfer a girl to Oncology.

248
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,445
Okay.

249
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,185
I'm sorry about Mark.

250
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,959
Yeah.

251
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,957
Hey, Kerry.

252
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,530
Hey, Kerry, we're going out
for drinks. You want to come?

253
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,137
- Thanks. I'd like to, but I can't.
- Yeah, sure you can.

254
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,806
- The Lava Lounge on Damen.
- I have other plans.

255
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,408
- But thanks anyway.
- Okay.

256
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,476
- Good night.
- Bye.

257
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,747
- The Lava Lounge?
- Yeah, you kind of have to see it.

258
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,781
Dr. Romano needs you.

259
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,816
Tell him I'm icing my ear.

260
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,319
He's putting a chest
tube in your patient.

261
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,047
- What?
- He came down for a consult.

262
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,486
I canceled that consult.

263
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,150
28 French on a vascular
clamp. Hang in there, Melissa.

264
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,489
- What are you doing?
- Where's her CT?

265
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,263
Oncology has it. - Oncology?

266
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,563
Incidental finding. Likely
Rhabdomyosarcoma.

267
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,498
- Did she have a hemopneumo?
- No.

268
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,929
- She does now.
- What is it?

269
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,768
We're gonna put a tube in
your chest to help you breathe.

270
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,672
I'm in. Thoraseal. Probably
outgrew its blood supply...

271
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,075
bled into her chest cavity.
Come on. My dog fetches faster.

272
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,682
- Is my mom here yet?
- Yeah, she's on her way.

273
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,614
Call the O.R. Tell them we
have a red blanket. Get consent.

274
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,346
Her father's in the SICU.
You criked him, remember?

275
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,753
Melissa, you need an operation.
- What?

276
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,291
We're gonna take care of you.

277
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,362
200 cc's already.
Second signature. Let's go.

278
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,122
Don't worry.

279
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:14,540
- We'll blow it off, go some other night.
- No. You changed your shift.

280
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,871
Kerry, the guy died. You
should be with your staff tonight.

281
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,446
- They were being polite.
- They're your friends.

282
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,277
They're people I work with.

283
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:28,982
One of our guys goes down, the
company gets together and we get drunk.

284
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,023
It's more for the unit
than the guy who's gone.

285
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,490
I'm not a firefighter.

286
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,324
Basically the same job,
isn't it? You put out fires.

287
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,570
Mark and I always butted heads.

288
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,436
I was always trying
to maneuver him...

289
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,507
gain some kind of edge
like it had to be a competition.

290
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,843
He just wanted to do
his job well and go home.

291
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:04,718
I've known this was coming for
a while, and I never imagined...

292
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,587
that I would feel like this.

293
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,819
You've lost a friend.

294
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,962
I think I have.

295
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:21,273
All I got out of him was, they put him on
dialysis for three days once. He hated it.

296
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,375
Then he passed out.

297
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,213
- As in vagalled?
- As in old.

298
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,446
- Find his old chart?
- Still pulling it. I need a forklift.

299
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,281
His temp's down, but he's
altered. He called me "son" once.

300
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,616
Glucose is over 400.
You owe me 20 bucks.

301
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,090
Started that insulin drip.
And he could be uremic.

302
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,592
You know, your basic "MMP."

303
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,193
- MMP?
- Multiple medical problems.

304
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,762
You just make this stuff up?

305
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,426
What? Multiple medical
problems? M-M-P, MMP.

306
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,265
All right, start with a urogram
and do a repeat Chem-20.

307
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,238
- I did it twice already.
- Just CT his belly and his pelvis...

308
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,140
- and call Nephrology.
- They won't take him. He's septic.

309
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,373
Well, then we'll dialyze down
here until we can admit to the unit.

310
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,382
Or we could turf him to
Medicine and let them figure it out.

311
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,247
Right now he belongs to us.

312
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,152
I'm gonna write this down now. Sure
you're not gonna change your mind again?

313
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,452
- Pratt, your letter.
- Where was it?

314
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,652
Filed N for "ne'er-do-well."

315
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,525
- What's your first choice?
- I ain't saying.

316
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,926
See you at the Lava
Lounge, Dr. Carter?

317
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,127
- What?
- Couple people going out for drinks.

318
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,295
- Don't feel like doing much else.
- Who?

319
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,806
Dr. Kovac, Dr. Lewis,
Abby, Haleh.

320
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,111
Maybe. I don't know. I got
some dictations I need to finish.

321
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,839
Okay. If you change your mind...

322
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,607
Good night.

323
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,982
Bad news?

324
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,420
- Yeah, you could say that.
- Second choice?

325
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,182
Last choice.

326
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,453
Someone's got to get their
last choice. Where is it?

327
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,029
- Here.
- Oh.

328
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,631
Good for us.

329
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,427
You know, I better be
getting my damn locker.

330
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,872
Well, that was fast.

331
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,046
- What?
- You haven't even had a drink yet...

332
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,445
- you already got somebody's number?
- Oh, my God. What is that?

333
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,586
- Two Sacrificial Virgins.
- How much alcohol is in there?

334
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,119
Enough to make you forget
you're being thrown into a volcano.

335
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,621
I get it.

336
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,225
- I think.
- Do you need some help?

337
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,385
Yeah. Can I start a tab?

338
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,824
Sure, Susan.

339
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,833
Oh, my God. Those
are our drinks?

340
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,026
- Too tacky?
- No, not for this place.

341
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,364
- I'm just bummed I forgot my grass skirt.
- Yeah.

342
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,632
I was gonna wear my
coconut bra, but it itches.

343
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,971
- How did you know about this place?
- Mark had a birthday here once.

344
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,544
It seemed appropriate.

345
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,975
Thanks. ABBY: Haleh.

346
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,410
Martini.

347
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,744
- Coke.
- Yeah. How did they find all this stuff?

348
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,979
It's kind of creepy. I keep
expecting Vincent Price to show up.

349
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,622
So should we toast or something?

350
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,925
Good idea.

351
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,562
Me?

352
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,163
You knew him the longest.

353
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,700
I'm not very good under
pressure. Someone else go first.

354
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,846
What the hell,
I'll drink to that.

355
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,688
Looks like we're going public.

356
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,192
Hey, Kerry.

357
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,193
Hey.

358
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,962
Well-encapsulated discreet mass.

359
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,566
No extension to
the visceral pleura.

360
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,397
Pickups.

361
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,304
Did you talk to Dr. Corday?

362
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,532
Yeah, Shirley, I'm
at the top of her list.

363
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,767
Right after the funeral home.

364
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,469
Aah! SHIRLEY: What?

365
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,773
Penetrated the rib cage. We
are gonna be here all night.

366
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,975
At least you caught it.

367
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:01,049
Amazing how the human body...

368
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,387
can turn on itself.

369
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,829
The very process we need to grow
in the womb to regenerate ourselves...

370
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,436
systematically eating us alive.

371
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,072
And no one's sacred.

372
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,835
Little girls. Fathers
with little girls.

373
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:22,608
Cancer. Brain cancer,
liver cancer, breast cancer.

374
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:27,345
It's the same traitor,
the same merciless...

375
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,121
unrelenting predator.

376
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,225
Like time itself.

377
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:38,092
I hope you're not driving. - No.

378
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,028
You're not on call, are you?

379
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,134
What are you, some
sort of Nazi bartender?

380
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,999
I prefer to think of
myself as magnanimous.

381
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,038
Hey. LEWIS: Hey, Carter.

382
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,301
- We thought you were gonna blow us off.
- Did you pick this place?

383
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,304
- She's outside.
- Who?

384
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,514
John Carter makes an appearance.

385
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,558
Abigail Lockhart sits alone.

386
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,959
- It's a nice jacket. Is it new?
- What, do you have ESP?

387
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,626
No, your car's right there.

388
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,872
I saw you circle
the building twice.

389
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,270
Thanks for yelling
out directions.

390
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:27,178
Didn't wanna encourage you. I don't
think you should be hanging around in bars.

391
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,076
You got me there.

392
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,544
Great letter, though.

393
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,191
I especially enjoyed
the surprise ending.

394
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,421
I didn't write it.

395
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:49,797
Well, that's the last time
we let you read out loud then.

396
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,504
Suddenly antisocial?

397
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,399
No, you just missed
my table dance.

398
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,441
- Hula?
- Oh, yeah.

399
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,706
Well, I'll have to stick
around for the second show.

400
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,554
How many lives do you think?

401
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,115
What?

402
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,726
How many lives do
you think he saved?

403
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,463
It's hard to say.

404
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:27,133
One a shift on average, I guess.
Five shifts a week for 10 years.

405
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,709
- Two or three thousand people.
- Damn.

406
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,444
Forget Superman,
I'll take Mark Greene.

407
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,418
Well, if I knew you felt that way, I would
have shaved my head a long time ago.

408
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,900
Are you okay?

409
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,185
Come on.

410
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,687
- Come on what?
- Let's get out of here.

411
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,986
- And ditch our friends?
- I think that they'll get over it.

412
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,159
Okay.

413
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:30,261
- You know, I have a tiki mask in there.
- I'll buy you another one.

414
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,271
Where are we going?

415
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,532
I know a place on Franklin.

416
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,539
- The titty bar?
- No.

417
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,200
Well...

418
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,276
- Oh, the tattoo parlor.
- No.

419
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,642
No. Where are we going?

420
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:43,942
Bill's place.

421
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,717
No.

422
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,047
- No, thank you.
- Come on. There's a meeting at 1.

423
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,952
- Great. Go. I'll catch up.
- When's the last time you went?

424
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,353
What's it gonna hurt?

425
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,393
- It'll kill my buzz for starters.
- Come on, one step at a time.

426
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,964
I sponsored you. Remember? Save
the dogma. Besides, you screwed it up.

427
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:03,125
- I'm screwing it up?
- Yes. Would you say that I'm drunk?

428
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,567
- Yeah.
- You can't go to meetings drunk.

429
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,173
- They'll overlook it.
- And the program is voluntary.

430
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,242
- Then get in the car voluntarily.
- Come on, out of my way.

431
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,674
You are going, even
if I have to carry you.

432
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,247
- Thanks for caring, but not tonight.
- Yeah, tonight.

433
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,508
- No. Slow down, tough guy.
- Get in the car.

434
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,982
- No.
- Get in the car.

435
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,814
- No, no.
- Hey.

436
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,388
- Hey, no. John! Stop.
- You're going.

437
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,583
Stop it. Help! Help!

438
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,663
- Aah! Son of a bitch! You bit me?
- You dropped me.

439
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,390
- I can't believe you bit me.
- I told you to put me down.

440
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,330
- I think that might be bleeding.
- Good.

441
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,903
Everything okay out here?
- Yeah.

442
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,612
I'm sorry. I just... I can't...

443
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,911
I can't go to a meeting
tonight. I won't do it.

444
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,188
Let's go get something to eat.

445
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,121
Come on. A cup of coffee.

446
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,291
Thank you.

447
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:17,766
We gotta stop at a pharmacy. I'll
get some gauze and bandage that.

448
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,417
A crate?

449
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,419
- Four feet by two feet.
- Greene gets a crate of live lobsters...

450
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,081
- for a pericardiocentesis?
- Every Memorial Day.

451
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,592
I gave a Heimlich to a kid at the
zoo once, didn't even get a thank-you.

452
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,788
I've been working
up to a fruit basket.

453
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,798
Wait. Is this the surf and
turf we had on the roof?

454
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,595
Yeah.

455
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,904
That was good.

456
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,840
- We can't tell him.
- Tell him what?

457
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,806
That he's dead.

458
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,642
We have to keep it coming.

459
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,475
That's a survivor talking.

460
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,810
We're starting breakfast.
You want anything?

461
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,317
- Yeah. Two mimosas, please.
- Excuse me?

462
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,479
No, we're fine.

463
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,494
It started on my birthday.

464
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,460
What?

465
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:20,537
I didn't start drinking when Brian
hit me. I started drinking before that.

466
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,910
And I probably wouldn't have been stupid
enough to open the door if I hadn't been.

467
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,005
Self-pity excuse.

468
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,843
Well, it's one of
my better ones.

469
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,180
What time is it?

470
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,187
Oh, God. It's almost 6:00. Oh,
my God. I have to work tonight.

471
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,018
- You sober?
- Unfortunately.

472
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,162
Good. Then I have got just enough
time to drop you off at a meeting.

473
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,700
No. I have to go to bed.

474
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,038
- Let's go.
- Nope.

475
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,032
But if you quit bugging
me, I promise I'll go later.

476
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,643
When?

477
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,176
Before my shift.

478
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,248
Good, you're here. I was gonna page
you, but Jerry said you were on at 7.

479
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,519
- You're on at 7?
- Yeah. I've done it before.

480
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,416
- What is it?
- It's your homeless guy.

481
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:12,490
- Six-beat run of ectopy.
- How long has that been going on?

482
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,718
Almost an hour. I
needed to start lido...

483
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,330
but I couldn't get a directive in
his chart, and he won't tell me.

484
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,760
She don't listen.

485
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,901
70 milligrams IV load and then
start a drip at two per minute.

486
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,988
- Wait. So he's full code?
- There he goes again.

487
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,449
I don't know. He was Greene's
private patient or something.

488
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,068
- Yeah, we lost his pressure.
- Mr. Ervin?

489
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,178
- No pulse.
- Okay, starting CPR.

490
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,075
- You sure?
- No.

491
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,342
- Slow PEA.
- Mg of epi. Prep an amp of atropine.

492
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,043
Well, guess that clears
it up. Intubation tray.

493
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,281
I'll do it. 7.5 ET
and a 3 Mac blade.

494
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,290
V-fib. CARTER: Okay,
charge paddles to 200.

495
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,754
No pressure, no pulse.

496
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,128
And clear.

497
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,791
All right, charge again to 300.

498
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,761
Back to sinus.

499
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,428
I've got a pulse.

500
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:04,737
Tough old bird. Okay, 20
of etomidate, eight of Pav.

501
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,946
Wait, wait, wait. Carter,
I think he's trying to talk.

502
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,713
Dr. Greene.

503
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:13,281
- No.
- What?

504
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,717
No tubes.

505
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,685
No shocks.

506
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,958
What did he say?

507
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,961
He said no more.

508
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,642
- Thanks for destroying my night.
- Did you get it?

509
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:47,081
She bled like stink. Control was
nearly impossible around the rib cage.

510
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,483
I was inside and outside
the chest simultaneously.

511
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,318
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

512
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:55,484
Resected fully.
Margins are clear.

513
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,823
- How's Daddy?
- Breathing over the vent.

514
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,830
Reflexes fully intact. Should
be extubated by this afternoon.

515
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,163
It was lucky they got
plowed by that cement truck.

516
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,899
These suckers rate 50%
mortality once they break out.

517
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,176
I'll tell Mom. You should get
some sleep. You look like crap.

518
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,836
Dr. Romano, are
you sure you got it?

519
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,081
I got it.

520
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,453
The only thing he's been consistent
about is not wanting any treatment.

521
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:29,322
If he discussed this with Dr. Greene,
then there should be a note in the charts.

522
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,795
- Maybe Dr. Greene expected to be here.
- Fine. He's your patient.

523
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,299
I have no idea what
you're saying. I'm sorry.

524
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,529
- Should someone save him?
- No.

525
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,140
I don't understand.

526
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,535
- What's the problem, Pratt?
- I don't speak Portuguese.

527
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,545
- That's Italian.
- That either.

528
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,309
Grandma was babysitting,
and he woke up with this rash.

529
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:58,218
She can't tell me if he's got any
allergies, and I can't find the parents.

530
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,755
Strawberry.

531
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,724
- What?
- Strawberry. Jelly, jam, maybe cereal.

532
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,728
Probably eating it
before he went to sleep.

533
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,057
Hey, you know anybody
at Northwestern?

534
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,533
- Yeah, I know a few.
- Could you do me a favor?

535
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,229
Tell them they made a mistake,
that they should take me.

536
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:17,171
- No. I'd have to believe that.
- Come on, you know I'm good.

537
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,039
- Too good to be wasted at County?
- I didn't say that.

538
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,011
Look, we're an under-serviced
community, and we need doctors.

539
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,116
For better or for
worse, we drew you.

540
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,411
Blood sugar over
400. Good pick-up.

541
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,918
Yeah, thanks.

542
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:39,224
I shouldn't have sat down.
If I don't sit down, I won't cry.

543
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,801
- Well, you have to sit down eventually.
- Yeah.

544
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:48,407
Can't I just pretend he moved to the
South Pacific and lived happily ever after?

545
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,066
In a way, he did.

546
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,613
A girl and her father...

547
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,918
are hit by a cement truck
on the way to ballet class.

548
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,279
A malignant tumor invades her
chest, and we find it by happenstance.

549
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,625
She'll walk out of here in a
week with not a care in the world.

550
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,826
Mark walked the halls of a hospital every
day and didn't know about his tumor...

551
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,298
till he presented with symptoms.

552
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,466
Well, we save who we can, right?

553
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:24,409
It has to make more
sense than that.

554
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,470
You're looking for a reason?

555
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,618
I miss him already.

556
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,814
- Me too.
- I went away for five years.

557
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,154
I thought of him on occasion.

558
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,496
Talked to him sporadically.

559
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,962
But I miss him. I thought
he'd always, always be here.

560
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,433
Well, it's good to miss him.

561
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,240
It's missing him
that keeps him here.

562
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,810
Yeah.

563
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,374
Hey.

564
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,445
You should write for Hallmark.

565
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,523
I have hidden talents.

566
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,184
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. It's okay.

567
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,125
I have to get back to work.

568
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,357
I have a pilonidal cyst
in 5 waiting to be lanced.

569
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,900
Give it to Pratt. He
needs the humility.

570
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,163
That will be cathartic.

571
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,878
- Where did you get that?
- What?

572
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,416
- Combination.
- Personnel.

573
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,281
Pratt matched at County.

574
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,420
Yes, I know.

575
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,887
He keeps bitching about it.

576
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,924
He needs a locker.

577
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,256
Thought I'd spare
Elizabeth the chore.

578
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,797
Heard you had some trouble
with Romano yesterday.

579
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:58,832
He was right.

580
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,971
- I took too long making a decision.
- You don't have that luxury anymore.

581
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,473
I never really thought I did.

582
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,811
Mark's gone.

583
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,952
That means you've been here
longer than any other doctor.

584
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,681
People will look to you
to step in and fill the void.

585
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,849
Big void.

586
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,359
Yes, it is.

587
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,295
I can't do this.
Will you do this?

588
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,036
Thank you.

589
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:01,056
Shotgun to the face.
This is gonna be fun, huh?

590
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,591
Cheaper than plastic surgery.

591
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,761
How's the bite?

592
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,260
I'm not howling at the moon.

593
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,160
There is no moon.

594
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,573
- How did it go?
- What?

595
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,504
The meeting.

596
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,009
It was boring.

597
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,008
You went?

598
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,078
Yeah. I just said it
was boring, didn't I?

599
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,019
Sorry, they didn't
give me a card.

600
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:37,122
You went for you or because
you promised me you would?

601
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,789
Is this guy gonna
look like hamburger?

602
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,698
More like ground chuck.

603
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,435
I went for you.

604
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,511
- You're gonna need some more people.
- Why?

605
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,823
Come on, hard restraints!

606
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,357
- No IV?
- 20 of morphine before he pulled out.

607
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,019
- Sir, we need you to hold still.
- Come on, Gallant, keep him on the table.

608
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:15,690
- 100 of fent, two of Ativan.
- Page Surgery, Plastics, Head and Neck.

609
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,166
- Could be PCP.
- Or the gunshot wound.

610
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,805
Sir, we're gonna help you.
But you gotta hold still...

611
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:25,307
- while we get the morphine into you.
- Okay, pressure 100/80. Pulse, 150.

612
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,173
Get access. We
need to sedate him.

613
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,585
- Get a 7.5 ET tube.
- You won't be able to use it.

614
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,912
- Break open lap pads and a crike tray.
- Gallant, hold down his arm.

615
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,019
Seven sterile... - Gallant.

616
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,520
And an 11 blade. Drape his neck.
- All right, fent's in.

617
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,558
Get some O-2 in him. 100% by mask.
- I'm pushing meds.

618
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,195
- Gallant. Gallant.
- Okay, okay, okay.

619
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,728
He's settling down. Betadine.

620
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,696
- 20 of etomidate.
- Wait, are we tubing him or criking him?

621
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,029
- Criking. Look at his face.
- Just taking a peek.

622
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,900
- All right, bradying down.
- Yeah, he aspirated too much blood.

623
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,565
- Open the crash cart.
- Gallant, unroof his jaw...

624
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,507
and hold it out of the way.
I need to see the epiglottis.

625
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,771
Mg of atropine.

626
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,347
Susan, hook your
finger under his tongue.

627
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:06,541
I can't do it.

628
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,062
Don't move. Abduct the mandible.

629
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,686
- I need to sit down.
- Don't move.

630
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,346
V-tach. CARTER: All
right, I'm in. Let go, Gallant.

631
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,356
- Charge is 200.
- Hyperventilating.

632
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,960
Sats are 90. LEWIS: Clear.

633
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,027
- Sinus rhythm.
- Okay, full trauma panel.

634
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:21,963
C-spine, chest and pelvis. Gallant,
why don't you go get yourself some air?

635
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,430
Want a facial CT?

636
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:27,737
Yeah, good idea. Why don't we get a full
head series? Call RT. Let's get a vent.

637
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,039
Give him four of
Ativan, seven of Pav.

638
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,301
Nice work, John.

639
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,597
Bet that was a new one.

640
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,137
Yeah. Yeah.

641
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,942
Look, I'm sorry.

642
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,979
I just thought I
was gonna be sick.

643
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,452
It's better if you
keep your head down.

644
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:20,152
It'll be okay. It just caught
me by surprise, you know?

645
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,317
Relax. Take a minute.

646
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,995
You know, sometimes I
don't think I can do this.

647
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,242
You know, there's
two kinds of doctors.

648
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,171
There's the kind that
get rid of their feelings...

649
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,784
and the kind that
hold on to them.

650
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:54,622
If you're gonna hold on to your feelings,
you're gonna get sick once in a while.

651
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,024
It's part of it.

652
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,296
You know, people come in here...

653
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,567
and they're sick...

654
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,208
and they're bleeding...

655
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,576
sometimes they're dying...

656
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,279
and they need our help.

657
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:23,014
And helping them is more
important than how we feel.

658
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:40,400
Hell, I've been doing this
eight years. I still get sick.

659
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,406
Take another minute.

660
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,953
- Did he go up?
- OMFS, ENT and Plastics all in.

661
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,923
Both carotids and IJ's intact. He must
have turned right when the blast hit him.

662
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,562
- Good.
- How's he doing?

663
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:08,689
Oh, he'll be all
right. How are you?

664
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,259
Ask me tomorrow.

665
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,598
- Good night.
- Good night.

666
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,121
He might need some fluids soon.

667
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,557
No. Morphine boluses of 10.

668
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,000
I heard you were gone.

669
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,577
No, I'm still here.

670
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,079
Good.

671
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,477
You know I don't like
nobody else helping me.

672
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,289
I know.

673
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:15,589
You've always
treated me like a man.

674
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,270
Just try and relax.

675
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,107
What is that?

676
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:28,143
That monitor's just a
little sensitive, that's all.

677
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,911
I'm scared.

678
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,180
There's no reason to be.

679
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,516
Everything's okay.

680
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:51,732
I could have been
a better person.

681
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,674
I could have done more.

682
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,348
You did enough.

683
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,577
Stay with me.

684
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,880
It won't be much longer.

685
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:21,661
I'll stay right here.

686
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,884
- Let me see.
- I think I singed my eyebrow.

687
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:50,688
I need to see. You thought it was a good
idea to put kerosene in your barbecue?

688
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:53,422
- I thought it was lighter fluid.
- It doesn't look burnt.

689
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:56,090
I'll check for corneal burns
with an ultraviolet light.

690
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,259
I need everything
documented. Worker's comp.

691
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,769
- You're a chef?
- It was my summer office party.

692
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,566
Oh, I don't think that counts.

693
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,466
Any word on the
air conditioning?

694
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,890
Yeah. They think
it'll be fixed by winter.

695
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:09,205
I can't work like this.

696
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,713
- You want a Big Stick?
- No.

697
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:14,250
- Why did I buy these shoes?
- Because they were cute.

698
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,080
- Some help here.
- Yeah, what is it?

699
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:19,281
Car rammed into a picnic at Lincoln
Park. I got three rigs behind me.

700
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,948
- John?
- Yeah, I got it.

701
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,821
Intubated, regular
pulse, good sats.

702
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,053
Get Neurosurgery.
Warn CT they'll get busy.

703
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,822
12-year-old boy,
dislocated shoulder...

704
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,591
multiple lacerations.
BP, 100/60. Pulse, 120.

705
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,827
Hey, I'm Dr. Carter.
What's your name?

706
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,904
What's that? Okay, we're
gonna take care of you.

707
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,064
Set me up...
