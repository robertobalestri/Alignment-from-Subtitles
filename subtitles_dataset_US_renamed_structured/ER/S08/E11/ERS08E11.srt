1
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,166
You were supposed to wake me up!

2
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,869
I'm not your damn mother, Brian!

3
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,285
Why is it so cold in here?

4
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,659
I called the super twice!
What have you done?

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,676
I'm studying so I can get a job
that pays enough for us to move out!

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,880
You don't realize how you talk
to me sometimes! It's disgusting!

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,389
You don't know when to
stop! You just keep pushing!

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,620
I have a life too! It's not
waiting on you hand and foot!

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,458
- Know what your problem is?
- We should work as a team.

10
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:35,797
We don't because you don't treat
me as an equal. You treat me like crap!

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,901
How do you think it makes me
feel? You're constantly belittling me...

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,168
Give me at least five minutes in the
morning before you act like a bitch.

13
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,141
- Shut up!
- Both of you shut up.

14
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,146
You know what your problem
is, Brian? You don't need me!

15
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,181
You don't even like me.
- Keep it up!

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,578
I just cook and clean,
pick up your dirty laundry.

17
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,985
But guess what,
that's not why I'm here.

18
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,167
<i>Hi, this is Abby.
Leave a message.</i>

19
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:02,060
<i>Hello, Abby? Abby, are
you there? Hello? Abby?</i>

20
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,357
<i>I thought I'd catch
you before your shift.</i>

21
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,558
<i>Anyway, I wanted to
wish you a happy birthday.</i>

22
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,492
Hi, Mom.

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,696
No, I was just getting up.

24
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,534
Thank you.

25
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,710
- Ooh.
- Ooh!

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,184
Your feet are like ice.

27
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,379
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,459
- I put on some coffee.
- What time is it?

29
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,596
- It's about 7:30.
- Mm-hm.

30
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,630
- You sleep okay?
- Yeah. You?

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,735
Mm-hm. Except for the snoring.

32
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,631
- I don't snore.
- Aw. Yeah, right. Like a truck driver.

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,736
I don't snore.

34
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,876
Stop it.

35
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,815
Oh, no.

36
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,014
Oh, yeah? Oh, wait a minute.

37
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,055
I've arranged for a nurse's
aide for you while I'm at work.

38
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,218
- A nurse?
- Just for a couple weeks.

39
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,160
I've got half a dozen people
in this house every day.

40
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,926
Well, then one
more isn't gonna hurt.

41
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:18,402
If it gets any colder I'm going
to winter in the Bahamas, alone.

42
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,734
I thought I heard someone.

43
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,570
Is it just me or is
it freezing in here?

44
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,076
Mom, what are you doing here?

45
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,147
I assumed you could use a hand
while your grandmother recovered.

46
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,341
How are you feeling, Millicent?

47
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,451
I've been better.

48
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,783
- Where's Jack?
- Kansas City, I think.

49
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,051
- You don't know?
- He's on an extended business trip.

50
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,485
We missed the pleasure of
your company at Christmas.

51
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,326
- You know how the holidays can be.
- Where are you staying?

52
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,434
- I was hoping to stay here.
- In the house?

53
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,968
- Yes, if that's all right.
- Yeah.

54
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:54,438
It is freezing in here. Would
somebody please turn up the furnace?

55
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,304
I will go get Alger on it.

56
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,274
- It won't start.
- Did you flood it?

57
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,937
- No. It won't turn over.
- You leave your lights on?

58
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,309
- No.
- You probably did.

59
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,848
- No, I didn't. Hi.
- Hi.

60
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,181
- Do you have any jumper cables?
- No, sorry. I take the El.

61
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,188
I guess you're not the only
one today. Give me the keys.

62
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,488
My husband's not
really a morning person.

63
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,221
Hi, I'm Joyce. We moved here
a few weeks ago from Virginia.

64
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,059
- Hi. Abby.
- We're in 205.

65
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,292
I know. I think you
guys are right beside me.

66
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,803
Nice meeting you.

67
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,667
- So I guess we're neighbors.
- Just a wall between us.

68
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,174
Well, maybe you could come over
for coffee or something sometime.

69
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,834
Sure.

70
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,537
Hey, can we give
you a ride somewhere?

71
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,617
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure? It's really cold out there.

72
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,187
I told you, you flooded it.

73
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,553
Welcome to Chicago.

74
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,064
Oh.

75
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,062
Oh, son of a bitch.

76
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,656
You're leaving?

77
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,385
I phoned the Pediatric
Cancer Society to inform them...

78
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,498
she wasn't coming to their luncheon,
and they managed to corral me.

79
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,898
You don't really have to do that. She
wasn't going. She just does it for effect.

80
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,537
I'm aware of her behavior.

81
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,398
But they actually
were expecting her.

82
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,806
- You'll be back tonight?
- You're really staying?

83
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,807
Yes. Unless I'm not welcome.

84
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,513
No, no. It's just I thought
you were covering.

85
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,448
Dad's in Denver, actually.

86
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,357
- Your father told you.
- Well, it was pretty obvious.

87
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,461
He was here for two days
at Christmas without you.

88
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,091
You thought he was still here.

89
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,891
We left it a little open-ended.

90
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,859
Really?

91
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,061
I'm sorry, John.

92
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,798
I should have phoned you and
let you know that I was coming.

93
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,442
Yeah, well...

94
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,475
It's good to see you.

95
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,045
Sanitation guys found
him in a dumpster.

96
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,952
Minimally responsive to deep
pain, thready pulse in the 50s.

97
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,319
- You sure he's not dead?
- He's still moving air.

98
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,462
Barely. Abby, can
you bring this guy in?

99
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,396
- I haven't even clocked in yet.
- I know, but you have a coat on.

100
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,735
Hey, I know this guy.

101
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,165
Oh, man.

102
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,737
Is this great or
what? Empty chairs.

103
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,930
Empty racks.

104
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,633
Nothing like subarctic temperatures
to keep the freaks at home.

105
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,974
- Except it's freezing in here.
- Maintenance is checking the furnace.

106
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,843
This is what we get for
punching holes in the ozone layer.

107
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,076
Isn't the greenhouse
effect make it warmer?

108
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,653
Greenhouse effect, my
ass. It's 40 below out there.

109
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,017
- What's this?
- This is Icicle Andy. You want him?

110
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,750
- He's yours.
- I thought he froze to death last year.

111
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,760
- The Ice Man cometh back.
- Okay, Trauma 1's open.

112
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:40,526
Get his core temp, pump in some warm
saline. Throw a heating blanket on him.

113
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,828
I'd keep that on if I were you.

114
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,534
He's bradying down.

115
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,469
No luck. Now it's A-fib.

116
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,803
Sounds like
rhonchi on the right.

117
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,946
- Probably pneumonia.
- I think he's decreased on the left.

118
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,207
Do you want to put in a chest tube?
- No.

119
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,010
He's got bad vascular
disease. We'll never get a line in.

120
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,777
Fine. Prep for lavage.

121
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,047
Oh, man. Look at this
dude's hands. Ugh.

122
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,190
- Can you get a pulse ox?
- I don't know.

123
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,864
I can barely get the monitor...

124
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,219
Ugh!

125
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,190
What's wrong?

126
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,925
- Snapped off.
- He gave you the finger, huh, Abby?

127
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,967
- Can they re-attach that?
- Not without superglue.

128
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,973
Let's get a central-line kit, Betadine
and some warm blankets to start.

129
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,077
No, you can't come
in. You have to go back.

130
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,906
- Where's my mom?
- She's not in here.

131
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,207
- Yes, she was.
- You got this?

132
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,146
Yeah. Warm liter of IV saline.

133
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,216
- You lost your mom?
- A second line.

134
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,584
- Not one of these two ladies right here?
- She was in there.

135
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,249
Okay. Well, maybe she's all finished.
Do you want to see if we can find her?

136
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,156
- I'm Abby. What's your name?
- Douglas.

137
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,729
- Douglas what?
- Douglas Leeman.

138
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,422
Okay, Douglas. Right this way.

139
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,430
- What's your mom's name?
- Bee.

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,593
Bee? Is that short for Beatrice?

141
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,205
- Barbara? Betty?
- Just Bee.

142
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,672
- Just Bee. Okay.
- Abby, can you help me?

143
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,710
Sure. Frank, this is Douglas
Leeman. He's lost his mom.

144
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,178
This is Frank. He's very
good at finding people's moms.

145
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,215
Douglas, you like doughnuts?

146
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,683
- When did the chest pains start?
- This morning.

147
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,879
But I've been feeling crappy...

148
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,421
for a couple of days.

149
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,583
I thought it was just a
cold or maybe the flu.

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,060
Bi-basilar rales. Have you
experienced any shortness of breath?

151
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,893
Yeah. I thought
I'd step outside...

152
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,366
catch a breath of fresh
air. I got so dizzy I fainted.

153
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,528
Three-plus pitting
edema on both feet.

154
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,704
- Have you had anything like this before?
- Never.

155
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,605
- Do you have a heart condition?
- No.

156
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:35,545
- Are you on birth-control pills?
- No. I'm trying to get pregnant.

157
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,241
I've been taking
fertility drugs.

158
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,614
- FSH.
- For how long?

159
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,024
- Um, what's today?
- Well, the 10th.

160
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,054
Yeah. Then I'm on my tenth.

161
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:52,928
All right. Let's get a CBC,
Chem-20, a DIC panel, and a D-dimer.

162
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,469
Am I having some sort
of reaction to the drugs?

163
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,902
It's possible, but we need to run
some more tests to know for sure.

164
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,669
You've got fluid in your lungs,
which could be a sign of a blood clot.

165
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:04,902
A blood clot?

166
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,071
It's unlikely, but I just
want to make sure.

167
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,776
It could be a possible side
effect of the medication.

168
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,978
Let's do a
Doppler. I'll be back.

169
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,824
- You want me to call your husband?
- I'm not married.

170
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,291
Oh. Boyfriend?

171
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:25,325
I decided to have
a baby on my own.

172
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,764
Got tired of waiting
around for Mr. Right.

173
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,128
I know that story.

174
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,440
- Chest x-ray and EKG?
- Yeah. And set her up for a V/Q.

175
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,104
- I haven't seen you around lately.
- I've been working nights.

176
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,479
- How was your Christmas?
- Quiet. What did you do for New Year's?

177
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,280
I worked.

178
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,854
That's always fun.

179
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,048
Did you make any resolutions?

180
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:54,285
- I'm gonna help out more.
- Help out more where? Here?

181
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,724
No. Europe.

182
00:09:55,895 --> 00:10:00,333
I've volunteered to go to Bosnia for
two months with Doctors Without Borders.

183
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,799
- Bosnia?
- Yeah. I speak the language.

184
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,997
- What brought this on?
- I don't know. Change of scenery.

185
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,200
Good, huh?

186
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,874
Hey, nice hat, Snoop.

187
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,141
Hey, Frank, you gonna
get the heat turned up?

188
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,716
- They're working on it.
- Really?

189
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,319
Is that why the thermostat
in the lounge says 56?

190
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,082
Get used to it. We're
heading into another ice age...

191
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:27,159
- like the one that killed the dinosaurs.
- Cold didn't kill them, cholesterol did.

192
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:31,162
Mr. Ellison in Curtain 3 can go home.
Miss Renfew in 4 needs to be admitted.

193
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,823
- Got a minute?
- Uh... No, not really.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,094
I hope your day's shaping
up better than mine.

195
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:40,832
Doubt it. I picked up Rachel's laundry
after you left. This fell out of her jeans.

196
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,841
- She's smoking.
- I doubt she uses it to light campfires.

197
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,343
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

198
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,210
- Find anything else in her pockets?
- No.

199
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,583
What if it's not cigarettes?

200
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,947
Her boyfriend tested
positive for marijuana.

201
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,588
Ex-boyfriend.

202
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,621
- I'll search her room.
- Is that wise?

203
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,350
Well, if she's doing drugs,
I want to know about it.

204
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,894
Asking her doesn't guarantee
I'm gonna get the truth.

205
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,089
But searching her room, that's
such a violation of her privacy.

206
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,064
You suggested I go
through her pockets.

207
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,274
In the course of doing laundry.
- Dr. Greene?

208
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,428
29-year-old male,
8-foot fall, no LOC.

209
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,445
- Can we talk about this?
- Come find me.

210
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,802
Normal vitals.

211
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,703
Ha-ha-ha. This is
adorable. Don't you think?

212
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,076
It's pretty cute.
You wanna buy it?

213
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,310
No. They won't let
me send him any gifts.

214
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,949
He must be getting
pretty big now, huh?

215
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:33,890
Yeah. Oh, they sent a video of
him walking, just before Christmas.

216
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,460
Won't be long now before he's
asking to borrow the keys to the car.

217
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,595
You know, I'm starting to wonder if
I'm making any right decisions lately.

218
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,798
It's mid-year. Something
will open by spring.

219
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,239
Well, maybe they'll
open back up at County.

220
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,106
Hey, cool.

221
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,506
Have you seen these?
These are really neat.

222
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,413
John, um, what would you say...

223
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,750
if I told you I asked the
waitress at Doc Magoo's...

224
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,584
if she remembered
Weaver being paged...

225
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,488
the night we lost
the Marfan case?

226
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,597
I'd say that place is full
of people with pagers.

227
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,494
I know. I was desperate.

228
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,326
So, what? She didn't remember?

229
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,738
Not about Weaver getting paged.

230
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,374
But she remembers Weaver
coming back, looking for her pager...

231
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,307
and finding it in the bathroom.

232
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,277
She couldn't answer my page, John,
because she didn't have her pager.

233
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,985
- Are you sure?
- I believe it.

234
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,550
Don't you?

235
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,282
Yeah, that explains it.

236
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,295
What are you gonna do?

237
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,633
- He died?
- Yep. Did you know him?

238
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,862
Only as Icicle Andy.

239
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,700
I think he was a Vietnam vet.

240
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,468
I heard bums are reincarnated
as pigeons when they die.

241
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,077
Really?

242
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,506
I think it's the
other way around.

243
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,313
Check it out.

244
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,510
Tickets to tonight's Blackhawks
game. And they're good seats too.

245
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,554
Whoa. Where did he get those?

246
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,313
- Any ID?
- Mm-mm.

247
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:15,053
Just two dollars, some
change and matches.

248
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,094
- Are you gonna keep the tickets?
- No.

249
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,526
- Can I have them?
- No.

250
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,190
- Why not?
- I think it's called grave robbing.

251
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,163
He ain't using them.

252
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,895
Somebody might
come to claim the body.

253
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,386
- I'm serious.
- Yeah, right. Seriously, I need them.

254
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,669
- No.
- Look, the tickets are only for tonight.

255
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,778
- Nobody's coming for this guy.
- Forget it.

256
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,675
Oh, come on, Abby.

257
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,611
Abby, look. He's
straight-up dead.

258
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,347
- Can you take a look at something?
- What patient?

259
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,011
Mr. Paninski. Unstable angina.

260
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,748
I called CCU. I wanna make
sure I didn't miss anything.

261
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,187
- Did you do a rectal?
- No.

262
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,622
- You better.
- Because...?

263
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:52,197
- Because if his stool is heme positive...
- The heparin. Right. Thank you.

264
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,192
- Frank.
- Yeah?

265
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,735
- You said you'll find his mother.
- I tried.

266
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,430
No Bee Leeman checked in today.

267
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,735
I'm beginning to think
somebody dumped him.

268
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,878
He said his mother was in Trauma 1.
Can you double-check it with the admit log?

269
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,312
Sure. MAN: Abby.

270
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,883
- Hi.
- Richard.

271
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,646
- How's it going?
- What are you doing here?

272
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,889
I think it's colder in
here than it is outside.

273
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,250
You look great.

274
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,995
Thank you. Shift
work becomes me.

275
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,229
- So how are things?
- They're good.

276
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,336
Good. That's good.

277
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,062
You seeing anyone or...?

278
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,069
Oh, yeah. I'm breaking
hearts all over town.

279
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,479
What do you want, ex?

280
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,911
- Ex?
- Yeah. Can I call you "ex"?

281
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:50,079
Because it's almost like sexy, so people
might think it's short for "ecstasy"...

282
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,488
or "triple X," which
stands for porn, uh, now.

283
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,128
Except for in cartoons
where it stands for poison...

284
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,025
which I always
thought was funny, but...

285
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,463
What do you want?

286
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,936
Oh. Look, I...

287
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,498
Well, I wanted to
talk to you in person...

288
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,200
so you didn't hear this
through the grapevine.

289
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,640
Oh, my God.

290
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,038
- What?
- Are you going to jail?

291
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,113
No.

292
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,151
Uh, I'm getting married.

293
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,389
- Married?
- Yeah.

294
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,495
You'd think I would've
learned my lesson.

295
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,290
I'm glad one of us did.

296
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,292
- What, is she rich?
- Hardly. She's a teacher.

297
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:41,865
- Not that one you had at the museum?
- No. No. No.

298
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,534
Her name is Corrine. She's really
great. She's really down-to-earth.

299
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,146
- I think you might even like her.
- How old is she?

300
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,010
She's 34.

301
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:54,883
She has a 6-year-old
son, Adam. Really great kid.

302
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,957
You're gonna be a father?

303
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,759
Stepfather, yeah. It's kind
of hard to believe, huh?

304
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,329
Yeah. Instant family.

305
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,023
I always wanted kids. So...

306
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,998
Since when?

307
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,000
Uh... You know, just a while.

308
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,005
I guess we just never
talked about it, you know?

309
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:25,346
And you felt that today was the
day you had to tell me about all this?

310
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,487
Is today a bad day?

311
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,549
Nope.

312
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,756
Um...

313
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,693
So, what? Am I supposed
to give you my blessing?

314
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,135
- That's up to you.
- Well, I have to get back to work.

315
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,641
Richard.

316
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,618
I hope that it
works out this time.

317
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,750
Thanks.

318
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,857
Aspen's great. There's
three separate mountains.

319
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,932
- So you don't have to be an expert.
- Mm-hm.

320
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,937
What is that?

321
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,698
What?

322
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,839
Oh. Yeah, they got
runs for every level.

323
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,178
Is that your jaw?

324
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,349
- What?
- That click-click-click sound.

325
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,418
- Oh, my God. You can hear that?
- Yeah.

326
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,522
I can't help it. I think I have
this TMJ happening thing.

327
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,214
Here. Chew.

328
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,186
- No.
- Come on. Chew so I can hear.

329
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,884
No.

330
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,258
Get out of here.

331
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,263
- I'm going back to work.
- I'll take care of this.

332
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,631
You should see a dentist.

333
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:55,035
Either that or you should find
someone else to eat lunch with.

334
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,579
- I'm sorry about that.
- What?

335
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,277
I should have said something
sooner. It just sort of snuck up on me.

336
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,420
I hate it when that happens.

337
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,225
It's really more about
friendship than anything else.

338
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,621
Really?

339
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,559
Never seen you
kiss Frank like that.

340
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,064
- Abby...
- Don't sweat it, Carter.

341
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,779
- Where's Frank?
- Don't know.

342
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,812
Hey, Douglas.

343
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,113
Did you find your mom?

344
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,081
- Are you getting hungry?
- Yeah.

345
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,487
Would you like to eat pizza?

346
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,820
A hamburger?

347
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,964
My mom says fast
food isn't good for you.

348
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:56,031
Well, she's right, but the fast
food we serve here at the hospital...

349
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,969
is specially formulated to be nutritious.
So would you like some French fries?

350
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,937
Okay. Sit tight.

351
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,974
Hey, Frank.

352
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,614
- I'm working on it.
- Work harder. He's been here for hours.

353
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,978
If I find his mom, can I have the
tickets you pinched off that stiff?

354
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,550
- No.
- Anybody seen Dr. Kovac?

355
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,983
- What do you need?
- Mrs. Sites' pressure's down.

356
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,679
Frank, find Luka. What happened?

357
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:20,486
She got dizzy. Systolic's at
80. I opened up the saline.

358
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,940
How are you doing? - PE?

359
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,288
I don't know. Crank her oxygen up
to 15 liters and grab some dopamine...

360
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,458
off the crash cart. She's got
muffled heart sounds and JVD.

361
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,195
Malik. We need a pericardiocentesis
tray and a SonoSite.

362
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,703
- Okay.
- Pressure's down to 70.

363
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,843
- You think it's tamponade?
- Unless you got any better ideas.

364
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,033
What happened?

365
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,906
Hypotensive, signs
of pericardial effusion.

366
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,173
He thought she had a
clot from hyper-stimulation.

367
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,341
You can third-space
anywhere, even around the heart.

368
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,017
- There it is.
- Here you go, Abby.

369
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,214
- Okay, glove up. You can assist.
- Lidocaine's ready.

370
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,657
I think I found that kid's mom if she
doesn't have the same last name as him.

371
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,821
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Okay, hook up the alligator clip.

372
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,594
Belinda Mathison. Came last night
with a headache, it was a brain bleed.

373
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,600
- 45-degree angle.
- Last night?

374
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,239
- They put her in Neurosurg.
- Watch for injury current.

375
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,739
- That boy sat in Chairs all night.
- There it is.

376
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,037
Can you take him
upstairs to his mother?

377
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,510
That could be
difficult. She's dead.

378
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,882
What?

379
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,247
- Blood pressure's back up to 90.
- She stroked out a few hours ago.

380
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,217
- Second syringe.
- What should I do?

381
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,381
- Abby?
- Um... Well, just try to find his dad.

382
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,221
- Systolic's one-ten.
- And get him some French fries.

383
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,192
Okay. Good pickup.

384
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,067
- Did you reach the father?
- He said he lives in Los Angeles.

385
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,228
- He doesn't know the number.
- Wasn't in here?

386
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,397
- I couldn't find it.
- You call the school?

387
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,406
- No.
- I'm sure they have a number, Frank.

388
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,408
- I thought you used to be a cop.
- I was.

389
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,605
Well, act like a cop.
Track the guy down.

390
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:52,744
- Someone from Neurosurg talk to him?
- Not yet.

391
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,614
Which ER doc treated his mother?

392
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,222
Weaver. She has a half-shift
today. She's not in yet.

393
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:02,259
- Should I page someone from Neurosurg?
- They should tell him his mother died.

394
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,722
No, she didn't.

395
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,666
Douglas, I need to talk to you
about your mom's headache, okay?

396
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,571
Let's sit down.

397
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,308
All right.

398
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,281
It was pretty bad.

399
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,452
It was caused by a blood
vessel in her brain that ruptured.

400
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,656
It broke. And the
doctors tried really hard...

401
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,294
but they couldn't fix it.

402
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,657
Can she go home now?

403
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:44,135
No, Douglas. I'm
sorry. She died.

404
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,035
My mom has a
headache. She's not sick.

405
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,175
- I want to see her. Where is she?
- Douglas.

406
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,311
- Mom! Mom!
- Douglas.

407
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,171
Mom! Mom, where are you?

408
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,984
- Douglas.
- Mom! Mom!

409
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,349
- Mom! Mom!
- Douglas, she's dead.

410
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,615
Stop saying that! Why
do you keep saying that?

411
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,624
- I want my mom. I just want my mom!
- I know you do.

412
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,290
Shh. Shh. Shh.

413
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,363
It's okay.

414
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,465
He finally went down?
- He's exhausted.

415
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,036
Poor kid.

416
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,674
I finally got ahold of his dad.

417
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,834
- He's in Australia on a business trip.
- Australia?

418
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,980
The soonest flight he can
get is a red-eye tomorrow night.

419
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,343
So Social Services have
to take him until then.

420
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,384
- Sorry. I'll call them.
- That's all right, I'll do it. Thanks.

421
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:37,011
- Can you grab me the minute he gets up?
- Sure.

422
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,715
Abby, do we do psychiatric
transfers to other hospitals?

423
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,827
- What?
- I have a patient in Curtain 3.

424
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,691
He was admitted with a tiny
scalp lac from a slip and fall.

425
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,426
He wants to be moved out of Curtain
3 and wants to call his caseworker...

426
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,399
- from some private hospital.
- Is he altered from the fall?

427
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,199
No, but he seems
pretty agitated.

428
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,672
Did you get a Psych consult?

429
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,175
- Not yet.
- Probably wouldn't hurt.

430
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,050
The paramedics brought
me to this hospital.

431
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,014
I didn't want to come here.

432
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:11,385
Can you just please call my caseworker
and move me to another room?

433
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:20,597
Please stop. That's
not necessary.

434
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,702
- You don't have to do that.
- It's just a precaution.

435
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,304
- What happened?
- I slipped, that's all.

436
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,872
- This your patient?
- Yeah.

437
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,306
I saw him in the hall. LOC after
he slipped. History of migraines.

438
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:33,639
- It's not his only history.
- Why the restraints?

439
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,543
I don't wanna cause trouble.
Please, call my caseworker.

440
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,310
We will. Dr. Lewis.

441
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,819
- Can you get me out of this room?
- Don't worry, we'll move you.

442
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,321
- What kind of caseworker?
- Psychiatric.

443
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,926
He's monitoring my
conditional release.

444
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,994
- He has the card.
- Release from where?

445
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,131
Dr. Lewis. Now.

446
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,495
Okay. Two of IV Ativan, five of
Compazine and a trauma panel.

447
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,667
Someone call my wife.

448
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,271
He's schizophrenic.

449
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,567
- He's been here before?
- He stabbed Carter...

450
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,972
- killed a med student two years ago.
- Him?

451
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,578
- Yeah.
- He stabbed Carter?

452
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,111
- Yes.
- What's he doing out?

453
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,149
I don't know. The police are coming.
We should transfer him before Carter sees.

454
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,514
- No, I need his CT.
- Let him get it at Mercy.

455
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:17,521
- He has a head injury.
- He stabbed two people in that room.

456
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,023
- Loss of consciousness...
- And killed one of them.

457
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,924
I won't move him and risk an intracranial
bleed. I don't care what he did.

458
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,962
Am I calling this
psychiatrist or not?

459
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,690
No. I'll call him.

460
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,096
We'll find out his
status, we'll get the CT.

461
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,897
Then we'll take it
from there. Okay?

462
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,033
Abby, the morgue called.
They're ready for you.

463
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,699
Move him to the suture
room. Don't let Dr. Carter see.

464
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,903
- I got it.
- And get his name off the board.

465
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,195
She looks like Snow White.

466
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,707
Mom.

467
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,437
Mom?

468
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,951
I drew you a picture.

469
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,386
You took him to the morgue?

470
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,115
- He didn't believe she died.
- Well, then you call Psych.

471
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,022
Advice you might have
given yourself 18 hours ago.

472
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,562
Hey, hey. She vagalled in Triage.
No one told me she had a kid with her.

473
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,462
- Well, she did.
- Did you call Social Services?

474
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,194
- Not yet.
- Why not? Abby, why not?

475
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,703
Because we're trying to
find another family member.

476
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,864
- Who's we?
- Uh-uh. Me.

477
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,065
It's not your job.

478
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,938
Don't want him in
another strange place.

479
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,946
Their holding facility is a lot more
comforting than the ER or the morgue.

480
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,813
They have the personnel and
resources to deal with it. Call them now.

481
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:30,148
"You're honest, forthright and a
judge... A good judge of character.

482
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,656
You often ramble incoherently when
agitated. Your dog doesn't like you."

483
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,318
- My dog died a year ago.
- It's a joke, Frank.

484
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,997
- This amuses you?
- Carter, what's your sign?

485
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,429
- Gemini, why?
- Horoscopes from the Internet.

486
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,160
"You're open to new ideas,
compassionate, a risk-taker."

487
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,395
True.

488
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,233
"You overstay your
welcome at parties...

489
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,246
- and you often smell like cheese."
- Don't you have some work to do?

490
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,649
- Abby, your turn.
- No, thanks.

491
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,183
- What's your sign?
- "Out of order."

492
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,337
Who moved Libertique
from the suture room?

493
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,177
The hand surgeon is stuck in surgery
for the next 40 minutes. We needed...

494
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,150
- a room for an extensor tendon repair.
- I'll do that.

495
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,347
No, no, no. The
surgical intern's got it.

496
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,652
Can you take a look at this
explosive watery diarrhea?

497
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,296
- You need to start an IV?
- Maybe. I don't know.

498
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,864
He's pretty miserable.

499
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,466
She.

500
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,932
- She.
- You okay?

501
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,661
Yeah.

502
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,543
Abby, the light source on the
fiber optic's down. Get me a spare?

503
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,271
- Okay. MAN: Can I
see a doctor this century?

504
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,541
- Hang on.
- I hang on any longer, I'll be dead.

505
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,446
If you're talking,
you're not dying.

506
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,712
He was not guilty
by reason of insanity.

507
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:38,016
- Shouldn't he be in a forensic hospital?
- He was. He was.

508
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,126
He was moved to a less restrictive
facility about 10 months ago.

509
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,956
And now he's on
conditional release.

510
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,893
- Bradying down to 60.
- Mg of atropine. I need that scope.

511
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,830
- I've got it.
- Pulse ox, 78.

512
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,403
I need a smaller tube.
Number seven. Suction.

513
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,044
- He's agitated.
- He's nervous.

514
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,972
He's been out of care for less
than a week, hits his head...

515
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,544
- and they bring him here of all places.
- He get out in two years?

516
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,736
Who are you?

517
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,474
I was there when he
attacked my friends.

518
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:07,484
I'm sorry. He was a law student. A
professor there got some colleagues...

519
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:11,488
to do some pro bono work. They
filed a writ of habeas corpus and won.

520
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,183
- That's unbelievable. HAZELTON:
But I can't say I disagree.

521
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,091
- Most schizophrenics are non-violent.
- Well, this one was, wasn't he?

522
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,893
When they are, they rarely are twice.
He's no danger to himself or others.

523
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,399
- Really?
- Not on his meds.

524
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,937
Safeguards are in place. He needs
to be supervised taking his medication.

525
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,734
- Did he get his head CT?
- They're almost ready for him.

526
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,173
Abby, can you check
this Foley? It's overflowing.

527
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,779
- Clamp it.
- I did. It's overflowing.

528
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,781
- Just get him out of here.
- I want those restraints removed.

529
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,782
- Uh, no.
- He is coherent and lucid.

530
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,750
- I worked with him for over a year.
- No.

531
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,718
- Abby.
- Susan, I swear to God...

532
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,620
- Abby, I got it.
- Keep somebody posted outside his door.

533
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,694
- But he needs reassurance and respect.
- Respect?

534
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,023
- Yes!
- I'm sorry. He needs our respect?

535
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,460
Abby, go.

536
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,472
Looks like over a
liter in the last hour.

537
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,733
BP's 110/70, and
her sats are up.

538
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,071
Good. You need to send
out a repeat potassium.

539
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,907
Right. Thanks.

540
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,447
He said something about the ICU.

541
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,916
Yeah. Maybe for a couple
of days, just for safety.

542
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,555
It's the fertility drugs,
isn't it, that's doing this?

543
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:19,988
The doctor has to
review your labs.

544
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,591
I could try to find
him now if you like.

545
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,757
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

546
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,497
It must be the damn
hormones. I'm not usually a crier.

547
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,435
It's okay.

548
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,506
Sometimes being a
woman sucks, you know?

549
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,848
It has its moments.

550
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,509
You grow up praying you don't get
pregnant every time you have sex.

551
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,848
And then when you finally do
want to have a baby, you can't.

552
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,514
It's so unfair.

553
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,856
Have you been
trying for a long time?

554
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,527
I just keep thinking that maybe
I had my chance and I blew it.

555
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,963
- You don't know that.
- No. I've been pregnant.

556
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,605
A few years ago.
It was an accident.

557
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:11,540
I had just started a new
job and this new relationship.

558
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,541
It didn't seem
like the right time.

559
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,146
- It happens.
- I only waited until I was ready...

560
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,377
so that I could be the
best mother I could be.

561
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,546
I'm sure you're going to be.

562
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,321
Unless I waited too long.

563
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,400
- Weaver's looking for you.
- What?

564
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,545
She wants to know why you didn't
call Family Services on the boy.

565
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,181
I am. I will. Fine.

566
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,588
I'm gonna check in with my office, get
some release paperwork. I'll be back.

567
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,598
The on-call social
worker for the ER, please.

568
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,827
- Someone claim them?
- What?

569
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,432
- The tickets.
- Oh, no.

570
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,371
Lewis was asking. Give her one.

571
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:22,207
- Mwah! Thank you.
- No, just have him paged. Thanks.

572
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:26,610
When you have time, I need a thick
and thin smear and culture in Curtain 3.

573
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,014
- Yeah.
- Your diarrhea patient was heme negative.

574
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,452
Just PO challenged. I sent
him home with Imodium.

575
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,822
I have a 5-year-old with abdominal pain,
and I'm worried about intussusception.

576
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,364
- Is there any blood in the stool?
- No.

577
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,590
But he had a palpable mass.
- There he is.

578
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,235
- Hey, sweetheart.
- There's Daddy.

579
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,797
Hey. Hi.

580
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:48,440
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Carter.

581
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:53,238
Daddy slipped, and he fell.
And he hit his head, but I'm okay.

582
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,903
They put you in restraints.

583
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,244
It's just a precaution.
They're a little paranoid.

584
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,422
Oh, it's you.

585
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,656
I'm sorry.

586
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:13,164
- What happened? What's he doing here?
- He slipped outside his office building.

587
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,365
- His office building?
- He's on conditional release.

588
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,463
- You're out?
- I'm better.

589
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,268
I'm sorry.

590
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,571
That wasn't me who did
that to you, to your friend.

591
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,509
You know that, right?

592
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,076
You're a doctor. You
know it's a disease.

593
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,677
I'm being treated.

594
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,511
I'm okay now.

595
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,526
Great.

596
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,890
I'm glad you're okay.

597
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:24,593
I think I'm starting to get it. Although,
that little puck is hard to keep track of.

598
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,568
They should give it a color
so your eye can follow it.

599
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,968
- What, the puck?
- Yes.

600
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,134
I mean, like bright pink or red
or flashing lights or something.

601
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,143
Okay, a flashing, pink puck.

602
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,474
Well, why not?

603
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,117
- It will be a great game.
- It's hockey. Come on.

604
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,879
- I love hockey.
- You got the tickets?

605
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:46,151
- Hey. Hey, what's wrong?
- Uh, nothing.

606
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,656
- I hugged him.
- You what?

607
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,760
Oh, yeah. I'm the
Bruce Lee of love, girl.

608
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,994
Maybe I just need
some fresh air.

609
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,568
Hold... Wait a
minute. You're not out.

610
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,233
- Huh? Who are you hiding from?
- I'm not.

611
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,808
Wait a minute. Then what was that?
You don't want your friends to see us?

612
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:09,141
- They're not friends. They work for me.
- How do you think that makes me feel?

613
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:12,284
- I'm sorry.
- You came on to me. You are not out.

614
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,079
I am not out at work.

615
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,949
- Well, you need to be.
- Sandy...

616
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,149
I'm sorry. I don't
got time for this.

617
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,755
- Okay. DAD: <i>I'll
come from the airport.</i>

618
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,797
Okay.

619
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,493
Bye, Dad. He'll
be here tomorrow.

620
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,262
Great.

621
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,965
- Have you ever been to Los Angeles?
- Once. Disneyland.

622
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,804
Oh. I think
you'll like it there.

623
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:42,607
Because it's sunny. It's
not cold like it is here.

624
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,114
Excuse me?

625
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:52,954
- Can you give this to Dr. Carter?
- I think you better do that.

626
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,626
Oh, they're discharging
Paul. I have to drive him home.

627
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,700
They wouldn't have released
him if he weren't better.

628
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,164
He's taking his
meds. He's in therapy.

629
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,836
He has a disease, but it's being
treated. I mean, that's what you do here.

630
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,569
You treat disease so people
can try to move on with life.

631
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,737
Yeah.

632
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,575
He's my husband.

633
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,650
We're his family.

634
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,317
I can't give up on him.

635
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,855
Good luck.

636
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,534
Hey.

637
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:49,039
Um, Lewis discharged Sobriki, and
his wife asked me to give you this.

638
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:53,108
I guess you couldn't protect
me from her either, huh?

639
00:35:56,688 --> 00:36:00,125
- Yeah. I'm sorry about that. I just...
- Don't worry about it. Forget it.

640
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:04,522
- Are you off already?
- Half-shift.

641
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,966
I'm off in a half-hour
if you want to go eat.

642
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,034
I should get home.

643
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:14,868
Or maybe just coffee and pie?

644
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,105
I had a pretty
crappy day myself.

645
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,707
Gam is out of the convalescent
hospital. I should go home...

646
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,317
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

647
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,452
Thank you for asking.

648
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,913
Anytime.

649
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,084
- No!
- I have a nice place for you to stay...

650
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:37,923
- till he gets here.
- I wanna stay!

651
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,428
- But you can't.
- Abby!

652
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,623
- I want to stay here.
- I know.

653
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,168
But this is a hospital, and you have
to go someplace where you can sleep.

654
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,306
- No.
- And get something to eat, take a bath.

655
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,772
- I'll stay with you.
- Douglas, I don't...

656
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,673
- No!
- I don't stay here all the time, honey.

657
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:57,009
But you can come visit me
whenever you want, okay? I promise.

658
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,117
- No. Abby.
- I got you.

659
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,343
Come on. We'll get you some
ice cream when we get there.

660
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,649
- You'll be fine, Douglas.
- Wait! I'll stay with you!

661
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:09,761
Abby, please! Abby!

662
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,038
Abby, my cellulitis patient
is allergic to penicillin.

663
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,833
- No.
- Can you give IV erythromycin?

664
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,269
- No.
- Vancomycin?

665
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,842
No. I am not your
Attending. I'm not a Resident.

666
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,879
I'm a nurse. You want me to assess
a patient, you want me to push meds...

667
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:34,109
you want me to check vitals, explain
the situation to a family member, fine.

668
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,618
What I will not do is carry
you through med school.

669
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:39,781
You want to be a doctor,
start acting like one.

670
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,391
Rachel, can I talk to you?

671
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,000
- What are you doing?
- Just picking your stuff up.

672
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,110
- You're searching my room.
- It's a pigsty.

673
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,145
That doesn't give you the
right to go through my things.

674
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,346
You mean these things?

675
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,284
- I can't believe you did this.
- Are you smoking now?

676
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,943
I asked you a question. Rachel!

677
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,090
- Are these your cigarettes?
- I bought that a month ago on a dare.

678
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,021
- Dare?
- To see if I could pass for 18.

679
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,560
- And the condoms?
- I got them in health class.

680
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,027
- And you kept them?
- You'd rather I not have them?

681
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,360
- You need to stop lying.
- You don't believe me.

682
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,265
- You search my room and private things.
- I was looking for drugs.

683
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,399
You said you were picking
up. Who's lying now?

684
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,100
You're right. The truth is I
was searching your room.

685
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,869
I don't know if I can trust you.

686
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,808
Then fine. Believe whatever you
want. I'm smoking. I'm on drugs.

687
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:14,612
And I'm having sex. Lots of
sex with lots of guys because...

688
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,618
I'm the school slut. You happy?

689
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,431
This is John Carter. I have a
private-duty nurse for my grandmother...

690
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,165
who was supposed to start today.

691
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,809
She's not here.

692
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,342
Yeah.

693
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,775
I sent her home early.

694
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,778
- What?
- She was aggravating Millicent...

695
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,816
so I sent her home early.
She'll be back at 6 a.m.

696
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,681
It's a 24-hour service.

697
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,949
I'll get up if
there's a problem.

698
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,124
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

699
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,622
I mean, you show up
unannounced, uninvited.

700
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,300
- Uninvited?
- Then you make health-care decisions?

701
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,665
Your grandma asked me to ask
her to leave. I was trying to be helpful.

702
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:09,535
Well, do me a favor. Don't try to be
helpful. It's not one of your strong suits.

703
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,300
Excuse me, John.

704
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,809
I've had enough abuse
from my mother-in-law today.

705
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:17,312
- I don't need any more from my son.
- I'm sorry?

706
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:19,644
I'm sorry, but I have
helped Gamma through this.

707
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,379
I have tended to her medical needs.
I've made her health-care arrangements.

708
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,718
So you need to consult with me
before you do anything like this.

709
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,486
- Fine. Call them back.
- Yeah. You bet I will.

710
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,901
But I'm not leaving this house.

711
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:35,859
I don't care if I'm uninvited. I won't
let your father break up this family.

712
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,067
- Family? What family would that be?
- Don't be sarcastic.

713
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,366
You checked out of
this family 20 years ago.

714
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,238
- Excuse me. I'm going to bed.
- No.

715
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:50,143
I won't let you put a revisionist spin
on this with you as the injured party. No.

716
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,149
- Step aside.
- No! I got stabbed!

717
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,651
I got stabbed in the back!
Where the hell were you?

718
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,486
You were the same place you've
been my entire life, someplace else.

719
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,693
- We came back.
- Three weeks later.

720
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,022
We were stuck in Tokyo.
You said you were fine.

721
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,892
I wasn't fine. I wasn't okay.

722
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,327
Are you gonna blame
me for taking drugs?

723
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,665
No. I am blaming you
for not being my mother!

724
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,069
Bobby died.

725
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,347
And I lost a mother.

726
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,412
May I go to bed now?

727
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,933
Yeah. Run away.

728
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,892
Oh, God.

729
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,730
- Thank you.
- Gotta call the super about that too.

730
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,000
It gets stuck in the cold.

731
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,804
And I'm guessing it's
gonna stay cold for a while.

732
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,776
Hopefully not this cold.

733
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,178
Good. I told Brian January
wasn't the best time to move.

734
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,285
But that's when the semester
starts. He's in law school.

735
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:37,319
Did you get locked out?

736
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,481
We had a fight. So
I went to the store.

737
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,592
Another half-hour
he'll be asleep.

738
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,490
You from Chicago?

739
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,931
- For a while now. Yeah.
- Originally?

740
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,271
Minnesota. You?

741
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:56,602
Idaho. The potato part, not
the white-supremacist part.

742
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,215
- You want a beer?
- No, thanks.

743
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,003
Come on.

744
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,013
Have a seat. You look
like you've had a long day.

745
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,053
Thank you.

746
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,665
Mm. You got a card.

747
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,123
Mm-hm.

748
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,795
It's nice to get one
personal piece of mail...

749
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,667
mixed in with all
the bills and junk.

750
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,839
Your birthday?

751
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,573
- Huh?
- Is it your birthday?

752
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,377
Yes.

753
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,344
- Today?
- Mm-hm.

754
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:39,841
8:03 p.m.

755
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:43,749
Well, congratulations. You've
made it. Happy birthday.

756
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,055
Thank you.
