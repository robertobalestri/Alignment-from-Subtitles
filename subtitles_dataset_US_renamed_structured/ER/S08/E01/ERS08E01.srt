1
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:31,730
Psych? My daughter
doesn't need a psychiatrist.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,368
I just need to talk
to her. That's all.

3
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,082
Can you get him on the phone?
- When did he die?

4
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,665
It's Dr. Carter in the ER.

5
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,041
How long does a CAT scan take?
- I'll hold.

6
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,443
I'm off at 4 if you
want to go get coffee.

7
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,239
Two hundred people
back at the house.

8
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,975
There's coffee
there, isn't there?

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,310
I wouldn't ask you to
subject yourself to that.

10
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,084
Dr. Weisman? MAN: <i>Yes?</i>

11
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:58,885
You have a patient here, Holly Evans,
who was supposed to be admitted last night.

12
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,154
Say he doesn't die on
the table or in post-op.

13
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,798
You ship him back to his
convenience-store alley.

14
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,059
But this time, instead
of getting beaten up...

15
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,295
he gets eaten by dogs
because he's too weak to move.

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,870
- Eaten by dogs?
- It happens.

17
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,568
- In Chicago?
- A lot. A cop told me.

18
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,142
Dr. Romano needs you
in his office immediately.

19
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,837
- Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.

20
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,242
He says it's important.

21
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,646
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

22
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,851
- Hey, Mark, you got a second?
- No.

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,489
Look, is Cleo having
trouble with the triple cocktail?

24
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,919
- What?
- She was nauseated.

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,358
She's alone and afraid. And has
now been waiting for almost 20 hours.

26
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:36,963
No.

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,294
No, pull your thumb out, get
down here and admit your patient.

28
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,297
Give her another gram of
cefoxitin and order a clear-liquid diet.

29
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,804
- "Pull your thumb out"?
- Call me in half an hour...

30
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,341
if someone from Pedes
doesn't get down here.

31
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,809
Exactly what don't you
want me to subject myself to?

32
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,148
- Dr. Weaver.
- Abby, John.

33
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,558
Things are a little
tense. I'll see you later.

34
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:00,582
I can imagine.

35
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,713
Queen Elizabeth wants
me to meet her boy.

36
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,051
- Got room for a Haldol deficiency?
- Over there.

37
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,456
Because we are compatible.

38
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:11,065
- Who, you and Prince Charles?
- He likes coffee and so do I.

39
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,224
- I could be princess.
- He is mine, honey.

40
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,929
Abby? MVA with PSI rolling up.
- Coming.

41
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,700
- Hey, you stay away from him.
- I promise.

42
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,900
There's an apartment
listed in that building.

43
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,738
- Which?
- The one you like on Clark.

44
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,640
Two bedrooms, big
closets, wood floors.

45
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,840
- You went there?
- Yeah. I called the manager.

46
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,213
She already had
two people interested.

47
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,686
- Are you seriously considering it?
- I thought you liked that area.

48
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,185
Oh, I can't afford
that kind of rent.

49
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,661
- Don't worry about it.
- And I'm pretty happy where I am.

50
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,690
- Oh, I...
- You know...

51
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,728
- How much is this?
- For you, $20.

52
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,567
- Is it real?
- Of course.

53
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,369
No. I mean authentic.

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,171
Direct from Kenya, pretty lady.
Imported with my own two hands.

55
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,212
All right. I'll take it.

56
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,578
Don't bother. It's not a gift.

57
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,097
<i>At some point, we have
to have some standards.</i>

58
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,419
<i>Who decides, you?</i>

59
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,751
<i>They decided when
they chose to participate.</i>

60
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,553
<i>You judge someone based on
what they do in their bedroom?</i>

61
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,720
<i>Look, I have no problem
with alternative lifestyles.</i>

62
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,798
<i>But we're talking
about role models here.</i>

63
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,526
<i>So you would
oppose gay teachers?</i>

64
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,763
<i>I oppose any homosexual in a job
where they interact and influence...</i>

65
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,736
Okay.

66
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,609
Exactly what don't you
want me to subject myself to?

67
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,445
- Dr. Weaver.
- Abby, John.

68
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,487
- Hey, chief. Back in the saddle so soon?
- Yeah. We weren't expecting you.

69
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,385
- It's been three weeks.
- Already?

70
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,119
Man, the time really flies when
you're, you know, missing a colleague.

71
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,126
Malik, you got that x-ray going?

72
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,424
- What x-ray?
- The one with the kid.

73
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,157
Yeah.

74
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,996
Abby, MVA with a PSI rolling up.

75
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,620
I love your hair color.
It's perfect on you.

76
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:06,644
Oh, thank you.

77
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,801
- It's strong. It's very...
- Thank you.

78
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,380
- Awesome bracelet. Where did you get it?
- A place in Nairobi.

79
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,516
- Was it totally amazing?
- What?

80
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,676
- Africa.
- It was exactly as I remembered it.

81
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,169
She's not breathing.

82
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,402
Pulse is thready,
bradying down to 50.

83
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,638
P.E.A. Starting compressions.

84
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,078
Two of O-neg on the
infuser. Get some saline.

85
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,309
- How'd she get upstairs?
- She's an ER patient?

86
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,249
Came in with facial fracture,
abdominal pain, broken wrist.

87
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,822
Waiting for Psych. Pregnant
with her brother's baby.

88
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,017
- Why wasn't anyone monitoring?
- Short-handed with Legaspi gone.

89
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,693
Another 2 cc's in the cuff.

90
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,525
Hey, give me a vascular clamp.

91
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,326
They haven't replaced Legaspi?

92
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,765
- Someone said she got a job in California.
- We should be so lucky.

93
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,666
Is that true?

94
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,467
Dr. Weaver, have you
heard from Dr. Legaspi?

95
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,605
- Probably a tension pneumo.
- What happened?

96
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,249
Four-story fall. GCS
of 3. Now in P.E.A.

97
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,856
- How did she fall?
- She jumped.

98
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,385
Pulse ox, 74 on 100 percent.

99
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,073
Did she ever have a pulse? - No.

100
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,124
- Try for a central line.
- No. Open up another tray.

101
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,157
We've got this, Kerry.
Go get cleaned up.

102
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,989
- Prep for a subclavian.
- I want a second chest tube first.

103
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,360
- 10 blade. Let's move.
- Really, Kerry, we've got it.

104
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,411
- Set up a Thora-Seal.
- Holding compressions.

105
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,235
Pretty agonal. You want atropine?
BENTON: Yeah. Push a milligram.

106
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,967
Let's set up a
pericardiocentesis.

107
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,980
What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

108
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,405
How long are we going?

109
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,118
Dr. Weaver, how was your trip?

110
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,685
Hot. It was hot.

111
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,822
Hey, I never got a
chance to thank you.

112
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,753
- For what?
- I got my Chief Resident confirmation.

113
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,087
- I won't let you down.
- I'm sure you won't.

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,056
No! No!

115
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,995
No, no, no!

116
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,432
- You should sue that Scottish bastard.
- What?

117
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,903
Sleazebag host will say
anything to get you on his show.

118
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,168
Mr. Peterson started a
brawl at a talk-show taping.

119
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,608
Somebody smacked
me with a microphone.

120
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,008
Carl?

121
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,513
Stay the hell away
from me, you queer.

122
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,710
- Carl, let me drive you home.
- I don't dig penises, okay?

123
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,406
- I have only one more operation.
- Touch me, I swear...

124
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,013
Hey. You need to calm down.

125
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,888
Calm down? This thing makes
me look like some twisted fairy.

126
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,087
You knew. Part of you knew.
- Security.

127
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,426
You see this, huh?

128
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,966
Man, woman. That's
what I know. That's normal.

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,536
It's still love,
Carl. Love is love.

130
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,869
It's perverted, you faggot!
It's sick. You disgust me.

131
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,567
- Calm down, sir.
- You're a freak!

132
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,304
- Please calm down.
- Damn homo.

133
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,977
You all right?

134
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,243
Take it easy, all right?

135
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,910
- You going to the M&M?
- What?

136
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,024
On Fossen. The M&M's starting.

137
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,160
Luka, has there been any talk...

138
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,564
about me?

139
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,763
Kerry, people always
talk about their bosses.

140
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,430
No, I...

141
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,372
- I mean personally.
- Personally?

142
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,205
Well, Dr. Weaver.

143
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,349
I thought maybe you fell under
the spell of some Masai warrior...

144
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,576
and were never
coming back. Coming in?

145
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,415
<i>Why wasn't lidocaine
given for a stable V-tach?</i>

146
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,480
I didn't have the
ACLS drug box with me.

147
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,017
When transferring
a critical patient?

148
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,156
The Trauma nurse
ran out to get it...

149
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,926
but then the doors
closed unexpectedly.

150
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,263
Leaving you alone with the patient?
- Right.

151
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,865
<i>Dr. Legaspi, however,
is a lesbian. Am I right?</i>

152
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,539
Yes. MAN: Isn't
that a little barbaric?

153
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:06,478
<i>I've never hidden that fact from
this administration or my colleagues.</i>

154
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,512
<i>Don't worry. Your
secret's safe with me.</i>

155
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,980
<i>How many openly gay
women do you know...</i>

156
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,751
<i>in hospital
administrative positions?</i>

157
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,410
<i>None. It doesn't happen.</i>

158
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,216
<i>Then deal with the
stigma of being gay.</i>

159
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,859
You care to comment on that?

160
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,128
Dr. Weaver.

161
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,860
In your opinion, was the
patient's care compromised?

162
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,231
Compromised?

163
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,670
Did the ER accept too many
Trauma patients that day?

164
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,510
Uh, I don't believe so.

165
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,509
We were busy, but we handled it.

166
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,274
Watch your back.

167
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,285
Kerry, you under the weather?

168
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,253
- Excuse me?
- You were a little slow on the uptake.

169
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,948
Jet lag.

170
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,492
Oh, yes. Your trip
to Africa, was it?

171
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,687
Spontaneous decision.
Doesn't seem like you.

172
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,332
Half of my accrued personal
days were about to expire.

173
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:03,266
Well, it still doesn't justify you going
MIA for three weeks with no real warning.

174
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,895
You know what? I took a vacation. I may
take another. I still have 19 days banked.

175
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,905
Uh-huh. I see.

176
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,670
You might want to try
Papua New Guinea next time.

177
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,713
I hear they put gourds
on their penises.

178
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,944
Give some notice next time.

179
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,611
- Wait. Robert.
- Careful, Kerry.

180
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,551
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm good.

181
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,591
You know, you could just call my office.
You don't have to go beat up the elevator.

182
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,557
You, uh...

183
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,557
- Who have you told?
- Told who what?

184
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,327
About what we
discussed before I left.

185
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,438
Oh, yes. Legaspi. As
ordered, I backed off.

186
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,803
But she was determined to leave,
decided she didn't like us anymore...

187
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:46,208
and was gonna move and work in
San Francisco, I understand. Go figure.

188
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:50,313
Have you told anyone about me?

189
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,318
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.

190
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,062
Have you told anyone
that I'm a lesbian?

191
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,954
Oh, um...

192
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,656
No, Kerry.

193
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,769
I assumed that that
was confidential.

194
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,529
Was I wrong to assume that?

195
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,731
I mean, if you want to tell
everyone, that's your business.

196
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,400
But I don't see how a
person's sexual affairs...

197
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:21,912
are appropriate subject matter for a
workplace conversation, do you, Kerry?

198
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,185
No.

199
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,446
Glad we're on the same page.

200
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,862
- We got aluminum rotors in stock?
- Doubt it. Want me to order some?

201
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,265
- If it's not too much trouble.
- Pads too?

202
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,401
I'm sure your father
will give me a deal.

203
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,534
If I ever need an operation,
you better not charge me.

204
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,643
Just for parts.

205
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,609
- What's this, summer session?
- Chem 2.

206
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,248
Look, if you can pay
him, you should pay him.

207
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,714
- Mom got fired.
- What happened?

208
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,583
You can only take a leave
of absence for just so long.

209
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,153
Hey, you know what?
You should bring Cleo over.

210
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,890
- We haven't seen you guys in a while.
- We're taking a little break right now.

211
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,556
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

212
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,531
She's going through
some rough stuff...

213
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,501
and she needed a little
room. I'm respecting that.

214
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,902
Did you reach him?
- No, not yet.

215
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,736
I'm gonna try
him again in a few.

216
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,901
Look at that. You'd
think she had fangs.

217
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,173
He said he'd come back to check on me.
- I know.

218
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,818
Nine years I've been hosting a
talk show. I've never gotten bit.

219
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,213
- I thought those fights were all staged.
- Not exactly.

220
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,085
But people usually
don't get hurt.

221
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,991
We use lightweight
furniture, just in case.

222
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:46,326
Guys tend to get unglued when their
lover tells them they used to be a man.

223
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,162
- Can you catch AIDS from a she-male bite?
- What?

224
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,133
I think one of the
transsexuals bit me.

225
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,273
Excuse me.

226
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,299
She broke the skin.

227
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,842
- Cleo? Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

228
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,912
- I heard you got sick.
- A little nauseous.

229
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,672
- Trouble with your meds?
- I'm fine.

230
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,010
You're still taking
them, though, right?

231
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,143
- Do you want to help out?
- Sure.

232
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,789
A 20-year-old girl fell down
and broke her left wrist.

233
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,185
Doesn't sound surgical.

234
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,555
Then smacked repeatedly with a
folding chair to the face and abdomen.

235
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,719
- Talk-show brawl?
- She's a little worked-up.

236
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,889
Just found out her boyfriend
is also her half-brother.

237
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,627
Right. Up.

238
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,632
Down.

239
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:30,501
Okay. You might have a facial
fracture. I need to see some x-rays.

240
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,844
Is this tender? How about here?

241
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,084
I need to use an
ultrasound machine on your

242
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,349
belly to rule out any
internal bleeding, okay?

243
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,120
- Alice.
- Get out!

244
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,655
- Get out!
- Let me explain...

245
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,656
- You tell me on TV.
- I know.

246
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,819
You keep this from
me. You let me date him.

247
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,057
And you knew we were having
sex, and you tell me on TV!

248
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,360
- The producers made me do that.
- Get out!

249
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,801
- You need to sit and let us monitor you.
- I need to talk to Alice.

250
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,371
Alice, honey, I love you.

251
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,736
- I can explain this whole thing.
- Get out!

252
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,901
I can explain this. - Get out!

253
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,410
- Please.
- Alice?

254
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,650
Can you tell if I'm
pregnant with that?

255
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,220
Do you think you are?

256
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,724
I might be.

257
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,728
It looks like about 10 weeks.

258
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,001
I was gonna keep it.

259
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,173
This can't be happening.

260
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,350
This can't be true.
I love him so much.

261
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,020
It's not fair.

262
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:54,287
There's no intra-abdominal bleeding, but
I'm gonna get a CT scan of your face, okay?

263
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,358
Could you close the curtain?

264
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,794
Sure.

265
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:11,174
- Dr. Benton, can I discharge Molton?
- As soon as he's done with his IV.

266
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,539
Also, this girl needs a facial
CT and a Psych consult.

267
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:16,955
Weaver's here! MALUCCI: What?

268
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,948
Why didn't someone
say she was working?

269
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,038
- She's on the schedule.
- Take this down.

270
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,986
I know I know you
from somewhere.

271
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,058
- I wouldn't forget that smile.
- All right.

272
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,992
Put Neosporin on it three times a day
and don't wash your hair for two days.

273
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:34,328
No way. I'm a bridesmaid on Saturday. I
have to wash my hair. I want to look good.

274
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,628
Dr. Romano needs you
in his office immediately.

275
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,170
- Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.

276
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,567
He says it's important.

277
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,676
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

278
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,869
- Hey, Mark, you got a minute?
- No.

279
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,514
Is Cleo having trouble
with the triple cocktail?

280
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,013
- What?
- She was nauseated.

281
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,812
- Has she had a repeat antibody test?
- You should ask her.

282
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,250
I want to make sure
they're following her LFTs.

283
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,583
Peter, you should talk to her.

284
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,361
- Uncle Peter.
- Joanie?

285
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,190
- What's wrong?
- Can I talk to you?

286
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,093
Your parathyroidectomy's
ready to go.

287
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,666
Put his film on a view
box. I'll be right back.

288
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,827
- What's up?
- I think they're gonna break up.

289
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,562
- Who?
- My mom and my dad.

290
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,781
I didn't notice it until
I came home for the

291
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,732
summer, but it's
really bad, Uncle Peter.

292
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,844
I mean, one minute,
Mom seems okay.

293
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,571
The next, she's crying and
locks herself in the bedroom.

294
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,240
Dad won't even say anything. He
just gets all quiet and stares into space.

295
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,479
- Look, they lost their son. It's normal.
- No, it is not normal.

296
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,113
They fight all the time about
her job, about Jesse's room.

297
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,989
Dad washed a shirt that had his
scent on it, and Mom went nuts.

298
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,025
And then Dad stayed out all night.
I don't know. It's just messed up.

299
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,531
Somebody's gotta talk to her.

300
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,866
There's nothing I can say, and there's
nothing you can do but give it time.

301
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,065
- It's almost been a year, Uncle Peter.
- Joanie, I know, but it...

302
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,138
- Trauma 1?
- Yeah. It's your patient.

303
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,578
- My patient?
- Yeah, the girl from the talk show.

304
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,274
What?

305
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,913
Probably a tension pneumo.

306
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,443
What happened?

307
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:04,353
- Four-story fall. GCS
of three. Now in P.E.A.

308
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,856
- How'd she fall?
- She jumped.

309
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,493
Pulse ox, 74 on 100 percent.

310
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,180
Did she ever have a pulse? - No.

311
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,993
- Try for a central line.
- Let's open up another tray first.

312
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,764
We've got this.
Go get cleaned up.

313
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,732
- Prep for a subclavian.
- Not until I get a second chest tube.

314
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,372
Really, Kerry. We've got it.

315
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,737
- Set up a Thora-Seal.
- Holding compressions.

316
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,141
- Pretty agonal. You want atropine?
- Yeah. Push a milligram.

317
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,905
Let's set up a
pericardiocentesis.

318
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,675
- What did you say to her?
- I didn't say anything to her.

319
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,984
I'm in. Check the tamponade.
Give her 8 units packed cells.

320
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,794
I feel a pulse. ABBY: Injury
occurring on the monitor.

321
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,529
Blood in the pericardium.

322
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,395
220 cc's out.

323
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,332
- Rate is 29.
- Still no pulse.

324
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,063
All right. Resuming
compressions. Another amp of epi.

325
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,867
- Mother's outside.
- Keep her out.

326
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,369
- I'll tell her.
- I'm not ready to call it yet.

327
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,310
You will be.

328
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,379
Let it circulate.

329
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,211
Dr. Benton?

330
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,652
Asystole.

331
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,453
No!

332
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,858
No!

333
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,695
No, no, no! No, no!

334
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,665
Time of death, 12:17.

335
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,583
- Peter.
- Hey.

336
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,920
- Hi.
- What, are you spring-cleaning?

337
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,214
- Getting rid of some crap.
- It's not too dark?

338
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,662
I wanted to finish. Salvation
Army comes tomorrow.

339
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,563
- All right. Well, let me give you a hand.
- I'm almost done.

340
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,567
Want a hamster cage?

341
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,138
- No?
- You okay?

342
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,831
What did you need, Peter?

343
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:06,571
I... What? I just came
by for a snow shovel.

344
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,043
All right. I came
to check on you.

345
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,643
I heard you lost your job.

346
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,916
We'll just have to wait
to expand that porch.

347
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,420
What's wrong with the porch?

348
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,692
I don't know.

349
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,562
I thought it was
time for a change.

350
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,738
Walt took some pictures of the back
yard that we could xerox and draw on...

351
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,738
make plans.

352
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,105
When I went to
pick up the prints...

353
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,344
I found three pictures
of Jesse left on the roll.

354
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,513
I fell apart.

355
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,591
Right in the store.

356
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,219
I realized...

357
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,591
that's it.

358
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,162
There'll never be any
more pictures of him.

359
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,264
Fifteen years old.

360
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,033
And he's never gonna change.

361
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,487
You think every day you're getting
a little better, getting through it.

362
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,824
And then you're right
back to the day it happened.

363
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,059
He's still my baby, Peter.

364
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,899
I'm supposed to
take care of him.

365
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,171
I feel like...

366
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,405
somewhere, sometime...

367
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,916
he's gonna be sad...

368
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,220
or cold...

369
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,949
or scared.

370
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,361
Who's taking care of him?

371
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,396
Who's being his mother?

372
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:09,525
"I am the resurrection and
the life," sayeth the Lord.

373
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:15,864
"He that believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

374
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:20,369
And whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.

375
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,536
We brought nothing
into this world.

376
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:27,778
And it is certain we'd
carry nothing out.

377
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,974
Wherefore my heart is
glad and my spirit rejoiceth...

378
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,515
my flesh also
shall rest in hope."

379
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:40,251
The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away.

380
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,986
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

381
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:47,429
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

382
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,296
through our Lord,
Jesus Christ...

383
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:54,668
we commend to almighty
God our brother John.

384
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,175
And we commit his
body to the ground.

385
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,778
Earth to earth...

386
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,777
ashes to ashes...

387
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,314
dust to dust.

388
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,789
Dad did a nice
job with the eulogy.

389
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,357
He worked on it for a while.

390
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,663
- Grandpa would have liked it.
- Yes.

391
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,203
Gamma seems to be holding up.

392
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,771
I expect she would.

393
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,139
Is that for your convenience
or someone else's?

394
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,709
Hello. ABBY: <i>Bad time?</i>

395
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,081
Yeah. Kind of busy. Why?

396
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,653
Wait, wait. She's
not on the ward?

397
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,920
Weisman was supposed
to admit her last night.

398
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,826
<i>- She's sitting right here.</i>
- What's her hemoglobin?

399
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,231
Okay, yeah. No,
I'll be right there.

400
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,963
Fifteen minutes.

401
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,708
We need to make a stop
at County General Hospital.

402
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,711
- Just get off on Division.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,249
This shouldn't take long.

404
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,145
You mind?

405
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:16,988
Pow!

406
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,356
- Can someone shut him up?
- Why don't you both shut up.

407
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,917
I got a right to be here,
same as you. Pow, pow.

408
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,528
Hi.

409
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,256
- You left without saying goodbye.
- You were asleep.

410
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,961
- For about 10 minutes.
- I'm sorry. I had someplace to be.

411
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,532
- I don't like it here.
- I know.

412
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:38,176
But we're gonna make sure that you get
your own bed and your own room upstairs.

413
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:42,042
- You said that last night.
- Well, they're still working on it.

414
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,542
- But I'm gonna go hurry them up, okay?
- Okay.

415
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,276
Any more pain in your stomach?

416
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,478
- A little.
- We'll take care of that.

417
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,954
And Abby here is gonna hang
out with you until they bring you up.

418
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,083
Tell her to call me again
if you want to talk to me.

419
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,587
- Thanks for coming back.
- You're welcome.

420
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,903
What was her last crit?

421
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,431
Thirty-six, after two
doses of Solu-Medrol.

422
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,769
Give her four more,
MS, then Q2 p.r.n.

423
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,036
- When are her parents getting here?
- Around 3.

424
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,477
- They missed their connecting flight.
- Dr. Weisman, please.

425
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,411
Nice suit. Who died?

426
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,552
My grandfather.

427
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,551
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

428
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,388
Uh, no, no. Can you get
him on the phone now?

429
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,790
- When did he die?
- It's Dr. Carter in the ER.

430
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,730
- Monday.
- Wow.

431
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,594
You okay?

432
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,004
I'm off at 4 if you want to
go get a coffee or something.

433
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,834
I got 200 people
back at the house.

434
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,635
There's coffee
there, isn't there?

435
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,410
I wouldn't ask you to
subject yourself to that.

436
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,811
Dr. Weisman? This is Dr. Carter.

437
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:54,476
You have a patient, Holly Evans, who
was supposed to be admitted last night.

438
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,796
Wait.

439
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,471
- Thank you.
- Did the driver get lost?

440
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,577
John had something
more pressing.

441
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,679
It was trouble with a patient.

442
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,311
- Decent turnout.
- It'll do.

443
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,111
- Where's Gamma?
- Lying down. Said she was tired.

444
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,653
- Where are you staying?
- The Drake.

445
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,555
The Ritz-Carlton was booked.

446
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:33,258
Did you think
about staying here?

447
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,824
Oh, there's Peter
Harkins. I should say hello.

448
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,266
- Who's Peter Harkins?
- He's handling the probate.

449
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,831
I'm gonna check on Gamma.

450
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,232
- I did. She's fine.
- Still...

451
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,840
You want to help your
grandmother, be a good host.

452
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,944
Introduce yourself to Senator
Herrero's daughter. Arthur.

453
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,428
Dr. Carter, your friend is here.

454
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,503
- Holly got her bed.
- Yeah? Did Weisman come down?

455
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,872
Yeah. A few minutes
after you called.

456
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,674
Amazing what a little "pull
your thumb out" will do.

457
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,978
- Did you eat something?
- No.

458
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:37,551
I couldn't decide between the smoked
tongue pâté and the whitefish mousse.

459
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,885
We must have run out
of the pigs in the blanket.

460
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,493
Well, somebody should
really talk to your caterer.

461
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,762
You're gonna have
some dirty birds.

462
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,731
Grandpa liked to drive the
power lawn mower around.

463
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,604
- And he drove it into the birdbath?
- Not on purpose.

464
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,708
He was having a
fatal MI at the time.

465
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,881
Oh, God.

466
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,016
I'm sorry.

467
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,348
- You gotta die somehow.
- Mm-hm.

468
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,419
It's not a bad way to go.

469
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,613
A sunny day...

470
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,922
out on the mower.

471
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,390
- Don't... Don't laugh.
- I'm sorry.

472
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,330
- Don't laugh.
- Well, stop it.

473
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,599
Oh, God.

474
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,874
I hope it's all right that I came
here. I'm not usually a funeral crasher.

475
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,071
Figured this would
be a good one?

476
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,478
And I felt bad...

477
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:42,944
that your grandfather died
and we didn't even talk about it.

478
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,487
John, have you seen Millicent?

479
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,594
No.

480
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,798
Mom, this is my friend Abby.
Abby, this is my mother, Eleanor.

481
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,935
- Hello.
- Hi.

482
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,236
Things are winding down. She
really needs to make an appearance.

483
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,967
- I will go and look for her in a minute.
- Please do.

484
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,410
Sorry.

485
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,383
- It's okay.
- It's my parents. They don't...

486
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,522
They don't handle loss well.

487
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,220
Who does?

488
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,091
It's been a while since we've
had to deal with this sort of thing.

489
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,325
- Since your brother died?
- Mm-hm.

490
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,005
You'd better go.

491
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,483
<i>54. That was back in July.</i>

492
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,815
Oh, come on.

493
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,688
<i>Fall from grace for the NASDAQ.</i>

494
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,359
- John?
- Hey.

495
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,592
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Just took a hit on Parning.

496
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:05,932
Biotech's in the basement again.

497
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,898
- You want a drink?
- No, thank you.

498
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,065
Have you seen Gamma?

499
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,268
Haven't given up
that quest, huh?

500
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,811
Oh, Mom thinks she
might be hiding out.

501
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,542
I don't blame her. That
room can get insufferable.

502
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,986
Dad, I think you
should stay here tonight.

503
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,045
Don't worry. We have a driver.

504
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,723
No. I meant for Gamma.

505
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:29,828
- You know how your mother feels about it.
- Well, then stand up to her this time.

506
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:34,126
Thanks for the counsel.
I'll take it under advisement.

507
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,198
She buried her husband today.

508
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,497
Yes, I know. My father.

509
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,368
- Then don't run away again.
- Drop it, John.

510
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,373
Leave it alone.

511
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,918
I've left it...

512
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,815
alone.

513
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,752
Bobby's not coming back.

514
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,896
If Mom wants to walk around in a
bubble for the rest of her life, then fine.

515
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,092
But don't let her keep
holding you inside of it.

516
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,045
You might want
to try the garage.

517
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,055
Damn it.

518
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,427
Gamma?

519
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:42,261
I can't get this
stupid thing started.

520
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,730
Well, it sounds
like it's flooded.

521
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,896
You need to let it sit.

522
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,643
- Your mother sent you.
- Yeah.

523
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,040
- People want to pay their respects.
- Well, they can wait.

524
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,445
I'm the widow.

525
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,416
I hope you weren't thinking
about drinking and driving.

526
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,854
We were saving that bottle
for our 60th anniversary.

527
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,330
Missed it by a year.

528
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,328
Open it.

529
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,427
No, you can still wait.

530
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,234
Let's drink to your grandfather.

531
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:29,845
It's a very nice vintage.

532
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,675
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather share this with...?

533
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,376
- Whoa!
- Whoa-ho-ho!

534
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,089
We don't have any glasses.

535
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,851
You can drink from the bottle.

536
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,992
To John Truman Carter...

537
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,729
entrepreneur...

538
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:55,299
philanthropist...

539
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,203
family man.

540
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,742
And friend.

541
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,689
We gonna take this old
girl out for a spin, or what?

542
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,795
Damn right.

543
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,497
Okay, that's it.

544
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:01,438
How'd it look?

545
00:34:01,462 --> 00:34:03,733
Have to wait for the
radiologist to read it.

546
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,377
You saw it.

547
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,706
- I'm just a tech.
- Did you see anything bad?

548
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,871
- You want to take on Fossen, Mark?
- What?

549
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,778
The shooter. He
coded in the elevator.

550
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,419
I thought maybe you
should present him in M&M.

551
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,350
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

552
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,513
- Did you give nitro?
- Two sprays, no relief.

553
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,751
Can you see if they brought my
daughter? I think she broke her arm.

554
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:24,260
- Is this from the talk show?
- How'd you guess?

555
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,263
- They're stacked up in the waiting room.
- How'd it start?

556
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,459
How do any of them start? I heard
somebody bit the host this time.

557
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,862
So I only present the
cab driver. That's it.

558
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:35,300
Luka, relax, okay?

559
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,170
Just stick to the
facts. You'll be fine.

560
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:41,108
Cleo, check a 12-lead and a...

561
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,116
The meds?

562
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,916
Third time today.

563
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,314
- You tried Compazine?
- Yeah.

564
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,513
- We can get you some Zofran.
- I can live with the nausea.

565
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,491
- My liver enzymes were up last week.
- Meds might be giving you hepatitis.

566
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,889
Only one more week.

567
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,031
- Three out of four might be enough.
- Maybe.

568
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,723
- You don't want to hurt your liver.
- I want to be safe.

569
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,893
- Malucci, need something to do?
- No. I'm swamped, actually.

570
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,766
- Want my opinion?
- I guess so.

571
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,373
Reduce your dose
and monitor your LFTs.

572
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:10,981
- Talk show? EMT
1: No. Casey Square.

573
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,307
A bunch of teenagers
beat him up for his coin cup.

574
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,707
Trauma 2.

575
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,110
Contusions to the
face, chest, everything.

576
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,081
- Didn't anybody see this happening?
- The whole plaza saw it.

577
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,653
All right. Get a surgical consult
and x-ray. I'll be right there.

578
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,182
- Nobody did anything?
- Just his homeless buddies.

579
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,386
- Hi, Adele.
- Hi.

580
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,655
- How's physical therapy?
- It's hard.

581
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,164
- Have you got up on crutches?
- Yeah, with leg braces, yeah.

582
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,734
- That's a good sign.
- Well, I'm trying.

583
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,761
But I'm also realistic.

584
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:45,001
Romano wanted me to go to the
Morbidity and Mortality as a show-and-tell.

585
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,647
- Are you presenting Fossen?
- Yeah.

586
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,918
Well, have fun.

587
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,765
I need an ultrasound. - Coming.

588
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,322
C-spine's ready.

589
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,618
Did you get his pressure up?
- 90/60 after a liter.

590
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,921
Hi, it's Abby calling about
your colitis patient, Holly.

591
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,655
She keeps asking for you.
Could you call me? Thanks.

592
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,094
Everything hurts.

593
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,369
Okay, we can take
the collar off now.

594
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,698
- How'd it go?
- What?

595
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,933
Oh, right. Good.
Yeah. Still have a brain.

596
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,838
- Mark.
- Everything's normal.

597
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,838
I still can't believe people would stand
there and watch someone get beaten.

598
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,781
- How are you holding up?
- Six weeks of maternity leave, not enough.

599
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,079
We have fluid in
Morrison's pouch. Call O.R.

600
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,452
Where? CORDAY: There.

601
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,721
Sir, it appears you're
bleeding internally...

602
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:35,822
Hold on. It could be
ascites from cirrhosis.

603
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,223
I can't assume that.

604
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,990
- What's his blood alcohol?
- 315.

605
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:44,535
- When was your last drink, Mr. Skapinski?
- They took my last drink.

606
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,304
- He's hypotensive with a low crit.
- He could be septic from pneumonia.

607
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,133
- High risk for surgery.
- Even riskier if he bleeds out.

608
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,940
Let's take a deep breath
and do a peritoneal lavage.

609
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:59,312
- He's a surgical candidate.
- He's a homeless alcoholic with pneumonia.

610
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:00,713
Therefore not worth saving?

611
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,787
He's as healthy as he'll get.
I'm trying to keep him that way.

612
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,618
- Surgery could kill him.
- Delaying surgery could kill him.

613
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,885
Say he doesn't die on
the table or in post-op.

614
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,359
You ship him back to his
convenience-store alley.

615
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,725
But this time, instead
of getting beaten up...

616
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,868
he gets eaten by dogs
because he's too weak to move.

617
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,367
- Eaten by dogs?
- It happens.

618
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,596
- In Chicago?
- A lot. A cop told me.

619
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,606
Dr. Romano needs to speak
to you in his office immediately.

620
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,244
- Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.

621
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,640
He says it's important.

622
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,646
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

623
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:34,474
M&Ms. They serve their purpose
in the practice of medicine, I guess.

624
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,554
- But they can be a pain in the ass.
- Needed something, Robert?

625
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,351
I hear you're presenting
this serial killer.

626
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,120
- Mass murderer?
- Right, right. This Fossen guy.

627
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,854
- You don't want me to?
- No. It's just that...

628
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,400
Legal flagged something they'll ask. I
wanted you to be prepared for the question.

629
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,300
Sure. Go ahead.

630
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,496
It's no big deal. It's
their job to be anal.

631
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,135
Yeah. What is it?

632
00:37:56,307 --> 00:38:01,268
Well, uh, the nurse's notes show
that you left the Trauma Room at 1625.

633
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:05,111
And the code-blue notes
from pre-op began at 1642.

634
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:09,050
Why'd it take you 17 minutes to
transfer a patient up four floors?

635
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,519
Well... I, uh...

636
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,158
Dr. Romano, there's an
incident in the ambulance bay.

637
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,623
I'm in a meeting, Brenda.

638
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,161
An ER patient jumped
out a fourth-floor window.

639
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,901
That's great news, Brenda,
thank you. Are they dead?

640
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,798
I don't know. They're
working on her.

641
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,804
Keep the press away. No
statements from anyone to anyone...

642
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,808
and get Risk Management down there.
Why I wanted this job I will never know.

643
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,937
All right, Greene, let's go. As you
can see, I've got bigger fish to fry.

644
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,108
Doors opened on
the surgical floor.

645
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:45,917
I was alone doing chest
compressions, ran down the defib battery.

646
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,719
Took time to get help...

647
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,052
transfer the patient to pre-op.

648
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,233
Okey-doke. Brenda,
get PR on the line.

649
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,700
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

650
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,806
I don't think anyone's gonna
be crying over this guy. Do you?

651
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:08,344
Autopsy also revealed injuries to the
spleen and superior mesenteric artery.

652
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,881
Cause of death: exsanguination
from multiple vascular injuries.

653
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,850
Why wasn't lidocaine
given for stable V-tach?

654
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,947
I didn't have the
ACLS drug box with me.

655
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,518
When transferring
a critical patient?

656
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:26,693
The Trauma nurse ran out to get it,
but then the doors closed unexpectedly.

657
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,234
Leaving you alone with the patient?
- Yes.

658
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,971
I don't know if it would
have changed the outcome.

659
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,939
I'm sorry. Did you say the original
dysrhythmia was stable V-tach?

660
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,774
Yes.

661
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,343
He had a pulse?

662
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,947
That's correct.

663
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,049
- So the patient was conscious?
- Yes.

664
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,218
I didn't realize that.

665
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,250
Were you involved with
this case, Dr. Corday?

666
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,628
No. No.

667
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:01,690
Wait a minute. You cardioverted
a patient without sedation?

668
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,428
- Yes. MAN: Isn't
that a little barbaric?

669
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,101
Under the circumstances,
it's what I felt I needed to do.

670
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:12,403
Was there any delay in the
O.R. accepting the patient?

671
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,238
Dr. Greene?

672
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:17,805
No.

673
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,578
Did you know him?

674
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,744
- Who?
- His grandfather.

675
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,823
Yeah. I met him at
that charity event.

676
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,356
Charity event?

677
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,256
Abby, where's my patient?

678
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,226
Dr. Corday took
him up to surgery.

679
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:34,730
- I thought you okayed it.
- Yeah.

680
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,294
So you're going? - Uh, yeah.

681
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,303
- Mrs. Jenkins.
- Could you take this tube out?

682
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,907
They wouldn't
take this tube out.

683
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:48,345
This is a coroner's case.
I'm sorry, we have to wait.

684
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,885
They flew us to Chicago
and put us up in the Hilton...

685
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:59,850
gave me money to go shopping
with. They even took me to a dentist.

686
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,695
The producers said not to
tell her until after the taping.

687
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:10,494
That it would be more real if she
didn't know what I was gonna say.

688
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,605
It was a lie.

689
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,539
It was all a lie.

690
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,406
All that stuff about them
having the same daddies...

691
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:27,382
I just said that to get
them on the show.

692
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:35,091
I used to say, "Alice, you
must always tell the truth."

693
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,888
And she'd go,
"Well, why, Mommy?"

694
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,892
And I'd say:

695
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,399
"Because when you don't...

696
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:47,232
God gets very angry."

697
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,885
How is she?

698
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,087
Catherine said she slept
for three hours this afternoon.

699
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,197
- Has she fed?
- Just now.

700
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,795
How's our patient?

701
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:21,064
Extubated in
Recovery when I left.

702
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,504
I repaired a little
omental oozing.

703
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:27,111
But it might have stopped
on its own. It's hard to say.

704
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,013
Judgment call.

705
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:33,483
You do what you
think is right, Mark.

706
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,485
Elizabeth, in the
elevator with Fossen...

707
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,025
I think we've talked enough
about Fossen today, don't you?

708
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm going to bed.

709
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,641
You coming?

710
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:06,380
Just wait a few minutes.
Make sure she's down.

711
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,350
Okay.

712
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,357
- Good night.
- Night.

713
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,020
Night-night, sweetheart.

714
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,436
Mark...

715
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,310
I'll get up with her.

716
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,145
Okay.
