1
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,673
- He drew this?
- Yesterday afternoon.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,178
He's got talent.
Don't you think?

3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,175
Hey, Jackie.

4
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,989
- Thanks for dropping him off.
- No problem.

5
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,716
Hey.

6
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,589
Missed you last night.

7
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,261
I know. I had to work late.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,228
No, no, no. I can't play.
I'm gonna come back...

9
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,636
and put you to sleep.

10
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,170
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,246
Dr. Benton? Romano wants you to
assist on a post-op hemicolectomy.

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,542
- I'm off at 8.
- It's 7:55.

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,514
Well, call Edson.

14
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,882
Damn it. JACKIE: What is it?

15
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,847
It's the ER.

16
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:01,256
Remember how Carla wanted
Reece to be with you on Father's Day?

17
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,694
- It says a lot. The judge should know.
- That's good. Yeah.

18
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,898
- We'll be okay?
- It's just the first day.

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,901
- Maybe I should be there to help.
- Jackie, you are helping.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,063
Rachel Greene. I need a
copy of her attendance records.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,869
- You could have told me.
- I didn't know.

22
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,569
Who's allergic to lilies?

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,544
She may not have
appreciated the symbolism.

24
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,241
- Symbolism?
- Lilies are for funerals.

25
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,411
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,116
- I just wanted to send her some flowers.
- You got his grandmother flowers?

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,125
I can't seem to get in her good
graces. How's her leg anyway?

28
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,628
- She's concerned with the girl she hit.
- I already met with him.

29
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:41,200
- I thought that girl was better.
- Yeah. She's in her upswing.

30
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,270
- About to have a bigger bank account.
- She settled?

31
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,964
- Very good offer.
- Good. So you can fax it to me.

32
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,370
- Who's paging me?
- They need you in Room 2.

33
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,068
- Where's Corday?
- Upstairs.

34
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,236
- Isn't she on for Trauma?
- We just got here.

35
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,212
- I thought she was on leave.
- She's been cleared to operate.

36
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:00,718
- What about all the dead geezers?
- There's no evidence of any wrongdoing.

37
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,446
Good news.

38
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,718
When the paramedics
roll me in, I'll take Romano.

39
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,384
- Entrance, left temple, no exit.
- What type of gun?

40
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:12,226
- Cops said a .32 at close range.
- Pupils are 5 mm and fixed.

41
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,924
- Who shot her?
- Does it matter?

42
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,333
Got caught in a gas station holdup.
- Absent blink reflex.

43
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,099
- Probable brainstem damage.
- Did we push mannitol?

44
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,742
- I'm still assessing her.
- What are you waiting for?

45
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,572
Let's push the mannitol, load
Dilantin and hyperventilate.

46
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:29,274
- I was taking Gallant through the exam.
- Treat the patient first, okay?

47
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,009
ABG, gram of Ancef
and a head CT.

48
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,450
- What's the GCS?
- Elizabeth, it's 8:20.

49
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,080
- Sorry. I had to change.
- Call Neurosurg if it's fixable on CT.

50
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,954
- What's the rush?
- I have to go.

51
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,596
- Heart rate's 50.
- Push an amp of atropine.

52
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:46,222
- Is there a problem, Peter?
- You're late. I have to get out of here.

53
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,310
- What's the caloric reflex?
- Slow deviation to the stimulus.

54
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,922
And then?

55
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:48,892
- Saccadic return to the midline.
- Date of birth: 9/12/73.

56
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,430
- Dr. Benton ever in a good mood?
- He has his moments.

57
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,959
Go ahead.

58
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,596
- No response.
- Looks like she's a donor.

59
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,666
- I'll be right back.
- Is there any family we can call for you?

60
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,575
Her parents live in Minnesota.
We were gonna drive there today.

61
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,615
- This is Dr. Corday.
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Pruitt.

62
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,847
Are you gonna operate?

63
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:17,691
The bullet passed through the brainstem.
I'm afraid no surgery can repair that.

64
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,054
Is there any chance
that she'll survive?

65
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,660
She's no longer
breathing on her own.

66
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,894
We have to wait and see if
she regains consciousness.

67
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,870
But it's highly unlikely.

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,976
The medical exam is
consistent with brain death.

69
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,210
I was still asleep
when she left.

70
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:50,053
I know this is a difficult time,
but we found a donor card.

71
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,886
- A what?
- Your wife wanted to be an organ donor.

72
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,395
Oh. Yeah, I guess
that's what she wanted.

73
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,498
- Can I go see her?
- Yeah, sure.

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,563
Elizabeth, we need you in here.

75
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,299
- Started an 18-gauge in the left AC.
- Rudy Escalona, 15 years old.

76
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,172
LOC from blunt head
trauma. One, two, three!

77
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,139
Boxing. He took
a lot of punches.

78
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,877
Any medical problems, Rudy?
- Huh?

79
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,544
- No. He's in good shape.
- Know where you are?

80
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,384
I hit him, man. I hit him good.

81
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,722
- Pulse ox is 98 on two liters.
- Pupils equal and reactive.

82
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,695
- Do you know what year it is?
- Nobody thought I could do it.

83
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,891
- Answer the doctor.
- But I did it.

84
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,592
Squeeze my hand, Rudy.

85
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,128
- Haleh?
- He's not responding.

86
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,433
We need to get some
information from you, sir.

87
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,907
- Airway's okay. Still has gag.
- No. I'll stay.

88
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:48,913
- After the x-rays, you can come back.
- Soft abdomen. No guarding or rebounds.

89
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,116
- How late are you on?
- Peter should be back by 6.

90
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,283
I'm on till 10. Could you
check Rachel's homework?

91
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,651
Sure. Lateral C-spine
and a head CT.

92
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,953
She needs help with her
trinomials. Normal Babinski.

93
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,689
- I believe I failed algebra.
- It's either that or Revolutionary War.

94
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,766
- I'll stick with math.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,459
- Why can't you talk to HR?
- It won't change the outcome.

96
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:13,368
- Nicole deserves a second chance.
- Is that your objective opinion?

97
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,838
She made a mistake. I
know it won't happen again.

98
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,979
The hospital has a zero-tolerance
policy against stealing.

99
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,618
But if you explain,
they might reconsider.

100
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:23,344
There is nothing to explain.

101
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,145
- Just do it as a favor to me.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

102
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,483
Or you won't? Please.
I got her the job.

103
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,648
You should have
screened her first.

104
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,317
Carter, what is this abscess
still doing in Exam 4?

105
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,463
- It's perirectal.
- Yeah, it needs surgery.

106
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,623
- So you're on this too, Susan?
- Carter wanted a second opinion.

107
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,167
No. Call Surgery. We're
busy. One doctor per patient.

108
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,706
- Have fun suturing.
- Have fun with your rectum.

109
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,700
When was your last tetanus shot?

110
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,669
You better ask my dad. I...

111
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,178
- Jorge, this is Dr. Lewis.
- Hi. How's his exam?

112
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:03,688
Two-centimeter lac on the labial
mucosa. Suggest an interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.

113
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,656
- How'd you get hurt?
- He was boxing.

114
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,159
- And the other guy?
- You tell me.

115
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,197
The patient in Trauma 1?
Jorge's little brother, Rudy.

116
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,697
He got in a good one.

117
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,326
I kind of lost it, but I didn't
mean to hurt him. Not bad.

118
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,002
There you are.

119
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,601
How's Rudy?

120
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,938
They say he's gonna wake up,
he's gonna be all right. You okay?

121
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,545
- He needs a couple of stitches.
- Does it hurt?

122
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,181
No.

123
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,011
This is one tough kid.

124
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,247
Be careful with your reaction to
the testimony. No sighing, no faces.

125
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,619
- What if I have a question?
- Write it down.

126
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,920
- They switched judges.
- Who'd we draft?

127
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,687
- Alter.
- Is that good or bad?

128
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,855
He always favors the mother.
That's not a problem in this case.

129
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,730
It wouldn't hurt to show a maternal
side. Is that the tie you're wearing?

130
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,237
- What's wrong with it?
- It's a little showy, don't you think?

131
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:58,910
And don't get too emotional. You
don't wanna come across as cold either.

132
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,481
- You make it sound like a performance.
- Well, it is.

133
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,943
That is the whitest
tie I've ever seen.

134
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,719
It's blue.

135
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,083
She keeps breaking out
in hives, like a reaction.

136
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,315
- To what?
- I don't know.

137
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,551
Nobody knows. We've
been to three ERs.

138
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,094
- Fifty of Benadryl.
- Push 125 of Solu-Medrol.

139
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,255
We've found guided imagery
helps. Close your eyes, honey.

140
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,162
- Who's her doctor?
- He's in Syracuse.

141
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,768
We're on our honeymoon.

142
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,633
Go to your peaceful place.

143
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,605
- Better hide the good silver.
- What's she doing here?

144
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,441
Meeting with Personnel.
I hear she's getting fired.

145
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,139
Let our souls intermingle.

146
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,445
- Any new soaps or pesticides?
- Everything's the same.

147
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,056
- What about latex?
- What do you mean?

148
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,784
Some people are allergic
to rubber gloves, condoms...

149
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,519
We stopped using them. - When?

150
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,959
- A few weeks ago.
- We're trying to get pregnant.

151
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,257
Everything's all right.
Feel the warmth of the sun.

152
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,266
Just embrace the joy.

153
00:08:56,436 --> 00:09:00,305
- Rudy's vitals and oxygen level are good.
- Is he awake now?

154
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,136
Not quite yet. But he
might be able to hear you.

155
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,835
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

156
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,452
Even before I married
Carla, we discussed it.

157
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,485
I knew it would
be a challenge...

158
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,180
but we agreed our first
priority would be Reece.

159
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,623
You took a variety of steps to be
a good parent to him, didn't you?

160
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,458
I learned to sign. I've always
been in contact with his teachers.

161
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,827
I've been volunteering
at his school.

162
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,897
And you're self-employed?

163
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,300
I run a website company
out of my home office.

164
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:35,932
- What kind of hours do you have?
- Very flexible. I make my own schedule.

165
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,738
- You ever needed to hire a babysitter?
- No.

166
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,848
- Ever have someone get him from school?
- No.

167
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,617
So you've never passed
Reece's caregiving to anyone?

168
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:49,114
- Never wanted to.
- Dr. Benton often needs help, doesn't he?

169
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,483
Objection. Outside his scope.

170
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,526
Mr. McGrath has knowledge,
can testify to what he's observed.

171
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,057
Overruled.

172
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,595
Peter has a long list of people
who pick Reece up from school.

173
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,534
His girlfriend, his sister, his niece.
They're all involved in looking after him.

174
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,369
Even Dr. Benton himself has
asked you to help him out, hasn't he?

175
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,704
Yeah. He asked me to get Reece.

176
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,579
But I don't mind. I
wanna be with him.

177
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:20,277
Did Reece ever mention where he prefers
to sleep? Your house or Dr. Benton's?

178
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,651
- He likes my place.
- Why is that?

179
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,381
He says it's his home.

180
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,121
Once the procurement teams
arrive, we'll move her to the O.R.

181
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,198
- She'll be on the ventilator?
- Yes.

182
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,892
So her heart will keep beating?

183
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,600
So she'll be alive when
you remove her organs?

184
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,736
Mr. Pruitt, your wife's brain is not
functioning at its most basic level.

185
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,738
There is no medical distinction
between brain death and cardiac death.

186
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,247
You said that the machines
are keeping her alive.

187
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:55,480
Not exactly. They're merely
keeping her organs viable.

188
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,591
Can't you just let
her die naturally?

189
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,398
To get healthy organs, we
procure while the heart's beating...

190
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,431
and there's oxygen
in the bloodstream.

191
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,598
I don't know. I don't know.

192
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,102
We never talked about this. I
know she filled out the card...

193
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,402
I understand.

194
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,112
I'm not so sure
that I can do this.

195
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,283
Why don't you take
some time with her.

196
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,784
I'll come back and
we'll talk some more.

197
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,690
Dr. Corday, pre-op's ready.

198
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,019
We're gonna wait a bit.

199
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,794
Abby? I need morphine
for a perilunate dislocation.

200
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,433
How much?

201
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,998
Get 20, just to be safe.

202
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,139
- What's the patient's name?
- Bovard.

203
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,205
I saw Nicole. They let her go?

204
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,944
- I'm sure she'll find another job.
- It's not important.

205
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,312
She might want to take it
easy now, with the baby coming.

206
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,317
She's keeping it?

207
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,817
You thought she wouldn't?

208
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,718
I don't know. It's tough
being a single mother.

209
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,953
Maybe she won't be.

210
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,094
- I need some Versed too.
- You can't be serious.

211
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,261
- She's a good person.
- You met her five minutes ago.

212
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,200
It's the right thing to do.

213
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,507
Did she ever take
a pregnancy test?

214
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,302
- Of course.
- Did you see it?

215
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,642
- I mean, in front of you?
- I trust her.

216
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,009
What exactly has she
done to deserve that?

217
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:32,050
Even if it is yours,
there's other ways to help.

218
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,487
- How much Versed?
- I'll do it.

219
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,184
- No, I'll do it.
- I said, I'll do it.

220
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:52,264
- There was bleeding inside Rudy's brain.
- How bad is it?

221
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,705
Problem's the arterial wall. If we prevent
any further hemorrhage, should be okay.

222
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,846
He's always begging to get in
the ring. I shouldn't have let him.

223
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:04,109
- This is from a pre-existing condition.
- What do you have to do?

224
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,051
The neuroradiologist can use a
catheter to mend the artery from within.

225
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,918
- And then he'll be okay?
- He should be.

226
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,255
Look, you didn't cause this, okay?
It could have happened at any time.

227
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,859
It happened when I hit him.

228
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,362
Susan, you have Curtain
2? Woman with hives?

229
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,798
- No. I've got the thyrotoxicosis.
- It's mine.

230
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,528
- Is she ready for dispo?
- No. I'm still working her up.

231
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,402
Either one of you guys ever
heard of an allergy to semen?

232
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,907
Maybe an aversion,
but not an allergy.

233
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,569
It's hundreds of proteins
that are potential antigens.

234
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,544
That your best diagnosis?

235
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,980
- It's a possibility.
- You must be desperate.

236
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,985
- This is Sean Gatney.
- My foot's stuck.

237
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,714
- You doing okay?
- His dad wouldn't let us break it.

238
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,826
- The toilet?
- It's a personal hygiene system.

239
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,053
Ugh, you're out of your mind.

240
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,731
- Dr. Weaver, right? Sandy Lopez.
- Right.

241
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,392
Good job. I hear the lady
and the baby are doing okay.

242
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,266
- Hey, Abby, I got this.
- Okay.

243
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,669
Do you need something?

244
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,072
- I was looking for Luka.
- He's with a patient.

245
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,645
- Oh.
- Do you want a cup of coffee?

246
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,450
Based on your extensive
observation of Dr. Benton and Reece...

247
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,049
how would you summarize
their relationship?

248
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,384
Peter's completely
devoted to Reece.

249
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,391
He's always focused
on what's best for him.

250
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,086
I can't imagine anyone
being a better father.

251
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,821
Thank you.

252
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,967
- Are you and Dr. Benton married?
- No.

253
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,062
- Living together?
- We've discussed it.

254
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,107
- How long have you been a couple?
- Almost three years.

255
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,741
So you didn't break up in June?

256
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,807
- It wasn't exactly a breakup...
- Then get together again two weeks ago?

257
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,781
- Are you tracking my love life?
- Objection. Argumentative.

258
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,353
- Sustained.
- Let me ask:

259
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,081
Do you consider yourself a
stable factor in Reece's life?

260
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,589
I do.

261
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,421
Can we be sure
you won't break up...

262
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:58,429
- next week or next month? Next year?
- Objection. Calls for prophecy.

263
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,365
- Goes to the stability of the home.
- Point taken. But you can answer.

264
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,604
It's my intention to be around
Peter and Reece for a long time.

265
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,831
You occasionally babysit
for Reece, don't you?

266
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,041
Quite often. We get along well.

267
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,381
There was an incident with
a piano. Could you explain?

268
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,310
- Reece hurt himself.
- Under your care.

269
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,455
- It wasn't my...
- That's the supervision Dr. Benton...

270
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,786
- entrusts his son to.
- I looked away for two seconds.

271
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,690
- When he should be looking after him.
- Are you gonna ask a question?

272
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:34,232
Counselors, let's all breathe.
Fifteen-minute recess.

273
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,370
Thanks.

274
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,134
- Is that decaf?
- No.

275
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,545
- Oh. I shouldn't have caffeine.
- Oh, right. I forgot.

276
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,315
Luka told you?

277
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,254
- Have you had a pre-natal exam yet?
- Not yet.

278
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,584
I used to work in OB. I
could do an ultrasound.

279
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,726
That's nice of you,
but I'll take care of it.

280
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,054
How do you know you're pregnant?

281
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,358
Thanks for the coffee.

282
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,228
This is not the way to get Luka.

283
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,737
- What are you talking about?
- The truth.

284
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,843
- What happened to your father?
- He killed himself when I was little.

285
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:24,382
And then, miraculously, he came back
to life so he could kick you out at 16?

286
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,918
- Is this funny to you?
- No. I'm just trying to figure it out.

287
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,216
You haven't told anyone
the same story twice.

288
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,760
My mother re-married and my
stepfather didn't want me around.

289
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,362
Okay. I guess you have
an answer for everything.

290
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,696
- I guess everything's your business.
- I don't want to see him hurt.

291
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,838
Maybe you don't
want to see him happy.

292
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,044
I know what won't
make him happy.

293
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,141
A made-up life.

294
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:58,079
You know, if this is all for
real, that's great. Go for it.

295
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,415
But if it's not, he's gonna
figure it out. He's not stupid.

296
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:11,386
- I never got a chance to thank you for...
- Saving your life?

297
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,465
Yeah, that.

298
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,501
It was no sweat. It
was a crazy night.

299
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,729
It's a pretty crazy job.

300
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,500
I haven't met too
many female firefighters.

301
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,905
Only one in Company B.

302
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:28,138
- Must be pretty challenging.
- No, not really. I'm just one of the guys.

303
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,413
- Anyway, I'll see you around.
- Did you get a wound check?

304
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,851
- Hm?
- Your hand.

305
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,684
Oh. Uh...

306
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,518
I don't like doctors.

307
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:44,130
- Let me take a look at it before you go.
- Maybe some other time.

308
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,797
- What happened?
- Rudy dropped his sats. BP is 230/120.

309
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,303
- Pulse ox, 78/15.
- He stopped breathing.

310
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,101
- One of Pavulon, 100 of sux.
- What's going on?

311
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,301
Check the fundi.

312
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,274
- There's pressure in his brain.
- What are you gonna do?

313
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,178
- We'll help him breathe first.
- Multifocal PVCs.

314
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,851
- Dr. Greene?
- Push another 100 of lidocaine.

315
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,616
- It's Rachel.
- Can't talk. Start Nipride at 70 mics.

316
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,852
- She said you told her to check in.
- Elizabeth will be home at 6.

317
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,797
- I'm in. Lily, another 60 of nimodipine.
- I'll get it.

318
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,335
- Looks like V-tach.
- Oh, God.

319
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,667
No pulse. Charge to
200. Start compressions.

320
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,375
- Ever try a non-heart-beating protocol?
- I observed one at Case Western.

321
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:36,312
They go to the O.R., turn off the vent,
and wait for the heart to stop beating.

322
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,542
Meanwhile, lack of
oxygen can ruin the organs.

323
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,313
You remove them after only
two minutes of cardiac arrest.

324
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,680
They'll be viable and
she'll get a natural death.

325
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,324
She's dead either way.

326
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,858
This approach
compromises the transplant.

327
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,724
It's the only approach the
husband will consent to.

328
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,259
You know that for a fact?

329
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,561
- You presented this to
Mr. Pruitt? NICOLE: Luka?

330
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,538
- I suggested it as an option.
- Without consulting me?

331
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,198
She's my patient too.

332
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,054
You're not the one who needs
approval for an unconventional procedure.

333
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,479
Nor are you going
to have to do it.

334
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,352
- Can you take a break?
- Yeah.

335
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:18,217
- Is there anyone in Exam 4?
- The middle bed's free.

336
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,087
I don't wanna tie up a monitor.

337
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,390
- Hey, do I have to keep this in my arm?
- Yeah. You might need emergency meds.

338
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:28,694
- What if someone comes in?
- These doors lock from the inside.

339
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,235
- Oh, my God.
- Is that what I think it is?

340
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,073
Just give me one second.

341
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,937
- Wasn't this guy going to the morgue?
- Yeah, I was just about to.

342
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,543
<i>Get him out.</i>

343
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,703
We need epi in here.
- How many amps?

344
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,873
- As much as you can carry.
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

345
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,076
No. It'll be fine.

346
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,249
Charge to 360. GREENE: Clear.

347
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,755
Asystole. GREENE: How
long has he been down?

348
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,792
- Forty-five minutes.
- Resume compressions.

349
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,827
- How much epi?
- Push another 4 milligrams.

350
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,966
How much longer are we going?
- I'm gonna bring them in.

351
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,602
- You're calling it?
- Not yet.

352
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:12,434
- Rudy hasn't had a heartbeat for an hour.
- How could this happen?

353
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,843
- He had a massive hemorrhage.
- No.

354
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,583
He damaged the part of his brain
that controls his heart and breathing.

355
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,348
- You said they could fix it.
- There wasn't enough time.

356
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,548
Keep trying, please.

357
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:29,119
We've shocked him repeatedly.
We've used every drug.

358
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,560
Nothing is working.

359
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,128
Do you want to say
goodbye before we stop?

360
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,442
You fought hard, Rudy.

361
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,781
You never gave up.

362
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,191
I'm proud of you.

363
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,895
- We'll never forget you.
- Shut up.

364
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,159
We love you, <i>mijo.</i>

365
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,204
- You'll always be in our hearts.
- Shut up! Shut up!

366
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,910
Can you hear me? Can
you hear me? Shut up!

367
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,638
Shut up!

368
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,822
Just let us know when
you want us to stop.

369
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,598
I hope it snows. I'd like to
see the city covered in white.

370
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,768
Yeah, it's pretty...

371
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,073
until your car won't start.

372
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,012
Maybe I can get a job
shoveling sidewalks.

373
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,581
It might be good if you
don't work for a while.

374
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,588
Take care of yourself, the baby.

375
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,684
I need to work.

376
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,895
You don't need to
worry about the rent.

377
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,332
I talked to my friend.
I think I found a job.

378
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,001
Wow. That was quick.

379
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,830
He's opening a café in Montreal.

380
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,941
He wants me to help run it.

381
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,375
I can't move to Montreal.

382
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:31,982
You've been very generous.
I'm thankful for everything.

383
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,450
So...

384
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:38,823
what are you saying, that's
it? You could leave like that?

385
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,459
Listen, my shift's over at 7.
Let's talk about this tonight.

386
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,522
I'll call you in a few days.

387
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,029
- Are you angry with me?
- No, of course not.

388
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,696
- Do you think I'm angry with you?
- I hope not.

389
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,702
Then why? I thought
we both felt the same.

390
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,979
You're a good person. But you
talked yourself into loving me.

391
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,343
This isn't real.

392
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,978
I'll leave the key inside.

393
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,224
I made an OB
appointment for Friday.

394
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,987
- It's not necessary.
- It is.

395
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,357
No, it's not. I'm not pregnant.

396
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,230
I felt safe for the first
time in a long time.

397
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,341
I didn't wanna lose you.

398
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,704
So I made it up, Luka.

399
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:37,115
I'm sorry. I made it all up.

400
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,849
- We need two layers.
- Do you know how to bury the knot?

401
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,221
Take your first bite in the
center, deep, then come up.

402
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,029
- You hear something?
- Three knots.

403
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,597
- I hear banging.
- What's that noise?

404
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,095
- I think they're working on the pipes.
- Oh, that don't sound like pipes.

405
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,933
- You got this?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

406
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,870
- Who's in there?
- My allergy patient.

407
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,806
- The lady with hives?
- And her husband.

408
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,206
You're tying up a room
so they can have sex?

409
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,407
- I'm conducting a clinical trial.
- Send them to an allergist.

410
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,985
No. That'll take weeks.
They're young. They're aroused.

411
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,716
- They want their answer now.
- Weaver know you're running a brothel?

412
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,621
It's not a brothel
if they're married.

413
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,661
- Dr. Lewis, lab's back on Escalona.
- I didn't order any labs.

414
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,661
- Rudy? Kid arrested?
- I had the brother.

415
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,891
That's mine.

416
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,231
It wasn't your fault. Things
happen. You can't explain it.

417
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,135
- Did Rudy ever take any stimulants?
- I'd never let him do that.

418
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,607
- There was Ephedra in his bloodstream.
- Ephedra?

419
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,246
A natural supplement.
It's in power formulas.

420
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,076
- He drinks Beta-Morph sometimes.
- From where?

421
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,980
From the store. He wanted
a six-pack before we sparred.

422
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,987
- He said he wanted to dust me for once.
- The Ephedra probably raised his BP...

423
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,489
causing a vessel in
his brain to rupture.

424
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,125
- Why would he do it?
- To enhance his performance.

425
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,094
- He wanted to make you proud, Dad.
- You knew about this?

426
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,496
- He was never tough enough for you.
- Why didn't you stop him?

427
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,194
You kept pushing him. You never let up!
- Calm down.

428
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,931
- No! He was just a kid!
- He wanted to be a champ!

429
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,769
No! That's what you wanted!

430
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:13,208
- It's over! I'm through!
- This is not how to honor your brother!

431
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,781
- It's my choice! It's not your choice!
- You were born with a gift!

432
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,350
- Come on, Jorge.
- No! Here's your gift!

433
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,685
Here's your gift!

434
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,295
Man, he's spinning
everything his way.

435
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,057
- We'll get it all back on your testimony.
- Hey.

436
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,461
Hey. Everything all right?

437
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,229
Yeah. I just couldn't sit at home,
not knowing what was going on.

438
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,964
- We're just getting started.
- You testify yet?

439
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,735
- No. Roger went first.
- What'd he say?

440
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,535
That I was the
world's greatest father.

441
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,813
Peter.

442
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:53,919
He made it seem like I ask him
to help out with Reece all the time.

443
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,480
- He lied.
- It's his version of the truth.

444
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,752
Isn't that perjury? Isn't
there something you can do?

445
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,486
- Jackie!
- Why are you lying?

446
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,187
- Jackie?
- Leave us alone.

447
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,004
- Jackie, don't.
- Get away from me.

448
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,285
Wait a minute. Stop
it and tell the truth.

449
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:10,309
Ma'am, step away.

450
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:13,338
Jackie, you're not helping.
- Get your own family!

451
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,373
He got us here. It's his choice.

452
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,273
Reece is our boy! He's our boy!

453
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,921
- What are you doing?
- Getting caught up on my charts.

454
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,587
You were listening. You were.
You were listening to them have sex.

455
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,758
- I am not.
- You usually chart in the lounge.

456
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,267
I can chart wherever I want.

457
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,463
And I don't need to listen to
your porno patients for kicks.

458
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,943
- They stopped.
- See? You were listening.

459
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,877
Do you think she's okay?
You think we should check?

460
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,245
- What's going on in there?
- Ask Carter.

461
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,493
- You broke your fifth metacarpal.
- Damn.

462
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,791
Hey, that's what they
call a boxer's fracture.

463
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,130
- You're gonna be in a cast for six weeks.
- Good.

464
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,965
Dr. Greene, teenager
with a 10-foot fall coming in.

465
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,405
- Get Carter. Clear Trauma 1.
- You want me on that?

466
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,602
Numb him up first.
Hematoma block.

467
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,575
- Does my dad know?
- Not yet.

468
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,317
It'd be better coming from you.

469
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,093
Listen, Jorge...

470
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,492
everyone has a hard
time talking to their dad.

471
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,600
It's different with him. He's
old school. He grew up in Cuba.

472
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:49,962
When did he come over?

473
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,928
Before I was born.

474
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,003
He was a great fighter.

475
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,668
When he tried to leave,
they broke his hands.

476
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,445
That's why he
pushes you so hard.

477
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,174
Yeah.

478
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,851
I guess he just wants us to have
what they took away from him.

479
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,648
You ever talk to him about this?

480
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,294
Well, maybe you should.

481
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,994
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Maybe you just need a break.

482
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,798
- He never had a problem finishing.
- That dead guy freaked me.

483
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,170
You need to use condoms until
you can try again under supervision.

484
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,335
- I never used to be allergic to sperm.
- It's the semen, actually.

485
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:37,347
- Oh. What would cause that?
- Sometimes multiple sex partners.

486
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,815
Have you had more than 10?

487
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,845
- Ten?
- Let's go, honey.

488
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,354
I thought it was just me
and Kenny Markowitz.

489
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,425
What else haven't you told me?

490
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,425
Good job there.
It's very diplomatic.

491
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,759
- It was your diagnosis.
- No. I bring people together, Susan.

492
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,765
- You and Cupid.
- Sixteen-year-old male, fell from a post.

493
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,163
Carter?

494
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,329
- Good vitals. No LOC.
- He's got an obvious ankle fracture.

495
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,270
- No meds, no allergies. CARTER:
Okay, everybody, on my count.

496
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,002
One, two and three.

497
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,670
- Pulse ox, 99 on two liters.
- You got any pain here?

498
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,679
- I'm fine.
- Turn your head towards me.

499
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,049
- Need any help?
- Yeah, can you doppler the foot?

500
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,818
- You got it.
- Okay if I cuff him?

501
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,013
Do it on the right side.
Turn away from me.

502
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,851
- BP's 124/78.
- Does that hurt?

503
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,050
- No.
- Neck's clear. Get him off the board.

504
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,457
- Bounding <i>dorsalis pedis.</i>
- Go.

505
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,894
- What's he in custody for?
- Stealing street signs.

506
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,533
- Anybody else hurt?
- Girl's fine. She's in the car.

507
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,602
- Okay, we're gonna sit you up now.
- What's your name?

508
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,633
Andrew.

509
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,538
Don't I know you?

510
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,039
- Is that your daughter?
- She's not under arrest?

511
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,545
No. Situations like this...

512
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,912
we like to scare them a little.
Take them down, call their parents.

513
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,576
- Will they release her to me?
- I'll call the sergeant.

514
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,780
- I appreciate that.
- Got a phone I can use?

515
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,085
I adjusted her meds. Have the
nurse call if she has any questions.

516
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,593
- Sandy.
- Still got time for a wound check?

517
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:01,723
- I thought you had to leave AMA.
- I jammed it rolling some hose.

518
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,493
- Still bleeding?
- I don't think so.

519
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,661
All right. Let's take a look.

520
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,806
What happens
when you're on call?

521
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,100
We work 12-hour shifts.

522
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,842
- Seven a.m. to 7 p.m.?
- Half the time.

523
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,106
- And the other half you work overnight?
- There's always a surgeon in-house.

524
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,012
- So you cover weekends too?
- Sometimes.

525
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,916
It appears that over half your
shifts are weekends or overnights.

526
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,250
- I'd have to check.
- Tell me what happens...

527
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,620
when a gunshot
victim enters the ER.

528
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:32,360
I evaluate the patient and I take
them to the O.R. if necessary.

529
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,426
Gunshot to the chest. How
long an operation is that?

530
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,530
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

531
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:40,195
The path of the bullet,
extent of vascular damage...

532
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,137
if bypass is necessary
for cardiac repair.

533
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,474
So it could take over an hour?

534
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,780
- Three hours is a reasonable estimate.
- Sometimes longer? Five hours?

535
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,010
- Sometimes.
- If a patient comes in at 6:30 p.m...

536
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,382
who takes over for
you when you go home?

537
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:59,851
- I try to get someone to cover for me.
- And if you can't?

538
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,551
Then I stay with the patient.

539
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,955
If an operation takes five hours,
you'll be there until midnight?

540
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,790
That's a rare situation.

541
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,398
- But it happens.
- It's possible.

542
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,142
When you're tied up in surgery all
night, who's looking after Reece?

543
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,710
I have the support
of family and friends.

544
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,807
- Like Dr. Finch, for example.
- Yes.

545
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,083
Cleo is very good with Reece.

546
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,015
Yes, we've already covered
that. Who else helps you out?

547
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,681
My sister, Jackie, picks
him up from school.

548
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,825
- And makes him dinner?
- Sometimes.

549
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,018
- Puts him to bed while you're working?
- That's right.

550
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,220
Is she always available?

551
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,598
Jackie's been like a mother to
Reece these last few months.

552
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:46,228
But initially, after Carla died, she
wasn't so receptive to the idea, was she?

553
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,273
- It was a tough time.
- She has her own children, doesn't she?

554
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:50,937
Joanie, her daughter.

555
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,208
Wasn't there a boy?

556
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,871
Yeah. Jesse, my nephew.

557
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,913
- He died last year.
- The death was gang-related, right?

558
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,912
- Objection.
- He can answer the question.

559
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,414
Yes.

560
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,085
How is your sister
handling that loss?

561
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,696
You know, I'm sorry. I don't...

562
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,523
I don't see how this pertains
to my fitness as a father.

563
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,190
Your Honor, this is far afield.

564
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,736
Goes to the stability of the person
he's identified as primary caregiver.

565
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,305
I'll give some latitude.

566
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,771
Is Jackie under the
care of a psychiatrist?

567
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:27,574
- I don't know.
- For depression and pathologic grieving?

568
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:31,205
- She lost her son.
- Is she currently managed by medication?

569
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,284
This has nothing
to do with Reece.

570
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:37,321
Whose side effects include
insomnia, sedation and anxiety?

571
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,983
Why don't you ask me
what kind of father I am.

572
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,560
Ask me about how I was there
when he was born prematurely.

573
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,391
How I stayed in the
hospital, watching over him...

574
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:50,002
making tough decisions and praying
over him day and night. Ask me that.

575
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:54,299
- Your Honor, a moment with my client?
- There's no question before the court.

576
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,341
No! Why don't you ask me
about Reece, so I can tell you...

577
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:02,003
there's nothing more important to me
in this world than my son. Ask me that!

578
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,426
- That can't happen again.
- They were provoking him.

579
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,827
- Get used to it, Peter.
- I said what I had to say.

580
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,990
I hope you feel better.
It sure didn't help.

581
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,195
- What did the judge say in chambers?
- He's impressed with Roger's availability.

582
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,340
- Availability?
- I'm available to Reece.

583
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,033
- We'll have to do better.
- I'll do better tomorrow.

584
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,373
That's not gonna do it.
Your hours are hurting us.

585
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,378
- He's a surgeon.
- It goes with the job.

586
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,881
- Do you wanna keep your son?
- What do you think?

587
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,781
That you need to start setting
priorities and making some hard choices.

588
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,947
That's what I think.

589
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,157
How well do you know Andrew?

590
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,794
What's that supposed to mean?

591
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,833
Does he do drugs?

592
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,966
- I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

593
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,605
- What's this?
- Results of his tox screen.

594
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,010
He tested positive
for marijuana.

595
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,917
Aren't you supposed to
keep that confidential?

596
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,077
- Were you smoking with him?
- No.

597
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,349
- Have you ever smoked with him?
- I wouldn't do that.

598
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,425
Good. Then you'll test negative.

599
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,859
Are you serious?

600
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,868
- You don't trust me?
- I trusted you to go home after school.

601
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:35,303
Dad, he was gonna drop me
off, but then he wanted to stop.

602
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,237
We agreed no rides.

603
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,537
- I missed the bus.
- You should have called me.

604
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,210
I didn't wanna bother you.

605
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,884
It sure didn't
work out that way.

606
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,617
- You want me to pee in a cup?
- Yep.

607
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:57,092
Yes, a gram of Ceftazidime. Did
the family choose a mortuary yet?

608
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:01,666
Rudy Escalona. We need to get him
to the morgue. Not the ICU. The ER.

609
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,395
- Do you need me to do something?
- Ask Frank for the decedent packet.

610
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,273
Luka?

611
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,433
You weren't here, so I
gave Collins the gent first.

612
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,010
Thanks.

613
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,146
I had to go out.

614
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,240
- Everything okay?
- She's leaving town.

615
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,109
- Why?
- I don't know.

616
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,812
Dr. Kovac, Exam
4's vomiting blood.

617
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,355
What about the baby?

618
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,491
There is no baby.

619
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,432
I started another line on Zahler.
Did you have a written order?

620
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,033
It was right up there.

621
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,295
Why was Abby about to
discharge my bowel obstruction?

622
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,495
I have no idea.

623
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,800
Because you can't
write between the lines.

624
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,308
Carter, is this one yours?
25-year-old. Severe allergic reaction.

625
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,447
- Mrs. Urman? PARAMEDIC:
Gave her 50 of Benadryl.

626
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,548
- What happened?
- I guess you were right.

627
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,308
- We followed our bliss.
- Where?

628
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,611
Our pickup truck.

629
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:56,152
We thought we'd be
safe by the hospital.

630
00:35:56,321 --> 00:36:00,019
- I'll get her started. 300 of cimetidine.
- I will be right there.

631
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,629
- That's a very nice suit.
- Thanks. I was in court all day.

632
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,127
- A patient?
- No.

633
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,390
- Something wrong?
- No. Everything's cool.

634
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,160
Dr. Benton, they
need you in the O.R.

635
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,631
Mr. Escalona.

636
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:21,011
If you'd like, the nurse said we could
make arrangements for the funeral home.

637
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,415
We used Rose Hills
when his mother died.

638
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,653
But I never thought that...

639
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,184
He was a good kid.

640
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,826
He made everybody smile.

641
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,562
Jorge...

642
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,362
he was the serious one.

643
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,732
I didn't mean to lose my temper.

644
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,539
It's been a hard day, you know?

645
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,674
He doesn't wanna see me.

646
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,244
He doesn't understand.

647
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,851
You should give him a shot.

648
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,684
You know, he might surprise you.

649
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:46,896
Sorry to be brief, but my
nanny gets off in six minutes.

650
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:51,400
Diane Pruitt, GSW to the head.
The transplant teams are flying in.

651
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,798
Gas station robbery?

652
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,406
Yes. Romano's agreed to a
non-heart-beating protocol.

653
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,475
- When did we start doing that?
- Today, apparently.

654
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,308
That's the husband. If you could
review the procedure with him?

655
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,249
- He's already consented, right?
- Of course.

656
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,352
- So, what is there to talk about?
- He needs some reassurance.

657
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,751
You've had him for 12
hours. You deal with him.

658
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,790
He wants to talk to
the operating surgeon.

659
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,157
Peter, what's the matter?

660
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,923
Nothing. Go home.

661
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,594
Mr. Pruitt?

662
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,635
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton. I'll be
coordinating the procedure.

663
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,798
As soon as the out-of-state team
gets here, we'll take her to the O.R.

664
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,911
I tried to explain it to
her, but she's too young.

665
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,613
I don't know how I'm
gonna do this by myself.

666
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,651
You're gonna do
the best you can.

667
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,689
You're supposed
to be on light duty.

668
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:49,021
- I was moving some gear.
- Yeah. You went on the run.

669
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,028
I get a little stir-crazy.

670
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,496
Okay.

671
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,795
- Looks pretty good. No sign of infection.
- That's it?

672
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,470
No, you need a new bandage.

673
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,705
So is...

674
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:12,643
- Captain Devlin still at the seven-five?
- I know that name.

675
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:17,846
Those guys used to hang out at
a place called Moose and Squirrel.

676
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,752
Yeah. Every Friday night.

677
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,359
That was a fun place.

678
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:27,388
You should have someone
remove the stitches in four days.

679
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,195
I know where to find you.

680
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,934
Listen, Sandy...

681
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,770
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I bunched it up.

682
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,208
That's all right. What
were you saying?

683
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,944
Do you wanna do something?

684
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,645
Excuse me?

685
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,080
Sometime? You know, something?

686
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,050
Something?

687
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,916
Lunch or a movie...

688
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,685
or ice-fishing.

689
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,063
- Like, go out?
- Yeah.

690
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,031
I mean, unless I'm
totally off base here.

691
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,902
No.

692
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,868
No, you're on base.

693
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,872
How's it going?

694
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,571
Fine.

695
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,446
Your drug screen came back.

696
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,586
Everything was negative.

697
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,752
Don't look so disappointed.

698
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,261
I know you're upset.

699
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:37,394
But I had to do this because
I want you to be safe.

700
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:43,265
I care more about that than
about you being angry with me.

701
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,306
I wanna be able to trust you.

702
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,579
It's something we
both have to work at.

703
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,547
Can I go now?

704
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,452
- Is the recipient ready?
- All I need's a liver.

705
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,528
- The heart team gets first crack.
- Tell them to make it snappy.

706
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,133
Sternal saw's up.

707
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,463
Open the O Dexon.
Atraumatic needle.

708
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,798
- All set?
- Good to go.

709
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,306
After two minutes of cardiac
arrest, we'll begin procurement.

710
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,808
- How's her oxygenation?
- Satting at 100 percent.

711
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,776
Good. Turn it off.

712
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,110
Respiratory support
discontinued at 20:37.

713
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,548
They're sweet. I hope
they get pregnant.

714
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:34,693
Shouldn't be a problem. The
endocrinologist can wash the sperm...

715
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,466
then it's safe to
artificially inseminate.

716
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,626
That's a new one.

717
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,664
Just goes to teach you
never to doubt my diagnoses.

718
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,359
Yeah. No matter
how loony they are.

719
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,869
I can't believe they did it in
the back of a pickup truck.

720
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,031
- They had a camper shell.
- How do you know?

721
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,471
- I saw it.
- You did?

722
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,238
It's in the front of the hospital. It's
their honeymoon suite. Very weird.

723
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,080
Not so weird. Ferris
wheel. That's weird.

724
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,145
Really?

725
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,721
I was young. It was
my first real boyfriend.

726
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,090
- Where else?
- Your turn.

727
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,926
Camping. Where else?

728
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,393
- In a tent, that's the best you can do?
- Uh...

729
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,267
On a train to Seattle.

730
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,602
Really? With who?

731
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:26,108
I was by myself. But
it was memorable.

732
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,514
It's cold.

733
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,550
Yeah. We should probably go in.

734
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,245
Yeah.

735
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,426
Carter...

736
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,760
You don't have any allergies
I should know about, do you?

737
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,468
Oops.

738
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,670
Where were we?

739
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:04,078
- How long's it been?
- Forty-nine minutes.

740
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,944
Tissues could be
getting ischemic.

741
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:09,178
Let's send an ABG,
lytes and a lactate.

742
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,651
Who's in charge?

743
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:13,553
I ordered liver an hour ago and
haven't seen my waitress since.

744
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,454
The patient's
breathing on her own.

745
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,896
How inconsiderate.

746
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,590
Well, this could take hours.
Page me when she goes.

747
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,128
What do you want
to do, Dr. Benton?

748
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,877
Let's just wait.
