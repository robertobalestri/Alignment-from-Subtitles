1
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,254
- Sign in.
- Actually...

2
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,588
- Where are our T-sheets?
- I'm a new med student.

3
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,060
Congratulations.

4
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,892
You said that yesterday.

5
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,398
- Check in with the docs.
- Okay, thanks.

6
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,800
- Do you guys have a lost-and-found box?
- Somebody stole it.

7
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,433
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you Dr. Carter?

8
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,909
Lewis. I don't think he's in yet. And
I'm not old enough to be a ma'am.

9
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,572
- I'm supposed to meet him around 8.
- You're a tad early.

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,584
Yeah, it's my first day. I
guess I was a little excited.

11
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,813
You'll get over it.

12
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,584
So Mr. Hopper, what
seems to be the problem?

13
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,389
I can't eat. I can't sleep. I
just don't feel like myself.

14
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,931
- How long has this been going on?
- A few weeks.

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,998
Any stress? Family? Work?

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,629
All my problems started when I
met this girl at an after-hours bar.

17
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,470
- She bit me.
- She bit you where?

18
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,134
In the alley outside the club...

19
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:21,612
- No, where on your body?
- My neck.

20
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,618
I'm pretty sure
she was a vampire.

21
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,181
That's a hickey.

22
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,822
- Is that a zygoma fracture?
- Maybe.

23
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,356
- Are you Dr. Carter?
- Nope, Greene.

24
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,790
I'm Michael Gallant. I'm
supposed to be meeting Dr. Carter.

25
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,863
You found the ER.
That's half the battle.

26
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,465
- You called for surgical consult!
- I changed my mind.

27
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,092
- After I got down here.
- He has rectal pain. Probably prostatitis.

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,829
That's why I need
to examine him.

29
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,634
If it is an appy, he's probably
going to need surgery.

30
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,606
Need a second opinion? - Nope.

31
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,144
Yes! He has a 22-year-old
male with right-sided tenderness.

32
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,475
Who also says it
burns when he pees.

33
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,948
What's his urine and white count?
- Still waiting.

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,314
Usually you won't even
come till labs are back.

35
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,979
Fine. When it bursts,
you can operate.

36
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,886
- Hey, Dr. Carter?
- Kovac.

37
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,958
- Dr. Kovac. GREENE:
Hold on. Elizabeth!

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,186
- What's going on?
- Isn't it obvious?

39
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,332
- No.
- He calls for a surgical consult...

40
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,161
then changes his mind
the moment he sees it's me!

41
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,326
That's a bit egocentric,
don't you think?

42
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,701
- They're afraid to have me treat patients.
- You're being paranoid.

43
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,501
Am I?

44
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,400
Excuse me. Excuse me. Do
you know where Dr. Carter is?

45
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,239
He should be here
in a few minutes.

46
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,382
If you say where he
is, I could find him.

47
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,846
I don't know. Sorry.

48
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,384
How come there aren't any doughnuts?
- No petty cash.

49
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,350
There was 50 bucks
in there yesterday.

50
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,889
I need a psych consult. My
patient thinks he's a vampire.

51
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,493
Count Fred? Where is he?

52
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,560
- Exam 2.
- Is there a nurse in with him?

53
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,494
- No, why?
- He's a vampire.

54
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,226
- What do you mean?
- I mean, he drinks people's blood.

55
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,234
You're kidding, right?

56
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,668
That's nasty.

57
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,427
But I volunteered to drive to the
Royal Botanical Gardens fundraiser.

58
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,125
I'm sorry, but there's just
not much I can do about it.

59
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,236
You can stop lying to me.

60
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,339
- Good morning.
- Dr. Carter.

61
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,601
- Did I miss something?
- Yes, breakfast.

62
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,576
Your grandmother's upset
because the Jaguar's being serviced.

63
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,976
For a week!

64
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,913
- What's wrong with it?
- Yes, Alger. What's wrong with it?

65
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,110
- They're waiting for a part.
- What part?

66
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,314
- The ignition coil.
- Liar. He's holding me hostage.

67
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:21,826
- What's the matter with the Town Car?
- I don't drive the Town Car.

68
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,658
You shouldn't be driving
anyway. That's why we have Alger.

69
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,300
Having a driver was
your grandfather's idea.

70
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:31,336
Now that he's gone, it seems
an unnecessary expense.

71
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:36,500
- He's just trying to look out for you.
- I'm a big girl. I don't need a chaperone.

72
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,169
Oh, John, are you still
planning to come with me to...?

73
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,016
Gamma! Gamma?

74
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,518
- Nurses do most of the triaging, right?
- Right.

75
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,747
So maybe you could
sneak me some minor cases.

76
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,654
Maybe you could sit down...

77
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,161
read your orientation
kit, and wait for Dr. Carter.

78
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,026
- What's going on?
- Teaching Nicole to take blood pressure.

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,862
- Why?
- It's part of her training.

80
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,800
- What training?
- I'm learning to be a nurse's aide.

81
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,269
Really? KOVAC: Abby?

82
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,374
No helmet. Alert at
the scene. GCS-14.

83
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,135
- Any blood loss or seizure?
- No.

84
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,779
Okay, let's get him in
Trauma 1. Nicole, come on.

85
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:16,212
- Me?
- Yeah, it'll be good for you to watch.

86
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,820
Must've taken a header
off the skateboard.

87
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,354
Bad scalp lac, hematoma,
right peritemporal.

88
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,492
Abby, show Nicole
how to take a pulse ox.

89
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,157
Uh, put some gloves on.

90
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,036
- Can I watch?
- Why don't we sell tickets?

91
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,900
- You a med student?
- Michael Gallant.

92
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,540
- Dr. Finch.
- Nice to meet you.

93
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,643
- Road rash all the way down the chest.
- Big abdominal bruise.

94
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,336
- Unh!
- BP's 90 over 60. Pulse, 115.

95
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,073
Full trauma panel, lateral
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

96
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,081
Jeremy, do you
remember what happened?

97
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,777
Right pupil is sluggish,
slightly larger than the left.

98
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,388
18 gauge in the right AC.

99
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,820
- What's his pulse ox?
- I can't get it.

100
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,149
Abby?

101
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,623
Make sure the fingernail
has contact with that red light.

102
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,864
No CSF or blood from the ears.

103
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,629
100 of fentanyl and page
Benton and Neurosurg.

104
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,773
Read the number
off of this monitor.

105
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,135
Decreased breath
sounds on the right.

106
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,334
- 78.
- What?

107
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,849
Pulse ox is 78 on 15 liters.

108
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,149
Okay. Good job.

109
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,452
- What do you think?
- Hyper-resonant on the right.

110
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,786
Decreased breath sounds,
low sats, hypotension.

111
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,518
Tension pneumothorax, right?

112
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,987
Yeah.

113
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,331
I had a fainting spell,
John. It happens.

114
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,868
But it shouldn't happen.

115
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:48,133
In my day, it was quite
acceptable for a lady to swoon.

116
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,210
- There's a med student looking for you.
- I'm a little busy.

117
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,212
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Carter.
- Hello.

118
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:58,113
Hi, Evan. Your mother's on her way.
She found your inhaler in the laundry.

119
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,380
Gam, will you sit up for me, put
your legs over the end of the bed?

120
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,284
Yes, John.

121
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,358
You're not gonna make
me do pushups, are...?

122
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:10,657
Gam? Gamma? Gamma?
Susan. Gamma, can you hear me?

123
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,890
John?

124
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,294
Okay. You're okay.

125
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,566
I need to step out for a
minute. I'll be right back.

126
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,245
- Checking orthostatics?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,247
- Is she anemic?
- I don't know.

128
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,248
I'm sending her
up for a tilt test.

129
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,411
She might be dehydrated,
it's probably nothing.

130
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,557
- Can I intubate?
- Maybe next time.

131
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,021
What am I looking at?

132
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,357
Teenage skateboarder, tension
pneumo on the left, with a head injury.

133
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,156
Needs a central line.

134
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,801
He's anterior. I can
see the cords. I'm in.

135
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,368
Okay, bag him, Nicole.

136
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,404
Come on. One,
two, three, squeeze.

137
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,972
He did this on a skateboard?

138
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,769
Trying a crazy stunt, no doubt.
- Good breath sounds.

139
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,912
Probably has a
depressed skull fracture.

140
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,439
That's what they used to
call a ping-pong fracture?

141
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,777
- Neurosurg is on the way.
- Pressure's dropping.

142
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,418
He's bleeding somewhere.

143
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,985
How much out in the chest tube?

144
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,054
Less than a liter.
First HemoCue is nine.

145
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,987
Let's hang the O-neg. Get
him to O.R. Has he had Dilantin?

146
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,717
Yeah. And 70 grams of mannitol.

147
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,384
What about his head?

148
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,394
- Who are you?
- Michael Gallant. You a trauma surgeon?

149
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,295
- You a med student?
- Yes, sir.

150
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:24,802
Why don't you find something to do, all
right? Let's get him ready to go. I'm in.

151
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,964
- I'll learn more here.
- You'll learn more with your eyes open...

152
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,406
- and your mouth shut, okay?
- He's got a point.

153
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,875
What about his head?

154
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,810
Won't make a difference if he bleeds
out in his chest first. Okay, let's move.

155
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,755
- You did good.
- Really? I was so scared.

156
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,984
- You get used to it.
- I don't know.

157
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,659
- You saved his life.
- Yeah, I hope so.

158
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,996
Me too. I better go back
to work. I'll see you later.

159
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,658
Okay.

160
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,603
What are you doing?

161
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,332
- What?
- What?

162
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,535
This morning she was learning to
take a BP, now she's in a trauma?

163
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,112
- Yeah, she's learning.
- To be an aide, not a nurse.

164
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,444
- I know you don't like her, but...
- That has nothing to do with this.

165
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,451
- It's inappropriate that she be in trauma.
- I just asked you to help her.

166
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,021
That's not my job, Luka.

167
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,682
Do you even realize
what I do in there?

168
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,288
You're not the only one
trying to save that kid's life.

169
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,290
- I'm gonna and scrub in.
- I'll page Neurosurg again.

170
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,799
- Dr. Benton?
- Yeah?

171
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,630
- Yeah, are you Peter Benton?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,501
Consider yourself
served. Have a nice day.

173
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,339
What was that about? Peter?

174
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,971
- I'm being subpoenaed.
- For what case?

175
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,379
Reece. Roger's
suing for custody.

176
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,485
So how extensive do you
think his brain injury is?

177
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,817
- It's too early to tell.
- How is he?

178
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,052
The skateboarder.
Is he gonna be okay?

179
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,289
- Are you his father?
- No. I'm David Hilliker. I called 911.

180
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,728
Did you see what happened?

181
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,097
Screwing around in the mall with
buddies. Looked like he hit his head.

182
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,967
- Yeah. He wasn't wearing a helmet.
- Wouldn't be cool. Don't need helmets...

183
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,735
to drive a motorcycle in
this state. Why a skateboard?

184
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,605
- You got a little limp.
- Oh, yeah.

185
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,441
I twisted it chasing him
and his buddy out of the mall.

186
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,687
You should let us
look at it. Come on.

187
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,018
Ice pack and a couple
beers, I'll be fine.

188
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,949
Sit down.

189
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,683
- We just need to change the dressing.
- But Dr. Carter usually does that.

190
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,418
I'm aware of that, but
Dr. Carter's not here right now.

191
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,029
- We'll wait.
- I don't know when he'll be in.

192
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,222
- I'm very patient.
- Look, Sister.

193
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,866
Helen.

194
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,935
- The sooner I change the bandage...
- I'm Monica.

195
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,640
The sooner you guys can get out of
here and get back to doing your stuff.

196
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,368
And, quite frankly,
I need the bed.

197
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,210
Perhaps if you told
Dr. Carter we were here?

198
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,819
- Your fans are getting restless.
- What is it with you and nuns, Carter?

199
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,251
It's almost kinky.

200
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,857
Can you take care of them?
- They want you.

201
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,425
My grandmother had a...

202
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,358
She passed out this morning.
Having Cardiology work her up.

203
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,398
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

204
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,931
- Are you?
- Me? I'm fine.

205
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,696
- Just wanna see she gets settled.
- I'll take care of it.

206
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,361
- Thank you.
- Come on, ladies.

207
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,840
Tequila Willie is still in Exam 1,
covered in puke and assorted body fluids.

208
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,844
- He's making this whole place reek.
- This place always reeks.

209
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,108
- Yeah. And it's Abby's turn.
- Oh, come on.

210
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,615
I did him last time. You're up.

211
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,081
Fine.

212
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,279
- Nicole.
- You need something?

213
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,118
Yeah, grab some gloves. I'm gonna
show you how to bathe a patient.

214
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,623
Oh.

215
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,291
Robert!

216
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,694
I was scrubbing in when I
discovered Dale's doing my Whipple.

217
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,926
He's an ass, but he's
a decent surgeon.

218
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,127
- I was back on service today.
- No, not yet.

219
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,466
Why not? I've complied with
every insulting, demeaning request.

220
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,270
- Even volunteered for a lie detector test.
- We have to wait for the CDC...

221
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,381
to finish with their bug hunt. But the
criminal investigation is essentially over.

222
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,483
- Couldn't find anything.
- What's that mean?

223
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,279
"We think you're killing your
patients, we just can't prove it."

224
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,945
If it makes you feel better,
this has nothing to do with you.

225
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,455
Then why am I not in surgery?

226
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,129
I'm sorry. I know this is frustrating. But
what choice does either one of us have?

227
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,663
Take the opportunity to
catch up with your dictation.

228
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,232
Spend time with your
baby. Enjoy the downtime.

229
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,598
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me?

230
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,329
- That's my patient.
- Drawing blood.

231
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,804
You were injecting
something into her central line.

232
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,671
I couldn't get a
draw. It's clogged.

233
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,835
- What did you inject?
- I didn't.

234
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,504
- Don't lie to me! I saw you!
- Is there a problem here?

235
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,843
- No, I was...
- Yes. She was injecting my patient.

236
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:35,648
- Urokinase to bust the clot in her line.
- Let me see it.

237
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,425
Where's the vial?

238
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,151
Elizabeth.

239
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,068
Sorry.

240
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,434
Excuse me.

241
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,539
Twenty-six years with the Chicago
P.D. Never fired my gun once.

242
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,546
That's good.

243
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,517
These are different times.

244
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,322
Try and stay off your
ankle and keep it elevated.

245
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,895
- Dr. Kovac, Jeremy's mother's here.
- Okay.

246
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,492
I'll have one of the nurses give
you a lesson on using the crutches.

247
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,573
Mrs. Norris?

248
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,679
Hi. I'm Dr. Kovac. I was the
first doctor to treat your son.

249
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,611
- How is he?
- He suffered a hemothorax.

250
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,253
That's when blood collects in the
chest cavity and collapses a lung.

251
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,912
- But it's been repaired.
- Can I see him?

252
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,253
- He's been taken up to the O.R.
- But he's gonna be okay.

253
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,122
There was evidence
of a head injury.

254
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,227
Is he in a coma?

255
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:55,095
I'm afraid we won't know until he's out
of surgery and the anesthesia wears off.

256
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,703
There's the idiot who was
chasing him, right there.

257
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,101
- Are you the boy's mother?
- What did you do?

258
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,141
- Nothing. I'm sorry...
- He threw his stick at him.

259
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,141
- What?
- You should get back in bed.

260
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,610
No, he's the one who
made Jeremy wipe out.

261
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,409
Your boy was riding in the
mall. I asked him to leave.

262
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,916
- You knocked him off his skateboard!
- I didn't!

263
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,486
You attacked my son? - No!

264
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,452
- You did! KOVAC: Can
you put him in the room?

265
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,988
- What'd you do?
- Nothing!

266
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,997
- I called the ambulance!
- Where is it?

267
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,618
Last door on the right.

268
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,660
- He hurt my son?
- I don't know, ma'am.

269
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,130
He's the reason Jeremy's here.
He should be arrested or something!

270
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,826
I just wanna see Jeremy. I
just wanna be with my son.

271
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,995
I'll get an update and find out
when you can go to see him, okay?

272
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,141
- I think he's having a heart attack!
- Good!

273
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,369
He started hyperventilating
and complaining of chest pain.

274
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,678
- What's going on, Mr. Hilliker?
- I don't feel so good.

275
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,149
- Chest hurts?
- Yeah. Head is spinning.

276
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,449
Okay, put him on oxygen,
aspirin and let's get an EKG.

277
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,357
I didn't mean to upset the mother. I
was just trying to offer my condolences.

278
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,860
Just relax.

279
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,032
He rode by me. He stole my hat.

280
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,035
He was tossing it back and forth,
threatening to throw it in the fountain.

281
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,504
- They were terrorizing the mall.
- Did you throw your nightstick at him?

282
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,344
Okay. Okay. Just relax.

283
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,919
- Dr. Zogoiby.
- Dr. Corday.

284
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,420
I've been reviewing charts...

285
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,491
and I have a question about a
patient you worked on with me.

286
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,494
- Yes?
- It was a few weeks ago. A Mrs. Taylor?

287
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,758
I'm having a little difficulty
reading your notes.

288
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,630
- You put in a central line.
- No, I was called away.

289
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,739
That was the day my son fell
off the monkey bars at school.

290
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,239
The on-call anesthesiologist
stepped in for me.

291
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,435
- And who was that?
- Babcock.

292
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,635
Babcock.

293
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,840
Hope this wasn't a waste of
time. Think this kid'll ever wake up?

294
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,075
I don't know.

295
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,913
You're scaring me. You're
not your usual jolly self today.

296
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,523
Haven't developed a drug addiction
or drinking problem like your buddies...

297
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,181
- in the ER, have you?
- No.

298
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,621
Give it time.

299
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,024
Jeremy's mother is in the waiting room.
- Great.

300
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,165
Jacy, have you tracked
down my sister yet?

301
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,425
- I left another message.
- All right. Thanks.

302
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,933
- You want me to talk to her?
- No.

303
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,593
Good.

304
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,302
Mrs. Norris.

305
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,972
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton. I'm one of
the surgeons that was with Jeremy.

306
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,380
- How is he?
- We tied off the bleeding vessels...

307
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:30,012
in the chest, but there's swelling in
the brain. He's with a neuro team now.

308
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,818
With an injury like
this, it becomes a...

309
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,725
- A waiting game.
- Waiting? To see if he wakes up?

310
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,490
Waiting to see if he's
a vegetable? What?

311
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,026
All of that.

312
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,728
They've got to be
able to do something.

313
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,770
He's all I've got.

314
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,408
Yeah.

315
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,547
- Ever gotten an erythropoietic porphyria?
- No.

316
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:58,082
- What about porphyria cutanea tarda?
- No.

317
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,413
The most unusual medical
case you've ever seen?

318
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,579
I had a guy with a live
bullfrog in his ass once.

319
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,821
Ever seen a patient scratch
through the skin into the bone?

320
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:10,225
- Are you serious?
- Figure he'll hit gray matter by spring.

321
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,865
Mr. Eldon, could you show a
young med student your itch?

322
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,056
Ooh.

323
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,428
- Save me.
- What?

324
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,695
I have a med student
who is in need of a home.

325
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,102
- Oh. No, thanks. But he seems nice.
- Oh, yeah. Of course he does.

326
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:25,075
That's how they all start, till they grow
up to become Residents like Carter.

327
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,542
I wish.

328
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,078
- What?
- "I wish"?

329
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,113
He turned into a good doctor.
- Uh-huh.

330
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,615
- He is.
- You and Carter...?

331
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:36,586
Dr. Greene, can I ask you
something? I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

332
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,052
Not at all.

333
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,386
You don't mind me asking
all these questions, do you?

334
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,792
No, of course not. This is a teaching
hospital. This is how you learn.

335
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,487
Bye.

336
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,732
Oh, hi. I was just talking about you.
How's your grandmother? What is it?

337
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,534
- Looks like Shy-Drager.
- I'm sorry.

338
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,943
They've been having a lot of success
with fludrocortisone and desmopressin.

339
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,272
- How'd she take it?
- I haven't told her yet.

340
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,417
They're still
running some tests.

341
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,553
- Anything I can do?
- I don't think so.

342
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,381
- Let me know.
- I will.

343
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,321
Carter! Dr. John Carter, this is
your new med student, Michael...

344
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,982
Gallant. CARTER: Hi.

345
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,359
Go get the orientation package,
when you're finished just come find me.

346
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,659
I did that while I was
waiting. I try to keep busy.

347
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,929
- Yeah. I had a family emergency.
- Nothing serious, I hope.

348
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,766
You wanna talk about it?

349
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,876
Okay. Well, I watched a trauma already
and helped Dr. Kovac with a possible MI.

350
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,705
Both of which were
very interesting.

351
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,973
But I was hoping that once you
got here I could start working up...

352
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,481
some of my own cases.

353
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,018
- He stepped into the men's room.
- Oh.

354
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,314
His grandmother's sick.

355
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,820
Do you want to see if we can
go find you a case to work up?

356
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,484
Yeah.

357
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,021
Kit.

358
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:57,693
I want to apologize for my behavior
earlier. It was completely unprofessional.

359
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,304
I know it's not an excuse, but I
have been under a lot of stress lately.

360
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,840
I understand.

361
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,640
That said, I also have a couple of
questions about some recent cases.

362
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,977
- Do you remember a Mr. Durning?
- Diverticulitis?

363
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,178
No, he was an elderly gentleman, came
in for a hemicolectomy for colon cancer.

364
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,653
- With all the faded Navy tattoos.
- Yes, yes.

365
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,349
You took out his central
line on October the 16th.

366
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:25,829
Yes. Well, no. It came out on the
16th. But we didn't do it. Babcock did.

367
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,756
Babcock?

368
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,933
- Why Babcock?
- I don't know. He just did.

369
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:34,506
Sometimes he likes to pull his own lines.
In fact, occasionally he insists on it.

370
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,706
So Mrs. Reynolds, how
long have you had the spots?

371
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,006
- About a week.
- I gave her some penicillin.

372
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,172
- Oh, for what?
- I got a cold.

373
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,614
Cough, sore throat, headaches.

374
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,811
Hmm. Yeah,
antibiotics won't help.

375
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,252
- I told you.
- Where'd you get the penicillin?

376
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,018
The medicine cabinet. Left
over from an ear infection.

377
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,593
Oh, yeah, you should
never share prescriptions.

378
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,070
If you're given one,
try to use all of it.

379
00:19:58,094 --> 00:19:58,890
What's wrong?

380
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:03,435
She's experiencing hypersensitivity
vasculitis. It's from the antibiotics.

381
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,537
Thank you, Dr. Kevorkian.

382
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,230
- Is it treatable?
- Absolutely.

383
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,810
We'll get some medicine for you
and have you feeling as good as new.

384
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,946
- You might wanna get a CBC.
- I beg your pardon?

385
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,317
Her history. It could be indicative
of undiagnosed thrombocytopenia.

386
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,152
- You know, low platelets.
- And you are...?

387
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,817
Grace. I'm a
second-year med student.

388
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:32,197
Ask if she has any unusual
bleeding when she brushes her teeth.

389
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,663
- Are you a med student at this hospital?
- No.

390
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,531
I'd appreciate it if you kept
your comments to yourself.

391
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,932
Hello.

392
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,097
- Is he your student?
- Excuse me?

393
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,835
She's a second-year med student
who thinks she can diagnose my patients.

394
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,842
He takes a lousy history.

395
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,073
I will bet your lunch money
she's got thrombocytopenia.

396
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,343
She's right. Low platelets.

397
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,716
Needs additional labs,
head CT and admission.

398
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,853
I'll take care of it.

399
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,285
You're welcome.

400
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,121
So do you do self-diagnosis too?

401
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,123
As a matter of fact, I do. I've
let myself get a little rundown...

402
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,530
and I can feel the flu coming
on. I can't afford to be sick now.

403
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,295
I was hoping you'd get me
a little Relenza or Tamiflu.

404
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,440
We can manage that.
What school are you in?

405
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,634
Western and Binville. I'm getting
my law degree simultaneously.

406
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,278
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

407
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,346
My parents didn't want
me to go to med school.

408
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,449
I know that feeling.

409
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,221
Excuse me. Can you get a head
CT for Mrs. Reynolds in Curtain 2?

410
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,289
I'm not a nurse. I'm
just training. I'm sorry.

411
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,949
That's okay. I'm sort
of in training myself.

412
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,891
- I'm a new med student, Michael.
- Nicole.

413
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,896
- How are you doing?
- Oh, okay.

414
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,557
- Everybody helping you?
- Abby showed me how to bathe...

415
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,864
- a homeless man. It was a little...
- She's busy. Stick with Malik and Haleh.

416
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,372
- Is this Mr. Hilliker's 12-lead?
- Yeah.

417
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,033
- Did he have an MI?
- No.

418
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,573
Probably an anxiety attack.
Want to give him the news?

419
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,648
- Can I?
- Yeah. I've got a trauma coming in.

420
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,514
We're gonna need some IV
saline. It's in the suture room.

421
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,915
Okay.

422
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,387
- It can get a little crazy here.
- Yeah, I know. It's only my first day.

423
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,322
- Are you liking it?
- So far, so good.

424
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,688
Oh.

425
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:15,396
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Go and get somebody!

426
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,304
Take a breath, Mr. Hilliker.
Somebody help me!

427
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,418
Somebody help me!

428
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,823
Hang on. Hang on.

429
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,908
Hey, Gam. Sorry
this is taking so long.

430
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,577
- Did you get some lunch?
- No. I didn't get anything.

431
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,241
That cardiologist has
never been back to see me.

432
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,944
Yeah. It's because I
asked to speak to you first.

433
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,655
Why?

434
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,025
It's the least I can do, since
you've been stuck here all day.

435
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,823
John, don't beat
around the bush.

436
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,668
You have what's called
Shy-Drager Syndrome.

437
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,670
It's a progressive disease that
affects your blood pressure...

438
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,274
and could put you at a greater
risk for a heart attack or stroke.

439
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,177
Is it gonna kill me?

440
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,975
Most people die within 10 years.

441
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:43,949
Ten years? I'm not even sure I
want to be around 10 more years.

442
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:47,719
Ten days, now, that might
have put a kink in my plans.

443
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,055
- Gam...
- Can I go home?

444
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:57,302
- I think they want you to stay overnight.
- John, I want to go home.

445
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,833
- You on a break?
- No.

446
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,436
- Can I get you a coffee?
- No, thanks.

447
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,502
Do you want to talk?

448
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,581
Is he going to die?

449
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,075
The guy that hung himself? No.

450
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:51,952
Well, not today. He's lucky you
and that med student walked in.

451
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,353
Try not to let it
upset you too much.

452
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,863
Once in a while some freak
tries to off himself in the hospital.

453
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,025
I wish they would
just do it at home.

454
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,868
My father hung
himself. I was only eight.

455
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,602
He'd lost another job. I
found him in the kitchen.

456
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,578
I was too little to do anything.

457
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:19,413
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

458
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,920
- Does Luka know this?
- No. I never told him.

459
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:30,324
I never told anyone. I
don't think I can do this.

460
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:35,067
- Well, it's not always this bad.
- Look at me. I'm crying like a baby.

461
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:41,137
We've all cried. Sometimes
it's the only thing you can do.

462
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,135
I went through my charts. I
found another commonality...

463
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,577
- to all my post-op infection mortalities.
- What am I looking for?

464
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,149
- I highlighted his name.
- Babcock?

465
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,786
Yeah. He was in every
case. I only missed it before...

466
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,446
because he stepped in for Dr. Zogoiby,
whose handwriting is illegible.

467
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:02,755
Dr. Babcock is gonna have a date with
your friend from the health department.

468
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,420
- Phone call, Dr. Greene.
- Take a message.

469
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:09,261
He knew I was being investigated. Why
didn't he step forward, say something?

470
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:12,769
Maybe he didn't want to be probed
or forced to give stool samples.

471
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,931
I'm being serious. Who knows
what he's working with in his lab.

472
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:19,169
I'm sorry. That's Rachel's school.
They need you to pick her up.

473
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,506
- Is she all right?
- She got suspended.

474
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,479
- For what?
- I don't know. That's not my business.

475
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,778
- Suspended?
- It must be some kind of mistake.

476
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:30,753
- Probably drug-related.
- You better go. I'll deal with this.

477
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,322
- How's he doing?
- Pulse ox is 98 on 50 percent.

478
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:41,627
Good. Mr. Hilliker, we had to put a
tube down your throat to help you breathe.

479
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,133
I'm gonna take it out now, okay?

480
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,966
I want you to take
some deep breaths.

481
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:52,467
When I say blow, I want you to blow
as hard as you can. Ready? Okay, blow.

482
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,309
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:02,148
Try not to speak, Mr. Hilliker.
Take some deep breaths.

484
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,252
- Tell him.
- Okay, Mr. Hilliker. Just relax.

485
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,895
Just relax.

486
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,657
He doesn't want us to tell the police.
He's still got buddies on the force.

487
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,803
I'm afraid we have to.

488
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:28,739
It's gonna be okay,
Mr. Hilliker. It's gonna be okay.

489
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,290
His wife died last year. - What?

490
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,518
Breast cancer.

491
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,031
He was a respected and
decorated police officer.

492
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,069
Only reason he took the job at the mall
was so that he could still help people.

493
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:56,368
- Why are you telling me this?
- I just thought you should know.

494
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:06,113
Keep an eye on his vitals
and call for a psych consult.

495
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,825
- 100.8.
- Feels like 108.

496
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:18,555
BP is 140 over 80. And your white
count is 14,000. You're a little anemic.

497
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,722
40 percent of menstruating
women are anemic.

498
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,768
My diagnosis is you're a little
rundown. Maybe it's time to pick a career.

499
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,565
Medicine beats law any day.

500
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,674
My parents will only pay for med
school if I graduate law school.

501
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,778
If your parents are both attorneys,
why don't you have any health insurance?

502
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:38,680
I have a sad and complicated relationship
with them that you couldn't understand.

503
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,918
I might surprise you.

504
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,248
You need to take better
care of yourself, Grace.

505
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:46,756
You need to eat right, get plenty
of sleep and lay off the caffeine...

506
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:50,089
I would if I could. I haven't
had eight hours' sleep in months.

507
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,424
Do you think you could
get me some Halcion?

508
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,834
- I don't think so.
- Just one dose. I mean...

509
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,803
Today is shot for me. If I could
just go home and crash. Please?

510
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,370
I diagnosed your
student's patient.

511
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,537
This is a one-time
special treatment...

512
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:12,151
and only if you promise to do
the other things we talked about.

513
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,049
Cross my heart.

514
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,621
What are the EKG
findings for hyperkalemia?

515
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,156
Peaked T waves, prolonged
PR and short QT intervals.

516
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,157
- You're good.
- Mm-hm.

517
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,895
- Hey. Your day getting any better?
- Not yet.

518
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,829
- You talk to your grandmother?
- Mm-hm.

519
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,128
How did she take it?

520
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,168
It didn't bother her.
She went home.

521
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,738
- You let her drive?
- No. Her driver picked her up.

522
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,375
- You have to notify the DMV.
- I didn't tell her that.

523
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,137
Dying's one thing. Not
driving is another story.

524
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:43,373
- You have to mail in the notice.
- I didn't see her as an ER patient.

525
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,016
- I brought her in.
- It's the law.

526
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,551
- I can't rat out my own grandmother.
- You want me to? She doesn't like me.

527
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,689
Carter! Your patient went down.

528
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,651
- What happened?
- She must have vagalled.

529
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,386
All right. Let's get the gurney.

530
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,329
Whoa...

531
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,679
All right, come on.

532
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,393
- I need to talk.
- Somebody took target practice...

533
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,731
on a crossing guard.
I gotta plug her up.

534
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,602
- It's rather important. ROMANO:
Well, give me the Cliff Notes.

535
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,003
I'm listening.

536
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,610
- I'd prefer to have your full attention.
- Suit yourself.

537
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,583
Are you joining us, Elizabeth?

538
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,189
No. I'm afraid not.

539
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:29,021
If you could have your assistant
page me when you're done, please?

540
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,695
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Want something to eat?

541
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,566
No, no. So, what did he say?

542
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:44,471
Well, I talked to Mitch and Sophie,
my friend that works in the courthouse.

543
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:48,375
- And?
- They said the worst thing to do is fight.

544
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:52,143
- I can fight it if I want to?
- It looks like you got something to hide.

545
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,877
What if I'm just offended
by the whole principle?

546
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,649
Peter, you go in.
You get swabbed.

547
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:02,886
They run the DNA. And you can prove
once and for all that Reece is your son.

548
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:08,996
- What if he's not, Jackie?
- Is that really a possibility?

549
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,115
Ooh.

550
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,168
- What are you doing?
- You're out of surgery.

551
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:26,467
The patient coded before we even got
started. What are you doing down here?

552
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,479
I wanted to ask you
about a couple of cases.

553
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:35,877
Uh...

554
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:41,925
You know, it doesn't matter anyway.
It'll have to wait. I've just been paged.

555
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,488
Elizabeth.

556
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,360
Aren't you forgetting something?

557
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,228
I believe those are mine.

558
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,367
Thank you.

559
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:04,574
I must be dehydrated. All I've had is
coffee and a muffin since last night.

560
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,715
You want to tell
us about the scars?

561
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,015
I used to be a cutter.

562
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,957
My parents fought a lot when I
was a kid, and I was a geek in school.

563
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:21,728
I developed an eating disorder. It
was my way of dealing with stress.

564
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,865
Did you ever see
anybody about it?

565
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,463
The only people who seemed to
care were the doctors and nurses.

566
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,405
- Probably why I'm in med school.
- What about now? Are you still cutting?

567
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,375
No.

568
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,582
- Show me your arm.
- You don't believe me?

569
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,457
You have a fever and
a borderline white count.

570
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,061
Maybe from an infection,
or using a dirty blade.

571
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:53,562
- I told you I haven't eaten.
- So the eating disorder continues?

572
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,960
- No. I've just been cramming.
- Pull up your skirt.

573
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,578
- Pardon me?
- Let me see your thigh.

574
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,935
I don't think so.

575
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,673
- You ass!
- You're still cutting.

576
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,404
- We just want to help you.
- Okay, hold on. Grace.

577
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,742
- I have a pathology final.
- If you don't stay...

578
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,147
- I'll put you on psych hold.
- On what grounds?

579
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,082
- Danger to self.
- That's not true.

580
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,245
- Grace, Grace. Wait.
- Stop!

581
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,516
You're blowing this
way out of proportion!

582
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,595
- Why are you doing this?
- I know what it's like to need help...

583
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,596
- when you least want it.
- Please.

584
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,326
- Please just leave me alone.
- I can't.

585
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,706
What are you staring at? You couldn't
even diagnose thrombocytopenia.

586
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,935
- Get five of droperidol.
- No! No, stop! Stop! I don't need that!

587
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,944
- Okay. Get back into bed now.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

588
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,378
Please. Please. Please.

589
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,814
- Take it easy. It's okay.
- You'll ruin everything.

590
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:49,819
Please, you'll ruin everything.

591
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:56,617
No, please, stop. Don't. No, don't...
Don't, please. Can't you just...?

592
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,666
- I had to get a doctor to cover for me.
- I'm sorry.

593
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,505
- Scissors, Rachel?
- It's not like they said.

594
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,408
Did you threaten this girl?

595
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,584
It was Natalie. I threatened to
cut her dreadlocks, not stab her.

596
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,309
Why?

597
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,547
She tried to steal Andrew away from
me. She keeps on sending notes in class...

598
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:28,216
- and asking him over to study.
- This is over a boy.

599
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:32,091
- It's no big deal, Dad.
- Then why aren't you in gym class now?

600
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,858
Maybe because they stopped
teaching gym in the '70s.

601
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,661
Don't get smart.
This is serious.

602
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:40,602
You've been suspended. Next
time you will be expelled permanently.

603
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:44,573
- There won't be a next time.
- Right. Because now we have new rules.

604
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,769
- Like what?
- No more rides to school...

605
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:50,507
unless it's with Elizabeth or me.
No more going out on weeknights...

606
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:53,709
or weekends for that
matter, for at least a month.

607
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,615
Why don't you send
me to a convent?

608
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:59,019
I would. But I need you around
the house to do all your chores.

609
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,888
- I have chores now?
- Yep. Think of yourself as Cinderella...

610
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,031
- and I'm your evil stepmother.
- I've already got one of those.

611
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,723
Keep it up. You'll find
yourself back in St. Louis.

612
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,738
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Don't know. Maybe because I love you?

613
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,567
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

614
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,300
Do you know how many
messed-up teenagers I see?

615
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:22,436
Drug addicts, suicides, 10-year-old
homeless girls who've been raped...

616
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,016
because nobody gave a damn about
them? Well, I give a damn about you.

617
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,746
You may not like it now.
Hell, you may never like it.

618
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,186
This is how it's gonna be.

619
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,754
Get in.

620
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:47,996
- Need any help?
- Hey. Did you page me?

621
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:52,871
No, but I figured I might find you
in here. Hi, Reece. How are you?

622
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,779
Good.

623
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,241
Did you talk to Jackie?

624
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,842
Yeah. She thinks I
should take the test.

625
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:10,158
So, what happens if
you're not a genetic match?

626
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,498
Well, I guess it makes it easier
for Roger to fight me for custody.

627
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,127
Nothing's changed, Peter.

628
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,629
You're still his father.

629
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,811
So what are you
two doing for dinner?

630
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,606
Why don't you come to my place?

631
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,579
I have those fish sticks
in the freezer Reece likes.

632
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,180
Hey, hey! Take it easy.

633
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:39,222
- Someone's getting a little frustrated.
- He's tired. He wants to go home.

634
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,358
Daddy can't take you
home. I have to work.

635
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,699
What's he saying?

636
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,839
He wants his other daddy
to come take him home.

637
00:37:56,007 --> 00:38:00,502
Gamma, because you cannot
drive. Because you could black out.

638
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:06,584
No, I'm... Hey, I'm sorry.
No, I'm not. No, I am not.

639
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:12,824
- She won't stop driving?
- She's calling from the car.

640
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,927
She's been driving around for
two hours just to prove me wrong.

641
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:20,091
It's not funny. She could
hurt herself or somebody else.

642
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,430
- What are you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do?

643
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,036
What am I gonna do? Call
the cops on my grandmother?

644
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:29,868
- You already made me call the DMV.
- Me? Don't make me the bad guy.

645
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,405
- I should go home, wait for her.
- I can wait with you.

646
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,940
- Yeah?
- I mean, yeah, if you want.

647
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:43,680
Enter!

648
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,018
Ah, I was just about to
page you. Have a seat.

649
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,059
So, Elizabeth.

650
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,897
Dr. Babcock says that you
were trespassing in his office...

651
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,403
and his research
area. Care to elaborate?

652
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,337
- I wanted to talk to him.
- You knew I was in surgery.

653
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:15,751
He's worked on every one of my cases
that died from a post-operative infection.

654
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:19,557
- Is this true?
- Yes. It's true.

655
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,319
- And I have evidence to prove it.
- So what?

656
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,958
You have made it clear on
more than one occasion...

657
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,295
- you are not opposed to euthanasia.
- I can't imagine a humane doctor who is.

658
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,597
- I have four bodies in the morgue!
- That's not my fault.

659
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,605
You need to take responsibility
for your gross misjudgment!

660
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,868
- Time out! BABCOCK:
This is a load of crap.

661
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,314
You allow her to operate on elderly
lost souls who should never be in surgery.

662
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,916
And then when they die,
which they inevitably will...

663
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,053
she comes looking
for someone to blame!

664
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,212
They didn't die from surgery.
They died from post-op infection.

665
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,415
- The key word there being
"post-op." ROMANO: Okay.

666
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,925
- If you hadn't operated, they'd be alive.
- Okay! Enough!

667
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:59,462
This whole thing has
gotten out of hand.

668
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,995
The health department has
yet to conclude its investigation.

669
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,967
Until they do, neither one
of you is in the O.R. Happy?

670
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,697
- No.
- That's not a solution.

671
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,601
It works for me.

672
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,676
- I'm not doing another case with her.
- You certainly aren't.

673
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,982
Get out, both of you. You're
giving me a headache. Go.

674
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,807
God is love.

675
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,344
You can go home,
Gallant. Carter signed out.

676
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,322
Oh, yeah, I know. I think
I'm gonna stay and study.

677
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:31,657
- Here?
- Maybe I'll pick up stuff by osmosis.

678
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,491
You'll pick up something.

679
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,801
Hi. Feeling better?

680
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,334
What do you want?

681
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,735
I heard you talking about
your pathology exam.

682
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,311
I thought you might like
to take a look at Robbins.

683
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,017
Thanks.

684
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,355
I'm sorry about some
of the crap I said to you.

685
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,288
- I think I was just a little stressed.
- I know what that's like.

686
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,993
So you obviously
know your vasculitidies.

687
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:11,097
How are you with your
glycogen-storage diseases?

688
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:17,103
- Not so good.
- Yeah. Me neither.

689
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:26,876
Mr. Benton? I am Asha.
You're here for a DNA test?

690
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,485
Yeah.

691
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:34,416
Okay. Don't
worry, it's painless.

692
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,756
I'm just gonna use this swab to
wipe the inside of your cheek. Okay?

693
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:40,262
Yeah. ASHA: Say "ah."

694
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,794
Ah.

695
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,833
Okay, all done.

696
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,640
That wasn't so bad, now, was it?

697
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:58,548
- I can't believe it.
- I didn't believe it either.

698
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,045
Fentanyl.

699
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:06,089
If you're gonna abuse
drugs, abuse a good one.

700
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,989
- Wow.
- I've been clean and sober for a year.

701
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,059
You got it out of your system.

702
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,024
I wouldn't say that.

703
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:21,538
What?

704
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,338
Nothing.

705
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:28,944
- Disappointed in me?
- No! No. I'm just...

706
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,050
You were stabbed.

707
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,685
Twice. I don't recommend it.

708
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,150
- Can I see your scar?
- What?

709
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,795
- Show me your scar.
- No.

710
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:45,986
- Why not?
- Why?

711
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,860
- Don't be bashful.
- Get your own.

712
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,629
Why do I feel like a
school kid sitting out here?

713
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,377
Must be the adolescent
sexual tension.

714
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,378
Mm.

715
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,677
That's it.

716
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,645
You know, I used to
have a crush on you.

717
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:16,191
- Used to?
- It's all coming back to me now.

718
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,054
- I used to have a crush on you too.
- Liar.

719
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:23,531
I did! You were cute.

720
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,898
- Real cute. But...
- But?

721
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,234
Well, you were a med
student, I was a Resident...

722
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,239
I'm a Resident now.

723
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,842
- Chief Resident.
- That's right.

724
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,652
Glad you came back.

725
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,682
Me too.

726
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,195
Gamma's home.
