1
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,661
There you are.

2
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,534
- Change, lady?
- Sorry.

3
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,470
Look out!

4
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,201
Sorry.

5
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,850
His buddies said
he just passed out.

6
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,577
There's rigor
mortis and lividity.

7
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,050
It was a crowded scene.
It was easier to grab him.

8
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,417
- It's gonna be harder to dump him.
- Come on, doc.

9
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,721
No. Look, I'm not tying up a room with
a dead body. Take him to the morgue.

10
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,206
- You've got a morgue.
- No. Come on. Load him up.

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,426
We reserve the right to
refuse service to anyone.

12
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,897
This is a county hospital.

13
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,764
Let me know when you start
paying taxes and wearing clothes.

14
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,929
This should be enough
Elimite for everyone.

15
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,573
Wash your bedding in hot water.

16
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,206
And the dog too?
ABBY: Sure. Why not?

17
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,902
Make a follow-up with your
regular health care provider.

18
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,444
This is our regular health care provider.
- Right.

19
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,450
- Hi. I'm looking for Mark Greene.
- Talk to the clerk.

20
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,521
Dude, it only takes, like, two
minutes to freeze a wart off.

21
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,887
Actually, less. But you still
have to wait like everybody else.

22
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,552
- Hi, I'm looking for Dr. Greene.
- Fill this out and take a seat over there.

23
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,097
- I'm not a patient. We're having lunch.
- Chairs are that way.

24
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,428
- Okay. You'll tell him I'm here?
- I'll tell him.

25
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,037
You might wanna know my name.
- County General.

26
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,895
- Excuse me.
- My fault.

27
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,099
Can you help me? I'm
looking for Mark Greene.

28
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,870
Yosh, labs back on the
gallbladder on Exam 1?

29
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,740
- Check the computer.
- He's a friend.

30
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,075
Hang on. ABBY: Have
you still not forgiven me?

31
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,410
- My angelfish died.
- I'll buy you another one.

32
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,195
There were two.
- I'll buy three.

33
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,155
- Can you help? I'm looking for Dr. Greene.
- Check with the clerk.

34
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,155
Go ahead and call the mayor!
Shut us down, for all I care!

35
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,793
Dr. Lewis!

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,895
- Dr. Lewis.
- Yes, hi.

37
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,462
- Ralph.
- Ralph?

38
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,659
Ralph Binks. Six years ago, I was
tapping the electrical main downstairs...

39
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,964
took 20 amps in the ass. You treated
me, said I was gonna be just fine.

40
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,836
- Right. Right.
- Well, I wasn't.

41
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,411
My life has been a living
hell of static cling since then!

42
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,743
So thanks, doc.
Thanks for nothing.

43
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,783
Bet I know what
you came here for.

44
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,622
Is that it?

45
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,636
So she just got on a plane?

46
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,244
Sent for the twins the next
day, haven't seen her since.

47
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,175
Dr. Kovac doesn't
know what happened.

48
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,373
- Dr. Kovac?
- A tall, hunky guy, dark hair.

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,828
- You can't miss him.
- And you don't want to.

50
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,755
Can someone move Mr. Schnack
before we have to hold the wake ourselves?

51
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,051
- She's still here?
- Worse. She's in charge.

52
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,219
Excuse me. Ladies, we have
patients breaking the eight-hour mark.

53
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,796
- Yeah. WRIGHT:
Don't be a stranger.

54
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,694
I won't.

55
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,031
Susan?

56
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,103
Hey, Kerry.

57
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,764
What a surprise. Are you
here for the ACEP assembly?

58
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,375
No, I'm here on some interviews.

59
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,070
- In Chicago?
- I'm meeting Mark for lunch.

60
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,681
He's in with a bad GSW.

61
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,681
Yeah, I finally got
someone to talk to me.

62
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,679
- Where have you gone to?
- What?

63
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,412
Hospitals.

64
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,217
Rush, Northwestern,
a couple of privates.

65
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,990
Looking for a staff position?

66
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,887
Mm-hm.

67
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,362
- Well, good luck with that.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,533
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.

69
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,363
- Welcome back.
- Sort of.

70
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,870
You mind? I work here.

71
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:41,238
Chest cavity's filled with clot.
- Sats are down to 60.

72
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,144
Lap pad.

73
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,750
Who's that?

74
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,779
It's Susan Lewis.

75
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,947
- Your friend from Scottsdale?
- Phoenix.

76
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,923
Says Scottsdale on the phone
bill. Metzenbaum scissors.

77
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,325
She looks great, doesn't she?

78
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,421
Pericardium's tense with blood.

79
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,069
- What's she doing here?
- We're supposed to have lunch.

80
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,938
There's a big
bleeder underneath.

81
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,441
- You didn't say anything about lunch.
- I didn't?

82
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,575
No.

83
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,943
Can you feel the defect?

84
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,916
- I can't put my finger on it.
- You're here for a reason, Mrs. McDuffy.

85
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,079
- It's Miss.
- Miss McDuffy.

86
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,192
Let's start with I'm tired, I'm
depressed, I can't concentrate.

87
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,194
I've got headaches and hives.
And I'm bloated and constipated.

88
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,423
- And it hurts here too.
- Any chest pain?

89
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,331
- Oh, that's the worst of all.
- I see. That just about covers everything.

90
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,801
Abby? ABBY: Yeah.

91
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,464
Can we get CBC,
Chem-20, TSH, Free T4...

92
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:47,478
troponin, CK with MB, lipase,
EKG, chest x-ray, urine and a culture?

93
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,808
- That it?
- I've got a yeast infection too.

94
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,645
- Wonderful.
- Wanna see it?

95
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,810
Maybe later.

96
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,514
- Be a sport. Do the pelvic.
- That might just put me over the edge.

97
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,990
- Into what? Celibacy?
- Into taking it.

98
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,492
- You're not taking it.
- I am.

99
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,653
- You like it here.
- I don't have a job here.

100
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,321
Weaver offered you shifts.

101
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,194
I can do shift work anywhere.

102
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,462
Northwestern. There's a tenured
track, clinical faculty position.

103
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,367
You wanna be a professor now?

104
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,337
It's better job security.

105
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,169
Like you're in it for the money?

106
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,836
And my money says they have
yeast infections at Northwestern.

107
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,175
- I'll let you know.
- If you really wanted it...

108
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,319
- you would've taken it.
- I have to tell them. They clocked it.

109
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,421
- Clocked what?
- I have to let them know by Friday.

110
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,486
- Tomorrow's Friday.
- I know.

111
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,217
John, can you take the
hypochondriac with a spider bite...?

112
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,261
- Asking me or are you telling me?
- Whatever gets you to do it.

113
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,762
I told the creep all we
had was traveler's checks.

114
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,991
Wouldn't do him any good.

115
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,692
Pretty brazen for a mugger
to hit you in broad daylight.

116
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,237
He didn't hit us. Stan tripped
over a curb trying to get away.

117
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,932
- Dr. Weaver?
- I'll have the nurse get you an ice pack.

118
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,373
- He doesn't need an MRI?
- Not this time.

119
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,842
Yesterday's positive list.

120
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,380
Make sure Frank routes
them correctly this time.

121
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,744
- Sure.
- Last week, the cafeteria ended up...

122
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,387
with our UTI sensitivities.

123
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,216
Anything I should know
about this meeting?

124
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,256
- What meeting?
- With Romano.

125
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,520
Risk Management called me, so I'm
assuming it's about the Marfan's death.

126
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,788
Oh.

127
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,432
Has there been a
wrongful-death suit filed?

128
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,899
In-house review is standard
procedure in this kind of circumstance.

129
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,129
It's not an M&M. These
are lawyers, right?

130
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,967
Their job is to protect you...

131
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,884
- and the hospital.
- And assess exposure.

132
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,436
- It's normal.
- Dave was fired. I just thought maybe...

133
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,138
Dr. Malucci's termination
isn't reflective of anything.

134
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,250
There were other concerns.

135
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,784
Other issues involved.

136
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,911
Am I in trouble here, Kerry?

137
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,984
I found it in my slipper. I
figured you'd need its antivenom.

138
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,924
Actually, Chicago doesn't
have any dangerous spiders.

139
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,894
- It doesn't?
- Not native anyway.

140
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,432
So this one hopped on
a bus across the border.

141
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,398
That bastard took a
chunk out of my foot.

142
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,664
- It looks like a flea bite.
- A flea bite? I can feel the toxin...

143
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,604
- making its way to my heart.
- 1 percent hydrocortisone cream...

144
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,939
Benadryl for the itching,
and get yourself a flea bomb.

145
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,013
- That's it?
- That's it.

146
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,683
You've got this down. Why
would you want to leave it?

147
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,512
- Yeah, right.
- Pardon, miss?

148
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,483
What's your name again?

149
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,590
- Abby.
- I'm Nicole. We met at the bar with Luka.

150
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,090
- I was your waitress.
- Right.

151
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,121
What happened to your hand?

152
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:19,494
I cut myself. Not bad, but I think
it needs to be... How do you say?

153
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,033
- Sutured?
- Yeah, sutured.

154
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,364
That man over there, he won't
tell Luka I'm here. He's so rude.

155
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,473
You want me to
take a look at it?

156
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,370
I was hoping Luka could look.

157
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,544
Well, Dr. Carter's
very good at suturing.

158
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:37,377
- Luka is not working today?
- No, I think that he is. Isn't he, Abby?

159
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,113
Yeah.

160
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,351
Sure. Come on. I'll get you a room.
- Thank you.

161
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,495
Jeez!

162
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,662
- Hey, don't hurt him!
- What are you doing?

163
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,164
- I'm letting him go.
- Why?

164
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,825
You said he was innocent.

165
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,131
Frank, I think I need
Housekeeping in here.

166
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,068
Funny, that's not
how I remember you.

167
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,472
Ow! Son of a bitch!

168
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,137
That is.

169
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,648
Dr. Lewis! What are you doing here?
- Susan, Carter.

170
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,684
- Right. Susan, hey!
- Hi.

171
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,524
- Would you believe I'm looking for work?
- In Chicago?

172
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,024
- Yeah. Never say never.
- Well, that's great.

173
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,529
Wow, you look...

174
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,526
- different.
- Yeah? You look the same.

175
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,067
- Are you interviewing?
- Yeah.

176
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,535
- I have a meeting at Northwestern.
- Northwestern?

177
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,333
- Yeah.
- Clinical faculty position?

178
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,669
- Yeah, why?
- I was just offered that job.

179
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,745
- Oh, no. It's in the ER.
- I switched back to emergency medicine.

180
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,711
- Oh, when?
- Forever ago.

181
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,706
So you must be Chief Resident.

182
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,678
No. That would be Dr. Chen.

183
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,852
- Deb Chen?
- It's Jing-Mei now. Jing-Mai now. Jing...

184
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,118
- Frank, what is it?
- I don't know what she calls herself.

185
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,692
Yeah, so...

186
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,124
Hey.

187
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,130
- Robert.
- Hey, lurking around the men's room now?

188
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,564
Changing teams again?

189
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,535
You scheduled meetings with
my Residents without telling me?

190
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,402
- Did you not get the memo?
- What memo?

191
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,545
- The one saying I run the place.
- Dr. Chen's my responsibility.

192
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,078
I expect to be notified if
she's to be questioned.

193
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,910
- Fair. Consider yourself notified.
- Good. I wanna be there.

194
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,745
No. I don't even wanna be there.

195
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,285
As chief of the department,
I think it's appropriate.

196
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,889
Don't interfere with Risk
Management investigations.

197
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,424
- An investigation?
- Information gathering, whatever.

198
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,994
- They have a few questions.
- Dr. Chen approached me.

199
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,631
She was scared. She
wants me to come with her.

200
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,096
She's a big girl.

201
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,495
She talked about lawyers.

202
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,296
Do you want it to escalate to
that or you want me to come?

203
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,938
Does she have something to hide?

204
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,337
No. The truth is bad enough.
We should be trying to protect her.

205
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,774
- You sure you don't have a thing for her?
- Robert.

206
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,005
Okay, fine, 3:00, seventh
floor conference room.

207
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,117
- Good femoral with compressions.
- Stop CPR.

208
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,117
- No pulse, no pressure.
- Your friend's back.

209
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,995
- What do you feel?
- Probable entry wound, left ventricle.

210
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,757
Feels ragged through
the mitral valve.

211
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,195
- How big?
- Too big.

212
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,011
Nothing's organized
on the monitor.

213
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,267
- He's gone. You wanna call it?
- See if we can piece anything together.

214
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:16,000
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- 0 silk on a needle driver.

215
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,109
- Hey. Give me 10 minutes?
- If there's still an express to Oak Park.

216
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,374
- Yeah. You look great.
- You look great too.

217
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,179
Dr. Greene, we got a 6-year-old boy
with vomiting and severe dehydration.

218
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,130
- Get Cleo. HALEH: He's
got a genetic disorder.

219
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,386
- Tachy at 120. BP's 90/60.
- You know what? I don't wanna be late.

220
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,357
- I'll just come back after my interview.
- Okay. That's great.

221
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,961
Elizabeth, how are you doing?

222
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,655
- Forget it. Go.
- Good to see things never change.

223
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,164
- Knock them dead.
- You too.

224
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,330
- How long's he been vomiting?
- Three days.

225
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,375
- He's dry as a bone.
- And you waited till now to bring him in?

226
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,639
His geneticist's at Mercy. Our insurance
got messed up. They couldn't see us.

227
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,545
- Is he Down's?
- No. Trisomy 18.

228
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,711
- I thought they didn't survive past age 1.
- They don't. He's special.

229
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:08,025
Yeah. Belly's hard as a rock.
Elizabeth, you better get in here!

230
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,595
- Let's do a rectal temp.
- I can do that if you want.

231
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,728
- No, no. We'll let the nurse do it.
- She does it for him all the time.

232
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,268
- What is it?
- Possible bowel obstruction.

233
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,996
Six-year-old boy with
Edwards syndrome.

234
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,108
Six? I thought that
was impossible.

235
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,109
- Apparently not. HALEH:
No luck with the IV.

236
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,043
- Prep a subclavian.
- It feels like a loop of bowel.

237
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,375
I'll try to reduce.

238
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,520
Okay. It's probably perfed.

239
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,713
- Surprised he doesn't have a fever.
- He will.

240
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,417
Probably dead bowel in addition to
the obstruction. Let's take him to O.R.

241
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,563
- He's vomiting. Let's roll him.
- Please. This has to stop.

242
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,562
Once the line's in,
we'll give Compazine.

243
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,793
That's not what she's asking.
Give him something for the pain.

244
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,198
- Titrate 6 of morphine.
- No, to end it.

245
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,199
What?

246
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,739
Please, just end it for him.

247
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:05,077
I'll be upstairs. Have each Resident
pick up at least two of the fast tracks...

248
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,413
when their sicker
patients are tucked in.

249
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,886
- They don't listen to me.
- Make sure Mrs. Hertel...

250
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,684
- gets her gentamicin.
- Two per kilo?

251
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,087
- Yeah.
- Are you ready?

252
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,522
- What?
- I'm going with you.

253
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,322
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

254
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,591
- Dr. Romano assures me it's routine.
- Then why are you going?

255
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,893
To represent the
department, apparently. Haleh?

256
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,867
- Oh, God.
- Jing-Mei, no one is out to get anyone.

257
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,531
You do this long enough, you make a
serious mistake. It's true for everyone.

258
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,540
That's encouraging.

259
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,275
Mr. and Mrs. Schudy?

260
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,880
- He stopped vomiting?
- Yes.

261
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,678
We've given him morphine for
the pain and antibiotics and fluids.

262
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,911
You must think
we're awful people.

263
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:47,628
No. No, I think that when a child
is this ill, emotions can escalate.

264
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,689
And I don't think you really
want what you asked for.

265
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,424
No. No, of course we don't.

266
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,735
I don't know. Maybe
we're both just too tired.

267
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:01,602
- Kenny needs round-the-clock care.
- I imagine he would.

268
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,800
Just tell us what
you need to do.

269
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,605
Well, your son has an
incarcerated inguinal hernia...

270
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,575
which we can repair.
It's a simple procedure.

271
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,152
But we will have to
evaluate his internal organs.

272
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,348
If he's been obstructed for a
while, he may need a colostomy.

273
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:27,060
How many has he had so far?
- Four.

274
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,498
Three laparotomies
and a VSD repair.

275
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,800
He's had more
surgeries than birthdays.

276
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,639
I was opening for lunch. The
back gate gets stuck sometimes.

277
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,250
It doesn't look deep
enough to suture.

278
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,785
Let's irrigate and
give her some Keflex.

279
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:52,483
My boss wanted me to finish my shift.
He's such... What do they say here?

280
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,422
A capitalist?

281
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,793
What did he want me to do,
bleed on everybody's food?

282
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:01,162
Good thing he let you off.
You don't want it to get infected.

283
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,599
He didn't let me. He fired me.

284
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,672
After a year of working
there seven nights a week.

285
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,775
Abby, where's
that irrigation kit?

286
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,343
It's coming, Dr. Kovac.

287
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,344
What?

288
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,116
I'll be right there.

289
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,815
There might be
a little scarring.

290
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,015
Will you be able
to find another job?

291
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,526
I don't know. He kept saying
he'd make problems with my visa.

292
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,823
I think he can too.

293
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,532
Is everything okay back there?
- Yeah.

294
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,000
Had you looked at the x-ray...

295
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,544
would you have recognized
the widened mediastinum?

296
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,340
Yes, I think so.

297
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,884
- Well, how confident of that are you?
- I don't know. Confident.

298
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,055
Standard of care is to take a chest
x-ray to rule out aortic dissection...

299
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,816
before ordering thrombolytics...

300
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,391
- correct?
- That's right.

301
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,688
So why take one if
you're not gonna look at it?

302
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:07,527
Dr. Chen has already admitted to a critical
error. No need to belabor the point.

303
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,566
We're trying to
understand what happened.

304
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,102
The treating Resident
told me the x-ray was clear.

305
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,833
He thought I meant hemothorax, I
thought he meant signs of dissection.

306
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,701
- Dr. Malucci.
- He's been terminated since the incident.

307
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,438
That helps, I suppose.

308
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,346
In essence, the mistake was
the result of a miscommunication...

309
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,352
during a time-sensitive
critical care situation.

310
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,723
- Except for the chain-of-command issue.
- What issue?

311
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,754
How did you get
involved in this case?

312
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,756
Chief Residents or
Attendings are called on...

313
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,626
to sign off on any
use of thrombolytics.

314
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,394
- Chief Residents who are Attendings.
- I am an Attending.

315
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,867
You are now, but at the
time, you were five days...

316
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,597
from officially completing
your Residency.

317
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:52,768
My appointment started July 1. I was
making up days from my maternity leave.

318
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,308
Dr. Chen was given the authority of
an Attending while a Chief Resident.

319
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,079
Prematurely. If she wasn't board-eligible,
she wasn't officially authorized...

320
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,019
- to make this decision.
- I thought I was.

321
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,118
- Who was your Attending?
- What?

322
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,728
Who was your
Attending that night?

323
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,831
- Dr. Weaver.
- We're talking five days.

324
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,459
And where was Dr. Weaver?

325
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,969
Excuse me. I'm sitting
right here. You can ask me.

326
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,439
You're here as a representative of the
department. I'm interviewing Dr. Chen.

327
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,316
- She was out of the hospital.
- I was right across the street.

328
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,579
I was getting a meal
with the understanding...

329
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,622
that Dr. Chen would
page me for critical cases.

330
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,281
- And did you page her?
- Yes.

331
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,518
Before or after you
authorized thrombolytics?

332
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,994
- Before and after.
- I never received a page.

333
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,861
- Three times total.
- You could have come to get me.

334
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,787
- I didn't know where you were.
- Carter knew. He found me in time...

335
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,497
to stop you from
cracking his chest.

336
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,938
Dr. Romano, this
is why I interview...

337
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,942
- participants separately.
- The fact is, this is a systems error.

338
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:04,072
The cafeteria isn't open at 2 a.m., so you
need to leave the building to get a meal.

339
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,848
Hm. You might consider
brown-bagging it next time.

340
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,692
I'm done.

341
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,797
All right. Well, this has been very
enlightening. Thank you, Dr. Chen.

342
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,957
- I'm sorry? ROMANO:
You're excused.

343
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,193
- Oh.
- Kerry, you stay.

344
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,988
That's gotta be a record,
35 minutes for a finger cut.

345
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,151
- Do you need something?
- 9-year-old, scalp lac. He's a handful.

346
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,162
They didn't pull you out
of court, did they? Good.

347
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,495
- I thought you were taking a stool sample.
- I will, Miss McDuffy.

348
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,433
- But you have to go back and lie down.
- Because I have to go.

349
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,769
I have a friend who's having trouble with
her visa. I thought you could help her.

350
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,570
- Do you know anything?
- What?

351
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,076
- About my condition?
- Yeah.

352
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,713
Not until your labs come back.

353
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,679
Work visa, French.

354
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,841
Does my having bad
B.O. mean anything?

355
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,180
- That is possible.
- Great. I'll send her over.

356
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:18,552
- You have to lie down.
- Nicole. Thanks. I owe you.

357
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,893
What?

358
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,865
Nothing.

359
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,233
I thought she was going to protect
me. She went to protect herself.

360
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,311
- What did you expect?
- I don't know.

361
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,243
It never occurred to me that
she had to protect her own ass.

362
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,384
Maybe your asses
aren't mutually exclusive.

363
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,281
Yeah. That's why she's still
up there and I'm down here.

364
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,582
Weaver's political, true. But she's
smart enough to protect her own.

365
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,748
- I don't see it. What's it look like?
- What?

366
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,885
- The spider.
- Nat, it's a big insect. Big, hairy.

367
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,156
You're a reflection on her. You're
her choice for Chief Resident.

368
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,595
She'll defend you.

369
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,767
- If only to defend herself.
- How's your back?

370
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,996
- Hurts like hell.
- 35-year-old male, impaled...

371
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,383
- after a fall off a roof.
- How much blood loss?

372
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,935
Not a lot. We packed around the wound
and stabilized it. No KO. BP, 100/70.

373
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,909
Don't touch me! CHEN: Hey.

374
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,963
What was he doing?

375
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,982
Wife said he was
trying to get free cable.

376
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,913
Where's my wife?

377
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,117
Hi, baby.

378
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,067
I can't believe you
have to open him again.

379
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,788
- Want me to go over the procedure?
- No. We know it by heart.

380
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,260
Right. Then I just need
you to sign the consent, then.

381
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,763
It shouldn't take more
than a couple of hours.

382
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,095
There's a waiting
area just down the hall.

383
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,930
Do you have a cafeteria?

384
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,595
Yeah. Third floor.

385
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,936
It's the only time my husband
and I get to share a meal together...

386
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,301
when Kenny's in the hospital.

387
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,107
- I understand.
- Thank you.

388
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,278
Any messages?

389
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,942
Elsa Alcoran called, said
she doesn't want the job.

390
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,349
- Did she say why?
- No.

391
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,548
- No new nanny yet?
- No. Not one that signs.

392
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,487
Oh, yeah, right. That
must be hard to find.

393
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,823
- You look tired.
- So do you.

394
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,064
Parenting will do that to you.

395
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,671
Hi. This is Peter Benton.
I got your message.

396
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,570
I was hoping you
would reconsider.

397
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,576
If you could at least call me back,
I would really appreciate it. Okay?

398
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,477
Thank you very much.

399
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,548
- What do we got? CARTER:
Fragments in the peritoneum.

400
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,849
- That's a hell of a fragment.
- BP's down to 70.

401
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,993
Bolus 2 liters wide
open. Central line kit.

402
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,158
- Take it out, it's killing him.
- We have to do it in O.R.

403
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,922
He could bleed
uncontrollably here.

404
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,397
- HemoCue is 10.
- You should take her outside.

405
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,887
Two units O-neg standing by.

406
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,768
- Can't you give him something?
- We did.

407
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,170
- Melanie?
- Full diaphragmatic rupture.

408
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,037
- Okay, let's red-line him.
- Melanie!

409
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,008
- What?
- I love you!

410
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,114
No. No, shut up.
You're not saying that.

411
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,010
I do. MELANIE: Stop it.

412
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,708
- You'll be okay.
- Where's the O-neg?

413
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,924
- Waiting on Dr. Chen.
- Let's go! Let's move!

414
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,351
- You need some help?
- No, no. I almost got it.

415
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,385
Didn't she leave a guide wire
in some poor schlub's chest?

416
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,290
That was over six years ago.
She was a medical student.

417
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,364
But now there's a pattern. If we don't
show we took corrective measures...

418
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,092
we could have real exposure
if she kills anyone else.

419
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,134
- That's a little dramatic.
- He's dead.

420
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,771
Can't get much more dramatic.

421
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,534
There's no reason to
think she'll kill anyone else.

422
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,143
- Can you guarantee that?
- Oh, come on.

423
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,440
And what happens the next time you
take a 20-minute break off campus?

424
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,986
How much does the technicality
in her status really factor in?

425
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:42,291
You mean, can you end
the blood trail with Chen?

426
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,487
I wanna know what
kind of support to expect.

427
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,599
- For you or the department?
- For me.

428
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,996
Well, I won't tell you
what to do, it's your ER...

429
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,665
but I expect the family's gonna want
accountability beyond Dr. Malucci.

430
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,147
BP's stable, 110/60.

431
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,946
Mr. Warshaw, I'm
Dr. Benton. We're gonna...

432
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,986
put you to sleep and
make any repairs.

433
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,418
No, don't.

434
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,320
- Don't what?
- Save me.

435
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:17,327
I know the medication has you feeling
a little strange, but don't worry...

436
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,897
- you're gonna be okay.
- Just let me die.

437
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,964
- Was this a suicide attempt?
- Not that I know of.

438
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,799
Dr. Benton, your niece called. Her car
broke down. She can't pick up your son.

439
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,472
It has to be an accident.

440
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:34,671
Mr. Warshaw, your family needs
you, so just hang in there, okay?

441
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,509
They need the money more!

442
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,881
Oh, my God! BENTON:
Grab his hands! Grab them!

443
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,680
- Give me gloves!
- What the hell...?

444
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:45,188
No pulse. All right.
Starting compressions.

445
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,483
- What happened?
- Don't stand there. Bag him.

446
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,458
You want to tube him instead?

447
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,655
Still no pulse. BENTON:
I need to clamp the aorta.

448
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:56,393
- Here? The O.R.'s 20 feet away.
- We'll never make it. 10 blade!

449
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,503
BP's 40 and dropping.

450
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,372
- Scissors and a rib spreader.
- We don't have them in Pre-Op.

451
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,911
- I gotta go to O.R. and get a tray.
- Forget it! Help me pull this apart.

452
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,742
What? BENTON: Just do it!

453
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,213
Here we go.

454
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,683
Got it. Let's get him
in the O.R. Move!

455
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,832
Mozart? CORDAY: Yes.

456
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,198
I don't have time to listen to
music anymore except at work.

457
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,568
- Up on the Bovie. SHIRLEY:
Kids will do that to you.

458
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,938
God, have you ever
seen this many adhesions?

459
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,755
- Is it part of the disease?
- That and heart defects...

460
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,044
mental retardation,
multiple gut problems.

461
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,911
Move to the right, Lizzie.
- What?

462
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:48,350
Your hands. They're blocking his
shot. Make sure you get the cecum.

463
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,352
Robert, I'm in the
middle of surgery!

464
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,583
No, you're in the middle of an
historic case. 6-year-old Trisomy 18.

465
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,695
- Has to be some kind of record.
- Hey, I said, stop it!

466
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,730
We need close-ups of the palmar
creases and rocker-bottom feet.

467
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,799
I hope you have
permission to do this.

468
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,301
This is a teaching hospital.
It's in the interest of science.

469
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:09,539
- For God's sake! Shirley, suction.
- How these parents can keep...

470
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,939
this kid alive in good
conscience is beyond me.

471
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,392
- Get a shot of that! CORDAY:
Fistula end's nice and pink.

472
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,209
- Let's tack it down.
- Okay. Now over here.

473
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,511
This one's for the coffee
table. Smile, Lizzie.

474
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,212
Perfed the cecum up
through the omentum...

475
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,255
and the superior
mesenteric vein.

476
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,784
I've got the cross-matched.

477
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,545
No answer at the garage. - What?

478
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,006
Your brother-in-law's not there.
- Try my sister.

479
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,896
- What's her number?
- 555-0146.

480
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,159
The portal vein seems intact.
- 0-1 what?

481
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,633
Four-six!

482
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,829
- What time is it?
- Almost 4.

483
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,167
Sixth unit is up.
He's exsanguinating.

484
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,503
<i>We're not home
to take your call.</i>

485
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,077
<i>Leave a message and
we'll get back to you.</i>

486
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:50,410
Jackie, it's Peter. Are you there?
I need you to pick up Reece.

487
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,983
<i>I'm not gonna make it in
time. I'm stuck in surgery.</i>

488
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,314
<i>Jackie, if you're
there, pick up!</i>

489
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,986
<i>Jackie!</i>

490
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,490
Check the ostomy output, cue
six hours and change the dressing.

491
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,651
You've got it, Dr. Corday.

492
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,958
- How did it go?
- As well as it could, I suppose.

493
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,964
- Where are they?
- Who?

494
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,659
- His parents.
- I don't know.

495
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,271
I don't think they've been
back since he went in.

496
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:16,500
- Are you sure?
- They never checked in with me.

497
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,143
They can't still be eating.

498
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,836
- So you're not gonna take it?
- Mark, he asked me out.

499
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,448
- Consider it a bonus.
- In the middle of the meeting.

500
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,208
Was he good-looking?

501
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:29,215
- He spits when he talks.
- So a little saliva's gonna hold you back?

502
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,323
No big deal. I have
three more interviews.

503
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,119
- Well, you can stop and come back here.
- Yeah, right.

504
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,694
- No. We're looking for an Attending.
- No, you're not.

505
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:40,026
Seriously. You saw what it
was like down there this morning.

506
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,031
Weaver didn't mention anything.

507
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,999
That surprise you?

508
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,608
Thought it was
cooler than a tattoo.

509
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,039
You could have at least
called me, you know.

510
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:57,540
And say what? "Hey, how's it going?
By the way, I have a brain tumor."

511
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,241
Or written a letter.

512
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,354
Oh, like the one you wrote me
telling me that you were engaged?

513
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,551
It wasn't an
engagement. And it's over.

514
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:11,327
Is that why you're moving back? Or
did you collapse from heat exhaustion?

515
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:14,831
Well, after Chloe moved, there
wasn't much reason to stay.

516
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,868
I can't follow my sister's
family around forever.

517
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,403
And I'm not exactly Desert Girl.

518
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,065
I just missed it here, you
know? The city, the weather...

519
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,836
you.

520
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,243
Hey, Mark...

521
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,508
- have you seen the Schudys in here?
- Who?

522
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,912
- The parents of the Trisomy boy.
- Did he make it through surgery?

523
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,147
Yes. His 11th.

524
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,655
Susan, this is Elizabeth,
my wife. Elizabeth, Susan.

525
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,925
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

526
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,957
Susan's moving back to Chicago.

527
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,269
Would you like some coffee?

528
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,203
I don't drink coffee, I'm
breast-feeding. Excuse me.

529
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,372
She seems nice.

530
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:09,482
- Grade IV liver lac.
- Pressure's 60 over nothing.

531
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,614
Hang more blood. Suction.

532
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,486
- What are they saying?
- Hold on. They're deaf.

533
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,424
It has to go through
the text translator.

534
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,622
Ask if they can
keep him until 6:30.

535
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,597
Combination stellate lac
with elements of crush injury.

536
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:25,128
I'd start pressors if there
was something to press.

537
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,081
They can't. You have to
make other arrangements.

538
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,951
- Tell them it's an emergency!
- Your son's upset. He's crying.

539
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,273
Hang up.

540
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,775
- What?
- Just hang up.

541
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,676
555-0177. Put it on speaker.
- Who's that?

542
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:39,943
Just call it. Suction. Can we get
more lap pads? Let's pack this thing off.

543
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,122
Change it. Another clip.

544
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,517
Hey, Roger, it's Peter.

545
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,954
<i>I wouldn't ask you this,
but I have an emergency.</i>

546
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,424
<i>- I need you to pick up Reece.</i>
- Everything okay?

547
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,120
- Yeah, I'm in surgery.
<i>- Right now?</i>

548
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,164
Yeah, Jackie's not around,
and Joanie got stuck.

549
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,792
- No problem. I'll take care of it.
- All right. I'll pick him up after work.

550
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,333
Fine. Don't worry.
I'm on my way.

551
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,133
Where the hell is Vascular?

552
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,174
Dr. Mitchell is
coming in 10 minutes.

553
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,642
Damn it! BABCOCK: V-fib.

554
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,656
He's ischemic. More
blood. BABCOCK: Hold on.

555
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,842
- More blood!
- Can't go any faster.

556
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:13,110
Internal paddles. Come on.

557
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,845
- Won't work.
- Charge to 15.

558
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,717
Clear. BJERKE: Clear.

559
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,449
- Nothing.
- Charge to 30.

560
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,151
Clear. BJERKE: Clear.

561
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,989
- Let go!
- Sit still, John Thomas.

562
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,028
- Let the doctors see your head.
- It hurts!

563
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,497
- I know. We're gonna make it feel better.
- No!

564
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,694
John, we're gonna give you a
shot so your head will stop hurting.

565
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,499
My name's John Thomas,
and I don't want a shot!

566
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,472
- Daddy told you not to climb on his boat.
- I wasn't climbing!

567
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,977
- It's just gonna be a small pinch.
- I don't want a small pinch!

568
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,140
- Stop crying and we'll go to McDonald's.
- I wanna go to Toys 'R' Us!

569
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,910
- McDonald's.
- Toys 'R' Us!

570
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,415
Ow! Ow!

571
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,056
Hold still. Almost finished.

572
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,087
Stop it or I'll tell Daddy you
were climbing on his boat.

573
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,491
I'll tell Grandma you were
playing with Daddy's penis!

574
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:07,801
- I think he's going to Toys 'R' Us.
- Oh, yeah.

575
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,506
- What?
- I haven't seen you smile for a while.

576
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,081
I forgot how pretty you were.

577
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,015
Thank you.

578
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,518
I guess.

579
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,866
- Oh! Can I help you?
- Yeah.

580
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,953
- Find the big hairy spider on the loose.
- What?

581
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,094
Cleo, have you seen
Kenny Schudy's parents?

582
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,899
Not since you
sent him up to O.R.

583
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,065
- I can't find them.
- Did you try the chapel?

584
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,210
Yes. And the bathroom
and the snack areas.

585
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,710
- Maybe they went home.
- I don't know where home is.

586
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,041
- You can't be serious.
- Be like you never left.

587
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,775
Elizabeth, tell Susan what
a great place this is to work.

588
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,147
- Haven't the time.
- Either she doesn't like me...

589
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,755
- or she's mad at you.
- No, she's just focused.

590
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,289
Right.

591
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,427
Have you eaten yet?

592
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,826
- No.
- Let me buy you lunch.

593
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,796
I'm not hungry.

594
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:15,430
I want you to know I went on record
against this, but the administration...

595
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,405
- Am I being fired, Kerry?
- No.

596
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,307
No, no, of course not.

597
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:26,917
You're on a year's probation and subject
to a month's suspension without pay.

598
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,111
I argued your case to
the best of my ability.

599
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,620
But Risk Management
feels that given your history...

600
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,691
they needed to take
corrective measures...

601
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,158
- to mitigate any further incidents.
- My history?

602
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,161
The guide wire.

603
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,199
God! You're gonna use that?

604
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,036
You'll also have to resign
your Chief Residency.

605
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,800
- What?
- I understand how upsetting this must...

606
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,501
What about you? Are you
going to resign anything?

607
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,841
My involvement, or lack
thereof, is not at issue.

608
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,347
Yeah, yeah. You
made sure of that.

609
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:02,944
Look, this is only a temporary setback,
after which you'll be back on track.

610
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,182
Were you even wearing
your pager that night?

611
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,292
This isn't about me.

612
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,723
Someone obviously misdialed.

613
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,023
Yeah. Just blame
everyone but yourself, Kerry.

614
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:17,031
- Look, I'm sorry that this had to happen.
- You are not sorry.

615
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:20,331
- Just relieved.
- Jing-Mei, I...

616
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,468
Go to hell, Kerry.

617
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,337
I quit.

618
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,921
She wasn't terminated.
She resigned.

619
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,578
You needed to demote her?

620
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:41,022
Risk Management thought there
might be some liability issues involved.

621
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,889
Oh, right. I bet.

622
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,258
- What do you mean?
- This is a teaching hospital.

623
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,196
Exactly. And she was the one
who was doing the teaching.

624
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,563
Jeez, Kerry. Who are
you cutting loose next?

625
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,934
Look, I'm gonna miss her
too. This saddens me too.

626
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:59,100
It's easy for you to be upset and angry
when you don't manage the situation.

627
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,270
But guess what. I'm
angry and upset, okay?

628
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,542
I mean, I think it sucks. Only, I
don't have anyone to complain to.

629
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,480
You're asking me to
feel sorry for you now?

630
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,249
No.

631
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,415
I just wanted you to
know what was going on.

632
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,790
Hopefully, this will be the last
personnel change for a while.

633
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:18,931
I wanna hire Susan.

634
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,161
- Lewis?
- Yeah. If you have a problem with that...

635
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,997
bring it up at the
next staff meeting.

636
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,297
We need doctors, Kerry.

637
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,019
Mom and Dad stayed just
long enough to give consent?

638
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,151
It doesn't mean anything.

639
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,353
The entire document is a lie.

640
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,022
Fake phone numbers,
phony addresses.

641
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,997
I'm not even sure his
real name is Kenny.

642
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,601
God knows he can't tell us.

643
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,338
$20,000 later and only his
parents have any quality of life.

644
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,340
Probably in the Bahamas by now.

645
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,143
He requires an
enormous amount of care.

646
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,616
Obviously, it became more than
they could handle after six years.

647
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,118
Yeah.

648
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,848
- Boo-hoo.
- Robert...

649
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:24,195
it had to be extremely draining
on them physically, emotionally.

650
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,156
You wanna be a parent?

651
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,461
Shut up and do your job.

652
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,909
Nice workout, Peter. Flogging
a dead guy for an hour.

653
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,316
Probably burned 1000 calories.

654
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,215
Mrs. Warshaw.

655
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,058
He lost his job six months ago.

656
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,065
He said it was the worst
that could happen to us.

657
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,563
He lied.

658
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,737
Your husband came
in with severe injuries.

659
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,900
We tried everything we
could to save him, but...

660
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,345
he died.

661
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,015
I am sorry.

662
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,092
He never told me why
he wanted cable so bad.

663
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,825
We don't need cable.

664
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,869
Any way to stop it
from happening again?

665
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,633
Get her to stop
picking her nose.

666
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,437
- Honey.
- Did you order a beta on Karen McDuffy?

667
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,874
- The hairy woman?
- Yeah.

668
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:49,810
No. It's the only
thing I didn't order.

669
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,109
- You should have. She's pregnant.
- What?

670
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,752
Yep. I guess there really
is someone for everyone.

671
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,946
- Hi, Abby. Is Luka still here?
- No. I think he went home.

672
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:01,116
Oh, that smells
good. What is that?

673
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,454
Chocolate chip cookies
with a little oatmeal.

674
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,655
I made them to thank him. He got
his immigration lawyer to help me.

675
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,366
That Luka. What a great guy.

676
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,566
Do you want one?

677
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,262
No. They're Luka's. I would
never touch Luka's cookies.

678
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,135
- No, please. Have one.
- Are you sure?

679
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,004
Yeah. I've made plenty.
Is he working tomorrow?

680
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,907
I don't know. Is Luka
working tomorrow?

681
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,411
I don't know. I don't know.

682
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,140
Can you make sure he gets them?

683
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,308
- Sure.
- You better put these in your locker.

684
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,885
- These are good.
- Really?

685
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:32,647
- Yeah. Maybe the best I've ever tasted.
- Thank you.

686
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,315
No, thank you.

687
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,097
- All right. I appreciate it, Abby.
- Anytime.

688
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,926
Carter?

689
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,762
- I need to speak with you.
- What is it?

690
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,597
Privately.

691
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,904
Is something wrong?

692
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,277
There's not enough time...

693
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,939
for a nomination process
and, practically speaking...

694
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:02,850
it'd be better to have someone who's
familiar with both staff and procedure.

695
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,050
- You lost me.
- If you want the Chief Residency...

696
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,817
it's yours.

697
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,795
Dr. Chen resigned.

698
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,901
- Are you sure? I just talked to her.
- Twenty minutes ago.

699
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,366
Is she serious?

700
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,665
I don't assume it's
something that she'd do lightly.

701
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,968
She resigned the Chief
Residency or altogether?

702
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,576
- Altogether.
- What happened?

703
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,441
Well, it's unfortunate. I
can't talk to you about it.

704
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,544
But it has to do with the
Marfan syndrome death?

705
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,048
I can't talk about it.

706
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,088
But I want you to know that
your circumstance aside...

707
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,454
I should've chosen you for the
Chief Resident in the first place.

708
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:47,231
The truth is, you've handled yourself and
your recovery with grace and confidence.

709
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,731
And I appreciate
your professionalism.

710
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:51,765
Thank you.

711
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,272
So I assume it's a yes?

712
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,910
Can I have some
time to think about it?

713
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:09,511
Well, sure. Find me in the morning.
Get Housekeeping to clean that up.

714
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,458
You call me for something
important, but don't know where it is.

715
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,028
I know where it is. It's
just not there right now.

716
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,563
- This is crazy.
- Voilà.

717
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:24,430
How come I have a feeling this could
have waited till I finished unpacking?

718
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,094
It's all about
momentum. Open it up.

719
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:36,244
- Oh, my God. You saved this?
- Yeah. Well, someone found it...

720
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,317
a couple years ago when they moved
the laundry. I was gonna send it to you.

721
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,544
Come on.

722
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,713
Peeling paint,
the frequent fliers.

723
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,553
The lousy pay. You
know you want it.

724
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,218
This is very sweet.

725
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:55,131
- But you're not winning me over.
- I already told Kerry it's a done deal...

726
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,498
so if you pull out now, it'd
make me look really stupid.

727
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,139
- Are you serious?
- I signed you up for Tuesday.

728
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,031
- It's mildewy.
- I'll dry-clean it.

729
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,940
- Hey.
- Hey.

730
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,741
- How's he doing?
- Good. Good.

731
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,316
We played, had some spaghetti.

732
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:17,285
- Conked out about half an hour ago.
- Listen, Roger, I really appreciate this.

733
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,550
No problem. It's
nice. I miss him.

734
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,321
So how are you doing?

735
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,996
- You know, I miss Carla too.
- Yeah.

736
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,101
- You want me to get him?
- No, no, no. I got it.

737
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,995
Hey.

738
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,503
Hey. Hey, Reece.

739
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,804
Listen. Time to go home.

740
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,608
Come on. Come on. It's late.

741
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,519
No. We can't.

742
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,018
We must go home.

743
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,354
- Reece, come on. ROGER:
He's half-asleep, Peter.

744
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,694
- You should let him stay the night.
- I don't wanna bother you.

745
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,456
It's no bother.

746
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,306
Bye.

747
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,150
- I can drop him off in the morning.
- No, no. I'll come by.

748
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,983
- What time?
- Nine.

749
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,148
- Sure.
- All right.

750
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,716
I always knew she was
capable of stuff like this.

751
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,585
I guess I fooled myself into
thinking that she wouldn't do it to me.

752
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,794
Has she offered you the job yet?

753
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:40,462
- I'm not sure that I want it.
- Yes, you do. You've always wanted it.

754
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,896
I'll pass if it
means you'll stay.

755
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,560
You should take it. I don't
wanna be here anymore.

756
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,503
Really.

757
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:53,235
If it's not you, it'll be somebody
else. And I'd rather it be you.

758
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,646
You gonna try and
stay in Chicago?

759
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,782
I don't know.

760
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:01,419
There's still a spot
open at Northwestern.

761
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:10,985
Promise me, John, that whatever
sacrifice you make for this place...

762
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,631
you just make
sure it's worth it.

763
00:42:58,276 --> 00:42:59,869
How's it going?

764
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:03,378
- Fine. Vodka, please.
- On the rocks?

765
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,044
Neat.

766
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,854
Here you go.

767
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:19,061
- Another round?
- Yeah, four. Thanks.
