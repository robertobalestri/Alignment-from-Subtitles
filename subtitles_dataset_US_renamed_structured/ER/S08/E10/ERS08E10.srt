1
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,012
The Phoenix Suns.
- Is that a crime?

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,174
- You root for the Phoenix Suns?
- I paid attention to basketball there.

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,946
- You grew up in Chicago.
- I dated a guy with tickets.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,683
- You didn't pay attention to the Bulls?
- Whatever. I'm starving.

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,191
Big Diamondbacks
fan too, aren't you?

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,162
- I'm gonna get breakfast out of this deal.
- Sorry. My manners.

7
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,061
- Roach coach?
- You live in a mansion...

8
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,237
- you're buying me a doughnut?
- I'll spring for the coffee too.

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,837
Hey there, big spender.

10
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,842
Hello. JACK: <i>John, it's Dad.</i>

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,808
- Hey. How was your flight?
<i>- How's Gamma doing?</i>

12
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,641
Yeah. No, she was walking
around a little bit yesterday.

13
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,305
<i>- Great.</i>
- I meet her for lunch.

14
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,749
- You wanna hook up there?
- You're getting me a yogurt too.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,151
What's that? Grab me a bagel.

16
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,383
<i>- For the holiday.</i>
- Really.

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,925
- No, that's great.
<i>- See you at the house.</i>

18
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,656
- Yeah, okay. I'll see you there.
<i>- Bye.</i>

19
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,998
- They're staying for the holidays.
- Your parents?

20
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,195
First time in nine years.

21
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,203
- Just like sex, isn't it, Peter?
- What?

22
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,174
Vascular surgery. Messy, fun, and
when done right, you leave satisfied.

23
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,508
D5 half-normal, 125 cc's per hour.
- Surgery.

24
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,014
- Real good hands in there, Peter.
- Thank you.

25
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,244
Which is why you get to assist
me in the Millburn surgery.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,117
Fifth District alderman wants
his cardiac bypass done here.

27
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,586
Why?

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,522
The correct response is,
"Thanks, Dr. Romano. I'm honored."

29
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,959
- I am...
- Clear his calendar for Monday afternoon.

30
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,394
- I need to talk.
- He's on trauma call in the ER.

31
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,433
Dump that on Corday. She
actually likes it down there.

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,197
- I have a situation with my son.
- What else is new?

33
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,102
- I need more flexible hours.
- In by 12, out by 4...

34
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,711
- we all make the evening news.
- I'm not just talking about this surgery.

35
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,609
If you're not interested, Peter, pass.
I've got 20 guys who'd kill for this gig.

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,081
- I didn't say I wasn't interested...
- So are you in or out?

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,784
- I'm in.
- Did I ever tell you you're my hero?

38
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:58,706
Ho, ho, ho, merry
Christmas! Ho, ho, ho.

39
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,247
- Feed the poor? Feed the poor?
- Sorry.

40
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,317
- Hey, feed the poor?
- Sorry.

41
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:08,615
Come on. You think it's easy being
a female Santa in a man's world?

42
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,224
Sorry, no soliciting. You
have to leave the premises.

43
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,385
- I work for the Salvation Army.
- Oh, do you? Let me see your ID.

44
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,555
- Okay, I eat at the Salvation Army.
- Get out of here. Hey!

45
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,292
I'm gonna call the cops.
Stop ringing that damn bell!

46
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,794
- Luka, you're late.
- Sorry.

47
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:28,170
Don't be sorry, be punctual. This
is a hospital, not a department store.

48
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,745
- When's she on Christmas vacation?
- Scrooge? Never.

49
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,675
- Merry Christmas. County.
- I think she thinks you were shopping.

50
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,875
Shopping for what?

51
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,279
It's a joke.

52
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,651
What's going on?

53
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,521
I went to the bar. No
one's heard anything.

54
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,619
- About Nicole?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,162
They said she took
money there too.

56
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,701
Guess you were right.
She lied about everything.

57
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,474
Hey, Abby. Can you run
Cynthia Cohen's sputum?

58
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,374
I got a couple of kids with
snow-related injuries! Quiet!

59
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:12,008
- Freak, freak, freak, freak...
- Hey! Shut up! Both of you, shut up!

60
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,349
Be glad you're not sleeping in
a grate or eating out of the trash!

61
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,888
Nyah!

62
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,650
- Haleh, get them out of here.
- Stop!

63
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,728
- You, this side. You, over here.
- Freak, freak, freak, freak...

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,889
Since when did Fire and Rescue start
transporting pediatric walk-in cases?

65
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,559
Since these two took
headers out by the firehouse.

66
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,832
- You notify the parents?
- Yeah, I left word.

67
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,908
- Hey, you didn't call.
- Sorry?

68
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,739
About getting together.
You change your mind?

69
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,881
- No, I was just...
- Dr. Weaver, Exam 1 has chest pains.

70
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,244
- Be right there.
- Dynamic changes on the EKG.

71
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,187
I'll let you get
back to work, okay?

72
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:53,259
Three nitro sprays and
titrate six of morphine.

73
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,860
Cops found him wandering around O'Hare
with a suitcase but no ticket and no ID.

74
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,262
He fell on the escalator
trying to get away.

75
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,402
I'm missing my flight.

76
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,367
Lacerations down to the galea.

77
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,939
I go home for Christmas
every year, I think.

78
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:11,272
- Looks intact. No sign of fracture.
- Which doesn't explain the amnesia.

79
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,276
Doesn't know who he
is, where he's going.

80
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,574
I know there's
lots of kids around.

81
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,048
And the women make
a wonderful supper.

82
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,119
Blood supply looks good.

83
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:24,281
Well, Plastics should be
able to tack it back down.

84
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,619
We still need to get a head CT.

85
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:32,198
Boys and the men, they settle
around the TV watching sports.

86
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,096
You think his memory
loss is temporary?

87
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,400
Peter?

88
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,767
He's 4 years old.

89
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,273
And deaf and traumatized
by the death of his mother.

90
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,970
- I emphasized all of that. Thank you.
- Well, then appeal it.

91
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,638
- I can't.
- What am I paying you for?

92
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,808
He denied the motion,
Peter. It's not irreparable.

93
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,149
The hell it isn't. He's asking my son
to decide which of us loves him more?

94
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:57,655
It won't be that specific.

95
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,157
Will he ask who makes
better macaroni and cheese?

96
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:05,964
Judge Alter has feels that interviewing
Reece will provide relevant insight.

97
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,465
Reece knows what's
going on. He can sense it.

98
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,968
How much more damage
do you want to inflict on him?

99
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:16,073
Hey, I agreed to represent you.
You're the one who's choosing to fight.

100
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,338
You can preempt this. His
attorney approached me yesterday.

101
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:19,774
No.

102
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:22,015
They'll make a revised
visitation request.

103
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,480
I said, no.

104
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,918
And I need to be honest.

105
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:33,455
We don't have the edge here. On paper,
Roger comes across as the better father.

106
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:37,029
If I were his attorney, I would
advise him to give you no more deals.

107
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,859
Yet you're advising
me to accept one?

108
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,558
I am advising you to
at least listen to one.

109
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,535
- You're still here.
- I was on my way out.

110
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,702
- Keep those kids from killing each other?
- Yeah. One has a corneal abrasion...

111
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,145
the other has a strained
wrist. Look, hey...

112
00:06:56,316 --> 00:07:01,687
- I'm not very good at this.
- What, follow-up?

113
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,216
Want to have lunch tomorrow?

114
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,360
- No sushi.
- What?

115
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,793
- I don't like sushi.
- Okay. Anything you want.

116
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,728
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

117
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,632
Why is he here? Somebody
finally kick his butt?

118
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,738
- Who?
- Mr. Karaoke over there.

119
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:23,172
How about a little "Jingle Bell Rock"?
- You know him?

120
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:27,075
Oh, yeah, Stan? He lives behind a
dumpster on 57th and Dorchester.

121
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,081
- He's homeless? LOPEZ:
Unless you count the dumpster.

122
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,118
Hello. STAN: Hello.

123
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,256
- Where you going?
- Whatever that lady said, it's not true.

124
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,257
- Your name isn't Stan?
- No, no, no.

125
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,860
- You don't live at 57th and Dorchester?
- I don't remember. That's why I'm here.

126
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,055
Mm-hm.

127
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,033
This Stan character sounds
rough. Bet he's got a record.

128
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,607
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- And no family to speak of.

129
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,403
- No place to spend the holidays.
- You know, if he was smart...

130
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,911
he'd clean himself up, get
himself a suit at the Goodwill...

131
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,879
And go to the airport.

132
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,584
You mind if I stay a while?
It's kind of Christmassy here.

133
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,418
The alderman thinks you're such a
brilliant surgeon, then you operate.

134
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,617
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

135
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,659
Hey. What's going on?

136
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,896
- Waiting for Roger and his lawyer.
- I thought we were seeing the judge.

137
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,127
- We're hoping that won't be necessary.
- Peter, what's going on?

138
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:28,071
- They wanna talk about some deal.
- Sorry we're late. We ran into traffic.

139
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,472
We don't have a lot of
time. What have you got?

140
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,738
Visitation every other weekend,
plus two weeks during the summer.

141
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,613
- One week during the summer.
- No.

142
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,685
- We only ask for 38 days.
- 31 days.

143
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,612
- I said, no.
- Peter, it's only 31 days.

144
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,088
- I'm not doing this.
- Peter, listen to me.

145
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,696
No. You listen to me, all of you.
I'm not negotiating over my son.

146
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,294
Rather take your
chances with the judge?

147
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:57,733
A martini in first class works
just as well and takes less time.

148
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:04,003
Like you, I enjoy the occasional
drive. Gives you time to clear your head.

149
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,304
- Hey, Dad.
- John.

150
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,108
Did you know your father's
been here since last night?

151
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,513
Late last night. He
went straight to the hotel.

152
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,678
- Oh, God. Am I dying?
- Rigor mortis hasn't set in just yet.

153
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,314
Why else would my son deign
to spend Christmas with us?

154
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,518
Mom's coming too.

155
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:26,689
- I knew there was a catch.
- Eleanor will be here later this week.

156
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,826
- You'll stay at the house until then?
- Sure, why not.

157
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,803
Wonderful. Here's Helga
to turn me like a pancake.

158
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:38,741
- We'll give you some privacy.
- I'd settle for a little dignity.

159
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,212
Believe it or not, she's thrilled.
This means the world to her.

160
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,149
- This year more than most.
- Well, I suppose.

161
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,812
Means a lot to me too.

162
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,686
Yeah. It should be fun, huh?

163
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:58,225
Reece, I have to
make a decision.

164
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,664
I need you to help me by
answering some questions.

165
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,770
Can you do that?

166
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,498
Okay...

167
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,973
Who's that?

168
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,379
Daddy.

169
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,077
And who's that?

170
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,581
My other daddy.

171
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,918
You love both your
daddies very much, right?

172
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,794
He says he doesn't know.

173
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:41,735
When you are sick, who
makes you feel better?

174
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,044
Mommy.

175
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:49,808
Which daddy gives you the best
care when you get a boo-boo?

176
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,619
He has Band-Aids with cartoons.

177
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,471
Right now, I'd say
he needs consistency.

178
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,140
Reece, Carla and I. The
three of us were a family.

179
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,475
That's how we planned our lives.

180
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,148
That's how we approached
every day, every week.

181
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,219
I've been with Reece
through earaches...

182
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:36,227
flus, almost every
scrape he's ever gotten.

183
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:43,394
If you count the hours that
I've spent with my stepson...

184
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,836
it far exceeds the time Dr. Benton has
spent with the child he believed to be his.

185
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,910
Reece and Carla were my life.

186
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,808
And now Reece is my life.

187
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,512
He comes first.

188
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:02,512
Ahead of my personal
needs, ahead of my job.

189
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,388
And I think that's
in his best interest.

190
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:19,196
- Oh, John. Diverse selection.
- Burgers are good.

191
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,705
You already know what you want?
I'm still working on what to drink.

192
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,272
This is nice. Haven't
done this for a while.

193
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,279
Had lunch together?
Or Christmas?

194
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,111
Both.

195
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,949
So...

196
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,148
What kind of business keeps
Mom in Costa Rica in December?

197
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,054
How's the chopped salad?

198
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:48,198
She broke her hip, Dad. Mom
can't spend five minutes with her?

199
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,065
Is she gonna avoid
her for the whole month?

200
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,435
Your mother's not coming.
John, we're getting divorced.

201
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,136
- What? Divorced?
- It's amicable.

202
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,578
After 30 years?

203
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,215
- What happened?
- This probably isn't the best...

204
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:14,851
- Is there somebody else?
- Neither of us is running off with anyone.

205
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,731
What is it, she's not happy? She's
bored? Wants to stay in Europe?

206
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,061
I'm the one who's leaving, John.

207
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,597
This can't surprise you.
You saw it before I did.

208
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,840
- Can I take your order?
- I was suffocating. I think we're ready.

209
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,378
Chopped salad, please.

210
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,551
Burger medium-rare, please.

211
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:47,088
I agree that consistency is the
best thing for Reece right now.

212
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,121
See, I...

213
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:55,061
I let Carla take on a lot of the
parenting while I pursued my career.

214
00:13:55,234 --> 00:14:01,265
But I did that because it felt right
to leave Reece in his mother's care.

215
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,577
But all that's changed now.

216
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,640
And my responsibilities
have changed too.

217
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,981
Because of that I've made
arrangements to work fewer hours...

218
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,317
so I can become
Reece's full-time caretaker.

219
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,755
- At County General?
- Yes, sir.

220
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,123
What sort of hour reduction
are we talking about?

221
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,433
7 a.m. to 5 p.m.
weekdays, weekends off.

222
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,667
You can provide proof
of this new schedule?

223
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,562
Yes, sir. Yes, I can.

224
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,307
Have it in my
office by day's end.

225
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,277
Unless there is anything
else, court's adjourned.

226
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,514
I need to talk to him
now. Well, pull him out.

227
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,243
Fine. Let him know
I'm on my way.

228
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,016
- Going back to work?
- Get out of my way.

229
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,626
- Got another shift?
- Roger, get out of my way!

230
00:14:54,794 --> 00:15:00,131
Where's Reece? Let me guess:
Jackie. No, Cleo. A nanny?

231
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,861
- You want me to hit your car?
- You lied, man.

232
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,631
On top of everything else,
you're a liar. And a perjurer.

233
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,673
You know what?
You need to back off.

234
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,537
Whatever it takes, is that
it? He's not a trophy, man!

235
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:19,117
You can't win at any cost
to give your sister a son!

236
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,810
- You gotta raise him!
- You know...

237
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,616
Go ahead, get in
my face. Come on.

238
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,387
- Roger, you need to shut your mouth.
- Think, Peter.

239
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,891
You can't change who you are.

240
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,532
I'm sure it was on this block. It's
called Nazim. It's got a blue awning.

241
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,233
- Well, I don't see it.
- We must have missed it.

242
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,846
- I don't like Indian food anyway.
- Why didn't you say something?

243
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:50,541
- I just did.
- Why don't we go to that Italian place...

244
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,550
- across the street. Great risotto.
- Wait a minute.

245
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,588
- That'd be great if it weren't closed.
- You're a pain in the ass, you know that?

246
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,693
- Well, some say.
- I'm starting to regret this whole thing.

247
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,730
- Too bad. I'm starving.
- Forget about looking for a decent place.

248
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:10,063
- Why don't we go home and order in.
- I like a take-charge kind of girl.

249
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,263
- My apartment?
- Lead the way.

250
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,208
- Dr. Romano.
- You hear something?

251
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:21,370
- I need to talk to you.
- That's a doctor who breaks promises...

252
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,176
then hangs up on the guy
he breaks the promises with.

253
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,649
- I need to talk to you now.
- Talk is cheap, Peter.

254
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,379
I need to scale back my
hours and I need it in writing.

255
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,388
- "To whom it may concern: No way."
- I'm serious.

256
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,188
- Is this about your kid?
- Yeah.

257
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,093
What do you need?
Every other Saturday?

258
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,832
No nights. No weekends.

259
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,167
Good one. I like the one
about the rabbi and the goldfish.

260
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,366
- I need to spend more time at home.
- Never needed to before.

261
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,512
- His mother died.
- His stepfather is still alive.

262
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,909
Split custody, keep
doing what you do best.

263
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,707
I'm not asking for your advice.

264
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,216
News flash! This is
an urban trauma center.

265
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,379
Until people plan their MVAs and
GSWs better, you won't punch a time clock.

266
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,890
That's not me being a hard-ass,
that's the job. You are a surgeon.

267
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,258
- Are you gonna do this for me or not?
- Not. Work when I need you or not at all.

268
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,395
Then consider
this my resignation.

269
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:19,865
All right, all right, all right.
Don't go getting dramatic.

270
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,770
- Weekends off.
- And what about weekdays?

271
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,409
It's my best offer,
Peter. Take it or leave it.

272
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,788
I'll finish out the week.

273
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:43,296
Are you really gonna do this?
Throw your career to play Mr. Mom?

274
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,928
What a waste!

275
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,030
- Hi. Newborn for the nursery.
- Hey.

276
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,761
- Birth in the ER?
- Marshall Field's.

277
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,373
Mother was last-minute
shopping. She's on her way up.

278
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,908
- The paramedics delivered?
- No, a shoe salesman.

279
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,439
Wow.

280
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,317
- Room 424, do you have a chart?
- Was she an ER patient?

281
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,325
I just have to follow
up on something.

282
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,437
- How far along was she?
- Eight weeks. No complications.

283
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,973
- She's in Recovery for a few more hours.
- Thanks.

284
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:35,313
- Dr. Finch, please.
- I'm not sure she's here. Let me check.

285
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,507
All right, thanks.

286
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,286
- What are you doing here?
- I need to meet the Surgicenter director.

287
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,620
- You gave him my CV, right?
- Yeah, but...

288
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,592
- I quit County.
- Romano wouldn't give you the hours?

289
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,858
You said there's a
position here. I want it.

290
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,860
- I'll introduce you tomorrow.
- I gotta show proof of employment now.

291
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,040
- Peter, he's probably gone for the day.
- Check, please.

292
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:07,043
- I just started, he barely knows me.
- Cleo, I need to talk to him.

293
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,712
- Hi. I thought you left.
- Tonight.

294
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,985
Luka has been looking for
you. Could you wait, please?

295
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,063
- Do you need something?
- You told him you weren't pregnant.

296
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,061
- I'm not.
- I don't understand.

297
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,757
You don't need to.

298
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,064
- Look, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
- No, you were right.

299
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:40,771
He did everything he could. I thought
his kindness was love. But it's not.

300
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,676
Abby, he deserves not to know.

301
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,318
Thanks.

302
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,421
Tuesday's impossible. He's
got colorectal procedures then.

303
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:02,261
Fissurectomy at 7.
Hemorrhoidectomy at 8. Another at 9.

304
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,701
And it looks like he's squeezed
in an inguinal hernia too.

305
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,670
<i>- Maybe for lunch?</i>
- No, he's got a lunch date.

306
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:13,108
<i>- After that?</i>
- After that, he sees patients until 5.

307
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,874
<i>- How about Thursday?</i>
- Thursday might work, actually.

308
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,783
Judge Alter! Judge Alter!

309
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,191
I got that employment
letter for you.

310
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,465
- I wanted this yesterday.
- I know. It came in after-hours.

311
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,498
- This is not your hospital.
- No.

312
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:44,973
- Schaumburg Surgicenter?
- I worked out a better situation there.

313
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,914
- All in the last 12 hours?
- It was always a possibility.

314
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,610
- It just needed to be ironed out.
- You didn't mention it yesterday.

315
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,585
I know. I said I'd cut
back my hours and I did.

316
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,248
- True.
- I'm now working 8 to 5, no weekends.

317
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,360
- This letter confirms it.
- That may be so.

318
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:05,225
But you told a different story
yesterday. And I don't like being lied to.

319
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,991
I'm doing what I
have to do for my son.

320
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,542
Hey, Elizabeth.
You sneaking coffee?

321
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,714
Tea. You look nice.
Are you going on a date?

322
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,543
No. Court date.

323
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,618
- Right. What's the latest?
- It's out of my hands now.

324
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:36,826
- It's best to keep busy while you wait.
- I owe a lot of hours before I go.

325
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,961
- Before you go?
- Yeah. End of the week, I'm out of here.

326
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,670
- What?
- Yeah, I had to quit.

327
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,876
- You're not serious.
- I need to change my life.

328
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,908
Romano won't cut me any slack.

329
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,380
Yeah, but I'm sure he'll
make some accommodation.

330
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,848
No. I asked. He won't.

331
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,515
You'd really leave County?

332
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,421
I gotta go.

333
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,187
How'd he fall?

334
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,024
Hanging lights on the house.
Parents are signing him in.

335
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,258
- What do we got?
- Fell from a ladder.

336
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,595
- Parents are here.
- Is he okay?

337
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,704
- Has he been unconscious?
- His sister put the hose on him.

338
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,569
- He woke up for a second.
- Did he hit anything?

339
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,074
- A bike. CARTER: I
got involuntary guarding.

340
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,712
He's waking up. That's good, yes?
- Coming through.

341
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,113
- What do we have?
- Possible liver or splenic lac.

342
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,414
- Stable, but might need to go to the O.R.
- HemoCue?

343
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,457
- Second is eight from 10.
- Does your belly hurt?

344
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,618
All right. He's stable
for CT. Control the pain.

345
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,297
- Watch him overnight.
- He has free fluid by ultrasound.

346
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,695
I won't remove the
spleen before we have to.

347
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,836
- Remove?
- He can still live without one.

348
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,364
- I can give him mine.
- That's not necessary.

349
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,531
- Someone'll match.
- We don't transplant spleens.

350
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,201
I'll show you where the waiting room is.
- We can at least give blood.

351
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,658
She's going down. JOE: Amparo!

352
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,474
Ma'am, you okay?

353
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,046
- Have you fainted before?
- Never.

354
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,916
How do you serve
Christmas dinner for them?

355
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:16,153
Start cooking early. No problem.

356
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:20,891
O.R.'s got elective cases they
can push. How's she doing?

357
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,766
- Please, I'm fine. Tell me about Ben.
- Blood counts are stable. Good.

358
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,464
His first CT only
shows a small injury.

359
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,133
His school band plays in a
concert on New Year's Eve.

360
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,801
I don't want him to miss it.

361
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,341
- How long have you had this node?
- I don't know.

362
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,246
Is this tender?

363
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,115
You don't have to
examine me or run tests.

364
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,654
I know I'm sick.

365
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,317
Have you been
diagnosed with something?

366
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,892
Lymphoma.

367
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,929
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,003
- Don't tell them, though.
- Your family doesn't know?

369
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,307
There will be plenty of
time to talk after Christmas.

370
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,339
Dr. Benton? Janice Prager called.
She wants you to meet her in court.

371
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:12,383
- Go. I'll get another surgeon.
- Your son will be fine.

372
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,281
Good.

373
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:20,186
- They got me right in the store.
- It's tough to hide two pairs of skates.

374
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,353
- The guard jumped me in front of my kids.
- Can we keep the ice skates?

375
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,055
No.

376
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,565
They hate getting used
stuff. I thought for Christmas...

377
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,068
They wanna take you
to the station house.

378
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,173
I know.

379
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,736
Do you have someone
to stay with them?

380
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,176
Their mother?

381
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,221
I'll be right back. Abby?

382
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,255
- Are you gonna be in jail for Christmas?
- I don't know.

383
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,039
Maybe I should
post bail for him.

384
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:12,607
They have no money. Do you know
where they've been living? In a motel room.

385
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,738
- Probably can't pay a security deposit.
- No, he has a job. But it's $5.15 an hour.

386
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,783
He has to steal to get his kids
a decent Christmas present.

387
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,683
- Could call the food bank.
- No, they help out this time of year.

388
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,052
What happens to
them in three months?

389
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,624
There's only so much you can do.

390
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,054
Yeah, I guess.

391
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,605
I just...

392
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,132
Miss your kids?

393
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,510
Yeah.

394
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,381
Sorry.

395
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,522
It's worse at Christmas.

396
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,601
Oh, right.

397
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,430
- Where's the judge?
- In chambers.

398
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,010
- Gentlemen, your counsel with you?
- They're on the way.

399
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:21,011
While we wait for Ms.
Prager and Mr. Wharton...

400
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,116
I was wondering if I could
talk with Reece once more.

401
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,049
- Only if you both agree, of course.
- Sure.

402
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,589
- I don't see why not.
- Thank you.

403
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,192
Nancy, will you ask
him to come with me?

404
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,466
It's okay.

405
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,962
Go on.

406
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,838
It's okay. Go, go.

407
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,701
Just Reece this time.

408
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:14,857
He'll have exploratory surgery.
They'll repair any injuries he might have.

409
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,798
- He'll be home for the holidays?
- Wait and see how he does.

410
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,910
So we celebrate a day or two late.
It doesn't matter. Thank you, doctor!

411
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:30,372
- Did you get him upstairs?
- Along with his parents, aunts, cousins...

412
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,247
Hope they all fit
in the waiting room.

413
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,184
You ready for this?

414
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:43,426
God. I forgot. I mean, I didn't
forget. It's at home, yours.

415
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:47,259
I don't know where
my head is at, though.

416
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,934
Do you wanna open it anyway?

417
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:56,569
- Can we wait?
- Sure.

418
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,711
Sorry.

419
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,141
Is something wrong?

420
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,445
- I'm having family problems.
- Your grandma?

421
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,781
No, no. It's my mother.

422
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:16,128
She's not coming home for the
holidays. She and my father are...

423
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,593
splitting up.

424
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,259
- Oh, no.
- I don't think it's sunk in yet.

425
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,432
- Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
- How do you figure?

426
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:31,371
- Did you ever meet my parents?
- I met Cookie.

427
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,943
Right. She and Henry aren't
divorced, and they should be.

428
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,811
- Still, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

429
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,825
I'm so self-centered. I thought
it was something to do with me.

430
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,788
No. You're about the only
thing going right in my life.

431
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,463
- You shouldn't let this happen.
- Didn't want to be defensive.

432
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:59,799
- What did he think of your new job?
- He wasn't overly impressed.

433
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,931
There you are.

434
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,241
Thank you for all rushing over.

435
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,074
Be seated.

436
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,950
We are in a unique situation.

437
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,355
In a traditional custody
case, win or lose...

438
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,653
the parents maintain...

439
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,297
the title given to
them by their biology.

440
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,490
They're still Mommy and Daddy.

441
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:32,001
Here I'm asked to declare that one
of these two men is not, in fact, Daddy.

442
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:37,632
But they both love Reece and
have made sacrifices to be with him...

443
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:42,008
though I will say Dr. Benton's
effort was late in the game.

444
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,877
And I am uncomfortable
about the way he handled it.

445
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,346
Not convinced he was
exactly forthright with the court.

446
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:54,516
But the fact is that I do believe Reece
would thrive in either of your households.

447
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,219
And that makes my
decision even harder.

448
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,366
But based on the evidence
provided by Dr. Benton...

449
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:04,162
that he will be more available
as a parent in the future...

450
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:08,273
and the fact that Reece has
always believed him to be his father...

451
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,143
the court grants
custody to Peter Benton.

452
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:17,509
Mr. McGrath will be given visitation
with Reece every other Saturday.

453
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,019
The court calls a
20-minute recess.

454
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,904
We might have to go get one.

455
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,074
- Use the angel.
- No, I always have a star.

456
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,911
Okay, here we go. One, two, three.
- Yay!

457
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,453
Yes, it is pretty.
You finish your part?

458
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:08,099
Hey, baby. Come here. Come
over here. Come lay under the tree.

459
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,835
- You should get going.
- I got a half an hour.

460
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:22,970
- Going to be late for your last shift.
- What are they gonna do? Fire me?

461
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:30,150
- What are we doing?
- It's the best way to look at a tree.

462
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:34,282
When I was Reece's age,
I used to do this for hours.

463
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,918
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

464
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:42,459
Hey, how long is the
commute to Schaumburg?

465
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,833
- Depends on when you leave.
- I was thinking, if we both work there...

466
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,871
Yeah?

467
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,544
Maybe we should relocate.

468
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,744
We?

469
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,511
Yeah.

470
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:06,623
This whole thing
has made me focus.

471
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:11,628
It's like all my life I've
been chasing something.

472
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,323
That time when I can...

473
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:19,869
make it into the end
zone and spike the ball.

474
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,174
It took almost losing
my son to realize...

475
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,972
the end zone's not out there.

476
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,575
It's right here.

477
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,350
You're good raw material.
I can work with you.

478
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:40,354
- Oh, you can?
- Yeah. I have to get you in shape.

479
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,392
- What kind of shape?
- Ay-ay-ay.

480
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:53,430
- Hey, you found it.
- I knew it was in one of those boxes.

481
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,734
Want to put it up
there? All right, come on.

482
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:04,243
Yay. That's good.

483
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,783
- I'm working New Year's Eve?
- Someone has to.

484
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,716
- Someone else. OLBES:
Six-year-old, GSW.

485
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,447
- Please save him.
- What happened?

486
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,286
.38 caliber, right thorax,
crossed the midline.

487
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,723
- Vitals?
- BP, 70/30. Pulse, 130.

488
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,556
He's so pale.

489
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,324
You his mother? What's his name?

490
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,962
- What's his name?
- Teddy.

491
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:25,729
Decreased breath sounds. Full
trauma panel. He needs a chest tube.

492
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,736
- It's the two of us.
- How did it happen?

493
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,841
I shot him.

494
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:36,244
Surgery. Yes, that was
Matt on the pay phone.

495
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,822
Peter.

496
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,088
I guess I should
say congratulations.

497
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,297
Did you really get a new job?

498
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,066
You gonna call me a liar again?

499
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,764
- Here you are, Christmas Eve.
- Yeah, well, it's my last shift.

500
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,307
What's your excuse?

501
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,912
I wanted to give you
Reece's Christmas presents.

502
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,280
You can leave them over there.

503
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,683
- See you in two Saturdays.
- Yeah.

504
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,154
Merry Christmas.

505
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,325
Hey, Roger.

506
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:28,399
Come over to the house tomorrow
and give them to him yourself.

507
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,665
Thanks.

508
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,834
I'm not doing it for you.

509
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,971
Surgery. Dr. Benton, the ER.

510
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,715
- Sux on board.
- Our tree's by the window.

511
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,478
- 5 1/2 ET tube. PAULA:
There've been many break-ins.

512
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,146
- O-neg's running. Systolic's at 70.
- Call for a vent.

513
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,316
- I was sleeping. I had the flu.
- 10 blade.

514
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,957
- He was supposed to be in bed.
- Long vascular clamp.

515
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,792
He dropped an ornament. I
thought someone was breaking in.

516
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,491
I'm in. Bag him.

517
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:06,564
- GSW?
- 6-year-old accidentally shot by his mom.

518
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,872
Heart rate's down to 30.

519
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,337
- Lost his pulse. Starting compressions.
- Thoracotomy tray.

520
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,677
- What does that mean?
- We'll open his chest, repair the damage.

521
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,751
- Four more units of blood.
- Scalpel.

522
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,473
- Oh, God! CARTER:
Paula, come with me.

523
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,853
500 cc's out the right side.

524
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,524
- Ready with the rib-spreader.
- Suction on high.

525
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,594
All right. Hang on, hang on.

526
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,263
Crank it now. Come on.

527
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,099
Looks like two liters in there.
- Damn it.

528
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,364
Pericardium's filled
with blood. 15 blade.

529
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,870
Call the O.R. We got a
red blanket. Page Romano.

530
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,545
- Who shoots a 6-year-old?
- Thought he was a burglar.

531
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,239
A burglar shaking presents?
- 10 blade.

532
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,681
- I'll clamshell the chest.
- Sternal saw.

533
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,754
We going through the motions?
BENTON: Knife back. Metz.

534
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:00,585
Guess we are. BENTON:
Pick-ups. Come on, pick-ups!

535
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:04,526
Damn it. Here's a
fragment of the slug.

536
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:07,723
- Looks weird.
- Saw. Let's move.

537
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,595
Black Talon. Fragmenting bullet.

538
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,066
Fragments at the hilum.

539
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,104
Like razor blades all over him.
- That's the point.

540
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,018
Order more FFP? - On its way.

541
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,943
Lost cause. Fragments
in all chambers.

542
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,738
God knows what
hit the great vessels.

543
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,107
Dr. Corday is here.

544
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,112
She'll love being
brought in on this.

545
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,717
What do we have? - Organ donor.

546
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,878
- BP dropping, 60/30.
- Hang two units packed cells.

547
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,048
- He'll go into DIC.
- We'll stay ahead with platelets.

548
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,544
We've got other surgeries.

549
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,221
Looks like a transverse
colon injury and dead bowel.

550
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:41,127
I'm still in the chest. Repaired
defects to the left ventricle, right hilum.

551
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,463
- Brought your magic wand?
- Help me or get the hell out.

552
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:47,401
Knock yourself out, Peter.
Either way, you're gone.

553
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,440
We need to rebuild the IVC
from the kidneys caudally.

554
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,012
More 2-0 silk on a Teflon pledget.
Come on. Keep them coming.

555
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,980
Peter. BENTON: We
can do this, all right?

556
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,852
Prep a venous cardiac snare.

557
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,162
Did I kill him?

558
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,195
We don't know
what his chances are.

559
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:24,773
But he does have the best
surgeons I know working on him.

560
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,643
How could I do this?

561
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,480
You were scared.

562
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,852
- I keep telling God how sorry I am.
- That's all you can do.

563
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,954
I don't even believe in God.

564
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,329
Teddy never gets up from bed.

565
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,298
I just wanted to protect our
home. I never thought he'd...

566
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,968
You want me to
take you to the O.R.?

567
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,012
- Turn off the heat.
- Another Vicryl.

568
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,842
GI stapler. CORDAY: Not
much stool in abdominal.

569
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,643
Good sign. I expected more.

570
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,184
Gut's done. What's the pressure?

571
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:11,323
80/40. Well, that's something.

572
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,049
Let me get another clip.
- Not much.

573
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,093
Here we go. SMV is done.

574
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,163
Cut.

575
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,326
Shirley, take down the
balloon on the Pruitt.

576
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,863
Here we go. Catheter out.
- Balloon down.

577
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,340
Throw in a good knot,
see if he stops bleeding.

578
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,739
Come on, Teddy.
Come on, man. Come on.

579
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,052
Look at that.

580
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,224
- Yeah.
- That's incredible.

581
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:54,555
Yeah. Well, all right. Here
we go. Releasing the clamp.

582
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:59,527
How the hell did you do that?
- I have no idea.

583
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,601
Let's make sure of the count.

584
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,809
Is that the mother? - Yeah.

585
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:12,576
You go tell her. I'll close up.
- Okay. Thanks, Elizabeth.

586
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:18,712
- Peter, that was remarkable.
- Little going-away present.

587
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,260
Despite anything Romano may say,
this place is really gonna miss you.

588
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:27,092
I wish I could say the same.
- Wasn't all that bad.

589
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,598
We had our moments.

590
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:41,769
Your son lost a lot of blood. However,
we were able to repair the damage.

591
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:45,610
He's got a long road ahead
of him, but he's gonna make it.

592
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,780
I don't know how to thank you.

593
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,620
Just get the gun
out of your house.

594
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,775
I guess Santa didn't buy
you that bike you asked for.

595
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,713
- Carter, what are you doing here?
- Cleo told me this was on your route.

596
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,875
- Come on. You want to join me?
- No.

597
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,682
If I wanna get my heart rate
up, I'll have another cup of coffee.

598
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,888
Got your message.

599
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,196
Guess there's no way
to talk you out of it, huh?

600
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,195
No. Done deal.

601
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,260
I got you something.

602
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,330
- Carter...
- Open it.

603
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,274
You're a tough guy to shop for.

604
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,114
An El token?

605
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:05,423
Second week of my surgical
internship we got 11 traumas in one night.

606
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:10,585
5 a.m., we were still patching together
a girl that had been dragged under a car.

607
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:15,729
I was so tired I couldn't see straight.
I asked you if I could take a break...

608
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,562
and you kicked
me out of the O.R.

609
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,498
I couldn't drive home, I was
exhausted. I started crying in the hallway.

610
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,166
You came out of surgery
and you gave me that.

611
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,575
You said I could use
it to go home. Or...

612
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:35,778
I could commit to what I was doing
and use it to come back the next day.

613
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,126
No Rolex, huh?

614
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,531
If you get tired of Schaumburg,
you can use it to come back.

615
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:55,764
- Carter, they don't use tokens anymore.
- Then call.

616
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,203
And I'll come pick you up.

617
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,044
- Look, I want you to know...
- I know.

618
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,015
That I owe you.

619
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:17,318
Carter.

620
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,498
Getting cold. I better move on.

621
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,708
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

622
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,210
Hey, Peter.

623
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,547
I'm a good doctor
because of you.

624
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,820
No, you're not.

625
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,813
But keep trying.
