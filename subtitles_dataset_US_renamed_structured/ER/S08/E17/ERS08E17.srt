Hello? WOMAN <i>6:30 wake-up call.</i>

2
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,450
Thank you.

3
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,033
See, the sun goes here.

4
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,163
The star goes...
Where does the star go?

5
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,072
Here. The star goes there.

6
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,473
That's right.

7
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,910
Where does the moon go?

8
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,606
Hmm, where does the moon go?

9
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,917
Yeah, moon. That's it, moon.

10
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,682
Can you say "Mama"?

11
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,157
Hmm? Can you say "Mama"?

12
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,422
Mama.

13
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,193
- Oh, hi. You're early.
- I figured you could use a break.

14
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,361
Well, that's right, ha.

15
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,233
Oh.

16
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,709
Okay, I've just fed her.
Um, I've put extra diapers...

17
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,174
- in the diaper bag.
- Mm-hm.

18
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,280
Uh, her hat and coat
are on the nightstand.

19
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,507
And, uh, I wrote you a check.

20
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,242
- Where is it?
- Dr. Greene paid me for the month.

21
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,512
Oh, okay. Um...

22
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,054
You didn't happen to
grab the mail, did you?

23
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,454
Ah, fabulous.

24
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,525
- Thanks.
- Say "bye-bye."

25
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,026
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

26
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,059
Bye-bye, my love. Bye-bye. Bye.

27
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,671
- What are you doing?
- Finishing my homework.

28
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,799
- Ready in 20 minutes?
- Sure.

29
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,471
- You okay, Dad?
- Fine.

30
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,689
- Dr. Romano signed it.
- I'm supposed to do a hernia...

31
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,349
and a pancreatic pseudocyst
today. I don't see them.

32
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,189
- Things change, Lizzie.
- Have you tampered with my schedule?

33
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,854
Uh-huh. Trauma call all week.
- Any reason?

34
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,864
You haven't covered
the ER in a month.

35
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,299
I had to go down to that
cesspool twice yesterday.

36
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,870
I'm catching up on
surgeries. I'll start next week.

37
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,201
Start today. With any
luck, you won't be called.

38
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,240
Right. That happens.

39
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,708
Did you pass out? - No.

40
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,873
We were tracking a black-crowned
heron, and I felt lightheaded and tingly.

41
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,714
- She had stomach problems last night.
- That was just his cooking.

42
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:18,150
Fifty of Benadryl, CBC,
chem panel, dip a urine.

43
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,793
Have you noticed any
changes in your eyes, Joanne?

44
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,932
- No. Why?
- Your sclera's a little yellow.

45
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,396
Any recent illnesses?

46
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,161
No. I do yoga and spin
every day. I'm in great health.

47
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,272
She's, uh, prone to panic attacks.
- Paul, I am not.

48
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,637
- Deep breath.
- We bird-watch to reduce stress.

49
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,608
I did not have a panic
attack. Ah, the eggs!

50
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,011
Oh, uh, we found a wood
duck's nest in the park.

51
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,310
A raccoon was about
to eat these for breakfast.

52
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,454
Can you put them someplace
warm? We think they're about to hatch.

53
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,919
Sure.

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,851
Add an AST, ALT, bilirubin
and a lipase for Joanne.

55
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,619
Okay. JERRY: Vegan brownie?

56
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,129
- My sister's starting a pastry business.
- I'll pass. Thanks.

57
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,631
Man in uniform. Nice.

58
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,135
Ah, they trot us out for recruitment
breakfasts. I was on Dearborn at 6 a.m.

59
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,533
Yeah? Sign anyone up?

60
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,571
No, but a coed gave
me her phone number.

61
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,573
- Ah, you go, private.
- That's "lieutenant."

62
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,144
- Lieutenant, do something with these.
- What are they?

63
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,803
- Eggs.
- What do you want me to do?

64
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,744
- They're supposed to hatch.
- Into what?

65
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,180
- Who knows?
- Gallant, posterior splint, Exam 4.

66
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,481
Kid in Curtain 2 needs
his earwax cleaned out.

67
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,421
- I'm here to serve.
- Dr. Weaver, stabbing victim rolling up.

68
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,687
Prep Trauma 1. Jerry, call the lab.
They need my chemistries for Exam 1.

69
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,992
- Mark, Susan, divvy up Kovac's passes.
- Morning to you too, Kerry.

70
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,328
- Somebody sign for this package.
- Yo, Gallant.

71
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,734
- I've got the eggs.
- Have you tried one of these?

72
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,272
- I'll just lose it later.
- Yeah, good point.

73
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,376
Jerry, there's something
to be said for animal fat.

74
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,605
My sister's hard-core.
Nothing with a face.

75
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,113
Someone call for a consult?

76
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,411
- Ah, Dr. Corday, welcome back.
- I've only been a few floors away.

77
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:57,024
A head trauma is threatening to go
AMA. I'll get this package to Dr. Kovac.

78
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,024
Don't worry. He's not
here. He'll get it tomorrow.

79
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,889
I'll find them.

80
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,756
You waiting for something else?

81
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,859
Can you talk?

82
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,206
Martin, huh? You need
a doctor? You need help?

83
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,104
Doc, this lady's got smoke
inhalation, some minor burns.

84
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,040
Malik, get him to Curtain 1.
- Got it.

85
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,272
Fire at Martin Luther King
Elementary. She stayed inside to help.

86
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:25,283
- Space heater fell on a girl's sweater.
- All right. No swelling in the nares.

87
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,546
Put her on a monitor.
Get a carboxyhemoglobin.

88
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,816
- Heating's been out since January.
- This the stabbing?

89
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,324
- Smoke inhalation.
- Some minor burns coming in.

90
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,726
- Plan on more. Second building went up.
- All engines responding. Gotta get back.

91
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,232
Diana Hayes, 19, multiple stab
wounds in the right neck and chest.

92
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,670
The guy that got bit by the
German shepherd calmed down.

93
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,603
- How much Ativan?
- Six.

94
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,573
He's relaxed and he's
all yours. I'm out of here.

95
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,110
You still keeping vampire hours?

96
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,340
Mm-hm. Not that I sleep
much during the day.

97
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,583
- Luka doesn't have curtains?
- Not in the living room.

98
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,620
- We got a lot of spare bedrooms.
- You lose some of the kitchen staff?

99
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,257
All I'm saying, a girl
needs her beauty sleep.

100
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,127
- Thanks.
- Lipstick Mary's looking for you.

101
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:14,427
She wants you to tell
her shadow to lay off.

102
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,435
- It's not like it listens to me.
- Making any headway?

103
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,232
With what?

104
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,941
Stop it.

105
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,339
I'll be at the 7:00 yoga,
if you want to avoid me.

106
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,538
- Oh, sorry.
- No, it's quite all right.

107
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,512
- A lot of glass, Nelson. How'd it happen?
- Candle.

108
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,175
- Was it in a glass holder?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:36,119
- Flying through the air at the time?
- Dr. Weaver needs a surgeon in 1.

110
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,488
- I'll be right there. Don't move, Nelson.
- Haleh, where are the baby warmers?

111
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,993
Lost, stolen. Who knows?

112
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,631

- Stab wounds, neck and chest.

113
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,703
- Tension pneumo.

00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,369
Attacked in bed.
Curved Kelly, 32 French.

116
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,568
How many wounds?

117
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,338
- At least 10.
- There's blood all over the sheets.

118
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,413
- Do you know about a weapon?
- I didn't see anything.

119
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,644
- Thora-Seal's ready.
- Needle driver.

120
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,654
- I thought Edson was on call.
- Settle for me.

121
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,760
- Neck veins are up. Trachea midline.
- Defensive wounds on both arms.

122
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,988
- What time did you find her?
- At 9. I always pick her up for poly-sci.

123
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,600
- Uh-huh. Was she able to speak at all?
- No. I thought she was dead.

124
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,928
Muffled heart sounds.
Prep for a thoracotomy.

125
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,403
There's more like 15 wounds here.
Do we know who did this to her?

126
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,543
- I don't know. Everybody likes her.
- Lost the pulse.

127
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,769
- Ten blade.
- Okay, rib spreader.

128
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,345
Get ready for suction.

129
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,711
I'm into the thoracic
cavity. There, hold that.

130
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,010
Mark.

131
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,447
Starting internal compressions.
I have a few minutes.

132
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,386
Do you want me to make the call?

133
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,457
- 2-0 silk on atraumatic needle.
- See if they can change the time.

134
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,063
- Yeah, yeah. Sure. JARVIK:
It's better if you wait outside.

135
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,893
- I'm okay. GREENE:
Prep internal paddles.

136
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,968
- We're losing this one too!
- Grab a set of vitals.

137
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,038
Get another gurney. She
may have hit her head.

138
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,979
- Did a nice job on your neck.
- Shaving. I was in a rush.

139
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,576
- Your mom called.
- Oh.

140
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,583
Four a.m. She still hasn't
figured out the time difference.

141
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,880
Oh, I'm so sorry.

142
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,280
Anyway...

143
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:22,425
Two more sutures and we'll defibrillate.
Call the O.R. Have them standing by.

144
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,593
Decisions, huh?

145
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,571
At the end of the day, I think that
Cheetos are just as good as Doritos.

146
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,901
See if I can get a soda.

147
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,440
Ugh. Martin, you were
supposed to stay over there.

148
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,479
- Is this your guy?
- Sort of.

149
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,413
- What's the deal?
- He can't speak.

150
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,453
- Is that an emergency?
- There's something not right about him.

151
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,887
Hey, I'm Dr. Carter,
Martin. How you doing?

152
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,593
- What, is he deaf, too?
- Martin?

153
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,754
Can you turn around?

154
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,528
Are you hurt?

155
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,769
Are you in pain?

156
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,768
I don't think he likes you much.

157
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,875
Do you think you could
write down what's wrong?

158
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:13,878
Is it your head? Chest?
Stomach? Oh, told you.

159
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,212
- He's probably just hungry.
- Well, when was the last time you ate?

160
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,611
Two days? Huh.

161
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,122
- Two days.
- Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

162
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,819
- Lap pad. And another.
- Fifteen knife wounds.

163
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,657
She must have
pissed someone off.

164
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,662
That's horrible. Bovie, pickups.

165
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,802
Let me get something straight.
Someone chops this girl up...

166
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,665
and you take your
time in the ER...

167
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,329
placing three horizontal
mattresses in the ventricle?

168
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,736
It was a large defect.

169
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,206
Uh-huh. Foley balloon
would've taken care of it.

170
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,539
We still had to repair
the myocardium.

171
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,342
Exactly. While you were
having your little sewing bee...

172
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,985
I could have been repairing
the pulmonary artery.

173
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,680
- I didn't appreciate that wound.
- Satinsky and more Prolene.

174
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,153
So what's your excuse?

175
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,087
Did you lose a fortune
in the stock market?

176
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,054
- No.
- Cat run away?

177
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,595
How many units in?
- Just the six O-neg.

178
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,092
You and the
hubby still fighting?

179
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,395
Aha!

180
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,830
Rumor mill is still
churning out winners.

181
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,667
I'm glad the
gossip's so amusing.

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,368
Army-Navy. So is this split
temporary or the real thing?

183
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,568
I don't know.

184
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,941
- You want my advice?
- Nope. Another clip.

185
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,549
Stay away from love. It
does things to the brain.

186
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,577
PVCs.

187
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,348
- Hundred of lidocaine!
- Come on, Diana.

188
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,185
So it's her nerves, right?
Nothing a Xanax won't cure?

189
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,386
- Actually, your transaminases are high.
- What's that mean?

190
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,192
You have pretty
extensive liver damage.

191
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,856
I don't drink at all.

192
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,062
- Drugs?
- No.

193
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,700
Have you had anything out of the
ordinary to eat the last few days?

194
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,503
We had seared ahi
last night, uh, pear salad.

195
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,479
- Chanterelles. PAUL:
You ate our mushrooms?

196
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,740
In my omelet.
You weren't up yet.

197
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,406
Where did you get them from?

198
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,584
We picked them in Marin a
few months ago. I froze them.

199
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,114
If they were bad mushrooms,
you could have amanita poisoning.

200
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,904
And that causes liver damage?

201
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:09,251
Extreme cases can
result in liver failure.

202
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,490
- What do you do for that?
- Don't want to get ahead of ourselves.

203
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,329
But, worst-case scenario,
you'd need a transplant.

204
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,335
- But I don't even feel that sick.
- It may not come to that.

205
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:24,133
Do you have any relatives we
can test to see if they're a match?

206
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,410
- Do we know her name?
- Cops are on it.

207
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,107
- Why didn't they tube her?
- Hematoma, base of the neck.

208
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,516
- Didn't want to take the chance.
- Female, stabbed at Hamden College.

209
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,122
- Second one today.
- Found a knife at the scene.

210
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,421
BP, 110/70. Stab wounds to the
neck and two deep ones by the sternum.

211
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,758
- Was she in the dorm too?
- Science building. Police are searching.

212
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,765
- Killing spree on campus.
- Remind me not to hang out there.

213
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,597
Open a crike tray. Might need
to cut through this hematoma.

214
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,606
Draw up 20 of etomidate and
120 of sux. And I need a 7.5 tube.

215
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,301
A wall collapsed at the
school fire. What can we take?

216
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,778
- Three criticals, four minors.
- Okay, call Respiratory and ENT.

217
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:06,283
Hang on, she's trying to say something.
Honey, can you tell us your name?

218
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,455
Okay, suction ready.
Hold cricoid while we bag.

219
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,386
Pulse ox is coming
up 96 percent.

220
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,457
Probable mediastinal injury.

221
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,095
- We'll have to triple-scope her.
- Oh, great.

222
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,089
- Friend of yours?
- Could someone take him to Curtain 1?

223
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,129
Six hundred of clinda, 200 gentamicin.
- Meds are in.

224
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,635
We should tube her, Kerry.

225
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,199
Wait. What is it?

226
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,707
I loved her.

227
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,646
- Hey, where's my doctor?
- Oh, I don't know.

228
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,088
- Can you tell her that I'm flying
again? LEWIS: It's okay. Hold still.

229
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,696
- This beats the patch any day.
- I thought women liked pirates.

230
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,558
Yeah, 400 years ago, maybe.

231
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,060
I was paged about a
possible liver transplant.

232
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:59,865
Oh, right. Um, the sister's here. I
thought both of us could talk to her.

233
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,940
Thanks, Susan. - Yeah.

234
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,240
- What's in New York?
- What?

235
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,779
There were charges on
our Visa bill from New York.

236
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,884
- Terry Welsh?
- Uh, right down there by Curtain 3.

237
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,919
- Fifty-two dollars from Saks?
- Uh, that's mine. It's a phone order.

238
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,785
- Something you couldn't find in Chicago?
- Terry?

239
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,758
- Hi, sorry. I just got out of practice.
- That's okay. I'm Dr. Greene.

240
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:26,093
- This is Dr. Corday. Thanks for coming.
- Um, Paul said it was serious.

241
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,894
Yes. Serious enough that
we should line up a donor.

242
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,697
Donor? CORDAY: Right in here.

243
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,466
- Hi, Ter.
- Joanne?

244
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,075
Your sister's doing okay now...

245
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,077
but we'd like to take the
first step and get blood drawn.

246
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:44,308
- And have you sign the consent form.
- Uh, consent for what?

247
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,982
- You didn't fill her in?
- I thought Joanne should.

248
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,917
- I might need a new liver.
- What?

249
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,581
And my best shot for a
match is someone in the family.

250
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,799
She's stage-three.

251
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,759
Means she's well enough to
accept a living donor transplant.

252
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,763
- Uh, wait a second.
- We'd like to test, see if you're a match.

253
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,595
- I have the Sweet Sixteen this weekend.
- What?

254
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,436
We beat Indiana on Thursday.

255
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,801
A game you
obviously didn't watch.

256
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,306
You play in a lot of games.

257
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,606
- These are the playoffs, Joanne.
- There's not a lot of time. Right?

258
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,809
Sooner is definitely better.

259
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,114
It's just part of the
liver. It grows back.

260
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,685
You donate the right
lobe, about 60 percent.

261
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,346
Wait. Stop. Let me think.

262
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,789
- What's to think about?
- No, you're right.

263
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,020
Uh, we don't even
know if she's a match yet.

264
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,433
Shelley? You
should be lying down.

265
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,338
- What's Renee doing here?
- You know this girl.

266
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,611
Renee Carlson. She's
Diana's roommate.

267
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:53,615
- Uh, she was badly injured.
- Was she stabbed like Diana?

268
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,246
Are Renee and Diana close?

269
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,624
No. She's quiet.

270
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,697
Kind of weird. Diana's moving out
in a few weeks to come live with us.

271
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,159
Where is Diana? Is she okay?

272
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,540
Oh, my God.

273
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,771
- She's not dead.
- I'm sorry.

274
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,151
I called your
house today, Martin.

275
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,313
I know you can speak, because I heard
your voice on the answering machine.

276
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,883
Why aren't you talking to me?

277
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,897
What?

278
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:44,666
I don't know what you're trying to
tell me. Why don't you just say it.

279
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:50,709
Martin! Okay, stop playing
games. Tell me what's wrong.

280
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:54,541
Look, we'll try supportive therapy.
But there are no guarantees.

281
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:59,209
- She's started bleeding in her stomach.
- I'm a match, aren't I?

282
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,755
- You wouldn't be explaining if I weren't.
- A transplant would be totally curative.

283
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,319
But there'd still be
a risk for me, right?

284
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:07,553
It would be minimal.

285
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,424
Someone as healthy as you
should recover completely.

286
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:15,034
- In three days?
- More like six weeks.

287
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,966
I'm a senior. This is my first
and last time in the playoffs.

288
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,404
- Can't she wait a month?
- She's already having complications.

289
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:27,035
Pretend she didn't have a
sister. What would you do?

290
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:31,048
Well, we'd be forced to put her on
a waiting list for a cadaveric donor.

291
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,452
So there are other ways
she could get a liver.

292
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,053
Terry, this is her best chance.

293
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,952
Obviously it's your choice, but, uh,
I'm sure she'd do the same thing for you.

294
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,657
No, ha. She wouldn't.

295
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,900
Run inside! Tell them we need
a collar and a backboard now!

296
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,597
- I got hot water on me!
- Charlie, does your neck hurt?

297
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,300
- Everything hurts.
- I need help here, somebody. Please!

298
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,570
- You need help driving!
- What happened?

299
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,680
The boy. Okay, Charlie.

300
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,009
Stay still like a statue.
We're gonna move you.

301
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,084
Give me that. Get
another backboard.

302
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,345
He's not breathing.

303
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,115
- Lie him down.
- He's been unconscious for 20 minutes.

304
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,583
Why is he wet?

305
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,589
Uh, he was taking a
bath. We stepped away.

306
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,352
- He was underwater.
- For how long?

307
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,292
Two minutes at the most.

308
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,998
- We need the pulse ox. How old is he?
- He's 8. His name's Viktor.

309
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,636
- Not moving much air.
- How could we let this happen?

310
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,999
- He'll be okay, Linda.
- You his mom?

311
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,538
- I am.
- I'm his doctor.

312
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:31,644
- Ahem, they called you first?
- Pulse ox, 85 on 15 liters.

313
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,144
- Did you try to resuscitate him?
- No.

314
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:37,181
- Take vitals?
- We thought it best to just come over.

315
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,811
First-aid lab, EKG and a
portable chest. And an ABG.

316
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:46,482
- Follow the light. Need to see pupils.
- My pupils aren't my problem.

317
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,493
- Titrate 10 of morphine.
- Now you're talking.

318
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,996
Circumferential burns to the
elbows. Trying to clear the neck.

319
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,135
Trauma panel, dip a
urine. Get the SonoSite.

320
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,498
- Dr. Corday?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:05,838
Go ahead. Let's get a full scan just
to be safe. Head, C-spine, abdomen.

322
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,914
Bag him. Draw up
atropine, etomidate and sux.

323
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,483
- Linda, Kyle, I recommend you step out.
- Orange zone on the Broselow.

324
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,245
- We wanna stay with him.
- Not now.

325
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,218
- I'm not leaving my son.
- He's not getting enough air.

326
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,224
- 6-0 cuffed ET tube.
- He's gonna be okay, right?

327
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,554
- Are you a medical doctor?
- Socialization therapist.

328
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,926
Satting at 91.

329
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,835
- Try a nasal trumpet.
- Felicia Kind.

330
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,063
- Number three straight blade.
- Okay, sit down. Deep breath.

331
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,435
You need to take that outside.

332
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,271
Surgilube. Let's do a jaw
thrust and get a good seal.

333
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,775
Sats at 92.

334
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,538
- I should have called first.
- I'm glad you came over.

335
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:46,049
We were on our way home from
baby gym class, and she just said it.

336
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,687
Who's that? Who's that? Dada?

337
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,755
- That's right.
- Dada.

338
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,391
That's right. It's Dada.

339
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,891
Why were three adults
giving an 8-year-old a bath?

340
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,724
A bonding game. Recreating the womb.
- I'm in.

341
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,389
Holding your son
underwater bonds him to you?

342
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,934
- It was only for short periods.
- Apparently not short enough.

343
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,595
- Mark, you should get out there.
- Is something wrong?

344
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,934
Uh, no. Ella has
something to tell you.

345
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,135
Tidal volume, 300.
AC, 14 on 100 percent.

346
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:16,248
Uh, get a blood gas in 20
minutes. I'll be right outside.

347
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,842
- Hey, you deserted me.
- I did nothing of the sort, Charlie.

348
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,615
- You're in perfectly good hands.
- She never buys from me.

349
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,848
You're overpriced.

350
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,687
Dr. Weaver, Renee
Carlson's mom is here.

351
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,954
- Is there anything on the firefighters?
- No.

352
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,059
Repeat the hematocrit
in one hour...

353
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,030
and send the O-neg
back to the blood bank.

354
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,361
Mrs. Carlson, I'm
Dr. Weaver. I'm treating Renee.

355
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,499
Hi. They called me at work.
They told me she got hurt at school.

356
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,169
I thought she twisted
an ankle or something.

357
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,247
Your daughter has
multiple knife wounds...

358
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,442
including a deep
cut across her throat.

359
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,281
- You saved her?
- We were able to repair the wounds...

360
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,512
and she's stable.

361
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:00,217
But we had to put a tube down
her throat to help her breathe.

362
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,165
When will she wake up?

363
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:07,723
It's hard to say.
We'll just have to wait.

364
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,704
She hasn't been in the
hospital since she was born.

365
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:15,535
We need to get her up
to the intensive care unit.

366
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,143
The police said her friend
Diana was attacked too.

367
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,837
Yes.

368
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,346
Is she okay?

369
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:28,477
Diana's injuries were much more
extensive. We were unable to save her.

370
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,659
Has Renee been having
any problems at school?

371
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,664
No.

372
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,963
Has she been depressed
or showing any signs of...?

373
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,129
No. Why are you asking this?

374
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,135
We're just trying to
understand what happened.

375
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,841
Someone attacked my
daughter and her friend.

376
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,850
That's what happened. Why is
everyone asking all these questions?

377
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:06,124
Diana had defensive wounds on
her hands and her arms. Renee didn't.

378
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,920
So what?

379
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,690
My daughter didn't
hurt her friend.

380
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:19,931
And she certainly did
not do this to herself.

381
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,132
There must be a
maniac out there.

382
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:28,113
I'm sure Renee will tell us what
happened as soon as she wakes up.

383
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,773
That's right. She'll tell you.

384
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,981
She and Diana were best friends.

385
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,125
Viktor's stable. He's breathing
with the help of a machine.

386
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,989
Will he wake up?

387
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:46,655
We hope we see some
progress in the next 24 hours.

388
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,562
A social worker's
on her way down.

389
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,203
Why do we need a social worker?

390
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,665
- Wait, let me explain.
- I got the gist of it.

391
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,833
We, uh, adopted Viktor in
Prague last year. We were thrilled.

392
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,071
- But he hasn't connected with us.
- Love and time usually does it.

393
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,308
It was putting a strain on our
marriage. Felicia's helping us.

394
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,419
You put your son
in a lot of danger.

395
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,523
If he needs counseling, or
you do, go to a real doctor.

396
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,253
- Her success rate is 85 percent.
- Excuse me.

397
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:20,161
- What, no geese?
- A flock of ducks walked down the hall.

398
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,028
- He's seeing birds.
- Please, Stan.

399
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,228
- You told me you saw butterflies earlier.
- Pink elephants.

400
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,705
They weren't pink. They were
psychedelic and pretty as Natalie Wood.

401
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,504
- Have you seen Dr. Greene?
- He checked out for an hour.

402
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:33,873
- Where to?
- Don't know.

403
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,242
But Dr. Lewis is
covering for him.

404
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,545
- Where are you going?
- I have a 5-day-old with listeria.

405
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,119
- Where are the eggs?
- What eggs?

406
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,551
Susan, I need a favor.

407
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,022
Uh, yeah, sure. Can
you take this to Exam 4?

408
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,591
Uh...

409
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:53,461
This is a bit awkward, but, um, I
need to know where my husband is.

410
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,692
- I don't know.
- You're covering his patients.

411
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,708
- Yeah, but... Uh, I'm sorry.
- Please tell me.

412
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,865
I know there's something going on. I
don't think I deserve to be in the dark.

413
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,374
- He is my husband.
- You need to talk to him.

414
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,205
Susan.

415
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,311
Elizabeth, think about it.

416
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:16,116
What would be going on that
he wouldn't want to tell you?

417
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,951
That he'd try to
protect you from?

418
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:46,143
Um, excuse me. I'm looking
for my husband, Mark Greene.

419
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,287
He just started his treatment.

420
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,631
- Can you take me to him, please?
- Sure.

421
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,669
I just pre-medicated with
the antiemetic, ondansetron.

422
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,434
The Decadron runs in over
15 minutes as an IV piggyback.

423
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,635
Once that's in, I'll be
back to inject vincristine.

424
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,975
He's also getting
procarbazine and CCNU.

425
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,113
Right through there.

426
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,336
- Were you knocked out?
- No. But I was pinned pretty good.

427
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,220
Full trauma panel,
C-spine, chest, pelvis.

428
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:49,008
School fire?

429
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:53,141
- It's a bad one.
- Contusions and abrasions to mid-thigh.

430
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:57,483
- Can you wiggle your toes for me?
- Good breath sounds.

431
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,319
Follow my finger. Did
you get everyone out?

432
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,858
One kid unaccounted for.

433
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,656
We were looking for him when
the floor above us collapsed.

434
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,526
- Who's we?
- About six of us.

435
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,667
Pedal pulses,
two-plus bilaterally.

436
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,269
They vented the roof and
half the main wall fell in.

437
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:14,896
- Did you get all your guys out safe?
- Still looking for three when I left.

438
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:19,034
- Hanson, Jeffries and Lopez.
- Sandy Lopez?

439
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,702
She was the first one in.

440
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:29,446
- What about gamma radiation?
- Didn't work. Tumor's still growing.

441
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,385
Should we call
Dr. Burke? Maybe he...

442
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,219
I saw him.

443
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,857
In New York.

444
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,735
How much time?

445
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,738
If this works, 10 months.

446
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,848
Why didn't you tell me?

447
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,450
I don't know, uh...

448
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,954
- I guess it was bad timing.
- I could have helped.

449
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,656
How?

450
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,435
- You shouldn't be alone.
- This doesn't change anything.

451
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,772
- It does. It changes everything.
- I don't expect you to come back...

452
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,470
just because this happened.

453
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,530
Let me know, ahem, if
Perotti goes to the O.R.

454
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,901
- I'm pretty sure it's an appy.
- What, you're going back to work?

455
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,837
I don't know what else to do.

456
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,341
I've débrided the forearms. She
needs Thermazine and burn-net.

457
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,511
- And I promised her three stickers.
- Mermaids or horses?

458
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,954
- Three liters of Ringer's, 20 of morphine.
- You got it.

459
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,289
- Going to the burn unit?
- Yeah, third one today. The last bed.

460
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,954
- Urine output was 250 cc's last hour.
- There's your new boyfriend.

461
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,897
What? Oh, poor guy. He's
a little on the simple side.

462
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,536
You think?

463
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:29,073
Martin, did you talk to
the lady from Psych?

464
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:33,310
Um. That doesn't
mean anything to me.

465
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,040
Okay, a scarf doesn't
mean much either.

466
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,217
I don't get it, okay?

467
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,415
Um...

468
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,856
Did someone knit you the set?
Something happened to that person.

469
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,687
Oh, um...

470
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:54,060
Two days ago, when
you stopped talking.

471
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:59,469
Danny Barnett, found on the scene
at the fire. No obvious burns or injuries.

472
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:02,767
People were very worried about
you, Danny. Where were you?

473
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,604
- Cafeteria.
- How are his sats?

474
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:09,942
- Ninety-nine on room air.
- Did you breathe in any smoke, Danny?

475
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,779
No, I told the fire lady I'm not
hurt. She still made me come.

476
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:18,617
- Is the fire lady here with you now?
- She rode in the ambulance with me.

477
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,555
- Maybe they took her home.
- And was she hurt?

478
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,422
- Don't think so. She was telling jokes.
- Okay, I'll be right back, Danny, okay?

479
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,594
Jerry, call the 38. Verify that all
their firefighters are accounted for.

480
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,294
They're probably
still busy with the fire.

481
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:36,318
Just do it.

482
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,880
- You need to start wearing shoes.
- Where's Dr. Greene?

483
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,116
- He'll be back in a bit.
- Know where he went?

484
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,956
- What do you need?
- Complex laceration through the helix.

485
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,325
- He was gonna walk me through it.
- I'll do it.

486
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,558
- Yeah? Suture Room.
- What's that?

487
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,328
It's a lighter. Scoped it
out of some kid's belly.

488
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,404
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Keep it.

489
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:10,372
- Why?
- Behold Dr. Carter's box of wonders.

490
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,670
You've scoped all that
stuff out of patients?

491
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,404
I like to think of it as
gastrointestinal bric-a-brac.

492
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,743
Hey, is that my good pen?

493
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,045
I can't believe you pulled
this out of someone's stomach.

494
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,884
- Other end.
- Keep it.

495
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,198
Here.

496
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,565
- You didn't sign it.
- I know.

497
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,767
Terry, where are you going?

498
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,372
Back to practice.

499
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,275
What about Joanne?

500
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,042
Joanne's never had time
for anyone but Joanne.

501
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,583
That's still no reason
not to help her.

502
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,221
- We're not close.
- She's still your sister!

503
00:30:56,388 --> 00:31:00,086
I know I should be a bigger person,
but I've trained for this my whole life.

504
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,920
I'm not willing
to sacrifice that.

505
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:06,229
If that makes me a selfish,
terrible person, I'm sorry.

506
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:10,698
Maybe I'll help Joanne
afterwards, but not right now.

507
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,408
Ah, hiding out, are you?

508
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,481
Do me a favor, go down there
when those idiots page you.

509
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,744
They're like crazed cyborgs,
paging every five minutes...

510
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,650
until they somehow manage
to find your fearless leader...

511
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:06,291
and suck us all
into their universe.

512
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,957
Oh, what happened?
Prince Harry in rehab again?

513
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,600
Mark's tumor's back.

514
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,035
Has it invaded Broca's?

515
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,473
It's encroaching
the motor cortex.

516
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,321
I'm sorry.

517
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,665
It was always a possibility.

518
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,703
He's known about it for
weeks. He just didn't tell me.

519
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,334
Well...

520
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,375
Maybe he was protecting you.

521
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,182
There's so much we
haven't worked out.

522
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,190
Oh...

523
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,164
I don't think I can
go through this again.

524
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,698
I'm sick and tired of
being the strong one.

525
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:33,209
You know, we've broken
up. We've grown apart.

526
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:37,045
He doesn't even expect
me to be there, anyway.

527
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,717
What am I supposed to do?

528
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:47,382
Am I supposed to just go
back home to watch him die?

529
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,895
Yes.

530
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,127
Well, I don't think I can.

531
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,573
Is he your husband?

532
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,407
Yes.

533
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,618
Do you love him?

534
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,750
Yes.

535
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,269
The police found his
mom on the bathroom floor.

536
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,101
- They think it was a heart attack.
- Does he live with her?

537
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,175
Yeah, I think it's a
conversion disorder...

538
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,504
brought on by the
stress of finding her dead.

539
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,272
Does he have any other family?

540
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,007
Yeah, there's a sister
coming in from Louisville.

541
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,118
And Psych said they'd
hold him until then.

542
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,186
- I'm gonna go visit him.
- Okay.

543
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,588
Uh, Viktor Evans' parents?
- Trauma 1.

544
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,926
How much do you
charge for therapy?

545
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,265
- Uh. Went a little too far this time.
- Too far?

546
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,600
You deprived that
boy's brain of oxygen.

547
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,308
- He'll pull through.
- How would you know?

548
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,775
- I have a feeling.
- Feeling.

549
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,074
If you call yourself a doctor,
you should be able to back it up.

550
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,514
Before I started working with
Viktor he could barely crack a smile...

551
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,915
let alone acknowledge
his adoptive parents.

552
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,956
Now he's calling them
Mommy and Daddy.

553
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,817
Dr. Greene, he's having
purposeful movements.

554
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,486
Don't worry, honey.
Mommy's here. Is he okay?

555
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,632
Viktor, can you hear me?

556
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,134
Try and grab my fingers.

557
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,100
- Good grip strength bilaterally.
- Ah! We're in the clear.

558
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,068
Check the weaning parameters.

559
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,970
Viktor, you have a tube in
your throat, so you can't talk.

560
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,572
Welcome back, champ.

561
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,975
We'll take it out
as soon as we can.

562
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:50,742
Look.

563
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,316
This may have been a breakthrough day.
- You think?

564
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,477
Absolutely. He's
engaging with you.

565
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,886
- You're kidding, right?
- We have other methods we can try.

566
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:00,821
Not if you intend
on keeping Viktor.

567
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,121
What you did today
was abusive, not loving.

568
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,662
Radical problems
need radical therapies.

569
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,096
Tell that to Child
Protective Services.

570
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,929
They'll be making a home visit.

571
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,435
You okay, Dr. Greene?

572
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,998
Uh. I gotta go.

573
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,104
What's Stan still doing here?

574
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,440
I told him he could
stay if he sang quietly.

575
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,446
At least it's not
<i>Oklahoma!</i> tonight.

576
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,586
- Thank God for small favors.
- And he's off the birds.

577
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,415
Can you call for Stewart's
pelvic CT results?

578
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,489
Check the second
troponin on Lang.

579
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,428
All right. Mark, you haven't
written up your H & P's.

580
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,792
- I'll do that on my next shift.
- Yeah, well, this shift isn't over.

581
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,490
I just had my first round
of chemotherapy, Kerry.

582
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,604
I feel like hell. I'm gonna
go home early, okay?

583
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,949
Hey. What's the
expression? "Couch tomato"?

584
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,383
"Potato." And I'm at the table.

585
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,319
I should buy a new comforter.

586
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:09,484
Don't do it on my account. A
girl named Michelle called for you.

587
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,823
Oh, I forgot.

588
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:16,234
You're taking her
to the Ice-Capades?

589
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,200
- What's wrong with that?
- Ha-ha, nothing.

590
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,703
I tried to explain that I
was just your roommate.

591
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,671
I'm not sure if I
like her, anyway.

592
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,482
- Is this the last one?
- No, there's a couple more in there.

593
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,320
Any luck?

594
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,490
Um, yes, here's one.

595
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,425
Two bedroom, one bath,
hardwood floors, breakfast nook.

596
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,725
- Sounds big.
- Has a doorman.

597
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,891
- Safe.
- And a lake view.

598
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,161
Ooh.

599
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,568
- How much?
- This one's only twice what I can afford.

600
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,236
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

601
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,673
Yeah, you don't wanna
keep Tai and Randy waiting.

602
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,122
This latte blows.

603
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,060
Weaver said Charlie won't
be on his feet until next week.

604
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,431
Then I'm in trouble, because
this cafeteria stuff is criminal.

605
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,264
I heard about Mark Greene.

606
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:34,474
- Tough to keep a secret around here.
- You did.

607
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,046
So that night, you were, uh...?

608
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,317
What can I say? I'm passionate.

609
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,457
You spent the night
together, and I thought...

610
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:49,387
- You have a very active imagination.
- If you only knew.

611
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,292
- You are not flirting with me.
- No way.

612
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,830
I'm never gonna make
that mistake again.

613
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,662
- Back in uniform. CARTER:
Isn't your head cold?

614
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,636
- No, no, I got thick hair.
- What are you hiding?

615
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,570
- Nothing.
- What are you hiding?

616
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,870
- What do you got there, Gallant?
- What do you got in there?

617
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,113
- Oh, look at that.
- Oh, can I hold one?

618
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,648
Sure.

619
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,677
Aw, so cute. Oh.

620
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,413
Oh.

621
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,320
Sorry.

622
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,461
Hey.

623
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,967
Out barhopping?

624
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,767
- I was just...
- Lost?

625
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,170
Looking for you.

626
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,941
And you only found my car.

627
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,985
It was great what you
did for that kid today.

628
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,712
Part of the job. The good part,
when the fire doesn't get you.

629
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,148
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No, I'm back at 7.

630
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:58,460
You know what? You can't drive.

631
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,992
Ha-ha, Kerry, come on.

632
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:07,431
You were missing. I was worried.

633
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,339
I'm touched.

634
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:18,313
You were right. You
did do me a favor.

635
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,692
Come to think of it, it
was a pretty cool save.

636
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:33,195
Fire went to three alarms. I
couldn't see my hand in front of my...

637
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,737
- Hi.
- Hi.

638
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:18,732
- Where's your dad?
- Upstairs.

639
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,208
He didn't feel well.

640
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,481
Would you like to take Ella?

641
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,116
Hey. CORDAY: There's Rach.

642
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,087
Hi.

643
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,592
Thank you.

644
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,399
He's sick again, isn't he?

645
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,322
How long have
you been like this?

646
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,553
Forever.

647
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,429
Don't they say if it makes
you sick it's working?

648
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:17,257
It's cold comfort when you're
lying on the bathroom floor.

649
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:21,497
- You want some Compazine?
- Ah, I took some an hour ago.

650
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,975
Here. Let me put
this on your forehead.

00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:41,452
You know, I tried for weeks to
get her to say "Mama" and "moon."

652
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:48,228
- They always say "Dada" first.
- That's just because it's easy to say.

653
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,331
Maybe she likes me.

654
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,334
She's a good judge of character.

655
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:59,372
Here. I'm gonna go out
and get some Zofran.

656
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,877
No, no, no. Stay. Stay.

657
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,247
It'll pass.
