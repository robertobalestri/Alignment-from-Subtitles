1
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:14,171
One hundred and forty patients, 27
admissions, has to be a shift record.

2
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:19,184
I got a record. There's a guy in Exam 4
that swallowed 50 hot dogs in 19 minutes.

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,755
- Shift record, as in "shift over."
- Who has Pelar now?

4
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,859
- Which one's that?
- Kidney stone in 7, since this morning.

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,392
I admitted him to Urology.

6
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,860
- I just need a diet order.
- Two grams sodium.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,228
Give me the beer. PABLO:
No. This is my personal property!

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,562
- Give me the beer!
- Two grams sodium in 7.

9
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,069
- I need help with a Foley.
- It's personal property!

10
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,501
What room? HALEH: Right here!

11
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,936
- No!
- What's the problem?

12
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,078
He's drunk, combative, and he
won't give up his beer! Give me...

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,270
- Is it open?
- Oh, Abby, I need help!

14
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,846
I need to pee!

15
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,610
- Sorry. I just punched out.
- That's gonna cost you.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,046
Where's Mark? Mark
Greene, your Attending.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,246
I think he quit.

18
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,425
Silvadene and dress
the second-degree areas.

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,060
Kerry, have you seen Mark?

20
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,526
Elizabeth, I need you
to see a post-op seroma.

21
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,460
Can I put my baby
down? Where's Mark?

22
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,725
- Try Curtain 3. TAKATA:
No urine in the last hour.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,301
Bolus a liter of Ringer's.
Call for a renal consult.

24
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,735
Dr. Weaver? X-ray's behind, and
my wrist fracture wants to leave AMA.

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,968
Jing-Mei, you're Chief Resident.
Don't check with me on every patient.

26
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,136
You have to learn to
keep things flowing.

27
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,474
We don't have time for
ones we can move quickly.

28
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,640
Turf and admit, treat and street.
- Mark!

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,910
Bag him. Prep the
neck, 1 percent with epi.

30
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,248
- What do you think you're doing?
- We got jammed.

31
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,084
You said to meet
in the parking lot.

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,227
Drunk boating accident, busted
his face. We need to crike him.

33
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,589
This is exactly why we
need a weekend nanny.

34
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,755
- A weekday nanny's bad enough.
- It doesn't make us bad parents.

35
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,662
I just want to
raise our children.

36
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,702
Then be home when you say
you'll be home. I'm an hour late.

37
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,363
- Sats are down to 84.
- Introducer needle. Five more minutes.

38
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:52,378
Finish the procedure, give it to a
Resident and meet me upstairs.

39
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,712
You're in trouble, doc.

40
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,483
You're being stubborn.
- I'm not.

41
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,782
You have 6 weeks on your Residency.
You don't have a job elsewhere.

42
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,822
You know she's
looking for an Attending.

43
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,086
- She should ask me.
- You're being stubborn.

44
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,940
I don't think I'm being...
- Abby!

45
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:12,828
Hey, can you try for a line on Barney
before you go? He's back with cellulitis.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,299
- I'm off.
- Conni said you found a vein last time.

47
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,097
- But I'm off.
- He's asking for you.

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,001
I'm off. I'm off. I'm
gone. I'm out of here.

49
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,666
- Someplace important to be?
- Home. I have to be back here at 7.

50
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,369
- Have a good night.
- See you tomorrow.

51
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,513
Hey!

52
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,076
Talk to Weaver.

53
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,395
How did it sting you in there?

54
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,723
- What?
- A bee flew in his Coke.

55
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,196
Can I ask you a question?

56
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,634
Airway's clear, no
wheezing. 50 of Benadryl, p.o.

57
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,899
Better get that new
Attending in here, huh?

58
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:57,408
Hey, Haleh, I need a visual
acuity on the foreign body in 8.

59
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,069
- In a minute.
- Are you actively recruiting?

60
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,182
Is it word of mouth?
Are you headhunting?

61
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,251
Running a classified
in the annals.

62
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,715
Unresponsive initially.

63
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,855
- What's the half-life of glyburide?
- Ten hours. Overdose?

64
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,548
- Sixty milligrams.
- Admit him.

65
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,819
The hypoglycemia
lasts for over a day.

66
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,556
- Because I was thinking about applying.
- For Attending?

67
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,724
- It is my next step.
- Oh, yeah. Right. Of course.

68
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,233
You don't sound enthusiastic.

69
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,497
We were hoping for someone at
least five years post-Residency.

70
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,370
- But, yeah, certainly apply.
- Right.

71
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,702
In case you can't find anybody better.
- John!

72
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,041
John! Can you clear
a toe lac in Curtain 2?

73
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,116
- I'm off.
- He's been waiting five hours.

74
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,777
- I can't get to it. We need the bed.
- I'm meeting my parents for dinner.

75
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,446
- You can dispo him in 15 minutes.
- I've done my share of dispos today.

76
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,889
- For me?
- Sorry. Give it to Malucci.

77
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,361
Malucci's not here for another hour.
Cleo is stuck with pulmonary edema.

78
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,626
I'm babysitting four ICU
players. We're down two nurses.

79
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:59,205
And the rack is overflowing. Please?
If you could just take one easy patient.

80
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,671
That's all I'm asking.

81
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:07,211
- All right. One patient.
- Thank you.

82
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,116
Wait. What room?

83
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,866
We were unloading the volcano.

84
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,978
I dropped the base on my foot
between the lift and the platform.

85
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,704
- Volcano?
- The show ends...

86
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:17,681
with this big volcano explosion
with real live lava and steam and crap.

87
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,618
- Not real lava.
- No, but it's real-looking lava, though.

88
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,724
- This is more than just a cut.
- The damn thing almost sliced my toe off.

89
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,660
Yeah. It was just hanging there
like a big noodle or something.

90
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,734
Have to do a digital block, have to wait
for X-ray, have to sew a two-layer repair.

91
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,461
- You signed up for it.
- This'll take more than an hour.

92
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,004
Hurry up. Maybe we can
catch the end of the show.

93
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,142
- The guys are opening for Metallica.
- Guys?

94
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,973
- We're roadies for Touching Wood.
- All right! What's the name of the song?

95
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,910
- "Rapture Bitch."
- I like that song.

96
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,549
It's not even their best song.

97
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,686
I'll numb the two nerves in
your toe, and then I'll wash it out.

98
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,845
Then we'll take
you for an x-ray.

99
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,817
- You want to wait outside?
- No, I'm cool.

100
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,227
That happens.

101
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,269
Take his set of vitals. Run in
a liter of saline if he's postural.

102
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,905
Carter, he's not breathing.

103
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,707
What?

104
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,346
The surgery
caused the infection?

105
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,378
It may have contributed, yes. But
because of his compromised state...

106
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,215
he wasn't able to fight off the infection
even with appropriate antibiotics.

107
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,721
I told him not to drink so much.

108
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:35,022
If you'd like to go in and see
him, I'll be in there in a minute.

109
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:39,223
- Jacy, Jacy, could you take her?
- Oh, of course. This way.

110
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,863
Sorry. He started seizing. I had to
give him Dilantin and get him to CT.

111
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,938
- We are not doing this anymore!
- What?

112
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,905
No more weekend shifts that
are even close to one another.

113
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,374
We got jammed. Four
hours should've been enough.

114
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,979
I'm not explaining to a
woman why her son died...

115
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,378
while my baby is
screaming in her face!

116
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,710
- Okay.
- I'm not!

117
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,409
I said, okay.

118
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,282
She missed her nap.

119
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,151
Get her home. Give her 4
more ounces and put her down.

120
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,986
- Is the milk defrosted?
- Yes.

121
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,822
But you'll have to take
another out for tonight.

122
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,589
Okay. I got it,
I got it, I got it.

123
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,764
Is that our homeless guy?

124
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,638
- Post-op bacteremia. He died of sepsis.
- He has a mother?

125
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,576
Apparently, we
all have a mother!

126
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:29,383
Yes, yes. She's a little cranky.
That's all right. You'll be all right.

127
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,144
- Give me some cricoid pressure.
- Sats are down to 90.

128
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,084
All right, I'm in. Bag
him. What did you take?

129
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,689
I didn't take anything.

130
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,416
- Him. What did he take? Drugs? Alcohol?
- I don't know.

131
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,618
Some beer, some pot,
some Georgia Homeboy.

132
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,093
- That liquid G?
- Yeah.

133
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,425
Call for a vent, B.A.L.
and tox screen. Cleo!

134
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,295
Take this guy. Respiratory
arrest from a GHB overdose.

135
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,697
- I can't.
- I'm off duty.

136
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,100
- I have the stampede.
- What stampede?

137
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,936
Guitar player collapsed at a rock
concert. The crowd just mobbed the stage.

138
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,975
- Where? MALIK:
At the United Center.

139
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,739
No way. Metallica or us?

140
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,383
- Any head injury?
- Just slumped to the floor.

141
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,644
- History of seizures?
- Girlfriend might know.

142
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,881
- Okay, ask her.
- Have an intubation from the concert?

143
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,855
Apneic on scene. Pupils
are equal and reactive.

144
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,996
Carter tubed his friend. He
thinks they mixed alcohol with GHB.

145
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,392
- BP's 122/78.
- Doctor, three crush injuries rolling in.

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,399
I'll be right there. Blood
gas, B.A.L. and tox screen.

147
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,868
And have Carter follow
their labs together.

148
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,167
There's a guy in a
ponytail, says he knows you.

149
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,334
- Take a name. Make him wait.
- BP, 100/60. Pulse, 110.

150
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,471
Complains of abdominal pains, no LOC.
Contusions to the trunk and extremities.

151
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,141
- His family coming in with him?
- No, he was by himself, but it was crazy.

152
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,515
Who brings a 7-year-old
to a heavy-metal concert?

153
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,986
One, two, three.

154
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,217
All right, portable C-spine, chest
and pelvis. Trauma panel, dip a urine.

155
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,626
What's his name? Kevin, I'm Dr. Finch.
Do you know your phone number?

156
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,357
- I can't breathe.
- We'll help you.

157
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,434
- They were pushing.
- Good breath sounds.

158
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,263
I know, but you're safe now.

159
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,702
Epigastric tenderness.
No rebound or guarding.

160
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,171
Sinus tach at 112.

161
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,934
- Is there a Dr. Benton here?
- Me.

162
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:07,046
A unit called in from St. Rafe's. An ER
doc thinks he's got your kid over there.

163
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,704
What?

164
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,442
Deaf, 3 or 4, Reece Benton
written inside his jacket.

165
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,917
- He okay?
- They're looking for a parent.

166
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,885
- Where's Carla?
- Who's Carla?

167
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,547
- His mother.
- I don't know.

168
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,716
Dispatch asked me to
see if I could find you.

169
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,727
Lily, get another
surgeon. Peter, go.

170
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,370
- What sort of look you going for here?
- Hey.

171
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,967
- Bought a TV?
- Yep.

172
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,873
Anything else?

173
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,178
Sony PlayStation.

174
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,919
I was thinking more along the lines
of furniture. You know, table, chairs...

175
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,819
- bed.
- I got an aquarium.

176
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,185
Yes, I see.

177
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,096
- Couldn't get a bigger one, huh?
- The next size up was pretty expensive.

178
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,133
- I thought we were gonna go out to eat.
- I'm still hungry. Want to play?

179
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,711
- I don't think so.
- We can hunt zombies together.

180
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,215
Couldn't we just
reason with them?

181
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,253
- I think I'm just gonna go home.
- No, no. Stay.

182
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,483
No, no. Zombies and a
pizza isn't really my thing.

183
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,392
You're right. Let's go.

184
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,092
I agreed to suture a toe
lac, now I got three patients.

185
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,761
Those two are the same
guy. Order the same stuff.

186
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,463
- Get Chen.
- She has a head trauma.

187
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,871
I don't care. Get her.
I'm handing this off.

188
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,137
He might be famous one day.
You can say you helped save his life.

189
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,180
We're in the Emergency
department. Ask for Dr. Finch.

190
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,511
It's extension 7614.

191
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,516
- I'm trying to be gentle.
- But it hurts.

192
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,898
What happened to Peter?
- Personal emergency.

193
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,552
This is Kevin, crushed against
the stage at a Metallica concert.

194
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,161
Hello, Kevin. Aren't you a
little young for Metallica?

195
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,230
They didn't start yet. It
was the warm-up group.

196
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,630
We're trying to track
down his parents.

197
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,995
Got the answering machine.

198
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,501
Any evidence of bleeding?

199
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,334
No. Liver and spleen are intact, but
there's moderate epigastric tenderness.

200
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,171
Could be an abdominal-wall injury,
small-bowel perf, a bruised pancreas.

201
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,472
- Want to get a CT?
- And serial exams.

202
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,481
We'll see if anything declares itself.
- Kevin? Oh, my God!

203
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,778
Kevin, I'm so sorry.

204
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,518
- You let go of my hand.
- I tried to hold on. I'm sorry.

205
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,584
- Is he okay?
- Who are you?

206
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,758
Marla. I'm his babysitter.

207
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,159
His parents let you take
him to rock concerts?

208
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,267
My boyfriend came over with
tickets. He was gonna be in bed by 11.

209
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,198
Do you have a number for them?

210
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,668
- Did you call it?
- I wanted to find Kevin first.

211
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,601
You found him.

212
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,368
Draw up etomidate,
sux and grab Surgery.

213
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,275
- That our last crush victim?
- I don't know, I just got here.

214
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,382
Multiple rib fractures,
needs chest tubes.

215
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,347
Curtain 3. Get out
of those gym clothes.

216
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,955
- Chief, I just got here.
- Come to work dressed properly.

217
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,255
Dr. Weaver?

218
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,855
Yosh, I need 100 of
mannitol in Exam 4 right away.

219
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,398
- Do you have a minute?
- No.

220
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,968
You're not thrilled to see
me. I screwed up last...

221
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,605
I'm not interested in
a private investigator.

222
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,503
- Frank, still waiting on that head CT.
- Just went down.

223
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,200
How long? FRANK: Who knows?

224
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,313
- Well, get Radiology on the phone.
- I found her.

225
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,441
There's a new database for adopted
children looking for their birth parents.

226
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,420
I ran a couple of old
clients through, and you hit.

227
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,549
I double-checked this
time. It's your mother.

228
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,729
Anyway, if you're
interested, it's 400 bucks.

229
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,923
My new cell's on there.

230
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,176
- Hi, doc.
- Hey, you still here?

231
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,007
- He never leaves.
- And you do?

232
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,150
Only because you
take so long to move.

233
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,144
You know them?

234
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,549
We met at lunch.

235
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,822
Is the smoke gonna bother you?
- No.

236
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,517
- Hi, Luka.
- Hey.

237
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,534
Delirium tremens, right? - Yeah.

238
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,722
Abby?

239
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,401
- Diet Coke and a couple menus, please.
- We stop serving at 10.

240
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,531
- It's, like, 10:02.
- I'm sorry.

241
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,876
I'm starving.

242
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:34,947
- Do you have appetizers or anything?
- He may not have thrown out the soup.

243
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,242
- What is it?
- Like a potato cream.

244
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,242
Sure. That's fine.

245
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,083
- All right.
- Thanks.

246
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,323
Anyone here you don't know?

247
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,567
You want me to put
him on line for a unit bed?

248
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,707
He'll be extubated by
the time that he gets one.

249
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,442
- Who is that?
- His girlfriend, I think.

250
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,102
I'll find out what's going on.

251
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,739
Yeah. Okay. Can you just tell them
that John is running a little bit late?

252
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,748
Be mellow. It's good.
He's all good, okay?

253
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,754
- Tell her he's all good.
- He's all good.

254
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,393
- I saw him stop breathing.
- We're helping him breathe.

255
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,224
- You don't just stop breathing.
- It's an overdose of alcohol and GHB.

256
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:28,232
- He'll wake up in a few hours.
- Are those blood stains?

257
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,164
No. Are you okay?

258
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,498
My asthma gets worse
when I get stressed out.

259
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,766
- Let's take a look at you.
- I need that back.

260
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,910
Take a seat right here.

261
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,273
I'm gonna need a good, deep
breath through your mouth.

262
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,309
- Those are blood stains.
- They're not.

263
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,111
- There's a body up there.
- Can you be quiet?

264
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,617
- You have a history of heart murmur?
- No. Just asthma.

265
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,315
- You on something?
- A little acid.

266
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,621
- I'm not talking to you.
- No. I don't do drugs anymore.

267
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,663
- Any fever? Chills?
- Is something wrong?

268
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,697
Hey, don't touch that.

269
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,632
Haleh, find her an open room. Have
somebody work her up for endocarditis.

270
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,440
Someone? As in you?

271
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,878
I'm Dr. Benton. My son is a
patient. The cops brought me here.

272
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,951
No. Three waiting for
Med/Surg. What's the name?

273
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,782
Reece Benton. He's
4 years old. He's deaf.

274
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,550
Right. Have a seat, please.

275
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:29,059
Okay. Yeah. I'm
holding here. Yes.

276
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,970
Reece. What happened?

277
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,164
Were you in a car?

278
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,309
Did you hurt your head?

279
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,005
- Can I help you?
- I'm his father. He lose consciousness?

280
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,549
- Keep that covered.
- Was he in his car seat?

281
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,016
- You have to talk to the doctor.
- Where's his mom?

282
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,951
You're busy. Tell
me where she is.

283
00:15:56,122 --> 00:16:00,082
Dr. Benton? Julia Scoft.
So the police found you.

284
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,752
One of the nurses thought that there
was a Benton at County with a deaf son.

285
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,398
- What happened?
- It was a single MVA.

286
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,899
- Where's Carla?
- Can he understand me?

287
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,435
- Was Carla or Roger driving?
- Your wife swerved...

288
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,368
She's not my wife.

289
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,906
- Oh, she isn't?
- No, no. We have shared custody.

290
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,341
Well, does she have a
husband or a close relative?

291
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:23,506
- Why? What's her status?
- I really need to speak to a relative.

292
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,882
How many people died here today?
- I don't know.

293
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,957
- You're afraid to tell me.
- I honestly don't know.

294
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,888
This place is full
of dead people.

295
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,393
Have you had any
teeth pulled recently?

296
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,224
- No. Why?
- Any infections?

297
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,731
- My piercing's been bothering me.
- Oh, it's so dope.

298
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,301
Your piercing?

299
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,369
- Where is that?
- Show him!

300
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,767
No!

301
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,271
- Melody...
- Harmony.

302
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,276
I think that you might have bacteria in
your bloodstream infecting your heart.

303
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,075
It's important that we locate
the source so we can treat it.

304
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,951
Oh.

305
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,928
Did you do that yourself?

306
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,697
- No. My friend Fiona.
- How long has it been like that?

307
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,100
Three months. She said it would
take time for the swelling to go down.

308
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,244
Definitely infected, and
I'm gonna have to drain it.

309
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,903
No! Don't drain her! Don't
let them drain you, Harmony!

310
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,072
- Get her off!
- Chill out, you're peaking!

311
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,377
Doctor! HARMONY: Dianna!

312
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,319
Dianna!

313
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,483
- Dianna!
- Oh...

314
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,126
Dianna, are you okay?

315
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,423
Ow.

316
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,795
I'll make a new chart.

317
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,174
What made you become a nurse?

318
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,444
I can't remember.

319
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,679
Ever see anything like this?

320
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,748
- How long has it been like that?
- Two, three years.

321
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,785
- You should get that looked at.
- So look!

322
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,982
By a doctor. You should
ask Luka. He's good with pus.

323
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,797
Cigarette?

324
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,658
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

325
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,202
Yeah. I'm trying to quit.

326
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,407
Wanna meet for breakfast
tomorrow? We could do it early.

327
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,511
Hey, coz! What
about my toe? I'm first!

328
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,011
Next time you're
back in town, then.

329
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,479
I'm sorry, Dad.

330
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,051
I'm sorry too,
Dad. I'm so sorry.

331
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,552
How long do you have
to fix it before it falls off?

332
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,487
Dave, I need you. Suture
his toe. He's already blocked.

333
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,854
I can't help you. I got
a chest pain rolling up.

334
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,223
Where the hell is Chen?

335
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,898
- Somebody go get me Chen!
- Are you talking to me?

336
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,262
Yes, actually. Can you
find her for me, please?

337
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,870
- Dr. Carter, Pelar is finally going up.
- Who?

338
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,803
- The kidney stone, to Urology.
- Good for Urology.

339
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,035
Well, Abby says she gave
him gent, but it wasn't charted.

340
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,010
- So should I give him a dose?
- Not if she gave him one.

341
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,048
- Then what do I do?
- Call her.

342
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,776
She's not at home.

343
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,148
- Call her cell.
- You got her number?

344
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,957
You know what?

345
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,559
I need to yell at her anyway.

346
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:30,893
Hello?

347
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,963
- Having fun?
<i>- Carter?</i>

348
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,731
Are you out having a good time?

349
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,342
No, not exactly.
What are you doing?

350
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,446
I am setting a wrist
on an "LSDiva."

351
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,078
You're working?

352
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:45,047
Someone talked me into coming
back and begging Weaver...

353
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,448
and I got sucked back
in to the ER vortex.

354
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,447
I didn't tell you to
talk to her tonight.

355
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,256
- You give gent to the kidney stone in 4?
<i>- No.</i>

356
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,090
- Malik said you did.
- No. That was the gall-bladder guy.

357
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:02,930
<i>- I thought you had an early shift.</i>
- I do. Luka dragged me to this bar.

358
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,934
So much for quitting.

359
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,800
- Oh, hey.
<i>- What?</i>

360
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,565
- Who is that?
- It's Carter.

361
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,802
- Is that Luka?
- Can you hang on a second?

362
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,172
Things are dying down.
I'm going to Doc Magoo's.

363
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,147
Things aren't dying down.
I've got five patients. I'm not on.

364
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,753
Then sign out. Go home.

365
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,924
I gotta go.

366
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,184
- You don't need to hang up for me.
- It was about a patient.

367
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,261
- You ready to go?
- If you want.

368
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,533
- Yeah, Luka, I want.
- Fine.

369
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,797
What? Now you're mad?

370
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,734
Finish your cigarette.
I'll pay the bill.

371
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,392
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Carla McGrath.

372
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,063
Roger.

373
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,366
I'm sorry, man.

374
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,146
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

375
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,541
- Do I go in, or what?
- The doctor will be right back.

376
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,921
What's he gonna tell me?

377
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,522
You should just wait.

378
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,955
Peter, come on.
What's he gonna tell me?

379
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,058
She came in without a blood pressure.
They worked on her for over an hour...

380
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:46,672
but she had massive internal
bleeding, and it was too severe to repair.

381
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,573
Was she awake?

382
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,340
No. She was...

383
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,550
There was a faint
pulse in the field...

384
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,251
but she was pretty
much gone on impact.

385
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:09,128
We were supposed to go
to Wisconsin this weekend...

386
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,263
but I had to work last-minute.

387
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,902
- You sure Reece is okay?
- Yeah, yeah. He cut his head, but...

388
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,041
Mr. McGrath? Dr. Scoft. I
was the treating physician.

389
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,575
- I'm here if you have any questions.
- Can I see her?

390
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,405
Of course.

391
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,652
I'm right here if you need me.

392
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,653
<i>Orderly to Central Supply.</i>

393
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:19,265
<i>Orderly, please report
to Central Supply.</i>

394
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,634
We had to trim a little hair.

395
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:29,032
The doctor will
be with you shortly.

396
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,911
Mom.

397
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,413
Reece.

398
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,983
Mom.

399
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:44,021
Mommy went away. She's gone.

400
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:49,291
Mommy was hurt very badly.

401
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,022
I can't.

402
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,334
She was...

403
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,231
She was bleeding.

404
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,496
The doctor...

405
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,842
Mommy went bye-bye.

406
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,512
She went to be with God.

407
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,147
I can't.

408
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,692
She's sleeping.
She's sleeping forever.

409
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,260
Mom.

410
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,294
I can't.

411
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,990
She won't wake up.

412
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:45,249
Sometimes people can't wake up.

413
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,726
Reece. Reece, Reece.

414
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,692
Mommy died.

415
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,625
Mommy's dead.

416
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,252
No response to Narcan.
BP's 108/76. Pulse, 110.

417
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,985
- Young for chest pain.
- He was complaining all day long.

418
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:33,257
- Thought it was a meatball sandwich.
- On my count. One, two, three.

419
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,165
Any history of early heart
disease in your family?

420
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,735
Our grandmother had diabetes.

421
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,134
CBC, chem panel, 12-lead
and a portable chest.

422
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,432
- What's his name?
- Paul.

423
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,167
- Paul, can you hear me?
- Pulse ox, 98.

424
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,642
Well, no evidence of
trauma. He just collapsed?

425
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:49,941
He's been pushing himself hard.
His first solo show opens Monday.

426
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,947
I haven't seen him
sleep the whole week.

427
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,949
Does your brother do drugs?

428
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,747
- No, I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

429
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,789
It's the first time I've seen
him since he moved to Chicago.

430
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,587
- All right. Let's get a tox screen.
- Here's your EKG.

431
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,287
I don't think he would.
He's an artist, but that...

432
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,434
ST elevations are off the
charts. He's having a major MI.

433
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,364
What? MALUCCI: Heart attack.

434
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,435
- He's 27.
- It happens with stimulants.

435
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,698
- Cocaine can constrict the arteries.
- Oh, God!

436
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:19,038
- 40 of tenecteplase. Gotta bust the clot.
- I need Attending to order thrombolytics.

437
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:22,010
- Let's go!
- You need to run this by Chen or Weaver.

438
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,309
- Get one of them!
- Shooting.

439
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,487
Pressure's dropping
to 70/30. Pulse is 130.

440
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,987
Bolus 500 of saline.
Halsted clamp.

441
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,318
You got bleeders popping
up like prairie dogs.

442
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,860
Pediatric pancreatic transection.
Splenic vessels won't separate.

443
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,827
How old? CORDAY: Seven.

444
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,522
You're not taking the spleen?

445
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,531
Not if I don't
have to. 4-0 Vicryl.

446
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,636
How much blood loss?

447
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,294
Over a liter.

448
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:47,804
- Dr. Corday?
- What?

449
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,670
Taching at 140. CORDAY:
Must've torn the splenic vein.

450
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,369
- Side-biting clamp.
- Dr. Corday.

451
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,138
- What?
- You're leaking.

452
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,513
Oh, damn!

453
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,249
- Is that breast milk?
- I should have pumped.

454
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,478
Is it sterile?

455
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,333
No, you're
contaminated. Scrub out.

456
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,683
- Fresh gown, fresh gloves.
- It's gonna leak again. Go pump.

457
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,636
Hang a unit of packed cells.
- Now!

458
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,151
Okay!

459
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,821
What the hell does the
guy want, a suite at the Ritz?

460
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,558
His manager freaked out
when I said we had to move him.

461
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,704
Excuse me. I thought this
guy wasn't even famous yet.

462
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,601
It's not about fame, jerk-off.

463
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,367
Jim, can we clear this
whole area here? Thank you.

464
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,706
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Find an open telemetry bed.

465
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,077
- You gave the last one to his friend.
- All right. Any open exam room.

466
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,581
- Fascist.
- Freak.

467
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,082
- Geek.
- Goof.

468
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,720
What?

469
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,679
Okay. Where were we?

470
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:40,917
- Does it take this long to fix a toe?
- When your buddies come in OD'd, yeah.

471
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,221
Hey, that's not my fault.

472
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:47,355
- Saying it's mine?
- You need more doctors or something.

473
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,365
Doctor, this is Vince
Newberry's mom.

474
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,527
- Who?
- The OD you sent to telemetry.

475
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,729
- You don't remember?
- I see lots of patients.

476
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,238
- He almost died.
- I saved him.

477
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,399
- Do you know my name?
- Hi, Mrs. Newberry.

478
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,603
- What kind of doctor are you?
- Why don't we take a step over here?

479
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,647
- I'm still here!
- I'm Dr. Carter. I treated your son.

480
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,943
- I heard he stopped breathing.
- For a moment.

481
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:10,249
We put a tube in his throat, a machine's
been breathing for him for a few hours.

482
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,915
- Is he in a coma?
- Not exactly. He should wake up soon.

483
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:18,155
- It's that liquid G junk, isn't it?
- Along with alcohol, yes.

484
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,392
I told him to stay
away from that stuff.

485
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,468
It can be dangerous.

486
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,298
- Where is he?
- Your... Your nose...

487
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,962
- What?
- Your nose is bleeding.

488
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,804
- Oh, damn! Not again.
- Take a seat right here.

489
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,502
Give it a good pinch.

490
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:39,583
You know, every time I get
worried, it gushes like a fountain.

491
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,982
Shouldn't I be there?
He's having a heart attack.

492
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,316
You have to give the
doctor room to work.

493
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,119
- Nitro's going to 10 mics.
- Titrate to a systolic of 100.

494
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,922
- Do you need help, Dave?
- One 27-year-old with acute MI.

495
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,361
I'm thinking cocaine.
We're ready to push TNK.

496
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,831
- Hold on. Did you get a tox screen?
- I sent one.

497
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,163
He's killing off myocardial
cells while we wait.

498
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,033
- Any recent surgery?
- No.

499
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,674
- Bleeding disorder?
- Clots well at blood draw sites.

500
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,104
- X-ray's clear.
- Dr. Chen.

501
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:08,338
- PCO2 and your subdural's up to 30.
- Oh, okay.

502
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:11,978
Increase the ACU to 16
and drop him to 80 percent.

503
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,178
- So, what about the cath lab?
- It takes them two hours to get in.

504
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,983
- Where's Weaver?
- I can't find her.

505
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,125
- Did you page her?
- Yeah.

506
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,557
You want to wait
for him to arrest?

507
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,699
Okay. Do it.

508
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,964
- How about ReoPro?
- If Cardiology takes him for stenting.

509
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:37,405
Won't need it if we lyse the thrombus.
- Doc, the tox screen.

510
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:43,244
- Cocaine, right?
- Negative for cocaine and amphetamines.

511
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:46,249
He could've just taken them.
Haven't had time to show up.

512
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,887
- Did you do a lipid panel?
- No, but we could add it on.

513
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,082
- We've got V-tach.
- Charge the paddles.

514
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,525
- No pulse. Starting compressions.
- Charge to 200. Push an amp of epi.

515
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,063
It's too early for a
reperfusion arrhythmia.

516
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,499
Get ready to intubate. Clear.

517
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:09,231
- Still V-tach.
- Charge to 300. Page Weaver again.

518
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,933
Clear!

519
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,513
I'm taking a cab.

520
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,419
- Where did you go?
- I was waiting for you outside.

521
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,027
I thought you were
coming back in. I...

522
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,929
Bye-bye.

523
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,902
Sorry. That guy's father got diagnosed
with prostate cancer last month.

524
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,872
- He was asking about treatment options.
- Go talk to him.

525
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,567
- He's calling tomorrow.
- I'm fine.

526
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,373
Luka, you forgot
your credit card.

527
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,812
- Thanks.
- The last two were on the house.

528
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,575
- Oh, no. How much?
- Our treat.

529
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,380
We want to make sure
you're gonna come back.

530
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,614
- Here. For you.
- Thank you. Good night.

531
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,155
- Night.
- Nice meeting you.

532
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,122
Yeah.

533
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,097
- Could you be a little bit more rude?
- Could you be more friendly?

534
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:14,933
- I'm glad one of us is.
- Go back inside. Cure cancer for the U.N.

535
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,769
- Where are you going?
- Taking the El.

536
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:20,071
- Still V-fib.
- 100 of lidocaine. Charge again to 360.

537
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,989
Good breath sounds.
- There you are.

538
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,413
- Clear!
- I am not staying.

539
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,414
I'm going to pack
this woman's nose...

540
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,679
and then you are gonna
take the rest of these misfits.

541
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,651
You're sure there
wasn't GI bleeding?

542
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,257
Stool was guaiac negative.
No contraindications.

543
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,360
- Clear!
- What happened?

544
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,796
- Fatal MI. Probably drug-related.
- Are you sure? He looks Marfanoid.

545
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,661
- What?
- Marfan syndrome.

546
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,359
Tall stature, pectus
excavatum, loose joints.

547
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,267
- You got a history.
- I did. Brother didn't say anything.

548
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,170
- He might not know.
- They have weak connective tissue.

549
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,833
- Keep going.
- He's dissecting.

550
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,809
- Try amiodarone. Might get a rhythm.
- We gave tenecteplase.

551
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,881
- What?
- He had ST elevation.

552
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,812
Thrombolytics to
an aortic dissection?

553
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:02,148
- We didn't know it was a dissection!
- He's bleeding into his chest.

554
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,846
- Thoracotomy tray.
- No! He'll bleed all over the floor.

555
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,321
We gotta do something.

556
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,618
O-neg cryo and FFP.

557
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,821
We can do a chest tube to confirm
the hemothorax and start a line.

558
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,626
Okay, let's go! Prep the chest.

559
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,566
I was trying to have
fun. Is that a crime?

560
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,205
No. Go have fun.

561
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:24,207
If I can be left waiting in the street,
I can certainly walk home by myself.

562
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,974
Why do you make a big
problem out of everything?

563
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:31,879
- Like you have an insect in your anus.
- Hey, it's "bug up my ass," Luka.

564
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,078
"Bug up my ass." If you're gonna
insult me, at least get the words right.

565
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:40,487
- How's this? Stop being such a bitch.
- Okay, fine. As soon as you grow up.

566
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,060
You're so mature. You don't
even know what you want.

567
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,753
Yes, I do. I want to go home.

568
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,365
You're like the schoolgirl who can
have any boy and treats them like crap.

569
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,731
Why don't you just call me
a whore and get it over with?

570
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,772
I'm tired of it. You're not that
pretty. You're not that special.

571
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,347
I'm pretty enough
in the dark, aren't I?

572
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,416
You're never happy. I don't think
you're capable of being happy.

573
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,746
Six months ago, you
didn't care if I was happy.

574
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,888
If you're not depressed,
you're just angry.

575
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,853
And you're married to a ghost.

576
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,722
- At least I treat you with respect.
- Oh, I know. You're a saint.

577
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,094
- Thora-Seal.
- I can't thread the guide wire.

578
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,532
Rotate the bevel 90 degrees.

579
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,604
Damn it! CHEN: No good.

580
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,798
- Looks like his entire blood volume.
- How much O-neg do we have?

581
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,069
- Third and fourth unit are up.
- Get another four! We need that FFP!

582
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,874
- Where is Weaver?
- We've been paging her for 15 minutes.

583
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,379
- Doc Magoo's.
- What?

584
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,643
She said something about
going to Doc Magoo's.

585
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:43,118
Right. I know. You're always
so good, and I'm so bad.

586
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:46,952
- I'm sick of being patient.
- I'm a mess, you're so understanding.

587
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,560
- And I'm a burden.
- Carter, your mother, your moods...

588
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:53,392
- Why don't you just break up with me?
- I think you want me to.

589
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,296
If I'm such a horrible person, how
could you possibly want to be with me?

590
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,563
I don't know how to be
with you or help you...

591
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,468
I don't want help.

592
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,131
I don't want help.

593
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,903
I don't want to be pitied.
I don't want to be saved.

594
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,340
Okay.

595
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,412
- Okay. I give up.
- Okay?

596
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,447
What does that mean?

597
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,611
What does that
mean? Why don't you...

598
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:18,314
I'm done! I'm done,
okay? Carter can have you.

599
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,125
Okay.

600
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,971
Okay. The catheter is passing.

601
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,835
- Any pulse with compression?
- Weak one.

602
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,374
- Got the plasma. CHEN:
Yeah. Run it in here.

603
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,672
- Are we cracking him or not?
- He can't clot. He'll exsanguinate.

604
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,542
He already has.

605
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,344
- Please get Weaver, John.
- Haleh, can you page her again?

606
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,680
If we're gonna try
this, we gotta do it now.

607
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:53,348
I am not opening his chest without
Weaver. Could you get her? Now?

608
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,022
Okay. Go ahead, prep. 4-0 silk.

609
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,959
- We can't wait.
- Wait!

610
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,531
- Slow down, Doogie!
- He's got a tube in his throat!

611
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,294
You were gonna draw a blood gas.

612
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,829
- Is that his doctor?
- Yes.

613
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,303
We need a private room!

614
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,063
Dr. Weaver?

615
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:41,064
- Wait. Where are you?
- Chest-tube output is 4 liters.

616
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,334
Ruptured aortic dissection.
We gave 40 of tenecteplase.

617
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,772
Put the scalpel down.

618
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,004
He's had cryoprecipitate,
4 units FFP.

619
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,410
- He might clot.
- He'll keep lysing the thrombin.

620
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,633
Gotta open the
chest to fix the defect.

621
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:54,883
It's a proximal lesion.
Can't cross-clamp.

622
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:58,546
- Can we try anything else?
- Stop compressions.

623
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,385
You killed him.

624
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:20,672
- Almost done, okay?
- One more.

625
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,440
One more. Hey.

626
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:29,316
You okay, Reece? Doctor
will make it better. Right?

627
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,995
I know. Mom's gone.

628
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:40,394
Finished. I'll have the nurse
dress it, and then you're free to go.

629
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,864
All right, thanks. I can
remove the suture, right?

630
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,969
In seven days.

631
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,072
Listen, they're transferring
her to the morgue till morning.

632
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:50,174
I've gotta find a funeral home.

633
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,970
- You call the parents?
- Yeah, they're on their way.

634
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:57,240
- Listen, Roger, tell them that I'm...
- It's cool.

635
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,874
Can you take him tonight?
I'm gonna have to stay.

636
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,915
Yeah. I was going to anyway.

637
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,359
Right, right. Thanks.

638
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:13,658
Reece, you have to go with
your father tonight, okay?

639
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:17,234
But I'll see you tomorrow...

640
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,395
or the next day, okay?

641
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:27,407
I love you too.

642
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,423
You don't know what
Marfan's looks like?

643
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:51,264
He's an artist. His brother said he
was up all week. I was thinking cocaine.

644
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:55,305
Did you check the blood
pressures in both arms?

645
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,642
- I don't think so.
- Did you or didn't you?

646
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,402
No.

647
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:04,009
You didn't recognize the
widened mediastinum?

648
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,048
Not until after he arrested.

649
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:10,154
Apical-capping tracheal shift to
the right is classic for a dissection.

650
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,950
I was told that it was clear.

651
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,684
- I meant, no hemothorax.
- Wait a minute.

652
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,991
You didn't look at the x-ray before
you signed off on thrombolytics?

653
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,657
Jing-Mei.

654
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,164
Jing-Mei?

655
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:30,633
- No. I should have.
- Yeah. You should have!

656
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,268
Look, you didn't answer your page.
We had to make a quick decision.

657
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:38,109
That's your job! Make quick decisions
based on the information available.

658
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,916
You had the right information.
You didn't bother to look at it.

659
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:45,818
- You've never made a bad call?
- Not as stupid and lethal as this one.

660
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,188
Then show up and make it
yourself. We paged you three times!

661
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,295
In a perfect world,
Dr. Malucci...

662
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:54,261
I wouldn't subject any
patients to your care.

663
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,163
If you knew your ass from your
elbow, or even gave a damn...

664
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,999
- I do give a damn. I do give a damn.
- This man might still be alive!

665
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,542
He dissected into his coronaries. He'd
probably never survive surgery anyway.

666
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,703
Well, we'll never
know that, will we?

667
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,678
The rest of the family should be
screened. I'll talk to the brother.

668
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,878
Wait. Dave, I'll do it.
- No. I will.

669
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:19,422
No one talks to
anyone about this case.

670
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,526
Is that clear?

671
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,796
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

672
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:27,996
Ice that back, Carter.

673
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,305
- Get up and help me! Mark!
- What?

674
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,979
Get up and help me!

675
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,378
There's poop all over the
bassinet. It's running down her legs.

676
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,247
- You didn't tighten the bloody diaper!
- God! What time is it?

677
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,185
- Now!
- Okay, okay, okay.

678
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:29,088
- I heard her crying from downstairs!
- I'm sorry. I must have passed out.

679
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,729
- I told you to double up!
- I thought I did.

680
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,424
- Look at this!
- Calm down. It's not fatal.

681
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,503
Yeah, okay! You take
her! I'll run her bath.

682
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,800
Why don't you just go back to
bed, and I'll take care of her?

683
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:46,604
Don't make me the bitch just because
you can't follow simple instructions!

684
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:51,614
- I was just offering to take care of it.
- Splendid job you've done of it so far!

685
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:55,777
Fine. You take care of it.
I've got a shift in three hours.

686
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:00,080
What do you think I'll be doing in
three hours? I'm the feeding trough!

687
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:06,129
- If I could breast-feed, I would.
- Oh, great. Great! You take it!

688
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,997
Take it all! The sore nipples,
the rashes, the hemorrhoids...

689
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,968
the leaking in your trauma
gown, the public humiliation...

690
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:19,702
sleep deprivation, the incontinence,
for goodness' sake. It's all yours!

691
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,215
There you go.

692
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,183
Watch out for that
volcano next time.

693
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,450
Malik, can you dress that
toe and fit him for a cast shoe?

694
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,819
Sorry, I'm off.

695
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,168
Can I help you?

696
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,568
Did anyone turn in a pager?

697
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,471
No. I don't think so.

698
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,858
Carter, I saw your
lady with the nosebleed.

699
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,194
I'm scheduling her for
a septoplasty next week.

700
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,565
- She had a defect?
- That you could drive a truck through.

701
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,400
I guess 2 grams of
coke a day will do that.

702
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,066
- Nap note?
- I was supposed to be off last night.

703
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:28,679
You're not in Surgery.
Don't punish yourself. Go.

704
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,247
No. I'm on at noon. I'm
just gonna go pass out.

705
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,079
Bad idea. You
know what they say:

706
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:37,848
"The longer you stay,
the longer you stay."

707
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,284
Conni, I need you to dress
a toe for me in Curtain 2.

708
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,896
- After my break.
- Yeah, whenever.

709
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,059
Hey.

710
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,596
Reece, what's wrong?

711
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,097
Bad dreams?

712
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,930
You want to sleep here?

713
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,039
Come on.

714
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:34,601
Okay. It's okay. It's okay.
