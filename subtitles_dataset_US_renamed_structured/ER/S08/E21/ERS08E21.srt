1
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:11,410
- You set the tone, Carter.
- What?

2
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,208
Work on your jump shot.

3
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,893
Mark.

4
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,396
Hey.

5
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:45,733
- What are you doing?
- I'm feeling sorry for myself.

6
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,804
- I made you some soup.
- Uh, no, thanks.

7
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,038
Do you want me to put
some drops in your eye?

8
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,977
I just did it.

9
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,174
Just making a list.

10
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:02,153
Things I've always wanted to
do but I never found time for.

11
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,550
- What, too morbid?
- A bit.

12
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,128
- You wanna hear it?
- Sure.

13
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,123
- Got a little carried away.
- Mm-hm.

14
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,061
"Sail around the world.

15
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,261
Climb Mount Kilimanjaro.

16
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,174
Play third base for
the Cubs and hit a

17
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:21,238
sacrifice fly to drive
in the winning run...

18
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,808
in the seventh game of the
World Series." They get better.

19
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,209
Uh-huh.

20
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,349
"Start a garage band and end
up on the cover of <i>Rolling Stone."</i>

21
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,279
Do you even play an instrument?

22
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,579
No, but I've always
wanted to trash a hotel room.

23
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,849
"Jump out of an airplane.
Have noisy sex in a public place."

24
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,516
I can help you with that one.

25
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:44,859
"Smoke hand-rolled Cuban cigars
while drinking dark Caribbean rum...

26
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:49,231
in a sidewalk cafÃ© overlooking
the Havana seawall."

27
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,269
That's a really good one.

28
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:55,603
"Get towed into Maverick's on
a big gun and live to tell about it.

29
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,208
Find Jerry Walker and beat
the living crap out of him."

30
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,043
- And who's he?
- Tenth grade. Long story.

31
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,951
"Take the kids to Disney World.

32
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:11,183
Teach Ella how to ice-skate at
Rockefeller Center at Christmastime.

33
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,623
Teach Rachel how to drive.

34
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,727
Be there to give them both
away at their weddings."

35
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,562
I told you I was sitting down
here feeling sorry for myself.

36
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:28,197
We could all go to
Disney World. I'd like that.

37
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,511
I haven't been a
very good father.

38
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,114
- Yes, you have.
- No, I haven't.

39
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,343
I wasn't there when she
needed me. I was 400 miles away.

40
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,923
A phone call on Saturdays. A
couple of weeks in the summer.

41
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,088
You know what the
last thing on my list is?

42
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,632
"Fix Rachel."

43
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,722
Rachel.

44
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,597
Rachel!

45
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,465
- See you. Bye.
- Bye.

46
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,899
Hey.

47
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,902
Breath mint?

48
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,206
- For that cigarette?
- I was holding it for a friend.

49
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,043
In your mouth?

50
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,878
- What are you doing here?
- Picking you up.

51
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,385
- Anything in your locker you need?
- What?

52
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,854
- Is there anything you need right away?
- No.

53
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,822
Okay, come on.

54
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,559
Where are we going?

55
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,026
Honestly, Rachel, I don't know.

56
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,540
Here we go!

57
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,969
Is that your dad? - Yeah.

58
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,140
Midlife crisis?

59
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,611
Something like that.

60
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,120
Aloha. GREENE: Morning.

61
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,735
Hey.

62
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,848
- What?
- You hungry?

63
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,143
- What time is it?
- It's almost 8.

64
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,485
Uch. Oh, God.

65
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,589
Told you not to stay up
late watching that movie.

66
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,590
Come on, time's
a-wasting. Gotta go.

67
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,456
- Go where?
- History lesson.

68
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,496
- What?
- My history.

69
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,968
- What's with this music?
- You don't like Todd Rundgren?

70
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:20,266
- Can we change the station?
- No. I like this.

71
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,945
- This is where everything blew up?
- Yeah.

72
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,808
That's Battleship Row.

73
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,779
See the white building?

74
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,180
That's the Arizona Memorial.

75
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,679
When I was a kid, there
wasn't a bridge here.

76
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,723
You used to have to take the
ferry back and forth to school...

77
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,952
to the movies, to shop.

78
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,861
It was kind of cool.

79
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,358
I loved living in Hawaii.

80
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,470
Mom had flower
gardens everywhere.

81
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,506
That's what she used to do when
Dad was gone, to keep busy. Garden.

82
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:59,977
I hated it. She used to make
me weed, fertilize, mow the lawn.

83
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:06,483
Last ferry was at 11:00, so Navy
kids mostly just stayed on the base.

84
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:12,923
The golf course, you know, the
pool, bowling alley, youth center.

85
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,892
- You were a bowler?
- Yeah.

86
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,563
Mostly just rode our bikes
around, went to the beach...

87
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,727
got in trouble trying to
sneak into restricted areas.

88
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,329
How long were you here?

89
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,236
Three years.

90
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,740
Longest time we ever
spent in one place.

91
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,181
All the good kids were JROTC,
hoping to get into Annapolis.

92
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,378
I hung out with
the troublemakers.

93
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:46,857
A couple of teenagers
acting dangerous, tough.

94
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,620
I had my first job here.

95
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,026
- You were a lifeguard?
- No. Junior janitor.

96
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:57,865
I'd get here at 6 a.m., sweep up,
mop the locker rooms, skim the pool.

97
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,098
$1.25 an hour.

98
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,208
That's slave wages.

99
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,903
It was enough to keep me in
new records and good weed.

100
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,483
What? You know,
records, LPs, vinyls.

101
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,613
Those funny, big, black things that your
hip-hop heroes rip off for their songs.

102
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,218
Come on.

103
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,131
I wanna show you something,
just a couple blocks away.

104
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:30,100
Sixteen-inch guns could lob
a 2000-pound shell 23 miles.

105
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,071
When a bombardment commenced,
you could hear it 40 miles away.

106
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:38,969
Up there's where the Japanese
surrendered. Tokyo Harbor.

107
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,579
Your grandfather took
me up to the bridge once.

108
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,948
Not here on the <i>Missouri</i>, but on
a sub tender that he was the XO of.

109
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,353
They used to let sailors bring families
onboard, steam around the harbor.

110
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:56,155
Kind of a take-your-kid-to-work
day, only Dad's office was a warship.

111
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,999
He introduced me to all the
sailors on watch, stuck a hat on me.

112
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,127
- One of those white Gilligan things?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:10,671
Held me up so I could man the helm,
showed me what everything was for.

114
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,335
I was about your age.

115
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,016
Sounds like you liked it.

116
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,341
I did.

117
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,180
So why didn't you join the Navy?

118
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,415
I was mad at my dad.

119
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,524
- For what?
- Never being around, I guess.

120
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,855
We used to fight all the time.

121
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:38,832
About music I listened to, my clothes,
my friends, the length of my hair.

122
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:44,041
Don't laugh, I used
to have hair. Lots of it.

123
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,370
Down to my shoulders.

124
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,978
He resented my
politics. I hated his.

125
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,090
I used to try and provoke him,
you know, just try to piss him off.

126
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,226
I was good at it.

127
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,724
I hated everything
that he stood for...

128
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,398
and I made sure that he knew it.

129
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,262
What did he stand for?

130
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:12,701
Patriotism, responsibility,
authority, honor.

131
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,835
The Navy, most of all.

132
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,243
I'd take it all back
now if I could.

133
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,846
But I can't.

134
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,620
He rode me pretty hard
when he was around.

135
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,082
I think he was worried about me.

136
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,124
He was worried about
the choices I was making...

137
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,789
and the things that
I was interested in.

138
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,262
Like what?

139
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,893
Like, uh...

140
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,099
girls, for one.

141
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:51,067
Bruce Lee flicks,
rock 'n' roll, surfing.

142
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,110
- Surfing?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,542
Don't look so surprised.

144
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,212
Surfing?

145
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,379
You're doing great. You
almost stood up on that last one.

146
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,318
Okay, lie down.

147
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,287
- I'm gonna push you. Ready?
- Yeah.

148
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,221
- You ready?
- Yeah.

149
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,594
Paddle, paddle,
paddle, paddle! Go, go!

150
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,270
Stand up!

151
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,803
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

152
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,834
Oh, my God!

153
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,735
Yes!

154
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,015
Dad?

155
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,619
Dad?

156
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,775
You know this one, right?

157
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,378
You gotta know who this is.

158
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,871
What is this place?

159
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,872
It's a retreat house.
I rented it for a week.

160
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,102
- A what?
- Relax. You're gonna love it.

161
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,524
There's no TV in my room.

162
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,432
- Right.
- Where's the TV?

163
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,134
I don't think there is one.

164
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,042
Is there a pool?

165
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,504
Ocean.

166
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,448
Hotel was getting too expensive.

167
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,849
The minibar charges alone
were starting to add up.

168
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,784
Once you're done unpacking,
you can help me with dinner.

169
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,358
Is there a phone?

170
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,188
Should be around here someplace.

171
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,128
- What are we supposed to do?
- I don't know.

172
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,533
Swim, walk on the beach...

173
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,195
surf.

174
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,460
Put your right foot on the
brake, left foot on the clutch.

175
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,657
Good. Clutch all the way in.

176
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,803
Okay, now put it in first gear.

177
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,599
Remember where that is?
Just straight up. Good, good.

178
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,606
Okay, now, you wanna ease
your right foot off of the brake...

179
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,073
and onto the accelerator.

180
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,611
Okay, ease off on the clutch.

181
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,771
A little gas. Ease
off on the clutch.

182
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,814
Hey, there you go.

183
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,748
Oh! Whoa.

184
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,766
- What'd I do?
- It's all right.

185
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,516
It's just a balance
thing, you know?

186
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:07,182
It's kind of a balance between
the clutch and the accelerator.

187
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,296
It's a feel thing. It just
takes a little practice.

188
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,591
All right, let's try it again.

189
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,496
Okay, make sure it's in neutral.

190
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,603
Good. Put that clutch in.

191
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,036
Put the brake on. Okay,
turn the ignition over.

192
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,669
Okay, make sure that
clutch is pushed all the way in.

193
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,871
- Got it in neutral.
- I... Okay.

194
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,949
Turn the ignition over again.

195
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,980
Okay, now put it up into first.

196
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,724
Okay, right foot off of that
brake, put it on the accelerator.

197
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,156
Ease off the clutch.

198
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,660
Whoa!

199
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:52,503
- Maybe I should try an automatic.
- No, no. It's best to learn with a stick.

200
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,504
Mom has an automatic.

201
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,006
Come on, put it in neutral.

202
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,802
- I don't want to.
- Rachel, if you fall off the horse...

203
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,210
you gotta get right back on.

204
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,177
- The horse?
- Come on. You almost got it.

205
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,683
Let's go.

206
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,186
There you go. Right foot on the
brake, left foot on the clutch. Neutral.

207
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,018
Start it up.

208
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,050
There you go.

209
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,025
There you go.

210
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,566
Okay, let off that clutch.

211
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,892
Let it off.

212
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,898
Hey, hey! We're going. We're
driving. We're driving, we're driving!

213
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,010
- Okay, now shift.
- What?

214
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,907
- Shift. Put it into second.
- How? What?

215
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,707
Clutch in. Pull it
down to second.

216
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,376
Second. Yeah, yeah, that's it.

217
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,747
Good, yes! We're driving! Whoo!

218
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,185
We're driving! We're free!

219
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,420
Dad?

220
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,958
Dad?

221
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,632
Dad?

222
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,703
- Huh?
- Are you okay?

223
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,338
Yeah.

224
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,246
Your headache back?

225
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,120
I'm all right.

226
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,227
Well, I was gonna
go to the beach.

227
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,730
Okay.

228
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,663
Are you coming?

229
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,767
Be down there in a minute.

230
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,286
Beautiful, isn't it?

231
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,956
Hey.

232
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,461
It's beautiful, huh?

233
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:09,297
- Your headache better?
- Yeah, thanks.

234
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,837
What are you listening to?

235
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,976
You wouldn't like it.

236
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,223
When did you start getting high?

237
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,856
I don't.

238
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,999
I was loaded most of the eighth grade.
I'm no fool. Stop treating me like one.

239
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,033
I don't get high.

240
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,638
I'm missing three Vicodin.

241
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,138
Any idea what happened to them?

242
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,007
Maybe you took them and forgot.

243
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,740
What else are you doing?

244
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,884
We know about the
Ecstasy. Now the Vicodin.

245
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,387
- Huffing? Speed?
- I already told you, nothing.

246
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,957
Crystal meth, what?

247
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:04,054
- You don't believe me, fine!
- Rachel.

248
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,697
Rachel! Rach!

249
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,562
You're only 14.

250
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,932
What the hell are you gonna be
putting in your body when you're 16?

251
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,096
We're gonna talk about this.

252
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,902
Rachel, damn it, stop.

253
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,445
I love you. Please,
don't do this.

254
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,173
I don't...

255
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,118
I don't know what to do.

256
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,746
I don't have time to work this through.
I'm not gonna be here in a year to help.

257
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,052
You got a bastard of a
father who was never around...

258
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,388
and then went off
and had a new baby.

259
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,691
Your mom got remarried to
a creep, she works too much.

260
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:44,428
You got a raw deal, all
right? Why not get high?

261
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,765
No one gives a damn
about you anyway.

262
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,408
I know how that feels.

263
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:55,075
I remember being 14 and
pissed off at my dad and the world.

264
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,150
What are you gonna
do when I'm not here?

265
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,254
Who is gonna keep you from
killing yourself? I'm scared.

266
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:05,285
Scared about what's
gonna happen to you.

267
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:10,090
Look, it sucks! I'm your
father, and I'm gonna die.

268
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,721
You know what?
I think it sucks too.

269
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,503
No, it's... Yeah.

270
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,339
No, it's fine.

271
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,342
I'm great.

272
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,780
No, I'm feeling good.

273
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,441
<i>- All right.</i>
- How's Ella?

274
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,452
<i>She's wonderful. The
tooth finally grew in.</i>

275
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,850
- Really?
<i>- Yeah, finally.</i>

276
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,355
- That's great.
<i>- How's Rachel doing?</i>

277
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,828
She's fine.

278
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,258
You know...

279
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,987
fourteen.

280
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,862
You wanna go out
to dinner or eat here?

281
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,497
I think we have
some of that ono left.

282
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,826
Vegetables, ice...

283
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,162
I want pizza. Can
we get some pizza?

284
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,828
There's that place down by the surf
shop that looked pretty good. Some olive...

285
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,232
Dad?

286
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,373
God, Dad?

287
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,911
Dad? Dad?

288
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,273
Mark?

289
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,145
Mark!

290
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,587
Oh, my goodness, look.

291
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,125
Mark?

292
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,644
Hi.

293
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,945
Hi.

294
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,457
We were out driving around,
I saw the vacation-rental sign.

295
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,656
- It must cost a fortune.
- You only live once.

296
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,003
There's a lady named Janet. She
lives up the road, takes care of children.

297
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,162
She said she'd be
happy to help out.

298
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,970
- Huh. What's this?
- Herbs. Got a whole bunch of them.

299
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:16,081
Take them in the morning, the
afternoon. Boosts my immune system.

300
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,911
- Is this snakeskin?
- Could be.

301
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:22,486
The lady who does my
acupuncture gave them to me.

302
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,179
Couldn't hurt.

303
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,723
I can't find a corkscrew.
How about a beer?

304
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,383
Sure.

305
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,229
So where's Rachel?

306
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,262
She's out surfing.

307
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,534
She found you in a
grand mal seizure.

308
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,434
It's no big deal.

309
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,870
She was scared to
death when she called me.

310
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,206
- What did the neurologist say?
- Up the Dilantin to 400.

311
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,370
You didn't see a doctor?

312
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,945
- Nope.
- How do you know what your level is?

313
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,949
I'm fine.

314
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,212
Mark, you need a CAT
scan and a full workup.

315
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,684
No, thanks.

316
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,525
Take my hand. Come on.

317
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,561
Squeeze my fingers.

318
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,662
What about your wrist?

319
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,936
Your elbow?

320
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,803
All right, we're going home.

321
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,108
You need an MRI and
to see the neurologist.

322
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,241
No.

323
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,053
I don't wanna go back home.

324
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,093
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

325
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,634
Come on, let me
show you the beach.

326
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,177
What's she gonna do with
a surfboard in St. Louis?

327
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,314
Let it gather dust
in the garage.

328
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:58,610
- Has she been like this the whole time?
- Pretty much.

329
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,275
Lucky you.

330
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,150
- Hey, I never knew they were so tall.
- Some are. Some aren't.

331
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,964
Hey, I'm looking for a long
board for my daughter. She's 14.

332
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:18,503
- How long were you thinking?
- Nine, 9'1". Maybe a Hamilton.

333
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,771
- What's she doing?
- It's okay.

334
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,877
- Does she even want a surfboard?
- Watch this.

335
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,535
I know.

336
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,306
- Who's he?
- Don't stare. It'll upset her.

337
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,145
- Well, does she know him?
- He works here. His name's Kai.

338
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,550
- Kai?
- Kai. It means "ocean."

339
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:41,125
She's made up a new excuse why we
had to come back the last three days.

340
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,652
- How old is he?
- I don't know.

341
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,821
- He looks at least 16.
- Could be.

342
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,489
Maybe 17.

343
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,727
I have some boards she might
like. A Papa San and a Sunburnt.

344
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,394
Good.

345
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,511
Rachel, can you
come and help me?

346
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,459
Remember when I
used to sing you to sleep?

347
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,221
No.

348
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,570
You made me do it for years.

349
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,565
You watched <i>The Wizard of
Oz</i> and <i>The Little Mermaid...</i>

350
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:09,079
over and over again.
It'd drive me crazy.

351
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,585
We had that apartment off of Division
with the big iron gates out front...

352
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,656
and that funny-looking
mutt next door. Dudley?

353
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,257
Dad.

354
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,486
There was a playground across
the street. Remember the big slide?

355
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,153
I don't.

356
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,095
I don't remember, okay? I
don't remember any of that stuff!

357
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:32,432
It's not important! And you just
keep talking and talking about it!

358
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,505
- It is important.
- No, it's not!

359
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,642
Where you used to live,
where we used to live...

360
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:41,746
and Grandmom's stupid garden,
Granddad's cousin Dave, or whatever.

361
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,940
Rachel, keep your voice
down. The baby's sleeping.

362
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:51,249
I'm trying to tell you about
us, about our family, our history.

363
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,951
- It's stupid, boring, useless crap!
- It's not crap!

364
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,289
- Some dog named Dudley?
- You loved that dog.

365
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,523
I don't care about these things!
I don't wanna hear this stuff!

366
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,965
So just stop talking
to me about it.

367
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,039
I'll go.

368
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,502
How long are you
planning on keeping this up?

369
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,845
He's not perfect. Far from it.

370
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,546
But he's trying.

371
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,016
You've got to grow up faster
than you should have to.

372
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,353
You don't get to be a child
anymore. Your father's dying.

373
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,357
I know that.

374
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,697
He's going to die
soon. Very soon.

375
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:12,870
If you keep on like this, you're gonna miss
what little time you have left with him.

376
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,904
This is it, Rachel.

377
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,546
This is your last chance.

378
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:28,182
And if you blow it, you're gonna end up
hating yourself for the rest of your life.

379
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,989
Shit!

380
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,950
I'm a bit worried
about that cough.

381
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,319
It's okay.

382
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,327
We could go to the hospital,
get a CBC and a chest x-ray.

383
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,794
No, thanks.

384
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:21,729
Mark, the Decadron's
suppressing your immune system.

385
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,196
No kidding.

386
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,428
Did you up it again?

387
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:29,241
Okay, well, if it turns to pneumonia,
we can give IV antibiotics.

388
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,670
- Pneumonia, huh?
- Uh-huh.

389
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,311
That's not a bad way to go.

390
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,072
Okay.

391
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,481
There you go.

392
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,884
- Where's Rachel?
- She's at Sunset with Kai.

393
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,524
Mm.

394
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,183
Nice offshore breeze.

395
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,655
Waves should be great.

396
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,760
They're spending a
great deal of time together.

397
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,160
He's a nice kid.

398
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:01,835
So you're not worried?

399
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,604
About what?

400
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,938
About what they might
be doing in all that time.

401
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,603
No.

402
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,709
I think it's great.

403
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,520
I need you to do
something for me.

404
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,288
- Mm-hm.
- It might be kind of hard.

405
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:30,031
I wanna write letters
to Rachel and Ella.

406
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,297
I tried to do it myself...

407
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,701
but I can't read my
own writing now.

408
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,445
I want them to open
letters on special days.

409
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,245
You know?

410
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,084
High-school
graduation, college...

411
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,891
their wedding days.

412
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,527
Think that's cruel?

413
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:08,673
Reaching out from beyond the grave
on days when they should be happy?

414
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,113
I think they'll cherish
every single word.

415
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,753
Told you it might be hard.

416
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,360
I'm okay.

417
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,286
Is he asleep?

418
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,944
Yep.

419
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,954
He sleeps a lot now.

420
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,784
Yeah.

421
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,300
He's in a lot of pain.

422
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,302
It won't be long now.

423
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,576
Hi.

424
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,020
Hi.

425
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,916
I was just dreaming about you.

426
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:12,152
- You were?
- When you used to love balloons.

427
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,261
You remember how
much you loved balloons?

428
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:21,202
- No.
- I used to buy them for you.

429
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,441
And right when I
handed them to you...

430
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,539
you'd let them go.

431
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,581
Drive your mother crazy.

432
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,286
Sit with me. Sit down.

433
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,713
Sit.

434
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,731
I was trying to figure out...

435
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:51,135
what I should have already
told you but I never have.

436
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,135
Something important.

437
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:58,902
Something every father
should impart to his daughter.

438
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,312
I finally got it.

439
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,479
Generosity.

440
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,850
Be generous...

441
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,787
with your time...

442
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,861
with your love...

443
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,736
with your life.

444
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,762
Okay.

445
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,033
I'm sorry, Rachel.

446
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:36,678
- I'm so tired.
- It's okay.

447
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:40,516
Don't cry for me.

448
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,780
I won't.

449
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,784
Be generous...

450
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:53,888
always.

451
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,125
I will.

452
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,799
Daddy?

453
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,879
I remember the lullaby.

454
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,349
I remember you used to
sing it to me every night.

455
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,599
I remember.

456
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,255
It's a sheep. Baa!

457
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,361
The resurrection and
the life, saith the Lord...

458
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,869
though he were
dead, yet shall he live.

459
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,477
And whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.

460
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,676
I know that my
redeemer liveth...

461
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,372
and he shall stand at the
latter day upon the Earth.

462
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,247
And though his
body be destroyed...

463
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,266
Can I still come see Ella?

464
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:35,144
Summers or at Christmas?

465
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,277
Of course. She's your sister.

466
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,624
Hey! Hey, hey, can
you pull over, please?

467
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,193
- What?
- Right here.
