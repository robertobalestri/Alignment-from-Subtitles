1
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:06,807
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,742
We do not need
a pediatric attending here.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,511
Don't worry.
It's not going to happen.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,312
Do you think I have what it
takes to be an attending?

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,680
Of course, you do.

6
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,182
‐ You've been a great friend.
‐ But?

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,384
‐ But there's this other guy.
‐ Oh, yeah?

8
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,286
We're both adults.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,623
'We enjoy each other.
Why not?'

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,093
None of you wants the family
involved in your lives.

11
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,529
He's not going
to break my heart.

12
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,163
Men like him don't change.

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,431
Let's start an epinephrine drip.

14
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,699
Why don't we
also give her a heart

15
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,100
transplant while we're at it?

16
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,236
Peter.

17
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,681
Aha.

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,550
Sleeping beauty awakes.

19
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,717
Hey.

20
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,418
I was just checking
my messages.

21
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,320
You didn't even stir
when the alarm went off.

22
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,156
‐ Dead to the world.
‐ Ah.

23
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,858
Well, you know...
it's not that often that

24
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,292
I get the chance to sleep in.

25
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,460
Yeah, yeah,
don't rub it in.

26
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,428
Some of us have
to work Sundays.

27
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,665
Oh, please.
You know I've had my share.

28
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,466
Well, you're welcome to stay.

29
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,869
No reason to waste
a warm bed.

30
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,436
'No, no, no.'

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,205
Actually, I need
to get going.

32
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,707
There's tea and toast
in the kitchen.

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,741
You'll have to boil the kettle

34
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,310
but I think you can manage that.

35
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,579
No.

36
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,582
I've, uh, I've got
to go somewhere.

37
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,851
Umh, not some other
clandestine meeting, I hope.

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,722
Reese is getting baptized today.

39
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,791
Protestant or Catholic?

40
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,759
‐ Why?
‐ Just curious.

41
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,795
AME.

42
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,196
Look, I would have
invited you, but‐‐

43
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,764
Ah, don't be silly.
It's a family thing.

44
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,299
We've got time to go
home and change?

45
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,767
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay.

46
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,569
Well, have
a good time then.

47
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,771
Hey, and could you
lock the door on your way out?

48
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,439
‐ Sure.
‐ Great.

49
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,678
Hey, Peter.

50
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,414
It was really lovely last night.

51
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,620
‐ What are you doing?
‐ I'm hungry.

52
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,855
‐ You can't start without her.
‐ Why not?

53
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,824
I knew this brunch
was a bad idea.

54
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,426
No. She's a little bit late.

55
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,795
We should have met
on neutral territory.

56
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,864
I told you, deep down..

57
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,932
...your mother likes me.

58
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,333
Keep dreaming.

59
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,668
Finally.

60
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,869
There you go.

61
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,473
Hi.

62
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,575
‐ Oh, Hello.
‐ Hello.

63
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,677
What happened
to your front step?

64
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,311
Oh..

65
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,581
Did you get a flat tire or
something? Why are you late?

66
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,182
Javier, this is
my daughter Carol.

67
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,684
‐ Please to meet you.
‐ And her friend Doug.

68
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,719
‐ How are you?
‐ Hey, nice to meet you.

69
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm sorry, we're late
but I couldn't get

70
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,389
'your mother out of the house.'

71
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,625
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Well, you know how she can be.

72
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,226
Has to be perfect, right?

73
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,795
‐ Allow me, sweet pea.
‐ No, I'll get this.

74
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,396
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

75
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,198
‐ Well, you have orange juice?
‐ Yes, we do.

76
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,332
Two mimosas, please.

77
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,934
‐ You brought champagne.
‐ Hm‐hmm.

78
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,937
‐ Well, aren't we celebrating?
‐ Two happy couples right?

79
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,931
'Did you see the way he kept
touching her back?'

80
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,666
Ah, wasn't really paying
attention.

81
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,701
Oh, you were too busy
laughing at his stupid jokes.

82
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,036
He was funny.

83
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,370
What was with "Sweet Pea."

84
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,438
If he called her
one more time

85
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,573
I was going to barf.

86
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,774
I thought it was great.

87
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,375
Doug, they met
at the racetrack.

88
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,878
Now, that was
a senior citizen outing.

89
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,013
So? They let anybody
in those groups.

90
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,449
Alright. It's not true.

91
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,851
All I know is that
this is the nicest

92
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,885
your mother's
ever been to me.

93
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,319
And I wanna keep it that way.

94
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,354
You don't understand.

95
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,589
My mother hates men.

96
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,690
Hate's a strong word.

97
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,424
Yeah, but in her case, accurate.

98
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,961
‐ Maybe she's getting some.
‐ Oh, Doug, don't even go there.

99
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,696
‐ How was it?
‐ Ugh, In like flint.

100
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,730
'I'll get it.'

101
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,998
You look like hell.

102
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,533
Oh, you got to love
Saturday nights.

103
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,968
ICU is packed.

104
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,770
Two muggings, three bar fights.

105
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,471
Four gangbanger drop‐offs

106
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,307
and a bad stroganoff
from a wedding reception.

107
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,742
Don't forget the guy
who licked the bottom

108
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,010
of his girlfriend's shoe.

109
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,945
‐ Why's that?
‐ She asked him to.

110
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,514
Had to do a tongue culture.

111
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,549
On that note, anybody hungry?

112
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,951
No. Anna actually brought
Sunday doughnuts.

113
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,320
Oh, so, cake isn't enough?
You have to deep fry it?

114
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,822
That's the point.

115
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,724
‐ How long are you on?
‐ 20 minutes.

116
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,492
Medevac is incoming.

117
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,528
29‐year‐old,
chemical accident.

118
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,796
Bad chemical burn.

119
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,731
Terrific.

120
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,633
Hold the elevator.

121
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,835
‐ Going down?
‐ Uh, up, actually.

122
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,003
Well, up's fine.

123
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,339
Surprised to see you
here on a Sunday.

124
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,474
Ah, well, I'm just
full of surprises.

125
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,544
‐ Covering the ER?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

126
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,679
I've noticed you signed up for a
lot of extra coverage lately.

127
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,980
Well, you know, idle hands.

128
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,381
Yeah,
I know exactly what you mean.

129
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,717
In fact, Lizzy,
I think it's about time

130
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,052
you and I had
a little sit‐down.

131
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,954
‐ Is there a problem?
‐ No. No problem.

132
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,388
Let me buy you lunch.

133
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,824
Is it about
the hemoAid study?

134
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,426
That and the future.

135
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,994
‐ Alright.
‐ Good.

136
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,797
‐ Then, in about an hour?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

137
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,439
‐ You said hydrofluoric acid?
‐ Yeah.

138
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,642
‐ Not hydrochloric?
‐ I don't think so.

139
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,909
‐ Why?
‐ Well some‐‐

140
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,778
I heard we had a fire victim.

141
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,079
Actually, chemical burn.

142
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,548
How bad?

143
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,982
‐ What do you got?
‐ 'Paul Canterna.'

144
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,651
'31‐year‐old security guard.'

145
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,152
Second and third‐degree
chemical burns

146
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,588
to the trunk, right arm
and and both legs.

147
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,956
Doused with hydrofluoric acid.

148
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,624
‐ What happened?
‐ It was stupid.

149
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,793
The vat was leaking.
I tried to tightened the valve.

150
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,628
Alright, sir,
just lie back and relax.

151
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,530
I got in the shower
to rinse it off.

152
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,399
Gave him five of morphine,
two liters normal saline.

153
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,801
You feeling
any more pain now?

154
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,169
‐ It's okay now.
‐ Alright, let's go.

155
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,537
Let's move him.

156
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,748
‐ Morning.
‐ Hey.

157
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,819
Usually, significant
improvement occurs

158
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,187
within the first three months.

159
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,022
Oh, he's still working
on his motor skills.

160
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,558
The fact is, Chase's progress
has slowed considerably.

161
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,927
That's all the more reason
for aggressive therapy.

162
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,696
He can get that at home.

163
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,599
Look, I just want what's
medically best for my cousin.

164
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,701
Gamma, I think
this is a big mistake.

165
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,770
John, it's often wise
to listen to the perspective

166
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,172
of those
not personally involved.

167
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,941
'Chase is getting worse.'

168
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,877
He's lost nearly all function
on his left side.

169
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,779
No, he just favors his right.

170
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,648
You have to force him
to use his left.

171
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,117
I wish it were that simple.

172
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,052
It is. Watch.

173
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,154
John, please.

174
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,523
Hey, Chase.

175
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,491
How you doing?

176
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,560
How you doing?

177
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,630
You, uh, you want to draw?

178
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,898
He was left‐handed.
He was drawing just last week.

179
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,534
You want to draw
something for me?

180
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,901
John, this isn't necessary.

181
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,102
Hmm? Okay?

182
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,205
‐ Okay?
‐ Okay.

183
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,508
'Okay. Why don't you go ahead
and you take the pencil?'

184
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,676
No, no, no.

185
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,512
Other hand.

186
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,582
Come on.

187
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,150
He can do this.

188
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,052
'It's okay. It's okay.'

189
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,521
There you go.
And you're all set.

190
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,658
What do you want
to draw, huh?

191
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,825
‐ You.
‐ Me?

192
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,794
You want to draw me?
Okay, go ahead.

193
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,630
I rushed him.

194
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,000
I rushed him.
You can't, you can't rush him.

195
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,268
Alright?

196
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,837
Here we go.
Let's try again.

197
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,038
Yeah.

198
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,510
Needs calcium chloride,
ten percent solution.

199
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,178
‐ Start with five Amps.
‐ Five Amps?

200
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,915
Yeah. And set up an infusion.
One gram every 15 minutes.

201
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,885
So, Mr. Canterna,
feeling any more pain?

202
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,920
It's starting to get numb,
doctor. Is that bad?

203
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,289
Our immediate concern is with
the fluoride in the acid.

204
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,158
‐ Well, like‐like toothpaste?
‐ Not exactly.

205
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,529
The uh, calcium, uh, can be
drawn out of your cells.

206
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,930
So, what does that mean?

207
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,133
Well, it depends how much has
penetrated your skin.

208
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,569
Right now, we're giving you
calcium intravenously

209
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,705
to counteract the effect.

210
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,607
Is there any family
you'd like us to call?

211
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,174
Is there something
you're not telling me, doctor?

212
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,076
Hydrofluoric burns
can be serious.

213
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,246
So, is there any family you'd
like us to call in the area?

214
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,616
Nah, I don't really have
family in Chicago.

215
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,150
Okay. I'll, I'll be right back.

216
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,921
Carol, uh, can, uh,
you keep an eye on him?

217
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,222
Make sure he's comfortable.

218
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,256
‐ And watch his heart rate.
‐ Alright.

219
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,691
Tell me
if his leg gets worse.

220
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,160
It's not his leg
I'm worried about.

221
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,165
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

222
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,134
You look nice.

223
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,136
Thanks. Hey, is,
uh, Carla here yet?

224
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,237
‐ Inside.
‐ Oh.

225
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,205
‐ Hey, Uncle Peter.
‐ Hey.

226
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,974
Where is she?

227
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,008
Who?

228
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,076
Your girlfriend.

229
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,210
‐ Steven.
‐ What?

230
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,747
You said
he had a new girlfriend.

231
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,615
Well, I don't.

232
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,717
Well, dad said he heard grandma
turning over in her grave.

233
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,218
Alright. That's enough.

234
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,920
Both of you go in there
and get a seat.

235
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,324
'Peter.'

236
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,595
Oh, come on.

237
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,796
You remember Roger?

238
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,230
How you doing, man?

239
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,166
Uh, hey, hey.

240
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,268
Uh, Carla, can I talk
to you for a minute?

241
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,936
‐ All set?
‐ Yes.

242
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,204
Uh, we should do
a little rehearsal

243
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,973
before everyone arrives.

244
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,808
Um, um, mom and dad..

245
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,309
Uh, um, I'm‐I'm the father.

246
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,745
Oh, I'm sorry.

247
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,380
‐ Uh, who's holding the baby?
‐ I am.

248
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,849
Okay. Now, l‐listen if you'd
just step back here.

249
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,350
Yeah, come on, everybody.

250
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,186
Just kind of move around
and make way here, please.

251
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,021
Thank you.
No, no, over here.

252
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,026
That's good.
That's good.

253
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,161
Here you go, little pickle.

254
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,362
Yeah, mom in the middle.

255
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,032
Dad, dad, right here
on the end.

256
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,366
Right here.
Just move back.

257
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,302
Thank you. Okay.

258
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,370
'You know, I wasn't even
supposed to go into work today.'

259
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,340
I was home
restoring my car and..

260
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,643
...the weekend guy
called in sick.

261
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,845
So, I figured I could use
the overtime, you know?

262
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,046
What kind of car do you have?

263
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,915
It's a '63 'vette.

264
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,151
She's an eyesore,
but she's got matching numbers.

265
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,220
I'm going to fix her up.
She's gonna be worth..

266
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,324
It's hurting under my skin.

267
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,992
I'm going to give you
something more for the pain.

268
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,196
How long is this going
to hang me up for?

269
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,197
It's hard to say.

270
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,071
He's already severely
hypocalcemic

271
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,305
and the leg is necrotic.

272
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,807
Any EKG changes?

273
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,175
Prolonged QT.

274
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,677
He's at risk
for an arrhythmia.

275
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,411
What does toxicology say?

276
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,148
Hydrofluoric burns of this
magnitude are always fatal.

277
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,883
There's no new treatment.

278
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,251
His family on the way?

279
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,386
‐ He doesn't have any in town.
‐ Hm.

280
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,188
You might have time
to fly somebody in.

281
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,357
Yep.

282
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,826
‐ Guess I better go tell him.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

283
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,865
This is really starting
to hurt, doctor.

284
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,199
We can do something
about that.

285
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,433
I'll give him
another five of morphine.

286
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,103
You okay? You don't look
so good yourself.

287
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,472
Mr. Canterna, the calcium
we're giving you

288
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:16,142
can't reverse the chemical
reaction in your body.

289
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,912
W‐what do you mean,
"Chemical reaction"?

290
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,315
The fluoride is binding
to your cellular calcium..

291
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,785
...to form calcium fluoride.

292
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,821
A crystal salt that seeps
into your body tissues.

293
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,756
So‐so, what does that mean?

294
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,726
We're already starting to see
changes in your cardiogram.

295
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,294
So, now, what?

296
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,263
As the calcium level
in your cardiac cells falls..

297
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:43,269
...your heart's going
to begin to fail.

298
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,807
What? Are you telling me
that I'm going to die?

299
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,041
We're doing everything we can.

300
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,209
Is that a yes?

301
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,047
Yes.

302
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,148
How‐how long?

303
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,219
Days?

304
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,822
Maybe 12 hours.

305
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,932
Is there anybody you'd like us
to call, Mr. Canterna?

306
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,975
Mr. Canterna?

307
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,883
I don't feel that bad.

308
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,852
Well, you let me know
if the pain increases.

309
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,555
It hurts. I just don't feel
like I'm dying or anything.

310
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,056
We're gonna do
everything we can

311
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,124
to keep you as comfortable
as possible.

312
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,526
Maybe he's got it wrong.

313
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,462
Shouldn't you call
a specialist or something?

314
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,330
I feel like you guys
are giving up on me..

315
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,399
We're not giving up
on you, Mr. Canterna.

316
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,134
I promise you that.

317
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,003
We're gonna do
everything we can.

318
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,806
You sure there isn't someone
we can call for you?

319
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:53,940
It's too late.

320
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,308
Why? How far away are they?

321
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,211
No, I been gone too long.
She won't come.

322
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,379
Who won't?

323
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,315
My daughter.

324
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,084
21 years old.
Complains of neck, back..

325
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,986
Hold up. we're full here.
Next room.

326
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,487
Neck, back and bilateral
ankle pain

327
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,389
following a 75‐foot fall
into the river.

328
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,424
‐ From where?
‐ The Train Bridge.

329
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,560
Sinus rhythm:
A and O times three.

330
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:16,930
ETOH on breath.
Sensory and motor exam normal.

331
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,266
Okay, CBC, dip a urine cross
table c‐spine

332
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,902
chest and pelvic x rays.

333
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,103
‐ Does that hurt?
‐ A little.

334
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,270
Okay, and lift.

335
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,940
What were you doing
on the bridge?

336
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,075
It's a long story.

337
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,611
‐ How about here?
‐ No.

338
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,045
BP is 120/70.

339
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,848
‐ Pulse is 112.
‐ Is that bad?

340
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,950
No. We're just gonna check
to make sure you're okay.

341
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,984
Good peripheral pulse.

342
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,352
Normal cap refill.

343
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,154
Follow with bilateral
ankle films

344
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,488
and, uh, call psych.

345
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,390
Psych?
Wait, I don't need a shrink.

346
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,926
Relax. Everything's fine.

347
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,260
I didn't jump,
if that's what you think.

348
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,629
‐ Okay.
‐ No, I'm serious.

349
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,896
‐ I didn't jump.
‐ Okay.

350
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,532
‐ Take any drugs?
‐ No.

351
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,934
I‐I was there with my buddies.
We were just fooling around.

352
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,135
How much have you had to drink?

353
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,503
A couple beers.

354
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,172
Well, you also have a couple
of broken ankles.

355
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,907
‐ Throw in a BA.
‐ Where are you going?

356
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,375
We're gonna take care of
everything. Just relax.

357
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,544
Is everything okay in there?

358
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,445
Joker jumps off a bridge
and walks away

359
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,947
with a couple of ankle
fractures.

360
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,114
‐ So to speak.
‐ Yeah. Called psych?

361
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,415
‐ Yeah.
‐ I'll tell Weaver.

362
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,483
‐ Surgical consult?
‐ Uh, Trauma two.

363
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,518
Straight ahead.

364
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:12,953
Mark, he changed his mind.

365
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,387
He really wants
to see his daughter.

366
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,122
Oh, I thought he didn't have
family in town.

367
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,258
No, he does. He just hasn't seen
her in six years.

368
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,326
‐ How old is she?
‐ Six and a half.

369
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,461
‐ Oh, boy.
‐ Don't worry.

370
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,629
‐ I'll take care of it.
‐ You sure?

371
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,297
Yeah, yeah. You go home.
Get some rest.

372
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,566
No no no. Listen I should
probably stick around.

373
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,133
Mark, there's nothing
else for you to do

374
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,669
except hold his hand,
which is my job.

375
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,470
‐ Go on. Get out of here.
‐ Alright. Thank you.

376
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:32,338
'And another breath in.'

377
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,275
‐ Got a sec?
‐ Sure. I'll be right back.

378
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,545
CBC, pulse ox, lytes,
ABG and a chest film.

379
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,914
Still waiting
for an ICU bed.

380
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,550
Pulse ox is
falling slowly.

381
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,519
Uh, I didn't talk to him
about a vent yet.

382
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,420
I wanted to let
the news set in and..

383
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,322
...Carol is looking
for the family.

384
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,526
‐ Alright. Have a good Sunday.
‐ Thank you.

385
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,528
‐ Sorry about that.
‐ No. I know you're busy.

386
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,497
I don't usually come to the
emergency room...for the flu.

387
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,365
But I can't seem
to beat this cough.

388
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,234
Hmm. How long you been
feeling fatigued?

389
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,570
‐ A‐about a month.
‐ Any weight loss?

390
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:06,472
Mmm. I've been so stressed
planning this wedding.

391
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,208
Oh! Congratulations.

392
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,511
Is that a daughter
or a granddaughter?

393
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:12,478
Why, it's my wedding.

394
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,414
After four years
I told her it was about

395
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,582
time to make a commitment.

396
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,183
Well, good for you.

397
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,019
Gives me less than
a month to get better.

398
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,353
No promises.

399
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,155
‐ You might have pneumonia.
‐ Pneumonia?

400
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,257
We'll know more once
we get a chest X‐ray.

401
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,693
Hey, Anna, are you the one who
had that voodoo woman yesterday?

402
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,962
‐ Oh, She's back?
‐ Yeah. Exam three.

403
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,097
Chief complaint, "Voodoo man
has taken over her body."

404
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,232
Wait a minute,
this isn't the same one.

405
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,600
My voodoo patient
was 60‐something.

406
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,235
I had a voodoo guy last week.

407
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,503
Oh, no.
Voodoo epidemic.

408
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,271
Sorry.

409
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,474
Yeah? Ma'am, your ex‐husband
is in critical condition.

410
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,009
I know you are at work.

411
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,711
He just..

412
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,713
Look, he's going to die tonight.

413
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,515
He just wants to see Molli.

414
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,517
‐ Anybody home?
‐ What have you got?

415
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,018
Pedestrian versus auto.

416
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,020
Head contusion, brief LOC.

417
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,421
Broken arm,
vitals are stable.

418
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,391
‐ What's open, Chuny?
‐ Uh, curtain three.

419
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,626
Curtain three?

420
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,094
‐ Cerebral palsy?
‐ I don't know.

421
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,462
Somebody clipped
his wheelchair.

422
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,630
He couldn't tell us
if he was hurt or not.

423
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:04,765
No one was with him?

424
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,767
Nope. Just found him
on the street.

425
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,502
Okay. Sir, can you
tell me your name?

426
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,603
No it's not use.

427
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,737
You can't understand him.

428
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:12,372
He might have
the uh, a subdural

429
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,740
that could impair his speech.

430
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,175
We should get a head CT.

431
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,610
How do you do a neuro exam?

432
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,279
It would help if we
knew his baseline.

433
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,614
Okay.

434
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,018
Sir, can you, can you push in
against my hand?

435
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,087
Alright, let's start
with a c‐spine.

436
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,121
Carter, have you seen Elizabeth?

437
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,455
No.

438
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,557
Wasn't she called down
for a consult?

439
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:31,758
‐ I just got here.
‐ Anna?

440
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,594
O‐oh, she's right there,
actually.

441
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,462
‐ Hey.
‐ Peter.

442
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,664
I thought you
weren't coming in.

443
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:39,566
Uh, I wasn't,
but I decided to come in

444
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,267
and do some,
uh, post‐op notes.

445
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,569
You look dapper.

446
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:44,204
‐ Thank you.
‐ How was the baptism?

447
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,540
‐ Good. It was good.
‐ Nothing afterwards?

448
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,141
Hey listen, you want
to get something to eat?

449
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,143
Oh, I wish. I've got
this thing with Romano.

450
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,678
‐ What thing?
‐ Lunch.

451
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:53,279
I think it's got something to do
with my fellowship renewal.

452
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,615
Ah.

453
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,082
Did you really come in
for post‐op notes?

454
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,651
Yeah, yeah.
So, I'll see you later?

455
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,085
Oh, yeah. I hope so.

456
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,453
'You should call the military.'

457
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,756
They might have
an antidote or something.

458
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,291
A buddy of mine
says they use stuff like this.

459
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,594
Yeah, it's not really
the same thing.

460
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:09,062
I just want you to know.

461
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,230
I know.

462
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,398
Did you find her?

463
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,434
Uh, I talked
to your ex‐wife.

464
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,836
What'd she say?

465
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,072
She said that she's
sorry, but, um..

466
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,307
She's not going to bring Molli?

467
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,143
No.

468
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,711
She, um, she knows
what's happening to me?

469
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,683
That's okay.

470
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,618
Hey, it's for
the best, I guess.

471
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,587
I'm sorry.

472
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,289
I was going to make it
up to her, but..

473
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,359
I guess I ran out
of time, you know?

474
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,194
At some point,
you'll have to let us know

475
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,664
if you want to be put
on a ventilator.

476
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,098
Dr. Weaver,
do you have a minute?

477
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,867
Yeah. Uh, what is it?

478
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,335
Auto versus pedestrian,
possible head injury.

479
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,271
‐ What's the problem?
‐ Cerebral palsy.

480
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,674
He's, uh, tough to assess
and we don't want to hurt him.

481
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:57,210
Alright. Call me
at the first sign of arrhythmia.

482
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,279
Are you sure it's CP?
He might be posturing.

483
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,313
No, he's conscious.

484
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,548
Well, is he on any meds?

485
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,749
I don't know.
He has no family.

486
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:04,184
We can't understand
a word he's saying.

487
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,218
‐ Did you check‐‐
‐ Wait, hang on.

488
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,252
Let me grab this one quick.

489
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,221
Yo! I need a portable c‐spine.

490
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,223
‐ Oh, X ray, trauma two.
‐ No, Maggie. I got him.

491
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,658
‐ When did you call?
‐ I didn't.

492
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,326
‐ But I need to clear a neck.
‐ So do I.

493
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,295
‐ Well, how bad is yours?
‐ How bad is yours?

494
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,530
'Hey, I need a hand here!'

495
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,231
Carter, grab that gurney.
Is he breathing?

496
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,200
Yeah. I need a C‐collar
and backboard. Let's move.

497
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,202
‐ I got it.
‐ Connie, get Doug.

498
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,437
‐ Why didn't you call 911?
‐ I thought I'd get here faster.

499
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,772
How long has he been
unconscious?

500
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:27,473
Uh, he was awake in the car.
He just stop crying.

501
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,309
‐ Pulse is weak and thready.
‐ What happened?

502
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,911
Uh, I had him for the weekend.
We were washing the car.

503
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,378
‐ 'I didn't see him.'
‐ We need the room now.

504
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,747
'I only backed up
a couple of feet.'

505
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,216
Get that guy out of here.
We'll roll him. Alright?

506
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,518
Here we go. Hang on.

507
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,352
Roll him.
Did you drive over him?

508
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,821
Yeah, I think so.
I just didn't see him, man.

509
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,156
‐ 'Get radiology over here!'
‐ Okay.

510
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,725
Cap refill is poor.

511
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:45,792
'What's going on?'

512
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,496
Chuny, get me a crit and type
and cross for six.

513
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,733
Put him on oxygen,
ten liters by mask.

514
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,467
Dip a urine.

515
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,902
Pupils are..

516
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,237
...equal and reactive.

517
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,371
I got a line in.

518
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,341
Alright, saline, 20cc's.

519
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,909
Uh, uh, per kilo bolus.

520
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:06,312
That's...uh, he's 30,
so, that's 600, right?

521
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,182
BP is 70/30,
pulse is 144.

522
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,517
Abdomen is distended.

523
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,418
‐ No bowel sounds.
‐ Can't wait for a CT.

524
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,588
Alright, let's prep for
a peritoneal lavage.

525
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,222
‐ I'll get a kit.
‐ Pulse ox?

526
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,860
‐ Hey, you okay in there?
‐ 'Yeah, I think so.'

527
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,695
‐ 'Where are the lavage kits?'
‐ Down and to the right.

528
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,830
‐ What's that? Lavage?
‐ What?

529
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:26,466
Oh, it's a procedure to check
if there's internal bleeding.

530
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,901
That sounds pretty bad.

531
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,269
Well, you never know.

532
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,506
Is it a boy or a girl?

533
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,240
It's, uh, it's a boy.

534
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,209
You could go in there
if you need to 'cause I feel..

535
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,580
No no. No. They got it.

536
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:42,215
Can I ask you to do
something for me, nurse?

537
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,717
Yeah.

538
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,553
I have a couple of thousand
dollars in my savings account.

539
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:49,289
Can you make sure
it gets to Molli?

540
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,291
Sure. Do you have
a will or something?

541
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,926
No, I didn't get around to it.

542
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,829
But I just want to make sure
I get her the money.

543
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,864
It's not much,
but I want to give it to her.

544
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,966
I can get a public
notary to arrange it.

545
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,334
I'll take care of it for you.

546
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,570
‐ You promise?
‐ I promise.

547
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,906
Okay. But Don't tell her
that it came from me.

548
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:06,973
'Cause I don't
want her to think

549
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,509
I'm buying her forgiveness.

550
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,678
Sorry. Hallway's blocked.

551
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,780
‐ 5.5 ET tube.
‐ Got the blood!

552
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:15,481
Ten unit.
I'll start a second line.

553
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:19,352
Rapid induction. Point five
of pavulon, 75 of sux.

554
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,387
Got it.

555
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,723
Cricoid pressure,
will you, please?

556
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:24,390
Marty, your daddy didn't
mean to do this to you.

557
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,425
‐ Cricoid pressure?
‐ I didn't mean to do this.

558
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,027
Crike's 28.

559
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,862
Lavage is...positive!

560
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,297
Alright, call the OR.
Tell them we're on our way up.

561
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,599
‐ Doug, are you done?
‐ Almost.

562
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,868
Hang on, hang on.
I got it.

563
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,402
We have to take
your son upstairs

564
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,971
to do an exploratory
laparotomy.

565
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,573
‐ What's wrong with him?
‐ Well..

566
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,007
We have to control
the internal bleeding.

567
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,408
Oh, my God.

568
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,910
I gonna need you
to sign a release form.

569
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:45,946
Okay, fine. Just‐just don't,
just don't let him die.

570
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,681
We do this every day.
He has a good chance.

571
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:48,849
Hold that elevator!

572
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,450
‐ Connie.
‐ Hang on..

573
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,952
You're gotta cover my
patient in trauma one.

574
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,319
You're leaving
in the middle of your shift?

575
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,821
Everything is on the chart.

576
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:56,623
‐ Where you going?
‐ I'll be back in an hour okay.

577
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:57,858
‐ Can you do it for me?
‐ Sure.

578
00:20:57,891 --> 00:20:59,526
‐ Pulse is 80.
‐ Second unit's in!

579
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,727
Second unit's in!

580
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,429
Don't let him die! Please!

581
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,665
I need you
to sign here again, sir.

582
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:05,732
Fine, just‐just
don't let him die.

583
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,367
‐ I understand
‐ Please?

584
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,902
‐ I understand..
‐ Please don't let him die.

585
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,642
Turkey burger, please.
No onions.

586
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:18,645
What kind of, uh, salad
dressings do you have?

587
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,681
Caesar, ranch, Italian,
lo‐cal Italian

588
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,448
bleu cheese,
honey mustard, catalina

589
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,852
oil and vinegar
and poppy seed vinaigrette.

590
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:27,020
I'll have the soup.

591
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:36,530
‐ So.
‐ So.

592
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:37,931
Enjoying your year?

593
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,099
It's been educational.

594
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,034
Mm, I bet.

595
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,036
Thoughts of staying
come fall?

596
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,405
I've entertained the idea.

597
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,373
Good.

598
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,676
Is that what you wanted
to talk about?

599
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,311
No. No, not exactly.

600
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:53,714
Must I guess?

601
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:02,422
Well, there's no way to say this
but flat out, so here goes.

602
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,990
'Lizzie,
our relationship has not'

603
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,759
'moved in a direction
I would have liked.'

604
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,894
Now, partly that's because
I have trouble communicating

605
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:10,496
these types of feelings
but the fact is..

606
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:12,432
I find you...very attractive.

607
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,535
‐ Dr. Romano.
‐ No, no. Let me finish.

608
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:17,403
Now, I don't know what your
long‐term plans are and uh..

609
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,705
I'm not foolish
enough to think

610
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,807
that colleagues can have
a romantic involvement

611
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,610
without,
uh...entanglements but..

612
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,411
'...we obviously have a lot
of common interests'

613
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,748
'and we share the same
insane schedule'

614
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,650
and uh, it makes sense so..

615
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:33,787
I would really like you
to consider, uh, a date.

616
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,488
'Going out with me on a date.'

617
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,657
What do you say?

618
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,894
I'm flattered,
uh, and shocked.

619
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,163
Really? I would have thought
you could see right through me.

620
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,632
No. No, not at all.

621
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,901
Uh, however, um..

622
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,871
...seeing as I‐I do
work for you..

623
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:53,006
...I don't think it would
be such a good idea.

624
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,510
Oh.

625
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,145
Uh, not that under
other circumstances..

626
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,480
Oh, oh. Oh, I see.

627
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,482
‐ You‐you have a policy.
‐ Yeah, yes.

628
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:03,917
No fraternization, uh,
with people at work.

629
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,653
Oh, well, okay,
I respect that.

630
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:08,722
Uh...just pretend
I never said anything.

631
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,559
I'm sorry.

632
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,828
No. Hey! Huh, I, uh..

633
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,698
Had to give it a shot.

634
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,936
You know what's funny?
For a while there, uh..

635
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,639
I really thought I was competing
with Peter Benton.

636
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:28,642
Huh.

637
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,210
'Can you open your fist?'

638
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,480
How about your fingers?
Just...do that?

639
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:40,453
How about now?
Just your fingers.

640
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,888
What are you doing?

641
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,990
Weaver said to examine him
like he's any other patient.

642
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:45,458
By pinning his arm down?

643
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,093
I'm trying to isolate
finger motion.

644
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,494
You're not afraid
of hurting him?

645
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,663
Actually, yes.

646
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,569
He's been trying
to tell me something.

647
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,103
'Oh, head CT is normal.'

648
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:58,238
No subdural bleeds.

649
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,041
No sign of brain abnormalities.

650
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:02,175
Hey, he opened his hand.

651
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,479
How about that?

652
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:09,583
‐ Oh, he's got a bad lac.
‐ Yup.

653
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,652
'He might have cut a tendon.'

654
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:13,754
They didn't teach this stuff
in med school, did they?

655
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,055
Oh, I guess we can call
a hand surgeon down here.

656
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,890
'Yeah.'

657
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,659
‐ What did you do?
‐ Nothing.

658
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,060
Is he having
a seizure or something?

659
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:21,762
I‐I, I don't I don't know.

660
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,601
The X ray indicates you have
what we call atypical pneumonia.

661
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,970
‐ What does that mean?
‐ Well, there's several kinds.

662
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:32,573
You don't by chance have any
birds in the house, do you?

663
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:33,774
How did you know?

664
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,676
Psittacosis pneumonia..

665
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,644
...is carried by small birds.

666
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:39,913
What? Is it a parakeet
or a dove?

667
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,182
‐ A falcon.
‐ A falcon.

668
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,184
Only thing Daniel
loves more than me.

669
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:45,819
That's not true.

670
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:47,888
Oh, I wanted to go
to Italy for our honeymoon.

671
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,256
He didn't want to leave
Sinbad that long.

672
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,558
Who was going to feed him?

673
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:52,726
What does he eat?

674
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,528
Uh, p‐partridges.

675
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:56,697
‐ It's not pretty.
‐ He doesn't eat them alive.

676
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,865
We kill
and clean them first.

677
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,867
That's where I come in.

678
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:03,937
Well, that's probably how
you contracted the pneumonia.

679
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,807
I'll get a blood test
to see what type..

680
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,742
...but we can treat it
with antibiotics.

681
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:11,912
Funny.

682
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,080
I thought I was
covering the ER.

683
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:16,717
I was there, so, I took it.

684
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,752
What happened
to your post‐op notes?

685
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:21,321
You know, I thought we
were past these games.

686
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,189
‐ Excuse me?
‐ The adolescent competition.

687
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:25,892
He was in bad shape. Come on
Elizabeth. Give it a rest, huh?

688
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:28,829
Peter, I was simply
commenting on how strange‐‐

689
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,131
You don't simply do
anything, Elizabeth.

690
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:32,766
Is something the matter?

691
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,701
‐ The boy could bleed out.
‐ I mean with you.

692
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:37,137
Has something happened
since this morning?

693
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,073
No. I'm fine.

694
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,776
Dr. Benton. I didn't know
you were working today.

695
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,045
‐ Yeah, I am now.
‐ Hmm.

696
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:47,948
Glad to hear I'm not
the only surgeon without a life.

697
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:51,585
Six‐year‐old male sustained
a splenic fracture..

698
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:52,753
‐ Bus tour?
‐ Thank you.

699
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,659
‐ Sandy Mader?
‐ Yeah.

700
00:25:58,692 --> 00:25:59,960
Hi. I'm Carol Hathaway.

701
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:02,763
We spoke on the phone
about your ex‐husband.

702
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:04,731
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

703
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,366
Just go right on.
I'm working, okay?

704
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:10,003
Yeah, look, I‐I don't pretend
to know the history here.

705
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,705
That's right.

706
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,307
I just...your ex‐husband
isn't going to make it

707
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,677
through the night.

708
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,312
Paul walked out on us, okay?
Here you go. Bus tour.

709
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,381
He just left.
He couldn't hold a job.

710
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,849
He couldn't handle it,
so, he just left.

711
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,618
Now, I feel bad
for him, I do.

712
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,352
But he's not part of our lives
anymore. Bus tour.

713
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:28,054
All he wants to do
is see Molli.

714
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,656
He was never there for her
but now he wants her

715
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,058
to hold his hand
and watch him die?

716
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,260
You really want him
to die alone?

717
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:38,331
Who are you? This is none
of your business.

718
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,867
I'm not putting my daughter
through that, alright?

719
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:43,103
I understand how you feel..

720
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:46,006
...and you don't know me..

721
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:49,109
...but trust me
you're making a mistake here.

722
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,711
I was a little girl
when my father

723
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:52,713
was dying in the hospital..

724
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:54,380
...and I couldn't see him.

725
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:57,417
I wasn't given a chance
to say good‐bye.

726
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,285
I know, you think
you're protecting Molli

727
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,187
but she's gonna have to live
with this the rest of her life.

728
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:03,156
Did you know him, your father
before he died?

729
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,858
‐ Did you know him?
‐ I remember him.

730
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,326
Molli won't remember Paul.

731
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,361
She has absolutely
no recollection of him, okay?

732
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:12,065
Now, I'm sorry,
but he chose this for himself.

733
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,405
Has anyone seen Carol?

734
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:22,108
Uh, she had some
administrative stuff upstairs.

735
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,277
‐ On Sunday?
‐ Something about payroll.

736
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,346
Yeah, well, Mr. Canterna
is asking for her.

737
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,181
He needs 40 lasix IV.

738
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:29,382
I'll get it.

739
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,417
Kerry, your labs came back.

740
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:34,254
Mrs. Weinbach tested
positive for HIV.

741
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:37,457
No, Mrs. Weinbach
is the older lady with the bird.

742
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,859
Yeah, I made them redo it.

743
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:41,394
I‐I asked
for cold agglutinate

744
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:42,996
and antibodies, not HIV.

745
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,398
Are you sure?
It was marked on the form.

746
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,334
Oh, my God.
It makes total sense.

747
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:49,703
I don't know why
I didn't think of it.

748
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:50,937
You want to do another one?

749
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:54,007
No, I can't do an HIV test
without consent.

750
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,175
So, now what?

751
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:58,178
He's been on methadone
since birth?

752
00:27:58,211 --> 00:27:59,780
Yeah.

753
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:01,447
No interruptions?
You haven't stopped and started?

754
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,416
Uh‐uh. No.

755
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,019
Seven months is a long time
to be on methadone.

756
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,754
It's pretty tough
on neurological development.

757
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:09,255
Yeah, well, they tell me
to start giving

758
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:10,791
him less, but it doesn't work.

759
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:12,025
You still using?

760
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,393
What does that
have to do with it?

761
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,195
‐ If you breastfeed.
‐ I don't.

762
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:21,902
Your baby has...a high fever.

763
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,837
He's sweating.
His pupils are dilated.

764
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,872
He has abnormally
high heart rate.

765
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:26,973
These are all signs
of withdrawal.

766
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,809
Now, why would that be?

767
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:29,943
I don't know.

768
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:30,977
You're the doctor.

769
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:32,012
When was his last dose?

770
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,816
Yesterday. I ran out.

771
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:38,852
My clinic is closed
on Sunday, so, I came here.

772
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,321
‐ You want methadone?
‐ It's what he needs, right?

773
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:44,424
‐ You don't need it?
‐ What are you talking about?

774
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:47,093
I think you're using your baby
to get methadone.

775
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:48,795
You're crazy.
I can get that for free.

776
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,363
Yeah, if you're clean, you can.

777
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,098
I think, otherwise you come here
when you can't score.

778
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:53,266
Forget it.
I don't need this.

779
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,301
But baby needs to be admitted.

780
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:57,938
No way. You'll call the cops.

781
00:28:57,971 --> 00:28:59,305
You come in here
with this story

782
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,441
because no place else
is gonna give you the stuff.

783
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:02,943
Now, if you leave here
that baby is not

784
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:04,144
'gonna get
the treatment he needs.'

785
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,112
Then give me some
and let me go.

786
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:07,280
Until next time?

787
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:11,284
Vicky...you addicted your son.

788
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,119
You strung him out.

789
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,988
Don't you think it's time
to do something right?

790
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,160
We should wait for his family.

791
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:21,528
Someone's gonna start
looking for him soon.

792
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:23,063
What if he's homeless?

793
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,365
He couldn't survive
out on the street alone.

794
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,202
The cops are, uh, checking
the neighborhood now.

795
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:32,405
He can't live
that far away.

796
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,207
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, take it easy.

797
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,341
Take it easy. It's okay.

798
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,277
Why does he keep banging
like that?

799
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,545
Maybe he is trying
to tell us something.

800
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:44,017
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

801
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:50,023
‐ What is that? Ring?
‐ Wait.

802
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:51,457
‐ Ring what?
‐ A‐a phone?

803
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:53,126
You want us to call somebody?

804
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,096
Uh, lie still if that's
what you want us to do.

805
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,832
If you want us to..

806
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,000
Yes.

807
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,508
‐ Four?
‐ Four, four, four what?

808
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,875
You giving us
your telephone number?

809
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,110
Yeah, yeah.

810
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,177
Four is the first number
of your telephone?

811
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:12,946
Yes, yes.

812
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,014
Here. Thanks.

813
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:16,850
Then what?
Four, then what?

814
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:19,452
‐ Then two.
‐ Two?

815
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,554
Yeah.

816
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:21,988
I'll tell the father..

817
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:24,124
...and I'll, uh,
I'll meet you in recovery.

818
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,533
‐ Hi.
‐ Yeah.

819
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:34,568
Your son sustained
irreparable damage

820
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,136
to the blood vessels
supplying his spleen.

821
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,437
Okay.

822
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,840
We had no choice but
to perform a splenectomy.

823
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:42,909
But...he's alive?

824
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:44,410
Yeah, yeah, of course.

825
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:46,379
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

826
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,648
Thank God.

827
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,016
Look, in time, h‐he'll
make a full recovery.

828
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,990
Now , listen to me.

829
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,491
He's going to be prone
to certain infections.

830
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,494
So, he's going to need to
be vaccinated against‐‐

831
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:02,863
Just...thank you.

832
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,198
Thank you so much.

833
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,366
Yeah.

834
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,001
I made a mistake
about the birds.

835
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,638
You may have what's called
pneumocystis pneumonia.

836
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:13,273
Is that worse?

837
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,341
Well, we need to get a sample
from your bronchial tube

838
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,043
to confirm it's PCP.

839
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:19,580
But since it's the defining
illness of AIDS

840
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:21,247
we should do an HIV test.

841
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:23,483
‐ Aids?
‐ That's a good one.

842
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:24,951
We need to be sure.

843
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:27,320
You don't know Loretta.

844
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,556
Can I speak with her alone?

845
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,992
‐ Why?
‐ No, i‐it's alright.

846
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:35,061
Uh, Daniel's practically
my husband.

847
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:38,464
To tell the truth...
we made a mistake.

848
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:39,566
We need written consent

849
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,168
from our patients
to test for HIV.

850
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:44,705
However...
we tested you by accident

851
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,573
and it was positive.

852
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:48,074
I don't understand.

853
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:50,577
No, it's a mistake,
uh, a mix‐up.

854
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:52,946
Perhaps another test
would remove any doubt.

855
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:55,248
I'll take care of this.

856
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,416
Doctor.

857
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,727
Just give her something
for the pneumonia and we'll go.

858
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,995
‐ I can't do that.
‐ Don't make me report you.

859
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,497
‐ Excuse me?
‐ You tested her illegally.

860
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:15,201
Yes, but it would be unethical
to let her leave untreated.

861
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:17,571
I don't want to burden
her with this.

862
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:20,040
Have you been tested?

863
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,542
We're not talking
about me, alright?

864
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:24,978
There are drug programs

865
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:27,648
that would drastically
enhance both your lives.

866
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:31,752
Can't you say they're, uh..

867
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,120
...for something else?

868
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:36,590
I think you should find a way
to explain it to her

869
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:37,958
or I'll have to.

870
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:50,336
You disappeared on me.

871
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,739
I needed
to check on something.

872
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:54,107
Molli's still not coming?

873
00:32:57,277 --> 00:33:00,113
I'm afraid not.

874
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:03,617
It's okay. It's better this way.
She shouldn't see.

875
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,286
Do you want to write her a note?
I could take something down.

876
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,555
Yeah.

877
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:09,723
No, it's too late.

878
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,660
It wouldn't be fair.

879
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:15,328
I think she'd really
like to hear

880
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:19,232
something from you,
I really do.

881
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:21,434
I was going to make it up
to her, I swear.

882
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,307
I called her
a couple of times last fall.

883
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,243
You can guess
how that went over.

884
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,079
You know..

885
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:38,552
...I figured
it just needed time.

886
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,544
I'm so glad you called me. I was
about going out of my mind.

887
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:53,313
I can't believe he was able
to give us your phone number.

888
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:55,549
Mr. Lorenzo, I am so sorry.

889
00:33:55,582 --> 00:33:57,384
I lost all track of time.

890
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,253
I got..

891
00:33:59,286 --> 00:34:02,723
stuck with the rejects.

892
00:34:04,591 --> 00:34:06,861
Uh, I'm sorry.
John Carter.

893
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:09,229
‐ You understand him?
‐ Katherine Dunlap.

894
00:34:09,263 --> 00:34:11,766
'I'm Mr. Lorenzo's
personal assistant.'

895
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,668
It takes a while
to get the accent.

896
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:14,735
Accent?

897
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:20,641
Slow, but I'll forgive them.

898
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,843
He says you're a little slow
but he'll forgive you.

899
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,544
Thanks.

900
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:26,847
Uh, c‐can you tell him
that they need

901
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:28,548
to operate on his hand?

902
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:30,818
You just did.
He understands English.

903
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,653
'It's one
of his many languages.'

904
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:35,623
'He's one of the worlds leading
experts in hieroglyphics.'

905
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,824
That's fascinating.

906
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,959
Liar.

907
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,327
I understood that.

908
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:47,601
Would you excuse me
for a second?

909
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,269
Thank you.

910
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:51,305
You're welcome,
Mr. Lorenzo.

911
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,511
Gamma.

912
00:34:57,544 --> 00:34:58,846
Oh, John.

913
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,648
I'm sorry to bother you
at work.

914
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,016
What's wrong?

915
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:04,551
Uh, I'm not happy the way
we left things earlier.

916
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:05,786
Do you have a moment?

917
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,622
Uh...yeah, sure.

918
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:13,293
‐ Want to sit down?
‐ No, thank you.

919
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,999
John, I respect your opinion.

920
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,568
If you think we should
keep Chase at the institute

921
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:24,471
I'll support that.

922
00:35:24,504 --> 00:35:26,006
I can't guarantee you
that it's going to make any

923
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,043
difference but I'm not
ready to give up on him.

924
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:30,745
I never intend to.

925
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:33,513
Neither do I.

926
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:36,016
Well, I'm glad we've got
that straightened out.

927
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,953
Me, too.

928
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:41,055
John..

929
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:42,790
...I understand
the freedom that comes

930
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:45,660
with financial independence..

931
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:50,397
but money or not
we're still your family.

932
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,332
I know.

933
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:55,069
You were always
your grandfather's first choice.

934
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:57,471
He's much too proud
to come to you now

935
00:35:57,504 --> 00:36:00,574
but he'd really like
you to come to him.

936
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:01,709
What are you asking me?

937
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:06,613
Finish your residency
if you must.

938
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:09,784
You can always
practice medicine part‐time.

939
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,886
But your family
needs you, John.

940
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,453
We need you to
run the business.

941
00:36:15,355 --> 00:36:16,556
I don't know.

942
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,059
'Please.'

943
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,961
Think about it.

944
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,630
No. No. I don't need
to think about it.

945
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:23,798
Gamma, I can't.

946
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:26,066
I'm a doctor.

947
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,736
It's all that
I've ever wanted to be since..

948
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,039
‐ Since your brother died.
‐ Since I was a kid.

949
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:33,307
And there's
nothing else for me.

950
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,545
You really love it that much?

951
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,681
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

952
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:44,785
Forgive me for asking.

953
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:48,623
I...I had to try.

954
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:51,091
I'll expect to see you at your
grandfather's birthday dinner.

955
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,828
You will.

956
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,631
I always wondered what you'd
be like when you grew up.

957
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:04,004
Hey, uh, Connie,
whose patient is this?

958
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:05,505
I think it's Doug's.

959
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:08,575
‐ Where's the mother?
‐ I don't know.

960
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:09,844
Yeah, it's Doug's.

961
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,846
Get him, will you?

962
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,547
Hi, sweetheart.

963
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,850
It's okay.
It's okay.

964
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:21,789
‐ What happened?
‐ Uh, I just found him alone.

965
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,457
Unbelievable.

966
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,959
Yeah, well,
this baby has a fever.

967
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,627
He's in heroin withdrawal.

968
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,863
The mother's been stealing his
methadone between fixes.

969
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:30,397
So, she split?

970
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,166
I told her
to do the right thing.

971
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,533
Maybe she did.

972
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:35,569
Unbelievable.

973
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,138
It's okay, buddy.

974
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:42,643
No. Please,
leave it open.

975
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,681
Okay.

976
00:37:46,714 --> 00:37:47,882
How much longer?

977
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,819
It's hard to tell.

978
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:55,589
Please.

979
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,526
Not long.

980
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:04,699
I'm scared.

981
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:05,866
I won't leave you.

982
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,908
Do you have things
you wish you did different?

983
00:38:16,243 --> 00:38:17,211
Doesn't everybody?

984
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:22,182
You should fix it if you can.

985
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,153
Maybe.

986
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,026
Do you want me
to read you back the letter?

987
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,193
Yeah.

988
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:35,495
Okay.

989
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:39,533
"Dear Molli.

990
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:43,871
"You don't know me.

991
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,573
"I'm your father.

992
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:50,010
"I suppose I shouldn't
even call myself that.

993
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:54,548
"You're the best thing
I ever did with my life.

994
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:55,783
"Leaving you was the worst.

995
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:01,689
"God knows I haven't done much
for you while I was alive

996
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:03,958
"But if there's
a place called heaven

997
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,459
"And they let me in

998
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:08,963
"I promise to always
look over you.

999
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:13,567
"Please forgive me. I'm sorry

1000
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,635
I never got to know you."

1001
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,083
Me, too.

1002
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:50,204
I'm going to start
to worry about you.

1003
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:52,572
First, you work
on a holiday.

1004
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:54,274
Now, I find you alone

1005
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,143
standing out here
in the dark.

1006
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:00,748
What are you
doing out here?

1007
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:03,150
Looking for you.

1008
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:06,153
Well, you found me.

1009
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,122
I have to admit
that brooding veneer

1010
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,824
is part of your appeal
but I thought

1011
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:11,291
I'd broken
through most of it.

1012
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,098
I'm supposed to be
at Carla's Restaurant

1013
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:20,567
celebrating
my son's baptism.

1014
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,302
I see.

1015
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,904
And you're here because?

1016
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:25,940
Ah..

1017
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:27,942
I don't want to feel
like an intruder, you know?

1018
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:31,578
Like I have to share my son
with Carla's boyfriend.

1019
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:34,048
Do you?

1020
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,716
I mean, he gets to spend
all the time with him.

1021
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,585
You know, how do I
compete with that?

1022
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,087
You're his father, Peter.

1023
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,890
You don't have to compete.

1024
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:44,191
Then I thought
I'd come and see you

1025
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:47,227
but, you know, you had
that lunch thing, so..

1026
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:50,030
Are you jealous?

1027
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:54,101
Well, you know, your
instincts were right.

1028
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:56,804
Romano propositioned me.

1029
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:59,006
Are you serious?
What'd you say?

1030
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,642
I lied.
Said I don't date colleagues.

1031
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:04,178
It's cowardly of me, I know.

1032
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,313
Oh, that's okay.
I lied today, too.

1033
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:08,215
‐ What, about me?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1034
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:11,819
So much for a relationship
without complications.

1035
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,659
You know what?
Screw it.

1036
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:20,795
‐ Come on. Let's go.
‐ Where?

1037
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:22,830
To the party.
There's still time.

1038
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:24,732
Peter, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

1039
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:27,267
Elizabeth, I know that.
Look, I just want to go, okay.

1040
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:28,769
Well, then you should go.

1041
00:41:28,803 --> 00:41:30,237
You should go alone
for your son.

1042
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,605
This is his day.

1043
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:35,643
Ah, yeah, you're right.

1044
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,879
Hey, thanks.

1045
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:45,352
Listen, um, if
it's not too late..

1046
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:46,420
Hey, listen, I'll be up.

1047
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:48,022
‐ Are you kidding?
‐ Oh.

1048
00:41:53,894 --> 00:41:55,295
Hey! Anna!

1049
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:56,764
Hi, Carter.

1050
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:58,365
‐ Want some cookie?
‐ Yeah.

1051
00:41:58,398 --> 00:42:00,367
‐ You off?
‐ Yep. You?

1052
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,969
‐ Another six hours.
‐ Bummer.

1053
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:03,437
Did you discharge
Mr. Lorenzo?

1054
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,139
Yes. He even gave me his web
site address.

1055
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,406
‐ Thank you very much
‐ Why?

1056
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,108
So you could
feel like an idiot?

1057
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,913
Max!
Hold on.

1058
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:39,707
'Oh, sorry.'

1059
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:42,176
That's okay.

1060
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:44,945
‐ What time is it?
‐ Uh, 10:00 to 2:00.

1061
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,314
‐ You on call?
‐ Um, I'm waiting for Carol.

1062
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:50,751
She should be ready. T‐they
called it about a half hour ago.

1063
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,152
Thanks.

1064
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,465
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

1065
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,234
'I'll just be another minute.'

1066
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:09,804
'That's alright.
Take your time.'

1067
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,909
Tough one, huh?

1068
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:18,312
‐ You okay?
‐ Yeah.

1069
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,148
You sure?

1070
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,282
Kept asking
for his daughter.

1071
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:26,353
Never thought of it
like that, you know?

1072
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:31,325
Maybe he was asking for me.

1073
00:43:33,327 --> 00:43:35,730
Maybe he wanted to see me
and I never came.

1074
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,901
Your dad was probably
in a coma, Carol.

1075
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:42,069
I don't know.

1076
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:45,439
I've been living
my mother's version of it

1077
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:49,810
for so long, I don't know...
what memories of him are mine.

1078
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:52,813
‐ What's her version?
‐ Everything was alright.

1079
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,248
That it was an accident.

1080
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,058
He was depressed, Doug.

1081
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,060
Well, maybe it's time
you talked to your mom about it.

1082
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:15,402
After he was gone,
my mom used to go on and on

1083
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:18,272
about how you can
never depend on men.

1084
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:21,575
Now she's head over heels and..

1085
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:23,010
...I'm the one holding back.

1086
00:44:23,043 --> 00:44:24,879
How messed up is that?

1087
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,514
Keeps me on my toes.

1088
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:33,954
I say I want time,
but the truth is..

1089
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,394
...I'm scared to death
of losing you.

1090
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,428
Oh, don't be.

1091
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:46,533
I'm so sorry, Doug.

1092
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:47,902
Don't be.

1093
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,106
I love you.

1094
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:53,841
I love you, too.
