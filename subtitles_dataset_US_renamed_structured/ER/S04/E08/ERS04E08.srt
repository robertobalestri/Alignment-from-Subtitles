1
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,040
Previously on "ER".

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,675
‐ Are you firing me?
‐ Jeanie, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,511
Oh, geez!

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,412
Your clinic proposal.
That's tonight, isn't it?

5
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,515
Yeah, Oak Park, 7 o'clock.
I thought that's what we said.

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,584
Your husband lied
to you about his condition.

7
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,085
He's going to die.

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,087
Peter Benton, Rocket Romano.

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,189
Dr. Benton.
Hey.

10
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,191
Lizzie's talked about you.

11
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,593
I don't usually do
this kind of thing.

12
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,562
Sure, that's what
they all say.

13
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,564
My family has a few bucks,
and everything changes.

14
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,298
A few bucks.
Is that what this is to you?

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,680
Carol!

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,214
Oh, man, look at you.

17
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,783
I hardly sleep a wink
on the redeye

18
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,318
and you're jogging
and smiling.

19
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,820
There's nothing like
a visit with the folks

20
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,756
to make you appreciate
home sweet home.

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,423
Well, the staff
will be thrilled.

22
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,727
You haven't been too high
on the popularity list lately.

23
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,428
Yeah, I've been
kind of a jerk.

24
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,364
‐ Worse.
‐ Pain in the ass?

25
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,431
Keep going.

26
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,333
‐ Total schmuck.
‐ Bingo.

27
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,735
I mean, we all understood.

28
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,104
It's just we‐we're glad
you're getting over it.

29
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,472
As you know,
that meant a lot to Doug

30
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,608
you, uh, showing up
like that.

31
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,643
Meant a lot to me, too.

32
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,579
Oh, I almost forgot.

33
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,848
I found this
when I unpacked.

34
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,450
‐ "CH"?
‐ Yeah. Carol Hathaway.

35
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,853
‐ It's from D. R.
‐ Did you read it?

36
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,422
‐ No, but I was tempted.
‐ Uh‐huh.

37
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:32,559
Anna, can you come in here
and give me a hand?

38
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,127
Uh, what have you got?

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,862
I've got a shoulder reduction
on a boxer.

40
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,199
‐ Coach made him take ballet.
‐ Mm. I'll do the traction.

41
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,734
Then I will give you
counter‐traction.

42
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,368
Okay.

43
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,871
Oh, thanks, Lily.

44
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,840
‐ So how have you been?
‐ Fine.

45
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:51,645
On my count.
One, two, three.

46
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,747
Seen any, uh, interesting cases?

47
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,181
Uh, no, not really.

48
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,650
Done any interesting
procedures?

49
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,184
Nope.

50
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,485
Hey, you want to grab
some breakfast?

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,787
I'm not hungry, thanks.

52
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,422
Are you still angry?

53
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,525
‐ I'm over it.
‐ You sure?

54
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,492
Can we just focus
on the patient, please?

55
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,232
‐ Hey, cute little bugger.
‐ Oh, thanks.

56
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,499
I bet he keeps you
pretty busy, huh?

57
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,701
Actually,
he lives with his mother

58
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:15,936
so I see him
when I can.

59
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,638
‐ Huh.
‐ What about you?

60
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,905
‐ You got any kids?
‐ Huh.

61
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,808
None they've been able
to pin on me.

62
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,343
You know, Peter..

63
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,812
...you've been
on my mind lately.

64
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,280
You made the shortlist
for my team.

65
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,415
You still interested?

66
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,584
Sure.

67
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,587
I just have a couple
of reservations.

68
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,322
‐ Reservations?
‐ Yeah.

69
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,758
I need a team player

70
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,326
someone who is compatible
with Lizzie Corday.

71
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,663
Now, word has it

72
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:46,332
you and she have had
a couple of run‐ins.

73
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,969
We've had our differences,
but we've worked them out.

74
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,572
Differences can be healthy.

75
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,507
You think you can
keep up with her?

76
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,842
Absolutely.

77
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,811
Do you have the time?

78
00:02:58,779 --> 00:02:59,913
Sure.

79
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,416
Great.

80
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,653
We'll do a trial run,
see if we're all compatible.

81
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,622
Then I'll make
my final decision.

82
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,696
‐ Whoa! What's going on?
‐ Mark, when did you get back?

83
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,430
Uh, hi, late last night.

84
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,732
What are all these people
doing here?

85
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,934
Oh, these are patients
for your new clinic.

86
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,604
Oh, no, the clinic doesn't open
till next week.

87
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,772
No, you said to put
the announcement in for today.

88
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,575
No, I said next week.

89
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,645
‐ Oh, man!
‐ Oh, I'm really sorry.

90
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,581
I...is there anything
that I can do?

91
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,719
Start giving out numbers.

92
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,606
Okay, everybody listen up

93
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,608
I need volunteers
to come back next week.

94
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,643
You'll get on the front
of the line.

95
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,045
No? Then everyone's gonna have
to be really patient.

96
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,814
Tell that to my boss.

97
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,349
‐ Hey, Brian, Davy, cut it out.
‐ Oh, miss.

98
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,552
I can't keep standing like this.
I've got the gout.

99
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,888
Here, take a chair.
Anyone else need a chair?

100
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,489
You need to stop
jumping up and down

101
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,924
and you need to go
wait over in chairs.

102
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,726
‐ Take a number.
‐ Aw, 27!

103
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,662
I might as well be waiting
six hours in the ER.

104
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,064
Go ahead, that would
help me out a lot.

105
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,566
Carol.

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,067
Oh, Kerry, hi.

107
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,836
Uh, did Mark tell you
about the scheduling snafu?

108
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,838
Yeah, it's very unfortunate.
I need to have a word with you.

109
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,372
Yeah, I'm lil' busy right now.

110
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,609
Weren't you scheduled
to work in the ER today?

111
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,511
Yeah, but I had to take the day
off, so I could run the clinic.

112
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,112
I don't suppose you could spare
anyone to help me out?

113
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,948
When I signed off
on the clinic, you promised

114
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,617
that you would find
your own personnel

115
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,619
and it wouldn't impinge
on your regular duties.

116
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,421
Well, uh, I could always turf
the runny noses, BP checks

117
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,057
over to the ER and have one of
the nurse personnel handle them.

118
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,026
Okay, I'll give
you Yosh Takata.

119
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,529
‐ Who?
‐ Nursing administration.

120
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:32,465
Excuse me.
Transfer from upstairs.

121
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,568
Why don't you, at least,
talk to a friend of mine

122
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,369
at the Gay and Lesbian
Defense Fund?

123
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,104
'They represent people
with HIV and AIDS'

124
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,472
'who've been fired
from their jobs.'

125
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,874
Maggie, thanks
for your concern, really

126
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,609
but that's not
what happened.

127
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,410
Sure.

128
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,112
You're the best PA we have.

129
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,948
I just hate to see you give up.

130
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,050
I'm not giving up.
I'm moving on.

131
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,818
Al's already in Atlanta
checking out leads

132
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,787
on a couple
of construction jobs.

133
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,522
But it is illegal
for them to fire you

134
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,423
for being HIV positive.

135
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,025
You think that's why
they fired me?

136
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,927
You don't?

137
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,495
No, I...no.

138
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,630
They could've done that
last year.

139
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,599
It's because of the budget.

140
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,472
Hi.

141
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,974
Hi.

142
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,610
‐ I missed you.
‐ Me, too.

143
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,644
You did?

144
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,580
'Cause you didn't call.

145
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,583
Oh, we were on the road
the whole time

146
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,185
so I wasn't able
to wrap it.

147
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,688
What's this?

148
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,723
Oh, it's beautiful.

149
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,626
‐ Thank you. I love it.
‐ Mm.

150
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,460
Oh, my...will you
latch it for me?

151
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,830
‐ Sure.
‐ Oh.

152
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,033
The guy at the shop said that
it is a genuine diamond.

153
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,202
A real diamond.

154
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,005
No one's ever gotten me
a real diamond before, Mark.

155
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,173
I love it.

156
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,142
‐ Pardon us.
‐ Welcome back.

157
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,811
Ah, there's no place like home.

158
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,646
Ugh, this coffee's terrible.

159
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,448
Oh, um, I'm really awful
in the kitchen.

160
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,618
‐ Sorry.
‐ I think it tastes really good.

161
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,222
‐ What do we got?
‐ Approximately 12‐year‐old boy.

162
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,857
Hit and run
on his way to school.

163
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,226
GCS seven,
got routine blood work.

164
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,895
Chest and abdominal films,
C‐spine.

165
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,632
BP's funky, 80/palp.

166
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,033
Gave two units O‐neg.

167
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,569
The name on this notebook
says Rodney Price.

168
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,703
There's a mass
in the upper left quadrant.

169
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,605
The abdomen is tense
and distended.

170
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,641
‐ Crit's falling, 26.
‐ He's bleeding internally.

171
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,509
I'll hang another unit
on the rapid infuser.

172
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,944
Looks like he ruptured
his spleen.

173
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,946
I don't know. That's the
biggest spleen I've ever felt.

174
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,049
‐ Got the wet reads.
‐ Ah, great.

175
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,517
Yeah, see, here's the shadow.

176
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,052
That's the hematoma

177
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,820
pressing down
on the splenic flexure.

178
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,255
‐ Looks like a rupture.
‐ Uh‐uh, no, no, no.

179
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,123
Oh, wait‐wait a minute,
wait a minute.

180
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,859
Film's mislabeled.

181
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,094
See, the gastric bubble is
under the right diaphragm

182
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,495
instead of the left.

183
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,264
Yeah, but with
a splenic rupture

184
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,999
the gastric bubble
can be displaced.

185
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,268
No, no, no,
not that much, it ca..

186
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,203
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute.

187
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,805
That's not the kid's spleen,
that's his liver.

188
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,507
The liver's in the wrong place.

189
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,775
‐ Backwards?
‐ Yeah.

190
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,109
His abdominal organs
are reversed.

191
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,544
‐ That's remarkable.
‐ Alright.

192
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,680
Let's get him up
to surgery, move!

193
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:00,981
You ever do a case
like this before?

194
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,282
No, I've never even seen
a case like this.

195
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,017
This is one in a million.
Alright, everybody.

196
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,285
Page Romano.

197
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,153
Do you have previous
clinic experience, Yosh?

198
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,221
A little.

199
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,523
Where would that
have been?

200
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,924
‐ Uh, chart review.
‐ Oh.

201
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,126
You don't see many patients
in chart review.

202
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,028
No, but I sure know
a lot about them.

203
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,030
Alright, we're gonna have to
double up on patients in here.

204
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,164
And I will be
with you in a minute.

205
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,700
You said that
an hour ago.

206
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,535
Alright, I want you
to sign in patients

207
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,136
start a chart
and check their vitals.

208
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,771
‐ 'Where?'
‐ Out here.

209
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,873
If anyone seems
the least bit emergent

210
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,175
I want you to take them
over to ER Triage.

211
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,044
Can you handle that?

212
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,679
If I have any questions,
I'll give a holler.

213
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:33,814
Great. Mark.

214
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,849
Oh, bring the kid
out here, please.

215
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,818
‐ Do you have a sec?
‐ I gotta get to Radiology.

216
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,953
Alright, but I got
a triple failure otitis media

217
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,888
that needs a script
for Augmentin.

218
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,124
Alright.
How's it going, Carol?

219
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,661
You know, I would've been
organized by next week.

220
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,063
I don't suppose you, uh,
could help me at all today, huh?

221
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,265
Yeah, well, it's a little busy
not having Doug here.

222
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,000
‐ Yeah.
‐ But I'll see what I can do.

223
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,836
Alright, I appreciate it.
Thank you.

224
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,903
Oh.

225
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,238
I think Carol's mad at me.

226
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,674
Nah, she's just got
a lot on her mind.

227
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,776
Listen, that hospital lawyer
dropped off these papers

228
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,077
for you to sign,
he says they're urgent

229
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,579
about the civil rights case.

230
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,747
Right, just file 'em in my box.

231
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,248
‐ Along with the others?
‐ Yeah.

232
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,216
'Cause I'm not gonna let
these bastards get to me.

233
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,920
Oh, the man of the hour's
arrived.

234
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,156
‐ This is situs inversus?
‐ Sure is.

235
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,691
Fantastic case, Peter.

236
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,960
I've never seen one
in the flesh before.

237
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,928
It's probably worth
considering a case report.

238
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,598
Well, I'm actually thinking
of running a literature review.

239
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,299
Actually, I took the liberty,
there's absolutely nothing

240
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,769
on abdominal situs inversus
in trauma.

241
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,671
Oh, really? Well, I can be
the first to write about it.

242
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,138
Just heard the good news.

243
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,174
You've got quite a nose
for sniffing out zebras.

244
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,176
I wish I could take
the credit, but Peter landed

245
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,844
and it's, as they say,
finders keepers.

246
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,746
Nonsense. Peter won't
mind you scrubbing in.

247
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,014
Give us all a chance
to work together.

248
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,950
Well, I think he might.

249
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,921
‐ No, no, of course not.
‐ Great. You both can run it.

250
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,656
I'll just hang out
on the sidelines in case

251
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,924
I have to take
one of you out of the game.

252
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,225
Shall we scrub?

253
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,097
So, uh..

254
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,132
...don't you think
it's time we called a truce?

255
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,234
I am not at war.

256
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,936
You know I feel really terrible
about what happened.

257
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,705
I didn't mean to mislead you
about my family.

258
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,807
It's really not that
big a deal, okay?

259
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,075
‐ No hard feelings?
‐ No.

260
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,677
Oh, excuse me, John.

261
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,878
‐ I hope I'm not interrupting.
‐ Hey, Henry.

262
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,680
Hey, Henry, what are you
doing back here?

263
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,248
I just wanna thank you
for giving me time

264
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,784
during my ER rotation
to finish my brain blots.

265
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:18,985
Henry, grab the end
of that, please.

266
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,153
The end? Oh, alright.

267
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,722
The results are
so promising.

268
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,356
I got a Howard Hughes
Research Fellowship.

269
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,291
‐ Ah. Glad I could help.
‐ Well, you did.

270
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,193
And I was wondering,
if it's not too much trouble

271
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,195
if you might just
do me one more favor here.

272
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,697
‐ Favor, huh?
‐ Uh, yes.

273
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,232
See, I'm not, I'm not able to..
Excuse me.

274
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,034
I'm not able to start
a new rotation

275
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,770
until you remove these UEs
from my evaluation here.

276
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,371
So if you could just..

277
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,974
"Unable to evaluate
physical examination.

278
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,877
"Unable to evaluate technical
and procedural skills.

279
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,680
Unable to evaluate interactions
with the healthcare team."

280
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,349
‐ Yeah. You can't just pass me?
‐ Uh...no.

281
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,917
You barely showed up.

282
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,786
Well, then the registrar
says that I need to repeat

283
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,988
this clerkship until I pass.

284
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,422
Anna, you don't have
a student, do you?

285
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,159
Uh, don't need one.

286
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,395
Well, then, I guess
it's just, uh...you and me.

287
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,733
Jeanie, I've been
looking for you.

288
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,201
Well, you found me.

289
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,770
Good news.

290
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,204
Atlanta Memorial called.

291
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,707
They're very interested in you.

292
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,742
I faxed them
an excellent recommendation.

293
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,011
You should be a shoo‐in
for a PA position there.

294
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,046
Thank you.

295
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,916
Jeanie, if there were any way
I could change things

296
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,819
believe me, I would.

297
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,788
‐ I'm‐I'm gonna miss you.
‐ I know.

298
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,163
There's absolutely no way we can
take all these people today.

299
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,832
You bring them back next week,
they'll get first priority.

300
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,867
You're refusing to give
physicals to homeless families?

301
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,435
I am not refusing,
we simply don't have

302
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,270
any more appointments for today.

303
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,472
But I called two hours ago,
and a lady over the phone said

304
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,441
that this was
a walk‐in clinic day.

305
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,210
Cynthia, did you give
this man permission

306
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,878
'to bring in all these people?'

307
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,014
Well, the clinic's open.
I figured that it would be okay.

308
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,215
Are you a complete idiot?

309
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,449
Can't you see
we're swamped already?

310
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,885
‐ I'm really sorry, I‐‐
‐ What's going on?

311
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,521
Oh, she invited
the entire Hazleton Shelter

312
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,822
for free physicals.

313
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,857
Carol, can I talk to you?

314
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,061
So there was miscommunication.

315
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,130
If you have a problem with
Cynthia or any other employee

316
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,799
in the future, have the courtesy
to speak to them privately.

317
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,835
Don't dress them down
in front of the entire ER.

318
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,171
‐ Anything else?
‐ No.

319
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,410
Liver's lacerated, let's excise
the left lateral aspect.

320
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,312
Which, anatomically,
is the right lobe.

321
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,081
‐ Correct.
‐ I don't know about you, Peter.

322
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,415
But I'm getting dizzy now.

323
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,284
Maybe we should put
a mirror on the ceiling.

324
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,053
We could operate
from my bedroom.

325
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,988
Alright, Janet, do me a favor,
get a photo from the other side.

326
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,258
Peter, expose the gall bladder.

327
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,160
Found any family
on this kid yet?

328
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,995
‐ Not last I heard.
‐ Well, let's get on it.

329
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,530
I wanna get releases
for these photos.

330
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,065
Liver's still bleeding.

331
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,800
You ever used
an argon beam coagulator?

332
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,468
No, I wanna do
the Pringle maneuver

333
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,970
while you practice
your ABC's.

334
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,371
Go for it.

335
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,039
I've got a colleague
who would love to get his hands

336
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,041
on some blood samples
from this kid and his family.

337
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,476
Suction, please.

338
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,181
Here we go.
Alright, heads up.

339
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,350
Have pathology pickle this.

340
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,952
'Bet no one's ever seen
a backwards liver.'

341
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,521
We can use it to play
stump the med student.

342
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,089
Not to mention publishing.

343
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,323
Dr. Corday and I
we're discussing it.

344
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,892
‐ You both up for it?
‐ I'm game.

345
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,426
‐ So am I.
‐ Excellent.

346
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,930
We'll fight over whose name
goes first on the papers later.

347
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,298
I'd say that's a wrist.

348
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,601
That's definitely
a fracture of the wrist.

349
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,103
Yeah, but there are eight bones
in the wrist. Which one?

350
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,874
What do you think the odds of
catching TB in this place?

351
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,275
Henry, which bone is broken?

352
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,911
Ah, it's th‐the lunate.

353
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,145
No, that's over here.

354
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,213
Here, remember this,
would you?

355
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,081
It's a mnemonic.

356
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:39,352
Never Lower Tillie's Pants
Mother May Come Home.

357
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,254
Maybe you boys should
talk privately.

358
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,990
No, I'm just..

359
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,159
...teaching Henry
the bones in the wrists.

360
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,195
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Here, the, uh..

361
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,032
M for mother is the
greater multangular.

362
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,000
Wait, wait, wait, you call that
the multangular?

363
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,536
I was taught
it was the trapezium.

364
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,237
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

365
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,205
And I call that the scaphoid,
what do you call it?

366
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,908
‐ Navicular.
‐ Hmm.

367
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:05,111
So my little mnemonic
wouldn't work for you.

368
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,379
It's okay.
I have one of my own.

369
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,482
Really, well, let's hear it.

370
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,351
Okay.

371
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,452
Uh..

372
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,187
...Scared Lovers

373
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,422
Try Positions

374
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,593
That They Can't Handle.

375
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,327
‐ Go with Anna's.
‐ He's already learned yours.

376
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,495
Yeah, I like yours better.

377
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,164
I‐I don't think that
I need either.

378
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,132
I'll just, uh..

379
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,868
...memorize the names.

380
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,873
Excuse me.

381
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,310
If Dr. Anspaugh calls,
tell him I'll have this budget

382
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,245
in his hands
by this afternoon.

383
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,380
Do you know
who left this note?

384
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,949
‐ Uh, no.
‐ "CH". That's me.

385
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,250
‐ Dr. Weaver.
‐ Yeah.

386
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,952
You drive a Plymouth?
You left your lights on.

387
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,253
Oh, that's hard to believe.
Thank you.

388
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,923
Herb Spivak. Snakebite
to the upper left torso.

389
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,491
‐ From a bivittatus.
‐ Non‐venomous?

390
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,393
No, but it's got teeth
like a piranha

391
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,928
with a head
the size of a papaya.

392
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,030
Mark, can you take this
non‐venomous snakebite

393
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,465
to the left thorax.
I left my lights on in the car.

394
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,001
‐ Sure. Curtain area three.
‐ Yeah.

395
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,468
Can you sign off
on this quarterly budget?

396
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,437
‐ Anspaugh is expecting it.
‐ Where?

397
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,673
Just below my signature.
I'll be right back.

398
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,141
So how did this happen?

399
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,076
I was feeding his python.
It bit me.

400
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,712
What do you except?
You spilled the chicken soup.

401
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,413
‐ Who are you?
‐ Gary Lomax.

402
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,481
Owner of
Jungle Gary's Reptarium.

403
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,317
He spilled chicken soup
on himself.

404
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,119
‐ What?
‐ Pythons love chicken.

405
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,721
So I dipped the rat
in my chicken soup.

406
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,389
It spilled on my jacket,
and bingo, the guy got me.

407
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,358
Python must have thought he was
the world's biggest chicken.

408
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,231
‐ Ellis.
‐ Hey, fancy meeting you here.

409
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,166
Uh, security said
my lights were on.

410
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,268
Ah, a little ruse to get you
out here so I can

411
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,203
thank you for getting us
the contract.

412
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,439
‐ Anspaugh approved it?
‐ Ink's still wet.

413
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,975
Synergix is now supplying
extra attending coverage

414
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,277
to County General,
it's all because of you.

415
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,979
Why didn't you just come
inside the hospital?

416
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,182
I wanted to avoid any suggestion
of preferential treatment.

417
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,717
Well, it's not
preferential treatment.

418
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,119
‐ It's just good business.
‐ We have that in common.

419
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,088
It's good business
for me to say thanks.

420
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,226
‐ Thanks, Kerry.
‐ Phalaenopsis.

421
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,295
Oh, Ellis,
you shouldn't have.

422
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,665
‐ Alright. You know phals?
‐ I love them.

423
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,768
Something else
we have in common.

424
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,269
Great job, Peter.

425
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,137
You really drained
the hell out of that liver.

426
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,239
Once I got my bearings,
it really wasn't that difficult.

427
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,641
I'm just glad
the case came along.

428
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,443
Me, too, but a compass
would've been helpful.

429
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,079
'Check the serial crits
and coags.'

430
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,681
'Make sure the Jackson Pratts
don't clot off.'

431
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,383
'Lizzie, catalog the photos,
and dig up every article'

432
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,619
'you can find on
situs inversus viscerum.'

433
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,353
'Okay, I'll keep an eye
on the core temp.'

434
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,422
'If it drops below 35, I'll
place him in a warming blanket.'

435
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,157
'I'll alert
the Genetics Department'

436
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,593
to see
if they want to consult.

437
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:35,529
Dr. Romano, this is Mr. Price,
Rodney's father.

438
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,363
School called.

439
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,333
Told me there was an accident,
told me to come right over.

440
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,168
How's my boy doing?

441
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,038
We had to remove part of his
liver to control the bleeding.

442
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,774
He's in serious condition, but
he did come out of surgery well.

443
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,475
Aren't you..

444
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,278
...Peter Benton
from Collins High?

445
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,782
‐ Yeah.
‐ Isaac...Price.

446
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,551
You two were classmates?

447
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,052
Yeah, class of '83.

448
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,087
Peter was on
that college track.

449
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,823
‐ Nose to the grindstone.
‐ It paid off.

450
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,491
Your son had
an excellent surgeon.

451
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,493
Isaac, is your son
on any medication

452
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,295
or allergic
to any drugs?

453
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,598
I don't know.

454
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:15,135
He lives with his mother.

455
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,404
Listen, is Rodney
gonna be alright?

456
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,440
You know,
we're doin' our best, man.

457
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,779
Damn it. Damn it.

458
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,313
‐ Can I help you find something?
‐ Oh, no.

459
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,849
‐ You've done plenty. Thanks.
‐ 'Carol.'

460
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,484
I think you better move your
patients out of the admit area.

461
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,587
We could get cited
for blocking fire exits.

462
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,556
Dr. Doyle, did you want
your December meal tickets.

463
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,124
‐ Uh, who has time to eat?
‐ I'll take 'em.

464
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,392
Well, they're
for the residents.

465
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,529
You heard her,
"Who has time to eat?"

466
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:46,366
You're gonna need
a tetanus booster, antibiotics

467
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,136
and I'll have to extract
those python teeth.

468
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,872
Malik, could you get me
some Betadine?

469
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,374
'I brought Flora along'

470
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,742
in case you wanted
to swab her.

471
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:56,843
Flora?

472
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,612
She's actually quite gentle.

473
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,281
‐ When she's not hungry.
‐ How do you know?

474
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,349
She's harmless except
for mouth rot.

475
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,251
And you‐you think
we should get a culture?

476
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,188
I love her dearly,
but her mouth's a cesspool.

477
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,257
Malik, you want to,
uh, give him a hand?

478
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,726
I don't think so.

479
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,762
Just grab her middle.
Don't let go.

480
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,840
Now, this next case
of situs inversus

481
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:30,511
apparently shows
no cardiac involvement.

482
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,278
Ah, Dr. Benton.

483
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,180
This is a great, great
teaching case.

484
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,617
I was just discussing it with
the residents and the students.

485
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,853
Dr. Benton and Dr. Corday
performed the surgery.

486
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,522
I understand that
photographs were taken.

487
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,156
I'm sure everybody
would love to see them.

488
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,525
Uh, actually you know what

489
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,159
we need to change
the patient's dressings.

490
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,161
No, no problem.
We'll come back later.

491
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,896
This is great work, Peter.

492
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,533
Don't forget those photos.

493
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,167
Anspaugh's impressed.

494
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,436
‐ Yeah. Here.
‐ How's the kid doing?

495
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,404
'Uh, he's stable.'

496
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,307
Lucky break,
the father knowing you.

497
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,578
Should make it easier to consent
him for blood tests.

498
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,613
Genetic breakthroughs
are hovering in the wings.

499
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,249
You'll talk to the family?

500
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,285
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, great.

501
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,588
‐ Peter, is something wrong?
‐ No.

502
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,923
I'll be happy to talk
to the father if you'd prefer.

503
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,559
Why?

504
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,860
I just thought
you might be more comfortable

505
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,461
since you know Mr. Price.

506
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,797
I don't know him.
What difference would it make?

507
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,232
It's tough if you've a personal
connection to a patient.

508
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,636
I don't have
a personal connection. I j..

509
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,938
I don't want him to think
we're using his kid.

510
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:33,406
We've treated him
as best we can.

511
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,542
‐ 'Haven't we?'
‐ Yeah.

512
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,511
Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

513
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,652
‐ Excuse me.
‐ It's my fault.

514
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,953
I'm not used
to the floor plan yet.

515
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,922
I don't think we've met.
I'm Jeanie Boulet.

516
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,958
Yosh Takata, new RN.

517
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,427
The new RN?

518
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,230
How'd you get past
the hiring freeze?

519
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,967
I didn't know there was one. I
put in for a transfer to the ER.

520
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,703
‐ How long you've been here?
‐ Two years.

521
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,771
‐ Oh. Do you like it?
‐ Yeah, I do, yeah.

522
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,372
Okay, well,
it's good to meet you.

523
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,741
‐ I gotta run.
‐ Okay.

524
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,512
How did you get these
other scars?

525
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,979
That was defending
a cave diver.

526
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,915
We got caught
in a kelp forest.

527
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:15,982
‐ Do you dive?
‐ No.

528
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,951
Oh, spectacular.

529
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,254
So when did you start
handling snakes?

530
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,856
He's defending me
in a wrongful death suit.

531
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,758
‐ Ah, you're an attorney.
‐ Yeah.

532
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,260
Flora ate his neighbor's
Jack Russell Terrier.

533
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,895
'Obviously, they have no case
whatsoever.'

534
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,363
'The breed's
not even recognized'

535
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,898
'by the American
Kennel Association.'

536
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,000
Gary offered to help me work
with snakes

537
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,002
in exchange for legal counsel.

538
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,705
How could I refuse
such an offer?

539
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,674
Oh.

540
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,876
Sure, Al, I know.
I know.

541
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,778
Okay, I love you, too. Bye.

542
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:48,048
You okay?

543
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,482
Yeah, just Al..

544
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,552
...foreman job
in Atlanta fell through.

545
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,820
Oh, I'm sorry. Does he
have other possibilities?

546
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,488
Al's always got
other possibilities.

547
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:56,823
‐ Let me give you a hand.
‐ Thanks.

548
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,725
‐ How's it going for you?
‐ Oh, lousy.

549
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,627
I don't know why I ever thought
I could run a clinic?

550
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:03,029
I've no supplies. I can't even
write a script for an earache.

551
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,831
‐ PA's can write scripts.
‐ Yeah.

552
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:07,400
But Kerry Weaver won't let me
use any of the ER staff.

553
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,369
What's she gonna do?
Fire me?

554
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,940
Mark.

555
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:16,409
You are so romantic.

556
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,944
I am?

557
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,015
Hiding that note
under the charts.

558
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,051
I mean, my heart skipped
a beat when I saw my initials.

559
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,086
What?

560
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,454
On the envelope, C. H.

561
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,991
What you wrote was really sexy.

562
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,393
‐ Did you mean it?
‐ Yeah, sure.

563
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,828
Then, my answer is yes.

564
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,296
I will.

565
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,070
Hey.

566
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:46,640
Everything okay?

567
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,408
Well, we just got
some labs back

568
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,344
and, uh...Rodney's crit
is okay.

569
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,580
But his platelets
are falling.

570
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:56,817
We're concerned that his blood
might not clot properly.

571
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,719
What does that mean?
Is he gonna pull through?

572
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:02,422
Well, he, uh...he may need
to have a transfusion

573
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,626
but don't worry about it. I'm
gonna keep an eye on him, okay?

574
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,093
You know,
thanks, Peter.

575
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,596
I know you're doing
everything you can, man.

576
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,931
It's like all the doctors
who've been in to see him

577
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,899
making sure he's alright.

578
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,037
Isaac, are you aware that

579
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,673
Rodney has a rare
genetic syndrome

580
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:23,009
that caused his abdominal
organs to be reversed?

581
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:24,444
Is that why he's so sick?

582
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,112
No, but when he was hit
by the car

583
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:28,414
his liver was
severely injured.

584
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:31,718
See, if it had been
in the proper position

585
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,787
the prognosis
might be better.

586
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,524
Um..

587
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,927
Listen, I, uh..

588
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:42,696
I know it's not easy, alright?

589
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:47,601
Times like this,
you know, to ask, but..

590
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,936
...w‐we'd like
permission to, um..

591
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,171
...draw some of Rodney's blood

592
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,739
along with yours
and your ex‐wife's

593
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:54,474
to do a genetic study.

594
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:57,611
Yeah, okay. Okay.

595
00:22:57,644 --> 00:23:00,847
I'll do anything
if it'll help Rodney get better.

596
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,184
Um, here.

597
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,152
You need to sign
the consent.

598
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,502
On a scale
of one to ten

599
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,637
how would you rate
your pain?

600
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,771
Oh, I don't know.

601
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,206
Ooh! When you
push like that

602
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,675
it's a nine
or‐or an eight.

603
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:29,843
But it could be
a six or a seven.

604
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,978
I'm not sure.

605
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:34,548
Ask him to describe
the quality of the pain.

606
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,118
Mr. Kottmeier

607
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:40,486
please describe
the quality of your pain.

608
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:41,522
‐ Quality?
‐ Yeah.

609
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:42,823
Is it dull?
Is it sharp?

610
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,525
Is it crampy?
Is it constant?

611
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:46,059
It's crampy, alright.

612
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,895
Sometimes it's sharp, too..

613
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,032
...when it's not dull.
I'm not sure.

614
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:54,034
I'm a double Libra.
You know how that is.

615
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,537
Not that I believe
in horoscopes.

616
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,639
That appears sharp to me.

617
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,240
I think we're dealing
with diverticulitis, Henry.

618
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,008
What do you want to do?

619
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:05,679
Oh, um, well, that‐that
could be surgical or not.

620
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:08,481
Um, order
an abdominal ultrasound

621
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,884
or maybe get a CT.
I'm not sure.

622
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,052
Well, why don't
we just start

623
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:14,921
with a history
and a physical?

624
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,793
Would you write me a script
for Erythromycin ointment?

625
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:22,228
I got a kid
with conjunctivitis.

626
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:24,998
Having you here today
has been a saving grace to me.

627
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,633
Thanks.

628
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,502
You worked really hard
to get this clinic going.

629
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:29,836
I wish I had your guts.

630
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,271
Gotta fight for
what you believe in.

631
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,007
What if you don't have
the ammunition?

632
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,476
Look for it.

633
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,049
‐ That won't hurt him, will it?
‐ 'No, no.'

634
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,023
Give me five units
of platelets and FFP.

635
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,092
'And 500 units of heparin now!
Move!'

636
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,695
‐ Hey, what's wrong?
‐ 'His blood's not clotting.'

637
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:57,631
‐ 'What's going on?'
‐ 'Oh, my God!'

638
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,900
He went into DIC.
I'm bolusing 500 of Heparin.

639
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,004
He's bradycardic.

640
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:06,673
Lungs are wet.
Put him on 100% oxygen.

641
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,942
‐ Damn. His stats are falling.
‐ Pulmonary hemorrhage.

642
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,176
Let's get him
on his stomach.

643
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,145
Here we go, people.
On my count.

644
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,148
‐ One, two, three.
‐ What's happening here?

645
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,249
His lungs are
filling with blood.

646
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,584
We're trying
to help him breathe.

647
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:18,819
Jesus, please.

648
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,687
‐ Isaac, you got to stand back.
‐ But..

649
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:24,157
Isaac, you got
to stand back, man.

650
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,627
'He's in asystole.
Amp of Epi. Come on, baby.'

651
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,761
We gotta get him
to turn back over.

652
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:28,829
Here we go,
on my count.

653
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,797
One, two, three.

654
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:32,098
Move.

655
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:34,100
Got to start CPR.

656
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,274
‐ Connie, have you seen Cynthia?
‐ She's on a break.

657
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,009
Do you know if she
left her purse?

658
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,712
I don't know.

659
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,113
She really likes you.

660
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:48,849
Oh, yeah.
We're just having fun.

661
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,951
You gave her a diamond.
That's serious fun.

662
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:56,189
Mark, what are you doing?

663
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,291
Uh, nothing I just lost my pen.

664
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:00,126
Here, did you sign off
on the budget?

665
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,128
Uh, actually,
I found an error.

666
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:03,897
‐ 'Really?'
‐ 'Yeah.'

667
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,300
'Here it has your salary $500
more a week than mine.'

668
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,035
Yeah, that's remuneration

669
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,071
for my taking over
administrative duties

670
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:13,674
until Morgenstern returns,
God willing.

671
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,609
$25,000 a year?

672
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,110
'Mark, you signed off on this
three months ago.'

673
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,912
'If you had a problem, why
didn't you say something then?'

674
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,648
I guess I just wasn't
paying attention.

675
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:27,253
Hey, uh, Jeanie, have you
seen a chart for Kottmeier?

676
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,855
No, no. Uh‐uh.

677
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,124
Guess I'll start a new one.

678
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:35,996
Um, and have you, um,
traveled anywhere recently?

679
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,932
Uh, just Louisville
to visit the in‐laws

680
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,701
a‐and then to, uh..

681
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,168
Okay, time to
wrap things up.

682
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:43,704
History and physical
just took 90 minutes.

683
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,371
Shave an hour off that
and you should be

684
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:47,841
within passing range for this
clerkship. Come on, let's go.

685
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,776
There's a rectal abscess in two
with your name on it.

686
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,078
Mr. Kottmeier, someone will be
in to see you shortly.

687
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,780
It would've gone a lot faster if
my allergies hadn't flared up.

688
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:55,749
Take an antihistamine.

689
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:00,987
Hi, Mr. Kottmeier.
I'm Dr. Del Amico.

690
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,422
I'm gonna examine you.

691
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,291
Boy, when they say shortly
they mean shortly.

692
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:08,028
This new clinic's a godsend.
I work part time.

693
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,363
No benefits, so thank you.

694
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:13,266
No. Thank you
for saying that.

695
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,235
There you go, Hector.

696
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:18,304
That shot will keep you
from getting sick.

697
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:19,773
If it's not too much trouble
could you

698
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,074
take a look
at Hector's chin?

699
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,242
He keeps crabbing about it

700
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:23,677
but I don't see
anything wrong.

701
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,345
Sure.

702
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:28,048
Okay. Hector, does it hurt
when I do this?

703
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,817
I can't feel it.

704
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,285
You don't feel me
pressing on it?

705
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,988
‐ No.
‐ No?

706
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,890
Okay, I'm gonna go see
if I can find a doctor.

707
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:39,359
Okay.

708
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,695
High‐dose Epi 7 CCs,
one to a thousand.

709
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,429
Another mg of Atropine.
Move!

710
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:44,865
We got a blip.

711
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:46,700
‐ Was it a pulse?
‐ No pulse.

712
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,068
'Maybe he's got fluid
around the heart.'

713
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:51,972
‐ Pericardiocentesis needle.
‐ Flatline.

714
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:55,475
An Epi can cause
a few transient heartbeats.

715
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,177
Damn, no blood.

716
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,846
Alright, Epi drip wide open
and more platelets.

717
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,915
Let's go.

718
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:04,284
Peter, it's been 20 minutes.

719
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:05,451
Peter!

720
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:12,058
Peter.

721
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,748
Time of death 4:52.

722
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,916
Ah!

723
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,171
Get him up to CT,
keep the C‐collar

724
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:00,340
on until Radiology
clears the C‐spine.

725
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:01,407
‐ You want films?
‐ No.

726
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,076
The neurosurgeon
will take them.

727
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,178
Kerry, I'd like
a minute with you?

728
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,213
Sure, Jeanie, what is it?

729
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,482
I want to take
a look at the budget.

730
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:11,852
‐ The ER budget?
‐ That's right, yeah.

731
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:14,187
Jeanie, I told you I..
It's nothing personal.

732
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,422
I tried everything I could
to try and keep you here.

733
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:18,358
The numbers just
don't support it.

734
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:20,426
If I'm being fired on the basis
of the budget, I just wanna see

735
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,495
the numbers, not hear
your interpretation of them.

736
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,165
Believe me, I've gone over them
with a fine‐tooth comb.

737
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,400
'It's‐it's not fair,
but that's the way it is.'

738
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,369
How do you justify
the hiring of a new nurse?

739
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:33,206
Yosh Takata was hired to replace
two nurses who've left.

740
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:36,510
Mm‐hmm. And what about
giving yourself a raise?

741
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:39,445
Salaries are confidential.

742
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,414
I sure as hell know why.

743
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:48,555
‐ Jeanie, I'm sorry I can't‐‐
‐ I'll find someone who can.

744
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:51,191
Hey, Carter, have you ever
had a patient complain

745
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,993
about his chin
falling asleep?

746
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,460
Heads up, Henry.

747
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:57,097
No, but I'm sure if it's
contagious, Henry will catch it.

748
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,331
Where are you going
with my patient?

749
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,166
Your patient?
Mr. Kottmeier's my patient.

750
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,068
Then why did I do a history
and physical on him?

751
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:03,870
Actually, I'm quite
fond of all of you.

752
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:05,138
Henry, you did
remember to sign

753
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,573
Mr. Kottmeier out
on the board, didn't you?

754
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:08,308
Was I supposed to?

755
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:10,410
‐ Where are you taking him?
‐ To the surgical ward.

756
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:13,279
Mr. Kottmeier has
an inflamed diverticulum

757
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,116
that perfed
into his mesentery.

758
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,051
‐ He needs a colectomy.
‐ Hold on, hold on.

759
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:20,086
Have you considered
medical management?

760
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,088
Treat the abscess first
with a course of Flagyl

761
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:24,124
and Cipro before jumping
into surgery?

762
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,527
‐ I'm willing to give it a shot.
‐ No, no, no, wait.

763
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,128
Are you just agreeing
with me because

764
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,495
you think that's what
I wanna hear

765
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,097
or is it because
you really believe that?

766
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,866
What?

767
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,100
I‐I don't want you
agreeing with me

768
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,468
because, uh, just to please me.

769
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,237
Believe me, I'm not,
in fact, I've already

770
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,239
considered several alternatives
to surgery.

771
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:42,609
‐ You have?
‐ Shut up, Henry.

772
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:46,980
Mark, if you have a problem
with my salary, come to me.

773
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,281
Don't bring it up
to the staff.

774
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,050
Do you have any idea
how many additional hours

775
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,251
I'm working
every week?

776
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,519
What are you talking about?

777
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:54,655
You disclosed our salaries
to Jeanie Boulet.

778
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:56,089
No, I didn't.

779
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:58,458
‐ You didn't?
‐ No.

780
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:01,027
Hey, Carol, what happened to all
the patients in your clinic?

781
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:03,930
I gave them meal tickets, and
stashed them in the cafeteria.

782
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,398
Pretty stressful day
for you, huh?

783
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,900
Tell me about it.

784
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,434
So anything interesting
in Doug's note?

785
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:11,204
Oh, I wish I knew. I lost it
before I got to read it.

786
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,506
Too bad.

787
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,207
Hey, how are you
on Medline searches?

788
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,542
Why?

789
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:17,177
I just did one
on submandibular paralysis

790
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,411
and I came up with zilch.

791
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:21,047
I'm not surprised.
I've never heard of it.

792
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:23,016
Well, I've got this kid
in the clinic who is complaining

793
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,551
of a numb chin,
what should I do?

794
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:28,121
Why don't you try numb chin?

795
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:30,356
Numb chin.

796
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,994
It sounds a little too,
uh, you know, easy.

797
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:36,029
Hey.

798
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,330
‐ Wow.
‐ There you go.

799
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:42,135
I'm sorry, Isaac.

800
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:47,674
Um, can we have a word
with you out in the hall?

801
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:51,512
I don't wanna leave my boy.

802
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:55,048
We'd like your permission
to perform an autopsy.

803
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,583
Why?

804
00:31:56,617 --> 00:31:59,452
Well, because
it could be useful.

805
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,254
Did something go wrong?

806
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,023
He started bleeding when you
stuck him with the needle.

807
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,490
No, that's because
his blood wouldn't clot

808
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:06,059
because of the injury
to his liver.

809
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:07,427
Then why do you need
to do an autopsy?

810
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,296
Uh, for research, it‐it..

811
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,700
...it could be helpful.

812
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,335
And that's why
you're so interested.

813
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,070
‐ And not because he was hurt.
‐ No, no, no.

814
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,972
Isaac, we were trying
to save his life.

815
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:21,107
When you took his blood
and mine

816
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:22,342
were you trying
to save his life?

817
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,409
No, but we would..

818
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,545
We'd like to study
his condition.

819
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:25,679
I don't want
my boy studied.

820
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,280
Well, we understand
how you feel‐‐

821
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,282
Look at him!

822
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,652
Don't you think
you cut him up enough?

823
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,253
‐ Isaac, I'm so sorry‐‐
‐ 'No!'

824
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,221
I don't want you
cutting up my son!

825
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,663
You're right.
I'm sorry.

826
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:47,200
I‐I'll leave you alone.

827
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:06,352
Focus, Henry.

828
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:09,656
‐ What do you hear?
‐ Uh.

829
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,193
‐ Uh, I'm not, I'm not‐‐
‐ What do you hear?

830
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:14,761
‐ I'm not sure.
‐ This man has pneumothorax.

831
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,396
Come over here, I'll show you
how to put in a chest tube.

832
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:18,699
‐ I'll grab a tray.
‐ It hurts.

833
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:20,601
Yeah, I bet it hurts.

834
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,068
Hang on there, buddy,
and everything

835
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:24,671
will feel better
in just a minute.

836
00:33:24,705 --> 00:33:26,773
Okay, Henry, first thing
that you wanna do

837
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,075
is feel for the ribs

838
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:32,145
along the mid‐axillary line
locating the fifth interspace..

839
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,815
Can I get some Betadine?

840
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,817
...where you make the incision.

841
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,420
‐ I‐I‐I'm not feeling so good.
‐ What?

842
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,556
‐ Not feeling so good.
‐ Sit down.

843
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:44,558
Put your head
between your knees.

844
00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:46,527
Lily, give me the Kelly.

845
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:49,730
How you doing, Henry?

846
00:33:51,832 --> 00:33:55,368
Lydia, do me a favor,
slide Henry out of the way.

847
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,470
Carter,
he's a little cyanotic.

848
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,439
What?

849
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,107
Can't get a pulse
on the banger.

850
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:03,343
Lydia, call an attending!

851
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:04,811
Change the dressing
twice a day

852
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:07,581
and think twice before
defending any sky divers.

853
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:08,849
Thank you, doc.

854
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,416
Hey, Mark, we need you
in trauma one.

855
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,719
Anna, Malik,
we may need your help.

856
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,259
‐ What happened?
‐ Banger had a tension pneumo.

857
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:20,493
Henry passed out.

858
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:22,663
Alright, I'll finish
the chest tube.

859
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:24,430
Get your student
into trauma two.

860
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:27,233
Okay. Henry, you're gonna be
just fine.

861
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:28,635
Alright, everybody grab hold.

862
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:31,772
On my count.
One, two, three.

863
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:33,373
‐ What happened?
‐ I don't know.

864
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,675
I was showing him
how to put in a chest tube

865
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,276
and he just fainted.

866
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,445
‐ Get on the other side.
‐ Wheezes bilaterally.

867
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,414
‐ Pulse ox is 86.
‐ I need to intubate.

868
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,584
Chuny, give me a laryngoscope.
Come on, let's go!

869
00:34:43,617 --> 00:34:45,385
Did he complain
of feeling sick?

870
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,420
He's always complaining.
He's a hypochondriac.

871
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,523
‐ Is he on any meds?
‐ Not that I know of.

872
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:52,225
Okay, let's get a CBC,
chem 20 and a tox screen.

873
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:54,861
Alright, I'm in.

874
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,763
‐ Bag him.
‐ Pulse ox is worse.

875
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,565
‐ Down to 82.
‐ What?

876
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,801
‐ Get a blood gas.
‐ Pressure's crashing!

877
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,269
What the hell's going on?

878
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:05,772
His wrist is red, his left hand
is red and edematous.

879
00:35:05,806 --> 00:35:07,473
Right hand's also swollen.

880
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:09,610
Oh! Oh, my God.
He's allergic to latex.

881
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:10,844
Okay.

882
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:12,412
He's in asystole!

883
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,380
Amp of Epi IV push!

884
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:16,850
ET tube cuff has latex.
We've got to extubate.

885
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:19,419
Lily, get me an ET tube
from the latex‐free cart.

886
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:20,887
'Wash your hands first.'

887
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:22,756
'Chuny, do me a favor,
get me a basin of water.'

888
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,390
Found a non‐latex ET tube.

889
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:26,527
Give me a mg of Atropine
and 50 of Benadryl!

890
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:30,631
Laryngeal edema. I'm having
a hard time getting in.

891
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:31,798
How long has he been down?

892
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:33,333
‐ 'Thirty seconds.'
‐ Damn it.

893
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,668
‐ Watch his teeth.
‐ I know.

894
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:36,302
‐ Can you see the cords?
‐ Barely.

895
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:38,905
Alright, Malik,
high‐dose Epi 7 CCs!

896
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:43,910
You're doing great, just keep
sliding it in, very gently.

897
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:47,180
‐ I'm in!
‐ Great, good job, good job.

898
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,448
'Got a pulse.'

899
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,183
‐ Whoa!
‐ Everything okay here?

900
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,152
Everything's under control.

901
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:56,189
Peter, I'd like
to speak to you.

902
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:59,826
Oh, yeah, I'd like
to speak to you as well.

903
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,461
Um.

904
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:03,530
Uh, I've been reconsidering
the possibility

905
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,498
of joining your team.

906
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:08,669
Hmm.

907
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:11,938
I understand Mr. Price
refused an autopsy on his son.

908
00:36:11,972 --> 00:36:13,740
Did you try everything
to convince him?

909
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:16,242
He doesn't want us
carving his boy.

910
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:18,444
You explain to him how our
research might benefit others?

911
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:19,946
He doesn't want it.

912
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,248
Give him some time.
He's emotional.

913
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,520
I don't feel comfortable
doing that.

914
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,491
How do you think we made
advances in heart surgery?

915
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:33,393
In transplantation?

916
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:34,928
'By refining our procedures
on patients'

917
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:37,397
and then studying
the results.

918
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,799
That kid was a freak of nature

919
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:41,367
and we have a responsibility
to do research.

920
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,504
That freak was a little boy
named Rodney Price

921
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:45,739
whose father doesn't understand
why he lost his kid

922
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:48,474
and all you want to do is cut
him despite his father's wishes.

923
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:52,579
We're scientists, Peter.

924
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:53,947
'We're not allowed
sentimentality.'

925
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,551
Now, you go back
and get consent

926
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:58,819
because I want it.

927
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:00,987
No, you get somebody else
to do it.

928
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:05,258
I just got a lab report back

929
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,960
on one of my clinic patients,
a seven year old.

930
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,563
Turns out he's got
acute lymphocytic leukemia.

931
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:11,565
I thought maybe a doctor
should speak to the mother.

932
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:12,699
How did it present?

933
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,267
Kid's only complaint
was a numb chin.

934
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,002
I checked it in the computer
and ran some tests.

935
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:17,904
Well, the mom knows you,
why don't you talk to her.

936
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:20,574
Call me if she has
any questions.

937
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:25,646
And then I plea bargained her
down to a misdemeanor

938
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,548
not two weeks
after she shot a guy!

939
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,382
No.

940
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,484
Oh, Mark! Listen,
you could have saved yourself

941
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:33,353
a whole bunch of
urgent phone messages

942
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:34,921
if you'd have told me
Herb was on board.

943
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:36,456
'I didn't know
you two knew each other.'

944
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:37,758
Oh, yeah, I served on

945
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,626
the Trial Lawyers'
Banquet Committee last year.

946
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,361
Herb was our keynote speaker.

947
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:43,630
You know, I've been filling him
in on that law family suit.

948
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,566
Aah, you got yourself
quite a little mess, doc.

949
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,901
Yeah, I've decided
to ignore the whole thing.

950
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:50,804
Oh, wrong impulse.
You'll get slaughtered.

951
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:52,906
Listen, you better
file this right away

952
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:54,575
to avoid
a summary judgment.

953
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,810
Now, Mark, the hospital's board
of directors

954
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:58,645
is gonna be
very relieved to hear

955
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,947
that you have
such excellent representation.

956
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:03,517
You know, you came
about this close

957
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,819
to losing your job.

958
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:07,654
Listen, Herb, if you have

959
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:09,923
any questions at all,
please, just give me a call.

960
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,992
I shall, I shall.
Take care of yourself, Alan.

961
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:15,596
You too. Mark.

962
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:18,364
Why did you let Alan believe
that you're representing me?

963
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:20,567
Honestly, doc,
he's a lousy lawyer.

964
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,569
He jumps to conclusions.

965
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:25,071
Nevertheless,
I could represent you.

966
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:27,608
I think your fee would be
a little too steep for me.

967
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:30,511
Four hundred an hour
with a $10,000 retainer fee.

968
00:38:30,544 --> 00:38:31,678
Yeah, I figured.

969
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:34,380
But honestly
I don't need the money.

970
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:37,518
I'm bored.
I'm looking for new challenges.

971
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:40,486
Here's a deal.
Let me shadow you.

972
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:42,756
You throw in a couple
of procedures, nothing big

973
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:45,125
you know, maybe a couple
of stitches here and there.

974
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,828
And I'll make
your little lawsuit vanish

975
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:50,030
just like that, gratis.

976
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:58,404
I got an autopsy consent
on the Price boy.

977
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:01,141
The father just
needed more time.

978
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:03,076
Why didn't Rocket send you?

979
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:04,611
I refused.

980
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:05,912
That's a ballsy move, Peter.

981
00:39:05,946 --> 00:39:07,914
It wasn't a move.
I told him what I felt.

982
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:09,516
Well, it worked.

983
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,484
Take a look at tomorrow's
surgery schedule.

984
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:14,387
You're scrubbing in
on a lap splenectomy at 7 a. m.

985
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,090
Rocket's team.

986
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:19,392
He's partial to residents
with backbone.

987
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:25,999
J‐John?

988
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,568
Yes, Henry.

989
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:30,403
What happened?

990
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:33,907
You went into anaphylactic shock
from latex.

991
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,809
I‐I was near death.

992
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:37,143
Yes.

993
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,712
And you were there.

994
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:40,814
Yes, Henry, I was there.

995
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:42,783
And‐and so was Anna.

996
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:48,188
It‐it was like a dream.

997
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:49,556
Anna!

998
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:53,560
Hey, Henry.

999
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:58,031
It was the most amazing thing.

1000
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:01,768
I remember being drawn

1001
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:04,771
toward this bright light

1002
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:07,641
'and then suddenly I was'

1003
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:11,945
floating up above you..

1004
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:13,547
...over there..

1005
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,718
...in the corner..

1006
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,586
...watching..

1007
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,188
...as the two of you..

1008
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,657
...enveloped..

1009
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,227
...in a blue glow.

1010
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,130
Worked together..

1011
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:32,699
...united..

1012
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:35,869
...to save my life.

1013
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:39,806
Thank you, John.

1014
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,142
Thank you, Anna.

1015
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:46,947
You were my angels.

1016
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,049
You brought me back
to the living!

1017
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:00,611
Goodnight.

1018
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:02,252
Goodnight.

1019
00:41:02,286 --> 00:41:05,022
Can't be a chart
you're writing.

1020
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:06,757
‐ No.
‐ And from your expression.

1021
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,358
And the way
you're covering it up

1022
00:41:08,392 --> 00:41:10,394
I'd say
it's something personal.

1023
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,997
Yeah, it's, um..

1024
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,200
‐ It's a love letter.
‐ Oh!

1025
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:19,169
The sentimental kind

1026
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:22,039
or the I'd like to rip
your pants off kind?

1027
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:26,110
Definitely the latter.

1028
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:28,445
I'd like to be writing
one of those.

1029
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:30,014
Pity I broke up with Jeremy.

1030
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:31,415
Could've been more fun
long distance.

1031
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:34,118
‐ Someone from back home?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1032
00:41:34,151 --> 00:41:36,754
A self‐possessed dermatologist.

1033
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:39,523
I'm afraid
I broke his heart.

1034
00:41:39,556 --> 00:41:42,793
Well, it's 9 o'clock
and since you're writing

1035
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:44,895
rather than living out
your prose

1036
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:47,431
I'd venture to say
you're alone.

1037
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:48,799
Yeah.

1038
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:52,202
Fancy grabbing a drink?

1039
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:54,171
I would love to.

1040
00:41:56,874 --> 00:41:59,276
It is an unenviable job
running the ER

1041
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,046
and making difficult
cost‐cutting decisions.

1042
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,513
I got your message.

1043
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:07,885
Jeanie came in quite upset
about the budget

1044
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:10,254
and I was just
explaining that

1045
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:12,222
it appears that
you've treated her

1046
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:13,490
honestly and fairly.

1047
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:15,926
She gave herself
a $25,000 raise.

1048
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,828
That comes from
the administrative budget.

1049
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:21,198
I understand that's your story,
but I don't buy it.

1050
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:24,168
I think something else
is going on.

1051
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:26,170
And what would that be?

1052
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:27,337
My HIV status.

1053
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:29,339
Jeanie!

1054
00:42:29,373 --> 00:42:31,375
I believe that's why
I'm being fired.

1055
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:36,781
I see.

1056
00:42:38,182 --> 00:42:40,484
Well, um..

1057
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,253
Let's not do anything rash.

1058
00:42:43,287 --> 00:42:45,990
I am, uh, late
for a dinner at the moment

1059
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:49,126
but tomorrow
I can give the budget

1060
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:51,328
another more
thorough review.

1061
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,330
We have been over these figures
a dozen times.

1062
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,867
You told me
we had to cut PAs.

1063
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:58,268
Jeanie, why don't you give
Kerry and me

1064
00:42:58,302 --> 00:43:00,570
another day or two
to recheck our figures.

1065
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:02,572
Thank you, Dr. Anspaugh.
I will.

1066
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:13,417
Jeanie, you're really gonna use
your HIV status like this?

1067
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,119
I call it as I see it.

1068
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:17,855
I tried everything to keep
you here and then I bent over

1069
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:20,157
backwards to help you
get a job in Atlanta.

1070
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,026
It just isn't fair,
is it, Kerry?

1071
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:24,061
You know, I have never
discriminated against you

1072
00:43:24,094 --> 00:43:25,395
because of your HIV status.

1073
00:43:25,429 --> 00:43:27,231
I was the one who fought
to keep you here.

1074
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:30,234
Kerry, like you said before,
it's nothing personal.

1075
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,009
‐ To your health.
‐ Thank you.

1076
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:56,360
‐ Here.
‐ Oh! What have we here?

1077
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:57,461
What have we here?

1078
00:43:57,494 --> 00:43:59,663
Another present?

1079
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:02,099
Oh, it's beautiful.

1080
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:03,633
Should I try it on?

1081
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:05,602
‐ You can try it on later.
‐ Okay.

1082
00:44:12,342 --> 00:44:14,178
I dream of the taste
of your neck

1083
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:16,346
and the smell
of your hair on my pillow.

1084
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,381
You do?

1085
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:21,285
No, silly, you do.

1086
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:23,320
Did you really mean everything
you wrote in the letter?

1087
00:44:23,353 --> 00:44:26,090
Yeah, yeah, I did, it was, uh..

1088
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:27,557
I was homesick.

1089
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:34,198
Do you remember this afternoon
when I said that I will?

1090
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:36,333
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ I changed my mind, I won't.

1091
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:37,667
‐ You won't?
‐ Mm‐mm.

1092
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:39,036
Oh.

1093
00:44:40,237 --> 00:44:42,072
Not unless you go first.

1094
00:44:42,106 --> 00:44:43,307
Lie back.
