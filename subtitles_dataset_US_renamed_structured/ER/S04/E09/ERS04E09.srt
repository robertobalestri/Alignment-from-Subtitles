1
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,640
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,576
No one's ever gotten me
a real diamond before, Mark.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,245
How dare you accuse me
of trying to manipulate you?

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,346
I deserve better
than that.

5
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:15,315
Here's the deal.
Let me shadow you.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,750
Throw in a couple
of procedures

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,184
a couple of stitches
here and there

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,386
and I'll make
your little lawsuit vanish.

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,822
‐ It's Carol.
‐ What?

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,457
Carol Hathaway.
Now, you are sworn to secrecy.

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,259
I didn't mean to mislead you
about my family.

12
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,561
It's really not that big a deal.

13
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,495
You told me we had to cut PAs.

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,197
Jeanie, why don't you
give Kerry and me

15
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,366
another day or two
to recheck our figures?

16
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,501
I love you, Carol.

17
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,846
Hey, I didn't hear you get up.

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,447
Um, I didn't wanna wake you.

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,251
Where you going?

20
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,485
I gotta go
sign some papers.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,622
Your last day was yesterday,
wasn't it?

22
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,490
That's for unemployment.

23
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,760
Did you take a look
at the, uh, want ads?

24
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,629
‐ What's the point?
‐ We've been back for four days.

25
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,631
Al, all you've done
is look at the sports page.

26
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,800
Don't start, okay?

27
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,374
This, uh..

28
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,810
This Atlanta high‐rise job
is gonna come through.

29
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,281
I can feel it.

30
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,217
I left some chicken
in the fridge for lunch.

31
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,621
Don't know how long I'll be.

32
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,493
‐ Morning, Kerry.
‐ Hey, Don.

33
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,795
What is all this?

34
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,831
It's computer equipment
Dr. West is setting up

35
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,501
thank you, for the Synergix
Attending coverage.

36
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,604
Ah, well, your trial period's
a good idea.

37
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,839
Letting them show their stuff.

38
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,242
Listen, uh, any further
rumblings from Jeanie Boulet?

39
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,778
Well, yesterday was her last day
and she left without a word.

40
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,648
I think her threats just came
out of the heat of the moment.

41
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,217
Mm‐hmm, well, we certainly
don't need a PA alleging

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,186
that she was fired
because she was HIV positive.

43
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,523
Jeanie knows she was fired
for financial reasons.

44
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,790
If anyone questions at all

45
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,858
all they have to do
is look at the budget.

46
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,794
Mm‐hmm, hold that elevator.

47
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,631
You handled a difficult
situation very well, Kerry.

48
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,232
Thank you, Don.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,169
Hey, sweetie.

50
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,438
Boy, were you ever snoring
when I left this morning?

51
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,574
Shh!

52
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,943
Oh, poor baby.
You have a hangover?

53
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,878
I don't think I should have
had that fourth margarita.

54
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,381
You know, I went to go
put your present on

55
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,284
and when I came back,
you were out like a light.

56
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,219
‐ Oh, I missed the grand finale?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

57
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,589
You know, I think I need a B12
shot to keep up with you.

58
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,457
Well, you know what?

59
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,425
I got just what
the doctor ordered. Get up.

60
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,829
‐ Turn around.
‐ Easy, I could hurl.

61
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,265
Just keep your eyes closed.

62
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,503
‐ 'Why?'
‐ Just do as I say.

63
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,672
Don't be a pooper.
Stand there. Hold on.

64
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,273
'What's going on?'

65
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,741
Just don't turn around

66
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,376
and keep your eyes closed.

67
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,580
Okay.

68
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,582
Take two of these
and call me in the morning.

69
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,440
The interns have seen meningitis
in every kid with a runny nose.

70
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,775
I thought Doug
was coming back today.

71
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,577
Oh, he called.
His car broke down.

72
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,411
I mean, here.
He called here.

73
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,913
Mark and Cynthia are in there.

74
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,515
So?

75
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,050
Hey, what's going on in there?

76
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,818
Nothing.

77
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,053
Hi.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,454
Hi.

79
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,562
Jeanie, hey.

80
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,931
Uh, this is Harold Percy,
and this is Barbara Leeman.

81
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,600
‐ Hi. I'm Jeanie Boulet.
‐ Hi.

82
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,968
I filled them in
as best I could.

83
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,770
‐ Thanks.
‐ I gotta get to work.

84
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:30,771
Good luck.

85
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,007
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

86
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,476
‐ Decaf?
‐ Always.

87
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,812
Dr. Doyle said you were fired
from your PA job

88
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,681
because you are HIV positive.

89
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,749
Is that true?

90
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,751
Yes, I believe it's true.

91
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,087
I was reprimanded
for doing a life‐saving

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,556
procedure in a body cavity.

93
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,392
A few weeks later,
I was fired..

94
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,861
...and the hospital claims
it's budgetary reasons.

95
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,663
'Oh, they always give
other reasons.'

96
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,632
Were you ever
disciplined before?

97
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,068
No, never. Actually, I was
October's employee of the month.

98
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,605
'Oh, good, did you keep a log
of what was said?'

99
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,606
No.

100
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,676
‐ Is it too late to do anything?
‐ 'Not necessarily.'

101
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,078
We're going to outline
a protocol for you to follow.

102
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,015
I warn you,
it might get ugly.

103
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,417
I want my job back.

104
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,485
Hey, can I, can I
borrow a buck?

105
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,021
No.

106
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,789
See ya.

107
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,824
Here.

108
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,562
They, uh, say JFK never
carried any cash either.

109
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,834
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Keep the change.

110
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,102
‐ Thanks.
‐ 'Hey, Scooter.'

111
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,705
‐ Chase. Hey!
‐ Hey!

112
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,106
What are you doing here?

113
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,009
Uh, I came to see,
you know, the good doctor.

114
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,378
Anna, this is my cousin, Chase.

115
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,780
‐ Hi.
‐ This is Anna Del Amico.

116
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,815
We, uh,
we're interns together.

117
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,751
Oh, now I see why
you got into medicine.

118
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,087
Come on, gang.
We're behind on sutures.

119
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,522
‐ Anna, could you, um..
‐ Sure.

120
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,723
I'll get started on these,
Scooter.

121
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,527
Hmm. Nice.

122
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,428
So, what's up?

123
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,532
I, uh, I escaped to the vineyard
for Thanksgiving.

124
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,000
I was..

125
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,970
...hauling, um, firewood
when a spider got me.

126
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,071
Oh, man!

127
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,042
Dr. Greene, hello.

128
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,778
‐ Ellis West.
‐ Hi.

129
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,646
I'm an SPG doctor.

130
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,047
Uh, Synergix Physicians Group.

131
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,818
Good for you.

132
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,754
Listen, doc,
whatever your misgivings

133
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,857
when the SPG attendings start
backing you up next week

134
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,793
it will make your job
a lot easier.

135
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,494
You are preaching
to the choir, okay?

136
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,630
Less work is fine with me.

137
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,765
Good, then I'll just set up
and stay out of your way.

138
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,035
Kerry, uh, this is Dr. West.

139
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,970
Oh, hi.
We know each other.

140
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,138
‐ How are you?
‐ Good.

141
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,607
What's all this?

142
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,042
This is the Wertz
dictation system.

143
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,744
You dictate on the fly.

144
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,145
It gives you verbal prompts.

145
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,047
Here, this you put
on your belt.

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,617
Puts everything
on a floppy.

147
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,051
And this is the, uh, earpiece?

148
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,686
It's the earpiece
and the microphone.

149
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,854
Well..

150
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,888
Okay.

151
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,128
I don't know how my mom ever
kept these things straight.

152
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,496
Cynthia, this is awkward
for me

153
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,699
but, um,
it's my job to tell you.

154
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:16,036
Some people find certain things
in the work place inappropriate.

155
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,771
Like sex in the lounge so..

156
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,141
We didn't have sex
in the lounge.

157
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,578
I was just trying to cheer up
three of the seven dwarves.

158
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,581
‐ What?
‐ Grumpy, Sleepy and Doc.

159
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,849
Mark's all three.

160
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:35,121
Just, um, a little
more discretion, okay?

161
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,157
'What's the matter
with you?'

162
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,792
You should be happy
that he's happy.

163
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,967
Jeanie, I thought
your last day was yesterday.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,869
Nope, I'm gonna
keep working here.

165
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,270
Didn't Weaver lay you off?

166
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,972
I'm not accepting it.

167
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,473
You go ahead, girl.

168
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,145
Hello! That smarts.

169
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,782
Sorry.

170
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,152
Hey, we missed you
at Thanksgiving dinner.

171
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,755
At least until
that third round of martinis.

172
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,191
‐ Was gramps after you?
‐ About what?

173
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,861
He's back trolling the gene pool
for another successor.

174
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,863
We've been through this, Chase.

175
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,999
You're done. You're gonna
need IV antibiotics.

176
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,202
You're still his first choice.

177
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,104
Eliot's in Thailand,
A. C.'s too lazy.

178
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,806
‐ Barbara's..
‐ Barbara.

179
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,808
Barbara.

180
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,711
What about you? You're already
an exec with the company.

181
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,278
He knows your work.

182
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,314
That's why he wants you.

183
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,216
Now, why can't anybody
just accept the fact

184
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,584
that I'm a doctor?

185
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,854
It's like my photography, or..

186
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,723
...A.C.'s summer stock.

187
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,024
Gramps just..

188
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,826
...sees them as phases.

189
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,295
All the little chickens
will come home to roost.

190
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,531
Not me.

191
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,335
Hi. I'm Dr. Weaver.
What's the problem?

192
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,604
I'm having a sickle cell crisis

193
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,706
and somebody stole my Percodans
at the bus station.

194
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,209
Where's your pain?

195
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,646
It's like having a migraine
all over.

196
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,681
'Mr. Jackson says the pain
is ten out of ten.'

197
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,082
Pulse and temp are normal.

198
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,785
My pulse and temperature
don't usually go up.

199
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,354
I need 250 of Demerol
as soon as possible.

200
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,889
That's a big dose.

201
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,858
I know me.

202
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,960
I need to break the cycle now.

203
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,095
BP's normal, 130/80.

204
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,930
Let's run in two liters
of saline.

205
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,165
O2, six liters.

206
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,868
Draw a CBC
with a retic count

207
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,370
and give him 60 of Toradol.

208
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,105
I'm allergic to it.

209
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,774
‐ Two of Stadol, then.
‐ That too.

210
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,909
I'm telling you
Demerol's all I can take, okay?

211
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,010
Who's your doctor?

212
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,379
I go to the Pontiac Clinic.

213
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,882
Okay, give him 50 of Demerol IV.

214
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,851
Repeat once in 15 minutes, PRN.

215
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,286
50 won't touch me, miss.

216
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,989
Give the medication
a chance to work, Mr. Jackson.

217
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,023
I need 250.

218
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,759
Let's call the clinic and see.

219
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,698
Rollover TC.
Daughter was seat‐belted.

220
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,266
Mom wasn't. Mother's shocky.
Chest and abdominal trauma.

221
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,069
BP's 80 palp, pulse 140.

222
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,706
Daughter's BP is 90/50.
Pulse 120.

223
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,140
Left leg's badly mangled
and pulseless.

224
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,142
‐ Massive blood loss on scene.
‐ Okay.

225
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,777
Anna, you're with me
in trauma two.

226
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,045
I'll take this one.

227
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,016
‐ Need a hand?
‐ Thanks.

228
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,150
Why don't you check her leg?

229
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,185
Everybody, this is Dr. West.

230
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,821
‐ My mom's calling me.
‐ I'm sorry.

231
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,322
‐ What?
‐ Where's my mom?

232
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,957
She's next door with Dr. Greene.

233
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,126
BP's down. 90/50, pulse 120.

234
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,896
Open saline wide.
CBC, type and cross for four.

235
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,032
Chest, C‐spine,
pelvis and left femur.

236
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,433
‐ Don't touch my leg.
‐ Get some pressure on it.

237
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,135
ABD pads.

238
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,903
We wear trauma gear
in the trenches these days.

239
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,105
Too late now.
Leg's pulseless.

240
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,741
Massive bone
and tissue loss.

241
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:41,942
Probably gonna
have to be amputated.

242
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,310
Is my mom okay?

243
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,879
That sounds
like a larynx fracture.

244
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,081
‐ Does your neck hurt?
‐ Mmm.

245
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,751
‐ I think you're right, Ellis.
‐ Alright, what have we got?

246
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:51,918
I'll make room
for the cavalry.

247
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,119
Thanks for your help.

248
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,154
Rollover TC.

249
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,455
She's hypotensive

250
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,990
'with an open femur'

251
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,258
'and a possible
larynx fracture.'

252
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,826
‐ Her mom's in two.
‐ Okay.

253
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,027
Are you having
trouble breathing?

254
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,763
‐ Am I gonna die?
‐ Alright now.

255
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,164
Listen, we're not gonna
let that happen, alright?

256
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,232
‐ 'Set up intubation.'
‐ Mind if I take her?

257
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,703
Sure, you take this.
I'm gonna go check next door.

258
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,238
‐ 'Ally, oh, please.'
‐ Hook her to the Thora‐Seal.

259
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,775
‐ How's she doing?
‐ Please, God, Allison.

260
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,476
DPL's grossly positive too.

261
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,978
I'm losing a pulse.

262
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,780
‐ She's arresting.
‐ Here's more O‐neg.

263
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,015
‐ Pump in four more.
‐ Start CPR. I'll intubate.

264
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,017
She's flatline.
I'll cross‐clamp the aorta.

265
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,151
Thoracotomy tray. Let's go.

266
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,022
'Hang two more and bag her.'

267
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,457
Let's get an abdominal CT
and finish the X‐rays upstairs.

268
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,293
If we hurry, maybe
we can save her leg.

269
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,828
‐ Do they need me in two?
‐ No.

270
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,162
There are three docs in there.

271
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,298
Stat page Dr. Romano
to the OR.

272
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,866
‐ Dr. Weaver.
‐ 'Hmm.'

273
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,935
I'm glad you reconsidered
the PA cutbacks.

274
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,270
‐ What are you talking about?
‐ Jeanie, she just clocked in.

275
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,773
Kerry, that sickle cell
guy's had 100

276
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,074
of Demerol, says
it hasn't touched him.

277
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,743
Yeah, did you call
the Pontiac Clinic?

278
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,077
I tried.
Number's not in service.

279
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,013
Why am I not surprised?

280
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,916
Crit and retic count okay.
White count's normal.

281
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,084
What's the problem
with you people?

282
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,120
I need more Demerol.

283
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,888
Run in the rest of the saline.

284
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,257
Give him four tabs of codeine
to go and street him.

285
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,226
This should be interesting.

286
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,293
‐ What?
‐ Look.

287
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,164
‐ May I speak with you?
‐ Sure.

288
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,332
Just keep taking deep breaths.

289
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,269
‐ What are you doing?
‐ I'm working.

290
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,872
No, you're not, you've been
terminated, you're off payroll

291
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,041
and you're not covered
by malpractice insurance.

292
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,809
Alright, alright, I won't see
any more patients

293
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,111
but I'm staying.

294
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,947
Jeanie, don't humiliate
yourself by being

295
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,181
forcibly removed
from the premises.

296
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,450
You do what you need to do,
Kerry.

297
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,018
I'll do what I need to do.

298
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,563
Time of death, 12:07.

299
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,397
We have to tell her daughter.

300
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,199
She went right from CT To OR.

301
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,333
I'll take care of it.

302
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,838
She was so worried
about her daughter.

303
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,447
Hey, Mark, how you doing?

304
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,216
Ah, today's the day
we save some lives.

305
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,186
I'm very excited.
Where's my scrubs?

306
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,188
Listen, we gotta kinda
be low key about this.

307
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,523
If anybody asks‐‐

308
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,057
I'm just,
I'm your attorney, okay?

309
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,492
I'm here to research
your work

310
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,460
so I can prepare
a proper defense.

311
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,830
‐ Sounds good.
‐ Look, calm down, okay?

312
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,298
I'm not expecting anything big,
maybe, you know

313
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,833
a couple of sutures
here and there.

314
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,268
Look, I cannot let you
practice medicine.

315
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,571
What are you talking about?
We had a deal.

316
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:26,940
I defend you in the civil
rights suit against you.

317
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,475
In exchange,
I play doctor for a day.

318
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,177
We'll see.

319
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,213
‐ How's my case going anyway?
‐ Where's my scrubs?

320
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,915
Look, I'll get you
your scrubs, okay?

321
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,550
Just try and do it
low profile.

322
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,852
Yeah, right. Listen,
don't worry about your case.

323
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,120
Right, it's gonna vanish
into thin air.

324
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,588
You made quite a deal
for yourself.

325
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:44,224
Have Dr. Anspaugh call me
as soon as he's free.

326
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,458
It's very important.

327
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,163
Hey, guys, how did it go?

328
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,498
Well, Marquis de Sade's
got nothing on Scooter.

329
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,467
Don't call me
that at work, okay?

330
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,603
‐ Marquis de Sade or Scooter?
‐ That's funny.

331
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,404
‐ Oh!
‐ Wanna go to lunch at Shaw's?

332
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,940
I can't. I'm on duty.

333
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,341
Blow it off.

334
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,010
It's my job.
I can't just blow it off.

335
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,246
Okay, Dr. Schweitzer.
Just asking.

336
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,515
You see, my family think that
I'm just dabbling in medicine

337
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,283
till I come to my senses
and quit.

338
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,484
'Sounds like fun.'

339
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,657
Eddie, you bastard.
You're trying to kill me.

340
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,291
‐ Shut up, Darlene.
‐ See.

341
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,961
They're ganging up on me.

342
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,897
I can see the appeal. You should
come by the house sometime.

343
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,533
‐ We'll all party. Ciao.
‐ Like that's gonna happen.

344
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,535
I've got a couple of winners
for you, wife says hubby tried

345
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,336
to beat her up,
complains of pain all over.

346
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,906
Vitals and mental status normal,
never mind being plastered.

347
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,108
'You're going to jail, Darlene.'

348
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,411
Let me up.
I gotta pee.

349
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,114
ETOH, bump on the head,
contusions and abrasions.

350
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,049
'No complains of pain,
he says that the woman tried'

351
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,985
'to run him over, and no LOC,
vitals normal.'

352
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,353
‐ Oriented times three, GCS 15.
‐ You'll be alright, Eddie.

353
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,089
Okay, I'll take him,
you take her.

354
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,090
Okay.

355
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,258
Why the cuffs?

356
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,560
She's under arrest
for assault

357
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,328
with a deadly weapon,
pickup truck.

358
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,430
I was just trying to get away

359
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,100
and this son of a bitch
was chasing me.

360
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,535
He's on Eddie's side
'cause he works

361
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,504
with the police motor pool.

362
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,573
You wanna uncuff her
so I can examine her?

363
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,074
While she's here,
she's my patient.

364
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,976
No matter where she is,
she's my perp.

365
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,545
You wanna go on record
as interfering with the care

366
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,179
of a woman
with critical injuries?

367
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,247
For God's sake.

368
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,453
Were you trying
to kill yourself?

369
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,089
No, I‐I was just mad at Eddie,
that's all.

370
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,258
‐ Take any drugs?
‐ Me? Never.

371
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,193
I want a blood alcohol
and a drug screen.

372
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,095
‐ Will you excuse us?
‐ I want the tests.

373
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,430
I need to evaluate her first.

374
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,232
Maybe you could wait outside
while I examine her.

375
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,471
With the lung extrication,
there's been over two hours

376
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,173
of pulseless, warm ischemia.

377
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,342
She's got massive crush
injury to the leg.

378
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,045
Her abdominal CT is normal
and her vitals are stable.

379
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,981
Yeah, but with contamination,
bony loss and protracted shock

380
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,283
an above‐the‐knee amputation
is indicated.

381
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,185
I say we attempt
to save Allison's leg

382
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,521
with a vascularized
free fibular transfer.

383
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:55,989
That would be four hours
of anesthesia

384
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,257
on a limb
that's too far gone.

385
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,159
Look, face it,
at this point

386
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,061
a long surgery is too risky.

387
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,529
Do you know how to do
a fibular transfer?

388
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,430
‐ No, I don't.
‐ Okay, on three..

389
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,632
Is that why you think
I shouldn't do it?

390
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,400
‐ Have you ever done one?
‐ No.

391
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,335
But she's a good candidate
for an aggressive approach.

392
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,637
Oh, no, you mean,
she's a good guinea pig

393
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,238
for you to practice on.

394
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,040
Oh, don't be so dramatic, Peter.
She's a young woman.

395
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,642
She deserves a chance
to keep her leg.

396
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,210
Got a hot one, eh, Lizzie?

397
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,378
Couldn't ask
for a better candidate

398
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,780
for a free fib transfer.

399
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,314
Wait till you see her
in action, Peter.

400
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,086
So, you worked something out
with Jeanie?

401
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,288
No, she's fired,
but she's protesting

402
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,323
and I'm trying to get legal
to deal with it

403
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,793
but Anspaugh's been
in a closed‐door meeting.

404
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,728
Man, glad I don't have your job.

405
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,431
No.

406
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,233
We'll go to trial.

407
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,403
Irv, my client's willing
to lose 100 Gs

408
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,671
rather than settle, okay?

409
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,341
No, no, no.
It's your move, Irv.

410
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,678
Oh, baby.

411
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:54,548
‐ What's this about 100 grand?
‐ It's not about you.

412
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,583
Uh, could you maybe
give me some specifics

413
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,251
on how you're planning
to defend me?

414
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,721
‐ Wh‐where do we change from?
‐ This way.

415
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,488
How about telling me
a little bit about my defense?

416
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,290
What's there to tell?
We're going to kill 'em.

417
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,493
We'll go for assault
with a deadly weapon

418
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,763
but, hey, no caving this time,
right, buddy?

419
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,331
Go for it, Billy.

420
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,099
‐ Kill the bitch.
‐ Right.

421
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,335
Sounds like you boys
have it all worked out.

422
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,639
Stick to the medicine.
I'll handle the law enforcement.

423
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,340
Your X‐rays are normal, sir.

424
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,275
You'll be back to battering
in no time.

425
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,711
What? Battering?
We scuffled is all.

426
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,379
Did your wife
lose consciousness

427
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,414
at any time
after she was assaulted?

428
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,416
Hey, she tried to kill me.

429
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,652
No, I don't wanna.

430
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,720
‐ Get off of me.
‐ Come on, nurse.

431
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:36,189
‐ Just draw the blood.
‐ Hey, what are you doing?

432
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,258
Nobody's drawing this woman's
blood without her permission.

433
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,460
This is constitutionally
permissible search.

434
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,262
Delay will result
in loss of evidence.

435
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,396
She's bradying down.

436
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,365
‐ 'Pulse 39.'
‐ 'Darlene.'

437
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,367
She might have taken drugs
and been afraid to tell us.

438
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,437
‐ She wouldn't lie.
‐ Let's give her .5 of atropine.

439
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,406
Let's pump her stomach.
Ewald tube.

440
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,208
‐ I want those tests.
‐ Get a warrant.

441
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,210
You've got one coming, okay?

442
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,712
We better get Greene
to back us up on this.

443
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,181
I don't need any backup.
I know my rights and hers.

444
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,416
Alright, Darlene, I want you
to try and swallow this tube.

445
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,523
Afternoon.

446
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,457
Hey, hello, doctor.

447
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,499
‐ Herb Spivak.
‐ Uh, Maggie Doyle.

448
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,667
Are you a Synergix attending?

449
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,705
What do we have here?

450
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:28,308
Oh, partial extensor
tendon laceration.

451
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,311
You best treat that with
irrigation and, uh, debridement

452
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,246
and give it a couple
of loose sutures

453
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,248
and a, a splint
and you'll be fine.

454
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,550
Herb, why don't you come
with me?

455
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,685
‐ 'Thanks.'
‐ How did you know that?

456
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,221
I hired a doctor for a couple
of weeks from an emergency room

457
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,156
for 100 bucks an hour,
he told me everything.

458
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,326
Blood gases, chest tubes,
peritoneal gavage‐‐

459
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,461
Uh, lavage,
peritoneal lavage.

460
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,296
Uh, oui, oui, lavage.

461
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,833
‐ Why don't you sit down?
‐ Uh, what's that?

462
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,635
Uh, I'd like you to practice
your suturing on this.

463
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,169
‐ Pig's foot?
‐ Yeah.

464
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,604
Okay. Which ones?

465
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,774
Um, running, uh, vertical,
interrupted, deep thermal?

466
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,442
‐ Why don't you try all of 'em?
‐ Okay.

467
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,177
Uh, this won't be
but a moment, okay?

468
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,479
‐ Alright.
‐ Hey, Mark.

469
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,582
Hey, welcome back.
How did it go?

470
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,451
Well, it's a long drive from
Flagstaff in an old Cadillac.

471
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,686
It's nice to spend
some time alone.

472
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,187
‐ Where's Carol?
‐ I don't know.

473
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,856
‐ Doug.
‐ Oh, are we glad to see you.

474
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:19,560
Otitis, rhinitis
and gastroenteritis.

475
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:20,927
Ah, it's nice to be loved.

476
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,796
Hey, Doug, how..

477
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,297
‐ Hey.
‐ Hello. How are you?

478
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,199
Um, good, I'm gonna get
right to work on these

479
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,868
I guess. It's good to see
all of you.

480
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,273
Hi. You all done?

481
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,776
Yeah, the system is up.

482
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,779
I usually don't get so hands‐on
with patients anymore.

483
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,514
Well, I'd prefer blood
on my shirt

484
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,649
to a staff mutiny any day.

485
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,751
Well, it sounds like you could
use a little R&R.

486
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,954
How's a week
in St. Bart's sound?

487
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:49,756
St. Bart's?
In the Caribbean?

488
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,559
Yeah, Synergix conference
is there next week.

489
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,895
You could give a paper on..

490
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,997
...inner‐city ER Management.

491
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,865
We'd take care
of your airfare and expenses.

492
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,767
Why?

493
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,769
Well, a doctor
with leadership qualities

494
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:03,970
is a very valuable asset.

495
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,010
It's a real offer.
You think about it.

496
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,311
I will. Thanks.

497
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,446
I'll be at the Ritz‐Carlton.

498
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:15,682
Okay.

499
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:21,354
‐ Hey, Doug.
‐ Hey.

500
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,624
So, how was it,
meeting your father's in‐laws?

501
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:25,659
I'm glad I did it,
but it was hard.

502
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,594
Sherry's death
hit them really bad.

503
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:29,362
‐ That was her name. Sherry.
‐ Listen.

504
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,665
I'd‐I'd like you to see
a depressed, anhedonic girl

505
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,300
complaining of loss
of appetite and insomnia.

506
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,769
She's in exam room three.

507
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,003
Psych take a look at her?

508
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:38,739
I'd like you
to evaluate it first.

509
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,007
‐ Hey, good to see you, doc.
‐ Yeah, feel like I never left.

510
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,381
Hey.

511
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,450
What?

512
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:52,886
Mark Greene.

513
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,355
Mmm, come here, you.

514
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,527
So now you've had a loss
of appetite and insomnia

515
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,462
because of me?

516
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,797
I'm surprised I lived.

517
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,365
Well, sounds serious.

518
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,601
Mmm, shut up and kiss me.

519
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,402
‐ Okay.
‐ Mmm.

520
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,507
Carol, do I collate
these clinic charts..

521
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,376
Oops!

522
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:19,045
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

523
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,754
Doc, what do you think?

524
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:28,955
Hey, not bad.

525
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:30,591
I love that running stitch.

526
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,325
‐ Yeah, that's good.
‐ Hey, Dr. Greene.

527
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:34,460
If the, uh, police need
evidence, like a blood test

528
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,030
and the patient refuses
to give it, what do I do?

529
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:40,701
Medical personnel can decline
to collect physical evidence

530
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,869
where the subject is unconscious

531
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:47,040
or indicates his or her refusal
to consent to the procedure.

532
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,676
The People versus O'Neal, 1993.

533
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,044
‐ Herb Spivak.
‐ John Carter.

534
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,013
‐ Thank you, Dr. Spivak.
‐ You need a consult?

535
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:55,982
No, he doesn't.
Uh, hey, listen, Herb.

536
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:57,884
That was not very low profile.

537
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,352
Well, I was being a lawyer.
What's the big deal?

538
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,054
Offering a consult?

539
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,624
‐ Listen, why don't you start‐‐
‐ I'm ready.

540
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,892
Jeanie.

541
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:08,461
If Yosh needs a doctor,
he can ask for one.

542
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,030
I'll be right in.

543
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,765
‐ I cannot allow this.
‐ Okay.

544
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,066
What are you doing?

545
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,135
I am just logging the fact
that at 2:30

546
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,671
I was prohibited
from treating an ankle injury.

547
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,373
‐ Chuny, call security.
‐ It's Anspaugh.

548
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,675
‐ Finally.
‐ No, it's not for you.

549
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,876
'He wants to talk to Jeanie.'

550
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,515
Yes?

551
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,783
Alright, I'll be right up.

552
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,790
I'm gonna take
this tube out now.

553
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:40,160
Blood alcohol's pretty high.
270.

554
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,427
Is she coming around?

555
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,630
Yeah, she's perking up..

556
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:44,731
...since she puked.

557
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:50,871
Let's see.
No pill fragments though.

558
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:54,775
‐ Here comes that cop.
‐ Here's your warrant, smartass.

559
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,877
‐ Now draw the damn blood.
‐ Let me read it first.

560
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,645
Is that her stomach contents?
I want that too.

561
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,781
Does that warrant specify
stomach contents?

562
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,115
It doesn't matter.
Give it here.

563
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,617
Oh, no, you don't.

564
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,056
That's destroying evidence, pal.

565
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,559
‐ You're under arrest.
‐ You can't arrest me.

566
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,895
‐ What? You can't arrest him.
‐ Watch me.

567
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,663
You have the right
to remain silent.

568
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,732
‐ Where you taking him?
‐ Jail.

569
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,433
You've the right to the presence
of an attorney.

570
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:21,702
Carter's getting arrested.

571
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,103
‐ Anything you say..
‐ For what?

572
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,471
For protecting
the doctor‐patient privilege.

573
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:28,542
Look, officer, uh, Dr. Carter
is an inexperienced intern.

574
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,644
If he did anything rashly,
uh, we can work this..

575
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,045
Carter, what did you do?

576
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,681
I stood up for my patient's
civil liberties.

577
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:37,518
Don't worry, this will be
taken care of in no time.

578
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:39,152
So what's the charge?

579
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,721
Obstruction of justice.

580
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,772
Her HIV status
defines Miss Boulet

581
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,107
as a person
in a protected class

582
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:04,010
and her firing constitutes
an adverse action

583
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,478
by the hospital.

584
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:06,980
Her layoff was budgetary.

585
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,249
We would argue
that was pretext.

586
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,952
'And ignoring your progressive
disciplinary policy'

587
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:16,156
'and firing an exemplary
employee after one incident'

588
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,692
proves discriminatory intent.

589
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,497
Why don't you take a seat,
Kerry?

590
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,132
I don't wanna take a seat.

591
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,273
If you're reinstated,
you'll let the matter drop?

592
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,741
Yes.

593
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,013
Well..

594
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:43,116
We'll have an answer
for you today.

595
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,250
We appreciate your time.

596
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,827
We can't cave in to this.

597
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,762
It's blackmail.

598
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:57,263
Our only option..

599
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,800
...is to hire her back.

600
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,568
The media would swarm all over

601
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:02,703
a federal case like this.

602
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:03,937
You know what,
you pushed me to make

603
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,539
the cutback.
What about the budget?

604
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:08,041
Her PA salary is nothing
compared to the risk

605
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,143
of the countless pain
and emotional suffering

606
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,546
lawsuits from the patients
she treated.

607
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,715
Do you know what
this will do to my authority?

608
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:16,149
Well, you're strong, Kerry.

609
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:19,252
You'll survive.

610
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,257
This femoral defect measures
at least 13 centimeters.

611
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,160
We're pushing the envelope
on fibular transfer.

612
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,795
She's throwing PVCs.

613
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:29,896
I'll push fluids
and start lidocaine.

614
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:35,969
Remove the distal clamp
from the femoral artery slowly.

615
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,838
It's back‐filled.

616
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,172
The anastomosis looks dry.

617
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,741
Excellent.

618
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:42,108
Does she know about her mother?

619
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:44,244
No, she was put under
before her mom died.

620
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,747
'Poor girl.
Release proximally.'

621
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,649
Alright, arterial flow's
restored.

622
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:49,783
Toes are pinking up.

623
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:51,284
Pressure's heading south.

624
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,820
‐ 'Map's down to 70.'
‐ Maybe we should bail.

625
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:54,921
I'm almost there.
Let's finish.

626
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:58,191
Alright, give her two more units
of packed cells.

627
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,326
‐ Let's pick it up, Lizzie.
‐ Pickup.

628
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,327
Metz.

629
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,166
Here's the, uh,
police district phone number.

630
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,168
Great, thanks, oh,
Cynthia, my daughter

631
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:10,003
is getting dropped off
for a dental appointment.

632
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,337
Can you come find me
when she gets here?

633
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,974
Rachel? I can't wait
to meet her.

634
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,241
Alright, well,
call me back then.

635
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,077
‐ Was that legal?
‐ Yeah.

636
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,045
‐ So, what did they say to do?
‐ Well, they're finding out.

637
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,014
It's not everyday
that interns are arrested.

638
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,949
Cop's leaving.
She's all ours.

639
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:24,084
What happened?

640
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:29,222
'Oh, baby, please forgive me.'

641
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,757
It's never gonna happen again.

642
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,258
'You almost killed me, Dee Dee.'

643
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:34,094
‐ Carter went to jail for this?
‐ 'My mind just snapped.'

644
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:35,862
'My‐my foot hit the gas.'

645
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:37,330
'You know how crazy
I get when we fight.'

646
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:43,403
Is this really necessary?

647
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,738
Let's say
it's a tradition.

648
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:48,174
You know, Superintendent
Rodriguez is a..

649
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,943
He's a family friend,
if you just give him a call

650
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,912
I'm sure we could clear up
this whole misunderstanding.

651
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,079
Over here.

652
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,250
Don't I get a, uh,
a phone call?

653
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,852
‐ I get a phone call.
‐ Nah.

654
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,921
Just a blindfold
and a cigarette.

655
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,255
‐ What?
‐ You'll get everything.

656
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,323
Don't worry.

657
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:04,357
Look here.

658
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:06,860
'No smiling.'

659
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:10,230
‐ Hey, Doug.
‐ What's going on?

660
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,432
This sickle cell guy
Weaver turfed, he's back

661
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,235
and I can't tell if he's a
junkie or he's in a real crisis.

662
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:17,403
‐ Okay, alright.
‐ 'Get a doctor in here.'

663
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,207
'I'm in pain.
Hurry up.'

664
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,411
I'm Dr. Ross. Just get
his vitals and start an IV.

665
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,747
Sit back, will you, please?

666
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,282
You're gonna give me
some Demerol.

667
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,751
Is that what works for you?

668
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:32,853
Yeah, yeah,
but nobody believes me.

669
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:35,321
What do you think
caused this crisis?

670
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:38,324
No, I'm stressed,
I'm trying to get home to..

671
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:41,161
...um, my, to KC
for my sister's wedding, right?

672
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,796
And‐and somebody stole
my pain pills.

673
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:43,830
They take everything?

674
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:45,866
Yeah, they took everything, man.

675
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,702
Will you give me, will you
give me some Demerol, please?

676
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,203
I'll tell you what I' gonna do.

677
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,172
I'll make you better
but we'll do it my way, okay?

678
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:53,807
‐ Alright.
‐ Vitals are normal.

679
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,176
Start an IV.
Five of Dilaudid.

680
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,944
Then three every ten minutes
till he doesn't feel

681
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,746
any more pain,
while she's medicating you

682
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,982
we're gonna try something,
alright?

683
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,483
I want you to close your eyes,
I want you

684
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,118
to think of a place
that makes you feel calm.

685
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:06,720
‐ Oh, c‐come on, man.
‐ Hey!

686
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,723
I'm trusting you.
You gotta trust me, okay?

687
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,124
‐ Close your eyes.
‐ Alright.

688
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,458
‐ Think of a place.
‐ Alright, um..

689
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:14,895
A place, uh..

690
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:16,930
My‐my granny's kitchen.

691
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:19,299
Okay, good.

692
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:21,101
‐ Close them. Close them.
‐ I can't do this.

693
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,103
‐ Yes, you can.
‐ No.

694
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,771
‐ Breathe slow.
‐ It hurts.

695
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:29,075
Hmm.

696
00:28:31,512 --> 00:28:33,213
‐ Hey, any word on Carter?
‐ Nope.

697
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:34,748
Dr. Greene said
the hospital lawyers

698
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,816
can't even find out
where he is.

699
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,151
Uh‐oh.

700
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:42,455
You have your PA position back

701
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,925
retroactive to your clock‐in
time this morning.

702
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:49,863
Then I'll get back to work.

703
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,532
There's a hand lac
in the suture room for you.

704
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,166
Thank you.

705
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,200
Hey, uh, Jeanie, let me know
if you need anything.

706
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,002
I will.

707
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,338
You know, and I know this was
not about your HIV status.

708
00:28:58,371 --> 00:29:00,240
Do I?

709
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:02,075
'The last pin is seated.'

710
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,109
Can we get out now?

711
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:06,212
‐ What's going on?
‐ 'I don't know.'

712
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:10,416
She's desatting. Pulse ox
is down to 92 on 100 percent.

713
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,953
Ex‐fix is on.
Bring her up.

714
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:14,988
‐ Cut the anesthetic.
‐ Run of eight.

715
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,891
Damn! 50 of lidocaine.

716
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:20,026
‐ T waves have flipped.
‐ Bottom's falling out.

717
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,361
Pulse ox 88.

718
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,831
She's crumping.
She's in fib. Crash cart.

719
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,299
‐ Alright.
‐ Charge her to 200.

720
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,400
Let's move! Come on.

721
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,036
Off!

722
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:33,507
Three hundred. Off.

723
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,509
'We gotta crack her chest
and get to that embolus.'

724
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:37,477
Three sixty. Off.

725
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:39,212
'Forget it, Peter.
Lizzie, start CPR.'

726
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,116
Get on it, Corday.

727
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,217
'Sternal saw.
Sternal saw.'

728
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:53,493
'She's out.'

729
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:56,029
Uh, l‐let me provide
the counter‐traction, Mark.

730
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,531
I want a nurse to do it.

731
00:29:57,564 --> 00:30:00,466
L‐let me just hold her arm
while you reduce it.

732
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,403
Hey, Mark, hey, come on, man,
I'm not getting anything.

733
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:06,873
We had a deal.
You're not giving me anything.

734
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:07,908
Alright, grab her arm.

735
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:12,946
Now, just hold the arm tight
while I pull. You ready?

736
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,314
‐ Yeah.
‐ And go.

737
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:16,382
Whoa!

738
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,585
It popped right back in.
What did you do?

739
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:20,420
Did you pronate
and externally rotate?

740
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:22,388
Uh‐uh. In‐line traction.

741
00:30:22,422 --> 00:30:25,626
‐ Mark, Rachel's at the desk.
‐ Oh, right.

742
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,028
Can you order post‐reduction
films on Mrs. Miller?

743
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,863
Got it.

744
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:31,131
Hey, what happened to Jeanie?

745
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,233
Dr. Anspaugh gave her
her job back.

746
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,135
Oh, how does Kerry
feel about that?

747
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,269
She's pissed.

748
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,108
Hi, sweetheart.

749
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,377
‐ So, you two have met?
‐ Oh, we're old friends by now.

750
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,580
Now, how could she be
wearing the jodhpurs

751
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:47,948
'with that bubble butt?'

752
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:49,215
'Maybe she has a bell'

753
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:51,351
'that dings
whenever she backs up?'

754
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:52,553
'You mean, like this?'

755
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:55,321
Ding! Ding! Ding!

756
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,023
Well, I think she looks hip.

757
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:59,225
Oh, yeah, dad. Sure.

758
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,360
Real hip.

759
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:07,067
Cynthia, uh, when do you
get off work?

760
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,135
Uh, about, uh, ten minutes.

761
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:10,904
Yeah, is there, is there
any way you could run

762
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,238
Rachel to the dentist for me?

763
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:14,074
I‐I gotta follow‐up
on this Carter thing.

764
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:15,341
‐ Sure.
‐ Is that alright, Rach?

765
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,677
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Thank you.

766
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,378
Okay. Maybe we'll go
window shopping.

767
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:20,446
Hey, hey, Herb, uh, where
you going with that chart?

768
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,482
Look, look, I got
the perfect patient for me.

769
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,085
A three and a half inch scalp
lac on a sleeping transient.

770
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:26,653
Isn't that where
you guys all start?

771
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:29,255
Um, I'll tell you what,
I'll suture him

772
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:30,557
and you can cut my knots.

773
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:31,692
Let me sew a little bit.

774
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,527
You're not a doctor, Herb.

775
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,995
Whoa, whoa.

776
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,099
Mr. Deindorfer?
Mr. Deindorfer?

777
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,601
We got a code blue in exam four.

778
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,969
‐ Looks like a V‐fib.
‐ Grab that red card for me.

779
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,304
'Defibrillator coming up.'

780
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,441
Two hundred. Clear.

781
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,143
Whoa! Whoa!

782
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,477
Herb!

783
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:56,316
‐ Ah!
‐ Wow!

784
00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:59,252
Wow. What happened?

785
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,055
You're gonna be okay, Mr. D.

786
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,692
Unbelievable.

787
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:13,299
‐ Jeanie. Jeanie!
‐ Hey.

788
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,235
What's going on? I've been
calling everywhere for you.

789
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,703
They told me in the ER
that you were working today.

790
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:18,404
I've been rehired, Al.

791
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,073
We're gonna get caught up.

792
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,474
I got the call from Atlanta.

793
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:24,077
Six months on the high‐rise,
job starting Tuesday.

794
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,345
Yeah, but I got my job back.

795
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:26,513
Yeah, but tell them to shove it

796
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:27,581
'cause we're moving to Atlanta.

797
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,183
We need to talk about this.

798
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:32,085
We'll have plenty of time
to talk.

799
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,353
I fought hard for this job.

800
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,621
It means a lot to me.

801
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,059
The truth is, you don't
believe my job is real.

802
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:40,226
You got no faith in me.

803
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,461
Al, it's not about that.

804
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:42,696
Yes, it is,
it's about you

805
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:44,297
not being able
to depend on me.

806
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,500
You're not gonna tell anyone
in Atlanta

807
00:32:47,534 --> 00:32:48,702
about our HIV status,
are you?

808
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:50,136
It's nobody's business.

809
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,237
I'm not running away.

810
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,405
You have a life here
and I don't.

811
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,211
Don't you see what making
this fresh start means to me?

812
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:00,480
Don't you see what getting
my job back means to me?

813
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:09,322
I gotta go pack.

814
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,390
I'll see you at home later.

815
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:16,029
'Mr. Carter.'

816
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:19,465
Um..

817
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,034
...Dr. Carter?

818
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,069
‐ Excuse the hell out of me.
‐ No, no, no.

819
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:25,539
You know, just‐just
for accuracy's sake.

820
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:27,040
So I get my one phone call now?

821
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,809
Seeing as you're in
on a misdemeanor offense

822
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,645
we're waiving the fingerprint
check. You can bond right out.

823
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,147
Oh, thank God.
What do I have to do?

824
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,716
Hundred bucks,
and you're out of here.

825
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:37,818
Great, my credit cards are in my
wallet which they took from me

826
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,485
and they put into that box
right over there.

827
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,489
We don't take credit cards.
It's cash and carry, doctor.

828
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:48,194
That's all I got.

829
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,230
That was unbelievable,
feeling the power

830
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:51,832
of life and death
in my hands, it was‐‐

831
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,200
Were you trying to get me fired?
Well, forget the deal.

832
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:55,536
Okay? It's over.
You're out of here.

833
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:57,137
‐ It worked.
‐ Cool it, huh, Herb?

834
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,739
Mark, Randi's getting Anspaugh
on the phone.

835
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:00,607
Could you talk to him about
getting Carter out of jail?

836
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:02,108
‐ Sure.
‐ Somebody's in jail?

837
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:03,409
‐ Are you a doctor?
‐ Nope.

838
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,278
‐ Herb Spivak. I'm a lawyer.
‐ Oh!

839
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:08,348
One of our interns was arrested
for destroying evidence.

840
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,183
That's no problem there.
Get a bail bondsman.

841
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,152
He'll be out in the morning.

842
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:15,221
By the way, Mark,
your lawsuit's gone.

843
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:16,657
Uh, what?

844
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,825
That's right.
Sayonara. Kaputo.

845
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,594
I just got off the phone
with Mickey Everett

846
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:22,796
the attorney for the law family.

847
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,297
He convinced them
to drop charges.

848
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,599
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

849
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:26,833
He'll have papers
drawn up in a week.

850
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,569
How do you pull that off?

851
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:30,537
Well, it just so happens
that Mickey Everett and I

852
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,372
are part of a billion‐dollar
class action

853
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:33,740
against big tobacco.

854
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:36,309
We're looking at maybe
a $10 million legal fee.

855
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:38,178
Nobody's pushing away
from that golden goose

856
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,313
until it's plucked clean.

857
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:42,816
Uh, Mark, let me ask you.
Can I have this as a memento?

858
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,518
‐ Yeah, sure, you can‐‐
‐ Oh!

859
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:46,352
That's the doctor
who saved my life.

860
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:47,754
‐ Thank you, doctor.
‐ You're welcome.

861
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:49,189
‐ 'May God bless.'
‐ Yeah, yeah, good.

862
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:50,857
Yeah, take care.
You look great.

863
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:53,594
Unbelievable.
Medicine, that's a calling.

864
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:57,263
Listen, Mark, Morton's some
night for a steak. On me.

865
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:58,732
Thanks for a thrilling day.

866
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,472
‐ Mark.
‐ Jen.

867
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:09,409
‐ Did Rachel have any cavities?
‐ Uh, Cynthia's not back yet.

868
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:10,877
She, uh, took her,
but y‐you know what?

869
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:12,679
They're, uh, we can wait
for them in the lounge.

870
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:15,148
‐ Cynthia?
‐ Yeah, the new desk clerk.

871
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:17,283
She really likes kids,
and Rachel gets along

872
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:18,852
great with her,
so she took her.

873
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,386
The appointment
was a while ago.

874
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,487
I'm sure they'll be back
any minute.

875
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,858
Oh, my God.

876
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:27,828
Me and Cyn went to makeovers

877
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,495
'across the street
from the dentist.'

878
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,832
I got my nails done
and my toes too

879
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:34,868
and she wanted her eyebrow
pierced, but I said no way.

880
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:39,706
This is Cynthia,
and this is Jennifer.

881
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,274
‐ 'Rachel's mom.'
‐ Hi.

882
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:46,446
It's just temporary, all
the teenagers are doing it so..

883
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,614
She's eight.

884
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:50,651
Oh! Well, it will wash out.

885
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,687
Come on, Rachel.

886
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,858
‐ Come on.
‐ Bye, sweetheart.

887
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:01,895
I was sick of that
little‐girl hair.

888
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:07,433
Oh, Mark, I'm..

889
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:10,403
I'm so sorry. I‐I,
we were just having so much fun

890
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,338
and‐and you said
that you liked it

891
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:13,674
when I showed it to you
in the magazine.

892
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:15,642
Uh, it's okay, really.

893
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:16,977
You're not mad at me?

894
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,278
No.

895
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,481
So we're still on for, um

896
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:23,917
a lingerie show
and margaritas tonight?

897
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,587
Ah, you know, I‐I kinda
need to give my liver

898
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,589
just one night to regenerate.

899
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:30,591
Uh, so I'll take a rain check.

900
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:32,693
‐ Hey, Mark.
‐ Yeah.

901
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:33,960
What are we doing about Carter?

902
00:36:33,994 --> 00:36:35,562
I called a bail bondsman
and they're gonna

903
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:36,930
release him in the morning.

904
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:38,665
Wait, so he has to stay
in jail all night?

905
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,601
‐ You wanna call the family?
‐ And say what?

906
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,235
John Carter III's in jail?

907
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:44,270
Um, here's the police
district phone number.

908
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:45,872
‐ Great. I'll deal with it.
‐ Okay.

909
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,340
Uh, here's enough oral Dilaudid

910
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,709
to get you
to your sister's wedding.

911
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:49,976
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.

912
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,311
Yeah, alright, you're welcome.

913
00:36:57,818 --> 00:37:01,555
Hey, what is he doing
back in here?

914
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:03,389
It's not your concern, Kerry.
He's my patient.

915
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,559
You don't help an addict
by giving him drugs‐‐

916
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,260
That is a sickle cell patient
in pain.

917
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:09,295
No, that is a drug seeker
who has learned to manipulate‐‐

918
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,732
He cannot function
without painkillers, Kerry.

919
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:13,266
People live in pain.

920
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,001
They suck it up
and get past it.

921
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,574
What's up with her?

922
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:21,842
I think the crown
is weighing

923
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,610
heavily on the queen's head.

924
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:31,618
Mark.

925
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,254
Hi.

926
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:36,890
I'm so sorry.

927
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,592
I just, um,
I really wanted to make it

928
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,961
special for Rachel
and I, uh..

929
00:37:40,994 --> 00:37:42,295
...made a mess of it.

930
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:44,931
‐ It's okay.
‐ Your ex‐wife hates me.

931
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:46,933
No, she was just..

932
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,769
She was shocked.

933
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:51,437
‐ So were you.
‐ Yeah.

934
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:52,673
I guess I was.

935
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,977
Rachel's really happy

936
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,379
and really sure of herself.

937
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:01,582
You must be a really great dad.

938
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,483
‐ I don't know about that.
‐ No, you are.

939
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,021
I was really excited
about tonight.

940
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:10,524
I wore your present
and everything.

941
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:11,792
My feet are killing me.

942
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,590
‐ So you're a doctor?
‐ Hmm?

943
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:45,559
Um, yes.

944
00:38:45,592 --> 00:38:46,727
Yes, I am.

945
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:53,734
So..

946
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:55,536
...what are you in for, Shrike?

947
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:58,371
Is that‐that your name?
Shrike?

948
00:38:58,404 --> 00:38:59,673
Obstruction of justice.

949
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:01,041
Yeah?

950
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:02,543
Me too.

951
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:04,144
How about that, huh?

952
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:06,513
I was expecting something
a little bit..

953
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:09,082
No, no, no, I'm not
making snap judgments.

954
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:12,719
‐ Got something for you.
‐ You do? Uh..

955
00:39:12,753 --> 00:39:14,120
What's this red bump?

956
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:17,924
Uh..

957
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,860
...that's a, that's a nasty
carbuncle.

958
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:22,829
Um, may I?

959
00:39:24,998 --> 00:39:27,901
‐ 'Yeah.'
‐ 'Pants up, ladies.'

960
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:29,736
Come on, Carter.

961
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,105
Your other girlfriend
bailed you out.

962
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:33,840
I got a girlfriend.

963
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,008
Uh, I guess I gotta go.

964
00:39:36,943 --> 00:39:39,479
Just, um, soak that
in warm, soapy water

965
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:42,082
about four times a day.
Should clear right up.

966
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:43,083
Girlfriend?

967
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,022
Anna?

968
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,725
‐ Oh, oh!
‐ Hi, knucklehead.

969
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:52,726
Thank God.

970
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,432
Sorry, I was, uh..

971
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:01,568
I was wondering what
I should get you for Christmas

972
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:04,437
and then, it finally
came to me. Bail.

973
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,672
I thought I was gonna
be spending

974
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:06,707
the weekend in there
with Shrike.

975
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,108
Yeah.

976
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:09,510
So what happened
with Darlene?

977
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:10,811
Did you get her
into the, into the home?

978
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:12,212
Oh! Oh, yeah,
she, uh..

979
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:14,214
She, actually,
she did try to kill him

980
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:16,049
but, uh, they kissed
and made up

981
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:19,620
and went home
and lived happily ever after.

982
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:20,787
I should have had lunch
with my cousin.

983
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:21,822
I know what you mean.

984
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:24,991
You know, I'm noticing
it's kind of expensive

985
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:26,426
to have a rich guy
for a friend.

986
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:31,031
Hey.

987
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:32,232
Hello.

988
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:34,200
English breakfast,
uh, you know

989
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:35,936
I figured
since you were English.

990
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:38,038
It's perfect.

991
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:39,806
Why aren't you at home
putting your son to sleep?

992
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,908
Uh, I get him on the weekends.

993
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,044
So, how's Allison?

994
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:46,079
Well, her parameters
are stable

995
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:48,081
but she's still comatose.

996
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,683
She hasn't so much
as twitched.

997
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:51,718
Hmm.

998
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,587
Maybe you made the right
decision for a young lady

999
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,621
who has a lifetime
ahead of her.

1000
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,559
I keep asking myself
whether I made the decision

1001
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:00,927
based on my lust
for challenging surgery.

1002
00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:04,831
Yeah.

1003
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:06,567
I ask myself that same question
all the time.

1004
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:10,804
You know, where does
wanting to help end

1005
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:11,972
and ambition begin?

1006
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,510
There's the rub.

1007
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:06,292
'Jeanie.'

1008
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,602
I...just went to gas up
the car.

1009
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:16,937
I thought you'd gone.

1010
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,071
No.

1011
00:42:19,172 --> 00:42:20,874
Hey.

1012
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:22,743
Say the word and I'll..

1013
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:23,810
...pack your stuff too.

1014
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:27,681
I can't, Al.

1015
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:30,851
My life is here.

1016
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,755
My job is here, I..

1017
00:42:34,788 --> 00:42:36,723
I've worked too hard.
I can't just walk away.

1018
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:40,260
Come on. I mean, all the abuse
they put you through?

1019
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:42,195
I know,
but i‐it's made me realize

1020
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:43,964
who I am and what I want.

1021
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:47,634
I can't tell lies anymore.

1022
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:51,905
We've been through a lot.

1023
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,609
Can't just..

1024
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,211
...throw that away.

1025
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:01,848
You've always been
able to make me laugh.

1026
00:43:04,284 --> 00:43:06,319
Make my head spin
like when we were teenagers.

1027
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,991
Yeah, well, uh..

1028
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,595
...give it some time.

1029
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:19,900
See what it feels like.

1030
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:43,156
Well, I'll, uh..

1031
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,194
I'll call..

1032
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,231

You do that.

00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,309
