1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,140
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,510
Peter?
Oh, hi, Lizzie.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,012
I think it's about time you
and I had a little sit down.

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,747
‐ Is there a problem?
‐ Am I hearing jealousy?

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,216
It's just that I think
that you're trouble.

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,417
What about his
heroin addiction?

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,752
Uh, it wasn't heroin.

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,286
It was pain killers,
Percocet.

9
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:22,523
I'm gonna do
an ultrarapid detox.

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,057
I'm gonna end
his addiction today.

11
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,292
You're gonna keep him
hidden here for 12 hours?

12
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:29,095
Found Doug in exam four
detoxing this baby.

13
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,631
What? You're going
to explain this

14
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,765
to the hospital
administration

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,799
and the executive
committee.

16
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,467
'You lied to me Doug.'

17
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,702
You looked me right
in the face and lied to me.

18
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:42,509
That is not fair, Doug.

19
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,610
You never would
let me do this

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,311
in the ER,
no matter what I told.

21
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,680
Yeah, you didn't even have
the ability to monitor.

22
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,782
EKG, pulse ox,
end title CO2

23
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,083
and invasive BP
with a radial art‐‐

24
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,451
You never got consent.

25
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,753
Consent from who? A mother
who chugs his methadone?

26
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,220
DCFS would have
followed through

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,255
you let someone
else do their job‐‐

28
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,690
Followed through for what?

29
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,491
A child whose development
is already stunted?

30
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,426
Been expecting you. Your desk
clerk called a minute ago.

31
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,296
‐ Admit orders?
‐ There aren't any.

32
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,566
Here's everything you need
is right there.

33
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,768
Start him on labetalol,
titrate point five

34
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,537
q five minutes
to a diastolic of 60.

35
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,774
Hey, Doug. Alexander Babcock,
pediatric anesthesiologist.

36
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,076
Kerry weaver, acting chief
of emergency medicine.

37
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,579
This is Josh McNeal,
seven months old hypertensive‐‐

38
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,614
This boy was born
addicted to heroin.

39
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,082
His mother's been stealing
his methadone.

40
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,449
I put him
on an ultrarapid detox.

41
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,484
Wow, I've heard
a couple of those

42
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,219
being done across the country.

43
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,854
Then you know, it's still
an experimental procedure.

44
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,123
BP is not bad, 150/90.

45
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,692
This boy needs
to be stabilized

46
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,426
and put back
on methadone

47
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,662
until administration
and legal can review this case.

48
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,397
‐ What did you use to induce it?
‐ Ketamine.

49
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,465
Until he's stabilized
and then narcan for the detox.

50
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,767
‐ Propofol's better.
‐ Yeah, I agree.

51
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,235
We just didn't
have it on the ER.

52
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,269
No, but we got it up here.

53
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,305
Kit, let's DC the ketamine.

54
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,773
'And start him on
three migs of Propofol'

55
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,875
and then 150 mics
per kilo per minute.

56
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,544
You're continuing with this?

57
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,112
'The approach seems
medically reasonable.'

58
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,246
And if it gets the boy
off the methadone‐‐

59
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,881
You cannot perform
procedures

60
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,750
on children
without permission.

61
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,384
Dr. Ross may have
gone overboard

62
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,120
but it seems
in the best interests

63
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,487
of the child to complete
what's been started.

64
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,289
'Who's gonna be on
for the follow through?'

65
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,358
I am. I'm off work till
tomorrow, so I'll stay.

66
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,360
'Okay. Excuse me.'

67
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,796
Your actions are
totally irresponsible, Doug.

68
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,233
You've broken every rule and
regulation we have in the ER.

69
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,701
Whatever happens here
won't change that.

70
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,269
...make sure
that this boy

71
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,671
gets a decent
shot at a normal life.

72
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,805
I don't care about
your rules or regulations.

73
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,306
I hope you
also don't care

74
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,543
about being an ER
pediatric attending

75
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,477
because you've just given up
any chance of that.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,569
‐ Mark, 7 o'clock.
‐ What?

77
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,772
7 o'clock. Rise and shine.

78
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,608
Oh.

79
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,343
Listen, did you hear from
the, uh, PICU about that baby?

80
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,477
Haleh just went off duty.

81
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,213
She didn't mention anything.

82
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,248
Am I supposed
to wake up Dr. Weaver?

83
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,282
Ah, she stayed, too?

84
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,884
Uh, snoozing in exam four.

85
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,554
‐ Ah, let her sleep.
‐ 'Come on, girls.'

86
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,556
‐ Oh, sweep, sweep, sweep!
‐ Oh, Randi's in my way!

87
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,424
I'm supposed to be
in the front!

88
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,492
‐ Curling, Jerry?
‐ We were inspired by Nagano.

89
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,563
Only three years and nine months
left till Salt Lake City.

90
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,865
These crazy white folk.

91
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,900
Hey, Mark, you and Dr. Weaver
having a slumber party?

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,368
No, not exactly.

93
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,603
Did you hear
anything from Doug?

94
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,271
No. Not since
the fireworks.

95
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,506
Is that why you
spent the night?

96
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,542
Uh, I was just nostalgic
from my residency.

97
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:02,709
I thought Carol was
working this morning.

98
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,545
She is,
but she's on a break.

99
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,312
There's no new patients
on the board.

100
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,448
‐ Why'd you wake me?
‐ Haleh said 7 o'clock.

101
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,983
I think that was
for Dr. Weaver.

102
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,418
Oh, forget it.
I'll just get some breakfast.

103
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,387
Uh, listen, can you
call Anspaugh's office

104
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,256
and find out what
his schedule is this morning?

105
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,358
I need a meeting
with him as soon as he can.

106
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,893
Okay.

107
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,728
'You didn't answer
my question.'

108
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,664
'I have no idea
how they got their name.'

109
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,599
But the drinks
go down so smoothly

110
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,633
at the Velvet Lounge.

111
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,001
I wouldn't know that.

112
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,270
Ah‐ha, that's what
this is about.

113
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,805
I was drinking
and you weren't.

114
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,306
You know I don't drink.

115
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,308
Yeah, and you think
I drink too much.

116
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,677
Oh, damn it.
We missed the 7:10.

117
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,978
Well, that's okay,
we can get

118
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,846
the next one
and cross over at Madison.

119
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,516
No, I can't. I told you.

120
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,951
I've gotta go to Carla's
and pick up Reese for daycare.

121
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,420
Are you always like
this after a night out?

122
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,423
What? You know,
we saw the whole show.

123
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,492
I don't, I don't think we
needed to stay for another set.

124
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,427
I thought we were
having a good time.

125
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,662
We were.

126
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,463
Until I made
that song request.

127
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,032
The look on your face.

128
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,869
Elizabeth, you know,
there's some places

129
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,739
that you go to listen
to the music, just listen.

130
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,373
Oh, so it's not
like the pub

131
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,709
where you can
play darts

132
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,544
nobody cares if you
drink too much

133
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,812
or put something
stupid on the jukebox

134
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,446
or even dance, God forbid.

135
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,082
I'm just saying a place like
that it just wasn't cool.

136
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,852
Well, if you ask me being cool
seems somewhat limiting.

137
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,388
You taking this one?

138
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,424
Uh, yes, I think I will.

139
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,626
Uh, I'll see you in there?

140
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,327
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay.

141
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,766
Why didn't you wake me?

142
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,701
I have a meeting
with Anspaugh at 8:00.

143
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,436
We woke up Dr. Greene
by mistake.

144
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,938
But now he's gone
for breakfast and we just got

145
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,005
two bounce back migraines.

146
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,541
Yeah, one of which
could be mine.

147
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,408
A guy with fractured
clavicle complaining

148
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,745
of coldness to his hand
and a suicide gesture a guy with

149
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,680
uh, superficial intension
marks to his left wrist.

150
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,448
Well, who else is on?

151
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,784
Well, Del Amico, Jeanie and
Carter are due any minute.

152
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,119
In other words, they're late
and I'm the only one here.

153
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,420
Why is that?

154
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,089
‐ Uh..
‐ Thank you, Lydia.

155
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,924
Be right out.

156
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,663
Carol, thought
you might want a refill.

157
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,997
Oh, I've just got one. Thanks.

158
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,867
Heard it's supposed to rain.

159
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,602
Do you wanna talk
about last night, Mark?

160
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,872
It's very serious
what Doug did.

161
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,541
You mean what we did,
don't you?

162
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,409
I think people understand

163
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,678
that it's the nature
of your job

164
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,881
to assist a doctor
when they ask you.

165
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,415
I was there 'cause
I wanted to be there

166
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,551
not because Doug asked me.

167
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,052
I'm sure you were.

168
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,421
Doug can be pretty
passionate about these kids.

169
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,156
Oh, give me
a little credit, Mark.

170
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,725
What do you think,
I am some fresh‐faced

171
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,528
nursing student
under the great doctor's spell?

172
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,864
I'm only sayin' that
legal and administration

173
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,433
are gonna be going over
every detail of this case

174
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,903
and I'd hate to see it
reflect badly on your record.

175
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,105
So you're saying I should
fudge my involvement?

176
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,608
Tell the truth. Tell them
you were doing your job.

177
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,142
A nurse assisting a doctor.

178
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,144
The truth is,
I insisted on being there

179
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,913
because I believe
Doug was working

180
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,480
in the best interests
of the patient

181
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,917
and that's my job,
every bit as much as it is his.

182
00:06:58,652 --> 00:06:59,853
I gotta get back.

183
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,659
We practically had our noses
pressed up against the glass.

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,793
The tracks
were right beneath us.

185
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:07,828
It was unbelievable.

186
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,062
You've never
done that before?

187
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,196
No. I didn't even
know you could.

188
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,498
All you have to do is ask.

189
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,434
‐ Hey.
‐ Hi.

190
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,969
Hey, Carter, have you
ever ridden in the front car

191
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,738
of the El, huh,
with the driver?

192
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:18,772
I don't think so.

193
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,741
Anna and Dr. Rosher just did.

194
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,477
‐ Max, please. Max.
‐ 'Max, see you.'

195
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,046
‐ Well, that sounds exciting.
‐ Yeah.

196
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,781
Uh, Max just asked
the guy if he could

197
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:28,849
and he said sure.

198
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,016
Pretty clever.

199
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,685
Well, thank you, John.

200
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,786
I can see you're
gonna give me that one

201
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,487
but maybe not
the next one, right?

202
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,123
I gotta go pry a kid's leg
out of a shopping cart.

203
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,925
'Call maintenance,
good set of bolt cutters'

204
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,226
'usually does the trick, right?'

205
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,628
It does feel cold.

206
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,063
That's what
I've been saying.

207
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,565
It's the damndest feeling.

208
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,867
Nails are cyanotic,
cap refill's poor

209
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,935
and he barely has
a radial pulse.

210
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,103
That doesn't sound good.

211
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,705
Well, I want
to get an ultrasound

212
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,775
and possibly an angiogram
to rule out a blood clot

213
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,010
which might be cutting off
the blood supply to your hand.

214
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,880
Sure, whatever you need to do.
I've got great insurance.

215
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,115
Well, you'd get excellent care
here even if you didn't.

216
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,850
Kerry, can I talk
to you a minute?

217
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,753
Of course, Lily, can you get
consents for Mr. Wass'

218
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,788
procedure
and schedule it, please.

219
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:08,989
Okay.

220
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,791
I've got a call
in to Anspaugh's office

221
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,158
to talk about this
Doug Ross situation.

222
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,660
Yeah, I'm gonna see him
in a few minutes.

223
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,128
I think, both of us should
be involved in this.

224
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,930
No, my meeting's
about something else.

225
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,800
It's been on his calendar
for a couple of weeks.

226
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,668
I'll set up another for
the two of us while I'm there?

227
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:22,869
Make sure you
let me know what time.

228
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,270
Don't worry, Mark.
I will.

229
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,507
Randi, send home
the rule‐out appy in three

230
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,542
with a diagnosis
of constipation.

231
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,644
I don't suppose there's a good
trauma on its way, is there?

232
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,245
No, but this letter
came down for you

233
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,814
from Dr. Romano's office.

234
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,215
He's a weird little dude,
ain't he?

235
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,218
Did he drop
this off himself?

236
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,921
No. It was his
secretary, I think.

237
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,789
Where is he now,
do you know?

238
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,759
It's not really my job to keep
track of stuff like that.

239
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,862
On our way in on the El today
he drank all of his juice

240
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,030
without spilling a drop.

241
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,132
‐ Go ahead and play.
‐ Yeah.

242
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,534
There you go.

243
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,901
He's not crying‐‐

244
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,804
Is he pretty responsive
to you these days?

245
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,741
Well, as responsive
as a one‐year‐old can be. Why?

246
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,843
Sometimes it's hard
to get his attention.

247
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,245
I was wondering if maybe
you'd had his hearing checked.

248
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,280
‐ What?
‐ Uh, it's not a problem.

249
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,615
Just things we notice.

250
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,553
Reese.
Reese, come here, man.

251
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,154
Come here. Come here.

252
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,190
Aw. I know, I know, shh.

253
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,026
‐ Seems pretty responsive to me.
‐ Hmm.

254
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,928
Okay, you know what,
he probably just gets distracted

255
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:22,963
by all these other kids.

256
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,765
Okay, okay. Got to go.

257
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:28,569
Listen, um, Carla's gonna
pick him up around 4:00, okay?

258
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,004
Sure. That's fine,
Dr. Benton.

259
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,875
Oh, who's hiding?
Who's hiding?

260
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,612
'Hi, Reese. What are you
playing with today, huh?'

261
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,582
Well, it just feels
so ridiculous.

262
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,150
I never really meant
to kill myself.

263
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,786
So it wasn't
just an accident.

264
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,924
Um, well, you see,
my wife and I

265
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,726
we had a fight,
you know, and, um..

266
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,763
...so, I went out
to my workshop.

267
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:01,367
Uh, I brought a glass
of orange juice with me..

268
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,804
...and I dropped
the glass and, um..

269
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:07,173
...when it broke,
there was a shard lying there

270
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,044
and I just...you know,
I don't know

271
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,312
because I was just so angry.

272
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,947
So it was impulsive.

273
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,716
It was stupid,
is what it was.

274
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,051
I worried the hell
out of my wife.

275
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,385
Although it's nice
to know she cares.

276
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,322
Mr. Nable, this is
Jeanie Boulet.

277
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,857
Hi. I'm a physician assistant.

278
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,059
I'm gonna be
suturing up your cuts.

279
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,794
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of stitches.

280
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,162
And we have
a psychiatric resident

281
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,230
coming down
to talk with you.

282
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,966
Oh, I'm fine, okay?

283
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:37,938
I, uh, this was just a mistake.
I really don't need that.

284
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,674
We're sure it was but it's
required in a case like this.

285
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,677
Oh, man.

286
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,220
Kerry.

287
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,690
‐ Hi.
‐ 'Hi.'

288
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,225
We're just finishing up here.

289
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,061
'Doug Ross called
an emergency meeting

290
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,329
to fill us in
on the case of Josh McNeal.

291
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,865
I'm familiar with it.

292
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,299
'Because of the unusual
circumstances'

293
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,869
I thought it was best
to bring everybody up to speed.

294
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:12,105
'Doug has admitted to clearly
stepping over the line here.'

295
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,173
But at least he
prevented the baby

296
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,075
'from going home
to his mother .'

297
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,142
'Anesthesia and pediatric
should have been'

298
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,844
involved from the get‐go.

299
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,146
Yeah, and he should've
gotten the mother's consent.

300
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,782
'Probably wouldn't
have gotten it'

301
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,684
'if it meant losing
her source for methadone.'

302
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,418
'I know that Max is doing
the feasibility study'

303
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,087
on an ER pediatric
department.

304
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,955
I didn't want to do
anything to jeopardize that.

305
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,257
Uh, even if I'm not involved,
I think, it's s‐still

306
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,026
the best thing
for County General.

307
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,828
Doug, I don't want
to minimize

308
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,831
the ramifications
of this but I do thank you

309
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,365
for coming forward so quickly.

310
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,902
Okay, sure. If you'll excuse me
I wanna get to PICU.

311
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,139
'Doug, thanks.
We'll talk.'

312
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,445
Uh, Don, I don't think
I need to tell you

313
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,748
that Doug Ross'
actions violated

314
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,050
every policy we have
regarding patient care.

315
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,021
I know, and there'll be
a full review and QA.

316
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,455
It may not go
so well for him

317
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,791
but, uh, I must say

318
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,260
he's certainly there
for his patients.

319
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,430
Anyway, I'm sorry this
has eaten into our time.

320
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:13,333
What is it that you wanted
to talk to me about?

321
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,336
Well, uh, as you know,
when David Morgenstern

322
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:20,073
had his MI last fall
I took over as acting chief

323
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,407
of emergency medicine.

324
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,744
And you've done
a fine job, Kerry.

325
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,045
With the exception
of that little

326
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,180
Ellis West, Synergix fiasco.

327
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,351
With Dr. Morgenstern
having resigned

328
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,120
it seems appropriate
for me to now step up

329
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,089
and be chief
of emergency medicine.

330
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,824
Well, the department is
running quite well

331
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,259
and we certainly owe you
a debt of gratitude

332
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,827
for jumping in
the way you did.

333
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,329
Well, I think everyone's
responded to my authority

334
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,466
and there shouldn't be a problem
with a simple change in title.

335
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,901
Well, I'm glad
to hear that you'd like

336
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,870
to be considered
for the position.

337
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,205
We will of course
be doing a national search

338
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,340
for the best candidate,
but I'm happy

339
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,009
to have you throw
your hat in the ring.

340
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,277
A national search?

341
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,846
County policy,
as I'm sure you know.

342
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,281
Excuse me.

343
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,117
Don Anspaugh.

344
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,127
‐ How's he doing?
‐ Pretty stable.

345
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,296
Turned off the Propofol
a half hour ago.

346
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,398
When's Doug gonna extubate?

347
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,466
Well, I figured I'd give him
a couple more minutes.

348
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,579
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

349
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,248
I was in the middle
of a pretty decent dream.

350
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,018
‐ Was I there?
‐ Mm, big time.

351
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,422
You think I did
the right thing?

352
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,392
Yeah, I do.

353
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,063
Even if we both
get fired for it?

354
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,397
Well, you know..

355
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,933
...that would just be
icing on the cake.

356
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,906
Kit, you ready to extubate him?

357
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,243
He's breathing spontaneously.

358
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,212
Vitals?

359
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:10,116
Afebrile.
BP's stable, 90/70.

360
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,085
Alright.

361
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:14,988
Suction cath.

362
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,225
Okay, buddy.

363
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,360
'Prove us right.'

364
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,265
Get ready to bag him.

365
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,033
I'll do it.

366
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:28,935
Okay.

367
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,039
Here we go.

368
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,547
Pulse ox?

369
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,883
Holding steady, 98 percent.

370
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,219
Do you think
he's gonna make it?

371
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:48,989
Too soon to tell.

372
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,060
Shirley, I'm looking
for Dr. Romano.

373
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,261
He's not here.

374
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,597
Well, do you have
his surgical schedule?

375
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:58,131
No, I mean,
he's really not here.

376
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,365
He went to some
head‐and‐neck conference

377
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,034
in Costa Rica.

378
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,368
He doesn't do
head‐and‐neck surgery.

379
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,104
Maybe he wants to learn.

380
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,639
Maybe he's just
playing golf.

381
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,140
When's he due back?

382
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,643
Teresa does all
the travel scheduling.

383
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,645
Well, that's lovely.
Where can I find her?

384
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,413
Right here, except
she's on a break.

385
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,383
I wanted to bring you
up‐to‐date on a patient

386
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,220
we got a seven‐month‐old boy
born addicted to heroin.

387
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,387
His mother was stealing
his methadone.

388
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,656
You know the case?

389
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,390
Doug Ross briefed us
with your chief of staff

390
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,425
and bunch of the pedes
muckety‐mucks.

391
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,993
So there was a meeting?

392
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,530
Kerry Weaver, I'm sure
can give you the highlights.

393
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,397
Anspaugh stayed pretty calm,
but, man, I got to tell you

394
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,066
if that had
happened at Chop

395
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,367
Doug would've
been out on his ass.

396
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,570
Anyway, I got
to go to chart hell.

397
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,539
‐ Carol, you seen Kerry?
‐ No. Sorry.

398
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,106
We were concerned
when you expressed your anger

399
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,642
in such a self‐destructive way.

400
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:45,579
Look, I know I should handle it
better, okay and I will.

401
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,481
But I really don't
wanna stay overnight.

402
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,083
Look, I'm not
a crazy person, okay?

403
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,952
‐ This was just stupid.
‐ Okay.

404
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,287
Um, I just need to talk to you
just for a minute, Dr. Myers.

405
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,489
Excuse us a moment.

406
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,258
‐ He doesn't want to stay?
‐ Nope.

407
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,526
And I don't really have
a reason to keep him.

408
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,394
Well, I just pulled up
his old records.

409
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,030
He's been here three times
in the past year.

410
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,266
Migraines,
abdominal pain, back pain.

411
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,433
You think he's drug seeking?

412
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,035
I think they're signs
of wanting help.

413
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,303
There's no doubt he's depressed

414
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,605
but that's not grounds
for admission.

415
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,039
Hell, I'd have
to admit half the city.

416
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,174
So you're just
gonna release him?

417
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,341
He's responsive.

418
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,210
He doesn't seem
suicidal or psychotic

419
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,513
and he's willing to come into
the psych clinic for follow‐up.

420
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,181
I just wish there
was more we could do.

421
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,517
Guy's fighting with his wife,
job's not going too well.

422
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,085
‐ Like I said..
‐ I know. Half the city.

423
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,121
Dr. Carter,
you seen Dr. Weaver?

424
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,523
Usually, she's everywhere.

425
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:30,657
Hey, Dr. Greene,
do you think it's too late

426
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,458
to reconsider
my ER residency?

427
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,560
Oh, it's that time of year, huh?

428
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,595
You getting bored?

429
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,129
Well, I just spent my morning

430
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,731
cleaning out
an old guy's ears

431
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,365
and dislodging
a five‐year‐old

432
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,634
from a shopping cart,
and, uh..

433
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,368
Any unsickly patient
is fine with me.

434
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,570
Stop complaining,
Carter.

435
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,371
By 9 o'clock,
I'd been puked on twice.

436
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,208
Yes, but I also did two
bowel disimpactions.

437
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,444
Either one of you wanna
answer the phones instead?

438
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,279
Carter, why don't you take
the coma patient in four?

439
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,615
Hey, Dr. Greene.

440
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,416
Paramedics on their way
in with a double trauma.

441
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,450
‐ Double?
‐ Yeah.

442
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:58,552
Two Elvis impersonators

443
00:16:58,652 --> 00:16:59,586
crashed into Lake Michigan.

444
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,654
‐ Sounds cool.
‐ Ooh.

445
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,088
Maybe, Dr. Greene,
I could, uh..

446
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,357
No, take the coma patient.

447
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,759
Jeanie, Anna.

448
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,493
How about getting
a handle on the Elvi?

449
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,762
Okay.

450
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,796
'Pick an Elvis. Any Elvis.'

451
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,532
We got your over‐the‐hill Elvis.

452
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,667
We got your Junior Elvis,
parachuted out of a plane

453
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,401
supposed to land
on a Navy pier.

454
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,370
Lines got tangled,
splashdown is in the lake.

455
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,706
But that freaky little twerp was
up there picking his pimples.

456
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,441
He can't skydive
to save his life.

457
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,143
Yeah, well, at least
I can do Elvis.

458
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,778
It's more than I can say
for your old cracker face.

459
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,379
Listen, you little fathead,
I was doing Elvis

460
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,581
before you was even born.

461
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,249
And I'll be doing him
after you're dead.

462
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,251
Shall we?

463
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,318
You need to undergo

464
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,820
anticoagulation therapy

465
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,422
in order to prevent
any further clotting.

466
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,524
Here in the hospital?

467
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,659
Not necessarily.

468
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,227
There's a fairly
new drug, Enoxaparin

469
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,563
which you inject
under the skin

470
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,565
in your abdomen
twice a day.

471
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:46,667
My wife's a nurse.
I guess, she could do that.

472
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,435
You're an excellent
candidate for the medication.

473
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,771
Otherwise, you'd have
to stay in the hospital

474
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,205
for at least
a couple days.

475
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,107
No way.
I don't want to do that.

476
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,175
I'll take the drug.

477
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,577
Okay, good.

478
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:57,678
'Kerry.'

479
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:58,845
I need to talk
to you now.

480
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,346
Sure.

481
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,315
Nurse Jarvik will see
that you're discharged.

482
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,150
‐ Sure. Thanks.
‐ You're very welcome.

483
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,285
What do you got?

484
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,820
Oh, two jokers
fell in the lake

485
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,689
out of an airplane
or something.

486
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,391
Listen, that Doug Ross meeting
happened this morning.

487
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,626
‐ It sure did.
‐ Yeah.

488
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:14,761
Well, I asked specifically
to be notified.

489
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:17,230
Yeah. Well, hey, Mark,
nobody told me either.

490
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,565
I just walked
in on it.

491
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,767
You know, you could've
mentioned something to me

492
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,368
so I didn't have
to hear about it third‐hand.

493
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,670
I had a few patients.

494
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,238
Can somebody give
the bullet, please?

495
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,140
‐ I already gave it.
‐ Well, give it again.

496
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,274
Uh, Junior Elvis‐‐

497
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,676
Uh, Jeanie,
Kerry and I've got this.

498
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,311
‐ Why don't you go help Anna?
‐ Gladly.

499
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,846
And tell that wannabe
his "Heartbreak Hotel"

500
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,447
sucks the big one.

501
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,349
'...oriented and alert,
vitals normal.'

502
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,818
'BP 120 over 70.'

503
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,219
Cap refill's fine.

504
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,588
BP's high,
180 over 120.

505
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,624
‐ Good luck in here.
‐ Better here than in there.

506
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:44,858
Those two are
making these Elvis'

507
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,492
sound like boy scouts.

508
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,395
♪ Well since my baby left me ♪

509
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,297
♪ I found a new place
to dwell.. ♪

510
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,833
Chuny, let's spin a crit
and dip the urine.

511
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:53,900
You want a chem‐7?

512
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,569
Sure.

513
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,437
So, why didn't
they tell us?

514
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,773
Well, why don't you
ask your pal Doug?

515
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,642
Do you think there's going to be
an inquiry into that case?

516
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,376
Well, hopefully,
Doug will let us know.

517
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,278
Why are you angry
at me about this, huh?

518
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,880
I didn't detox a baby
and not tell anybody about it.

519
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,815
No, but always
giving him an inch

520
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,183
you let him
get away with a mile.

521
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,484
So this is all my fault.

522
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,219
You know,
it's not a question of fault

523
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,188
Mark, it's a
question of style.

524
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,557
I mean, you close your eyes

525
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,158
and you hope these
things will disappear.

526
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,459
Here.

527
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,827
And whenever I try
to come down firmly

528
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,229
on an issue,
you tell me to pull back

529
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,865
you fight me,
and it'll just disappear.

530
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:27,433
Well, it's not disappearing
this time, is it?

531
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,369
Kerry, I don't think this is the
time or place to discuss this.

532
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,238
Chuny, let's repeat
a BP, please.

533
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,373
Mm‐hmm.

534
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,410
Oh, Mrs. Lang,
this is Dr. Carter.

535
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,312
How do you do,
Mrs. Lang?

536
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,582
I've just been going
over your chart.

537
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,183
I see that your husband has..

538
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,718
I couldn't wake Bill
up this morning.

539
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:47,187
He was diagnosed
14 months ago

540
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,456
with brainstem
glioblastoma.

541
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,258
They tried to do
radiation therapy

542
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,827
but that didn't work.

543
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,262
He's had some visual
disturbances

544
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,364
and some paralysis

545
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:01,301
but we were not
expecting this.

546
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,469
Well, we are gonna do
everything that we can.

547
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,772
'Carol, let's order
an MRI with gadolinium'

548
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,808
'and let's get in
a neurosurgery consult'

549
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:08,875
and the oncology fellow
on call.

550
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,276
Sure.

551
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,779
I hope it's okay
we opened up the window.

552
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,782
Bill, he just loves
the smell of the rain.

553
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,217
It's fine, Mrs. Lang.

554
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,722
Last time I complain about
a kid in a shopping cart.

555
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,524
‐ What?
‐ Never mind.

556
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,893
‐ Oh, hi, Adele.
‐ Hey, Carol.

557
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,261
This is Vicki McNeal.

558
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,996
This is Josh McNeal's mother.

559
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,899
Baby Josh. Right. Hi.

560
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,001
'She'd like
to see her son.'

561
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,670
‐ Okay, thank you.
‐ Dr. Benton.

562
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,371
Listen, Randi, an audiologist
is going to call.

563
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,405
An audi, what?

564
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,641
Someone who does hearing tests.

565
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,742
Just write it down
for me, please.

566
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:42,776
Okay, but we've
got an MVA coming

567
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:43,844
at the back door.

568
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:45,378
A Mazda versus
a milk truck.

569
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,380
I'm just signing charts.
I'm not covering the ER.

570
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,382
I know. But I can't
locate Dr. Corday.

571
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,483
I called upstairs
and they said something

572
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,018
about her checking out
Costa Rica.

573
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,386
‐ What?
‐ That's what I said.

574
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,888
About the MVA?

575
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,256
Uh, damn it.

576
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,992
Alright, Dumar,
what do we have?

577
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,328
Sam Wiser, 32, head‐on TC,
passenger space intrusion

578
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,697
with head, neck
and abdominal trauma.

579
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,331
Did she say anything
about consent?

580
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,001
I don't even know
what Adele told her.

581
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,571
Ms. McNeal.

582
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,273
Is he going
to be alright?

583
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,910
'Well, he's stable. His blood
pressure's holding steady.'

584
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,779
He's pretty sleepy,
but that's to be expected

585
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,947
after a prolonged sedation
and intubation.

586
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,382
'What's intubation?'

587
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,617
That's when they
put a tube down his throat

588
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:24,851
to help him breathe.

589
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,919
He was asleep while
they were doing it

590
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,554
so he didn't feel anything.

591
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:30,524
I explained to Vicki
about the ultrarapid detox

592
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,292
'and how the drugs
will be out of his system.'

593
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,827
She said Josh
will be able to sit up

594
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,529
like other babies of his age.

595
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,664
We have every reason to believe
he'll be able to catch up.

596
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:38,732
The procedure went well

597
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:40,466
so we just have
to wait and see.

598
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:45,606
So what I wanted
to know then, Dr. Ross, is..

599
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,442
...could you do
the same thing for me?

600
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,556
I'm gonna kill you.

601
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,757
Why? You offered.

602
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,058
Did you get
my patty melt?

603
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,660
Yes, I got your
patty melt.

604
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,461
Hey, will you, uh..

605
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:09,663
Will you help
this gentleman here?

606
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,097
He's‐he's looking
for Dr. Weaver.

607
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,099
Sir.

608
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,467
Can I help you?

609
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:16,670
Yes, I'm looking
for Dr. Weaver.

610
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,938
Dr. Weaver?

611
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:19,840
Mr. Wass,
what are you doing back?

612
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,643
The pharmacist couldn't
fill the enoxaparin.

613
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:23,977
It's $500, and he said

614
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:25,445
my insurance won't cover it.

615
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,748
They'll only cover
something called

616
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,650
Heparin or...Comadin?

617
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,718
‐ Coumadin.
‐ Is that what I should be on?

618
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,687
No, you need to be
hospitalized for those.

619
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:34,955
You know, I'll call the
insurance company

620
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:36,489
and straighten it out.

621
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,491
Randi, could get Mr. Wass'
insurance information

622
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,893
and put a call in, please?

623
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,562
Carol.

624
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:44,397
You know, I had a meeting with
Dr. Anspaugh this morning

625
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:47,433
and there is going to be an
executive committee review

626
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,502
of the Josh McNeal case.

627
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:49,970
Yeah, Doug told me.

628
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,838
Yeah, I think it would be
in your best interest

629
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,674
to document your
participation

630
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:55,441
while it's still
fresh in your mind.

631
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,612
Oh, that experience
isn't going away any time soon.

632
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,615
No, you should hope neither
you nor Doug Ross is, either.

633
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,817
Dr. Weaver?
Mr. Wass' insurance?

634
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,586
Thank you.

635
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,020
Yeah, it's Dr. Weaver.

636
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,454
No, no, no.

637
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,823
I don't want
the claims department.

638
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,958
I need a medical supervisor.

639
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,794
Mrs. Lang?

640
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,461
MRI is backed up.

641
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,830
It's going to be
a little while longer.

642
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,532
I've got
Nurse Hathaway checking.

643
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,603
He is going to wake up,
isn't he?

644
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,671
I mean, his doctors thought
we had longer than this.

645
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,006
We really
won't know anything

646
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:27,674
until we get those
test results back.

647
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,444
Is there a phone
that I could use?

648
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,979
I want to call
my daughter.

649
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,748
She's a freshman
in college.

650
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:37,417
Tulane Drama School.

651
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:39,753
She didn't want to go
because of her dad

652
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,555
but Bill, he insisted.

653
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:42,756
He said that it was enough

654
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,490
that his life
was being put on hold.

655
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,127
I don't know.

656
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:48,962
Maybe we made a mistake.

657
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,637
'Looks like an avocado.'

658
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,038
Dr. Corday!

659
00:23:58,138 --> 00:23:59,540
Sorry, I'm late.

660
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,610
I understand you were
on trauma call

661
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,712
when Mr. Wiser
was brought in.

662
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,748
'Yes, but Dr. Benton was
kind enough to cover for me'

663
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,049
'while I was away.'

664
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:10,717
You've reviewed
the chart, of course?

665
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,452
'Avulsed gallbladder.'

666
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:14,054
Can I get some
suction here, please?

667
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:20,160
Let's say you find
a significant pancreatic injury

668
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,596
crushed duodenum
and common bile duct.

669
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:24,097
What are you
going to do?

670
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:25,498
A whipple, of course.

671
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,667
which, as I think you know

672
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,001
I performed solo back in England

673
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:29,836
prior to my fellowship.

674
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,705
Yes, I think I did know that.

675
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:32,773
'And speaking of fellowships'

676
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,174
I wanted to ask you,
Dr. Anspaugh

677
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:37,578
about the possibility
of sponsorship for next year.

678
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:39,813
You don't want
to continue with Dr. Romano?

679
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,816
It seems Dr. Romano doesn't
wish to continue with me.

680
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,085
What?

681
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:46,820
Yes, he served me
notice this morning

682
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,522
and apparently he's unavailable

683
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:51,558
at some head‐and‐neck conference
in Costa Rica.

684
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,927
I'm afraid it's too late
in the year to arrange

685
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:55,796
another fellowship
at County General.

686
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,631
We're way beyond
the application deadlines.

687
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:58,765
I was hoping there might be

688
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,634
some sort of
individual consideration

689
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:02,803
seeing as I've already
spent a year here.

690
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:05,639
'The committee always
seems to frown on that.'

691
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:06,907
You definitely want to stay
in the United States?

692
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,775
Very much so, yes.

693
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,276
'If it's just staying
in America you want'

694
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,613
you could always
find Joe Schmo to marry you.

695
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:13,780
Shirley.

696
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,782
Sorry, Dr. Anspaugh.

697
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,184
‐ Dr. Weaver?
‐ Your guidelines are wrong.

698
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,220
My patient needs
anticoagulation therapy

699
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,956
and there's no reason for him to
be admitted to this hospital.

700
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:24,725
‐ Dr. Weaver.
‐ What is it, Jerry?

701
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,860
They just brought
that renal‐failure guy in.

702
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,895
Okay, tell them to get started
and I'll be there when I can.

703
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,264
You know,
I would like to get your name.

704
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,634
Rufhauer? Rufhauer.

705
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,069
Louis Palmieri, 84,
end‐stage renal failure.

706
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:38,171
Found in bed
in full cardiopulmonary arrest.

707
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,574
His femoral dialysis catheter
had been disconnected

708
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:41,775
and he exsanguinated through it.

709
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,243
Sheets were drenched with blood.

710
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:44,811
Is he going to be alright?

711
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:45,846
Would you stand back,
please, ma'am.

712
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,614
No pulse, no heart sounds.

713
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,083
Intubated in the field. Gave him
two amps epi, two of Atropine.

714
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:52,586
Reattached saline to the
catheter, ran in two liters.

715
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:53,654
That does it.

716
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:54,888
‐ Still no pulse?
‐ No.

717
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,757
Amp of bicarb
and high dose epi

718
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:57,991
five milligrams.

719
00:25:58,091 --> 00:25:59,726
Please be okay, Louis, huh?

720
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,227
No heart sounds. He's PEA.

721
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,597
Well, let's spin a crit
and get four units o‐neg.

722
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:04,965
Want to try
a transthoracic pacemaker?

723
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,600
‐ 'May as well.'
‐ What are you doing?

724
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,069
Trying to get
his heart going.

725
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:11,137
‐ Turn up the gain.
‐ You a relative?

726
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,906
‐ Not exactly.
‐ It's not capturing.

727
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:14,307
I know, but you did
come in with him.

728
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,909
Yeah. I drop by his house

729
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,277
a couple of times a week.

730
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,848
Mrs. Lang..

731
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:25,652
...your husband's
MRI results are done.

732
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,989
The tumor is blocking his, uh..

733
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,356
Is creating a blockage

734
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,158
that's increasing the
inter‐cranial pressure.

735
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:36,697
‐ And that's causing the coma?
‐ Yes.

736
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,665
So can it be unblocked?

737
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,068
Yes. A neurosurgeon
can perform a ventriculostomy.

738
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:44,871
So Bill could
come out of this?

739
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,773
He could. Um..

740
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,611
The outcome is problematic.

741
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,716
Your husband would have
very little time

742
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,985
and it may cause him
a great deal of pain.

743
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,223
And he would most likely die
of respiratory failure.

744
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:05,759
But Bill would wake up?

745
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:09,062
I mean, I could talk to him
again and he could hear me?

746
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:10,230
Yes.

747
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:13,734
Or he could stay
the way he is now

748
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,068
and die peacefully.

749
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:21,642
She wants to handle
the funeral arrangements?

750
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:22,676
Says he has
no family.

751
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,044
What's her relationship?

752
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,245
Friend.

753
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:26,279
I don't want
to sound judgmental

754
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,014
but she looks
like a hooker.

755
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,917
She is. She's been, uh,
attending him twice a week.

756
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,385
Mm‐hmm. Did you say
he had a Foley catheter?

757
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,887
Yeah.

758
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,722
Excuse me, Ms., uh..

759
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,924
Myra.

760
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:40,861
Ms. Myra. I wonder if you could
tell me exactly what happened.

761
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:43,163
I've been seeing Louis,
Mr. Palmieri

762
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:45,766
twice a week now,
for the past couple of years.

763
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:46,933
It wasn't a lot of money

764
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,034
but then I was only providing

765
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,770
a little manual relief.

766
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,338
But today,
my charm bracelet here

767
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:53,907
got caught
on that little tube

768
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,943
and when I pulled back,
the whole thing popped out

769
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,912
and the next thing I know
is there's blood everywhere.

770
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,848
So I called 911 right away.

771
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,349
‐ I see.
‐ 'Dr. Weaver.'

772
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:04,751
They're looking for you
at the front desk.

773
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,119
Some insurance company's
on the phone.

774
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,220
I'll be right there.

775
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,254
Excuse me.

776
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,958
I say give her the body.

777
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,060
Hey, Carter, you were here
a little while ago

778
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,195
talking to Dr. Greene?

779
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:16,296
Hmm.

780
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:18,231
Have you seen
a vial of Percocet?

781
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:20,967
I lost it somewhere
around the drug lock‐up.

782
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:24,437
No, I haven't, but
I'll keep my eyes open for you.

783
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,372
'First day's tour is always
the highlight of these visits.'

784
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,909
'Now I get to pore over these.'

785
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,043
'I went through
the last two weeks.'

786
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,778
'You guys do a lot of kids.'

787
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,413
‐ Elizabeth.
‐ Oh, Peter.

788
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,181
I'm afraid
I haven't much time right now.

789
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,417
I'm trying to catch Langstaff
after her gastroplasty.

790
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:39,019
‐ Langstaff?
‐ Yes.

791
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,087
I've heard she isn't
too keen on her fellow.

792
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,388
Thinking of letting
the chap go.

793
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,057
So, I thought
I should get a word in.

794
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:45,225
Well, don't you
think you should wait

795
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:47,193
to see if she
does let him go?

796
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,461
No, I think
it's a good idea

797
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:49,863
to let her know
I'm available.

798
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:51,131
And desperate.

799
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,833
Excuse me?

800
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,968
I mean, you know,
asking Dr. Anspaugh

801
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,369
in the middle
of an operation?

802
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,438
He didn't seem
put off by it. Why are you?

803
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,173
I'm not put off.

804
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:02,242
Listen, if it's about me
hanging you up in the ER

805
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:05,111
I'm sorry, and I really
appreciate your covering for me.

806
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:06,479
I wasn't hung up.
I mean, yeah.

807
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,348
I would've appreciated
a page or something

808
00:29:08,448 --> 00:29:11,184
letting me know
about Romano's letter.

809
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:14,287
Uh, look, I would have
discussed it with you

810
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:17,023
but Romano is
my first priority.

811
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,425
That bastard didn't
even give me a reason.

812
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:21,094
He's not required to.

813
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:24,164
He sponsored you.
I mean, it's his call.

814
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,266
You're certainly taking
all this in your stride.

815
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:29,002
I'm just trying to show you that
it's not necessarily about you.

816
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:31,171
No, Peter. From where I stand,
it's very much about me.

817
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,874
You have no idea how hard
I worked to get here.

818
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,876
No, I do know what
it takes to get here.

819
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,343
Well then, why aren't
you being more supportive?

820
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,279
Because I think you're going
about it the wrong way.

821
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:40,480
You know, you're
running all over the hospital

822
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:42,448
asking every surgeon
to sponsor you.

823
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,217
Okay, so what do you suggest?

824
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:45,819
Elizabeth, you haven't
even checked out

825
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,055
other hospitals,
other parts of the country.

826
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:52,859
I've built up relationships
here or so I thought.

827
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,195
I'm not saying I would
want you to leave Chicago.

828
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,197
No, but you're
not exactly passionate

829
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,498
about my fight to stay.

830
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,933
Whatever goes on
between you and I‐‐

831
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:01,568
Peter, there you are.

832
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:03,804
'You ready to scrub
on that small bowel infarction?'

833
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:04,871
Yes, sir.

834
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,081
Please let me finish.

835
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,416
Surely you understand

836
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:17,984
that admitting
the patient is not only..

837
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,185
I need you to
sign off on these charts.

838
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:20,286
I'm not working today.

839
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,421
Well, these are
from yesterday's.

840
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:22,956
I told you
I'm not working today.

841
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:25,258
Mark, Josh McNeal
is doing much better.

842
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:26,527
I wish you would've
told me about the meeting.

843
00:30:26,627 --> 00:30:28,194
‐ Well, I didn't get a chance.
‐ No!

844
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,897
...your policy
is not sound, Dr. Stork.

845
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:35,335
It's obscene, I mean, you're
spending $10,000 to save $500.

846
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,503
'Then so be it.'

847
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:39,272
I will admit
Mr. Wass to this hospital

848
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:40,574
'and I look forward
to billing you'

849
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:43,376
for every damn dime
we can possibly spend.

850
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:44,911
Jerry, admit Mr. Wass
to medicine.

851
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,146
Kerry, you want me
to call the company?

852
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:47,213
‐ Maybe that will help.
‐ I don't know.

853
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,882
I don't know
what helps anymore

854
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:50,050
and, you know, I don't care.

855
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,585
‐ Because I quit.
‐ What?

856
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:54,054
I quit as acting chief
of emergency medicine.

857
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:55,221
Let somebody else
act for a while.

858
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,857
Kerry, could wait a minute?

859
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,291
You know, why am I
the only idiot around here

860
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:00,026
who's worrying
about policy?

861
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:01,928
Doug Ross has...
he's got the right idea.

862
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,530
I mean, break the rules
if you think

863
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,999
it helps the patient,
everything else be damned.

864
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:08,168
Where do I get by
trying to follow them?

865
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:10,236
‐ Look, Kerry, wait.
‐ 'No.'

866
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,105
Hey, if anybody's
looking for me I'll be outside.

867
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,273
Cool.

868
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,149
Hey.

869
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,551
Hey, Carter.

870
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:25,886
Getting some air?

871
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:27,954
Yeah. I need it
after my last case.

872
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,923
Yeah. Me, too.

873
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,897
Listen, I was just
talking to Lydia Wright.

874
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:39,032
And, uh, she
mentioned to me

875
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,667
that some Percocet
has been missing

876
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:42,503
from the drug lock‐up.

877
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:44,137
That's low, Carter.

878
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:46,239
Hey, I'm not accusing
anybody. I'm just..

879
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,441
You know, you're my friend
so I thought you should know.

880
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:50,343
Well, Max is clean.

881
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:51,678
Maybe he is, but..

882
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:53,647
But what?

883
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,415
That's what Chase
used to say to me.

884
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,319
I got to get back.

885
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,531
The vitals are stable.
The boy's alert.

886
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:12,633
Looks to me like you got
your next journal article.

887
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:14,467
Yeah, right after they
draw and quarter me

888
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:17,203
in front of the executive
committee. Thank you.

889
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:20,140
We don't always get results
this good up here.

890
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,608
I'm gonna go check
on the Yezerski kid.

891
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,243
Okay.

892
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,278
What will happen now?
Back to his mother?

893
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:26,412
Ah, who knows?

894
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:28,582
I gave her
a list of names of doctors

895
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:31,384
who do ultrarapid
detox on adults

896
00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:35,055
but it doesn't change
the psychological addiction.

897
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:37,157
Well, at least
she's trying.

898
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:38,559
Come on, buddy.

899
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:42,395
Hey, I was just gonna
come looking for you.

900
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:44,064
You knocking
off already?

901
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:45,465
No, I got to go
over to St. Mark's

902
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:46,567
see how the unit's are doing.

903
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:47,634
What time you off?

904
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:48,969
7:00.

905
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,003
You wanna go out to Johnny D's

906
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:51,071
grab some dinner?

907
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,739
Yeah. Sure.

908
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:56,109
Uh, feeling good about
getting through those charts?

909
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,678
Yeah, I mean,
it'll be a week or two

910
00:32:57,778 --> 00:32:59,546
before I can
get a report out.

911
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,616
That is, if you can stand
to have me around that long.

912
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:04,518
Any hints on what
your recommendation will be?

913
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:07,253
'What usually happens
when I recommend in favor'

914
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,556
of an ER pedes department is..

915
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,992
'...they ask me to run it.'

916
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:14,094
'I've always said no'

917
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:16,396
but this time, I could be
convinced to say yes.

918
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:20,166
You mean, stay in Chicago?

919
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:22,402
Only if you want me to.

920
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:25,105
Wow. I hadn't really
thought that far ahead.

921
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:38,184
I heard some
Percocet was missing.

922
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:41,121
Yeah. I heard that, too.

923
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:43,023
I didn't take it.

924
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:45,692
I didn't suspect
that you did.

925
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,594
You'd be crazy not to.

926
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,767
Well, I didn't want to suspect
that you did, anyway.

927
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,569
Don't feel bad about it.

928
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:02,609
I know, I've used up
all my free passes with you

929
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:06,146
but I'm telling you the truth..

930
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:09,516
...and I'm willing to prove it..

931
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:10,584
...every day.

932
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,355
It's not that I don't
believe you. It's just‐‐

933
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:17,290
'Anna?'

934
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,592
Labs are back on that MI.

935
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,594
Thanks, Lily.
I'll be right there.

936
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:25,198
Alright.
Go. Be a doctor.

937
00:34:25,298 --> 00:34:28,234
I'll call you later.

938
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,402
Sure.

939
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:33,707
Where's Mrs. Lang?
Where's her husband?

940
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,141
Mark Greene signed a transfer

941
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:36,376
to White Memorial
a half hour ago.

942
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:37,578
Why White Memorial?

943
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:39,412
I don't know. Maybe
his doctor's there.

944
00:34:39,513 --> 00:34:40,681
Oh. Are they going to do
the ventriculostomy?

945
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:42,448
She didn't say.

946
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:44,250
Didn't you tell her there wasn't
much they could do for him?

947
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,086
Yeah, I just would've
liked to have known

948
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:47,554
what she was going to chose.

949
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:48,589
Why?

950
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:51,324
Why? Um, I don't know.

951
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,394
It just seems
unsettled, unfinished.

952
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:55,596
We never know what
happens to people

953
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:57,163
when they leave here.

954
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,332
Okay.

955
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:01,668
Oh, uh, you haven't seen
Anna around, have you?

956
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,570
No.

957
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,639
Ah, there it goes again.

958
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,440
‐ There goes what again?
‐ That car alarm.

959
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:09,510
It keeps
starting up and shutting off

960
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,644
and starting up.

961
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:12,112
Really annoying.

962
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:13,146
It's out in the ambulance bay

963
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:14,247
and I called security

964
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:16,116
but who knows
where they ever are?

965
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:18,652
Mark, Kerry, this is the
accident report on Josh McNeal

966
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:19,853
if you want to go
over anything.

967
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:22,355
You mean, like maybe
why you lied to me?

968
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:23,824
You wouldn't
have understood, Mark.

969
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,425
Oh, yeah. Well, you didn't
really give me a chance.

970
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:27,894
You know what? Take it outside.
We got work to do.

971
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:29,630
Dr. Weaver, if you're
no longer acting chief

972
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,533
who do I give
these budget review forms to?

973
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:33,667
I'll take 'em.

974
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,202
This kid was
more important.

975
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,904
You're always got a patient
excuse to hide behind.

976
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:39,740
When it's necessary,
I'm willing to go out on a limb.

977
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,242
Go on a limb? You took the whole
tree with you this time.

978
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:43,744
I was trying
to support you.

979
00:35:43,844 --> 00:35:44,845
You've come
to pedes attending, Mark?

980
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:46,279
You were never
going to support me

981
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:47,447
if it meant giving up
that much authority.

982
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:48,849
We'll never know now,
will we?

983
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,517
Because you did
what you always do.

984
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,285
You go after
something you want

985
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:54,354
and when you're just about
to get it, you sabotage it.

986
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:55,756
Is that what
you're so angry about?

987
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:58,458
Look, I'm not angry,
okay. I'm disappointed.

988
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,326
You like being
disappointed in me, Mark.

989
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:01,795
It validates the fact
that you are the adult

990
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:02,829
and I'm the screw‐up.

991
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,698
You never wanted to grow up.

992
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:06,399
You don't want me to. You like
our friendship the way it is.

993
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:07,433
We go out, we have
a couple of beers

994
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:08,669
we come here, you're the boss

995
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:10,571
and for good reason,
based on your actions.

996
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,540
Based on your inability
to see me as an equal, Mark.

997
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,841
It was bad enough
when Kerry stepped up.

998
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:16,209
I supported her in that.

999
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,511
You supported her
on the surface, yes.

1000
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:19,179
Underneath,
you resented her.

1001
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,181
Like you resent what
I'm doing with Josh McNeal.

1002
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:23,584
Have you seen Mark? I need his
signature on the Haney chart.

1003
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,286
Uh, he and Dr. Ross
are outside, sharing.

1004
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:27,554
Okay.

1005
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:33,426
Mr. Nable?
What are you doing here?

1006
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:34,628
Mr. Nable, are you hurt?

1007
00:36:34,728 --> 00:36:36,329
Are you okay?

1008
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:38,398
Come on. Come with me.
Come on.

1009
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:42,836
I'm so sorry.

1010
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:44,905
Where is all this
blood from, Mr. Nable?

1011
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:47,608
Come this way. I'm gonna
check you over, okay?

1012
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,644
You just sit down
right here.

1013
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,248
That's my car, um..

1014
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,483
The alarm's always doing
that. I don't know why.

1015
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:59,419
You drove here?

1016
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,421
Okay. We're gonna get someone
to turn that alarm off for you.

1017
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:02,989
Do you have
a remote button or something?

1018
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:08,428
‐ Oh, God.
‐ There weren't enough bullets.

1019
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:11,431
‐ Alright. Um, uh, Jeanie.
‐ Yeah?

1020
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:12,566
‐ Can you stay with Mr. Nable?
‐ What's going on?

1021
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:13,767
Just be careful.

1022
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:15,769
Jerry, stick this
away somewhere

1023
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,804
and call security
to help Jeanie.

1024
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:19,540
Doug, Mark!
Come on! The car!

1025
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:24,645
Come on!

1026
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:28,448
What is it?

1027
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:29,783
‐ It's locked.
‐ Who's in here?

1028
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:31,852
Can you see anyone?

1029
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:33,353
I can't see anything.

1030
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:35,355
There's something
in the back seat.

1031
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:36,790
It's two kids.

1032
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,858
I'll break a window.

1033
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,728
'Hang on.'

1034
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:47,333
It's a woman in the front,
two kids in the back.

1035
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,836
Mark, hit the locks.
The door won't open.

1036
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:53,574
Got it. Alright.

1037
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:55,642
Jerry! Get us three gurneys.

1038
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:56,910
'Backboards and head collars.'

1039
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,880
Get some help now, too.

1040
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,715
I got a 40‐year‐old woman

1041
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:03,884
gunshot wound to the left neck

1042
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:05,819
'a weak carotid pulse.'

1043
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,688
‐ She's barely breathing.
‐ I got a 13‐year‐old.

1044
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,423
‐ A GSW to the abdomen.
‐ 'What's going on?'

1045
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:11,758
There's some kinda accident
in the ambulance bay.

1046
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,560
Jerry, hurry up
and get those out there.

1047
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,661
I got the
flashlights.

1048
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,062
Everyone use blood precautions.

1049
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:17,631
‐ What is it?
‐ Get outside.

1050
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:19,533
See if you can help.
Lydia, call for o‐neg.

1051
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:20,801
‐ How much?
‐ At least 15 units.

1052
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:22,869
Randi, close us
to trauma and page surgery.

1053
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,404
‐ Kerry, I need to talk to you.
‐ In a minute.

1054
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,906
‐ No, now. This is the guy.
‐ What guy?

1055
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:28,441
Whatever's happened out there,
I think Mr. Nable..

1056
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:31,612
Okay, call security now
move him to curtain three

1057
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:32,979
and have them post
someone at the door.

1058
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,649
Yosh, help Jeanie with this man.

1059
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:37,618
Jerry, push the
gurney closer.

1060
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:38,919
C‐collar secure.

1061
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:40,320
Anything else I can do?

1062
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,822
Yeah. Help lift her.

1063
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:43,323
‐ Watch her head.
‐ Okay.

1064
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:45,726
‐ Gently, gently.
‐ Alright.

1065
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,894
Anna, grab her legs.
I'll support her neck, okay?

1066
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,663
‐ Okay. I'm underneath her.
‐ Support's in.

1067
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,565
Mommy. Where's my mommy?

1068
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:52,799
‐ It's okay, honey.
‐ Slide her out

1069
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:54,334
Really, really
gently, really slow.

1070
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,435
Get this side.

1071
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:57,003
She's got a weak
carotid pulse.

1072
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:59,873
Flat neck veins,
decent respiratory effort

1073
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:01,107
trachea midline.

1074
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,877
We're going to
roll him now. We're rolling.

1075
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,546
‐ Nice and easy.
‐ Slide him in.

1076
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:07,614
Hang on. Let's roll
him back. Nice and easy.

1077
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:09,382
‐ 'Come on, Malik.'
‐ Malik, give me a hand.

1078
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:10,551
Top of the board.

1079
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,720
On my count.
One, two...three.

1080
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,589
‐ 'Three.'
‐ 'Three.'

1081
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:17,057
‐ 'I'll start a line.'
‐ Which one have you got?

1082
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:19,926
Little girl.

1083
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,862
Good breath sounds
on the left.

1084
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:23,797
A few crackles
at the right base.

1085
00:39:23,897 --> 00:39:25,832
Hi. I'm Dr. Weaver.

1086
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:27,634
We're going to take
very good care of you.

1087
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:28,735
What's your name, sweetie?

1088
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:31,004
Amy.

1089
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:33,139
CBC, Chem 20,
two lines saline

1090
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,575
wide open
cross for eight.

1091
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:35,642
Not moving much air.

1092
00:39:35,742 --> 00:39:37,711
I got to tube him. 6.5!

1093
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:38,812
Pulse 120.

1094
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:39,913
BP's 70 over 50.

1095
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:41,447
‐ Suction.
‐ I got it.

1096
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,783
We need o‐negative
on the rapid infuser.

1097
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:43,950
I'll get it.

1098
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:47,087
Hey, Jeanie,
what's going on?

1099
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,022
A guy shot his wife
and two kids.

1100
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:51,592
‐ Oh, man. Damn.
‐ Yeah.

1101
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:53,026
'Hold on.
We're going to help you.'

1102
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:54,695
The other doctors are
helping your children.

1103
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:56,429
We'll tell you
as soon as we know anything.

1104
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,064
‐ They are in good hands.
‐ Elizabeth?

1105
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:00,500
Intubated.
Had a respiratory arrest.

1106
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,035
‐ Where's the wound?
‐ Left neck.

1107
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:03,904
BP's 80 palp.

1108
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:06,507
Start Dopamine,
ten mics per kilo per minute.

1109
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:07,808
We'll need high dose
Solu‐Medrol.

1110
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:08,975
How much?

1111
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,712
50 milligrams
per kilo over 20 minutes

1112
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:13,947
then five per kilo per hour.

1113
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,516
Lily, send off
the pre‐op labs.

1114
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,618
We need X‐ray in here
for a portable c‐spine.

1115
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:20,621
Dr. Benton, there's a Jackson
Kroopf on the phone for you.

1116
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:21,688
Who?

1117
00:40:21,788 --> 00:40:22,956
Something about a hearing test.

1118
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:24,124
Tell him
I'll call him back.

1119
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:25,726
Carotid's okay.
What about yours?

1120
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:27,093
Strong and regular.

1121
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:28,895
It looks like
it missed the major vessels.

1122
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:30,496
Any sub‐q air on your side?

1123
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,033
No. Tube went straight in.
Trachea's intact.

1124
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:34,067
What's her name?

1125
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:35,902
Husband's name is Nable.

1126
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:38,672
Mrs. Nable,
can you squeeze my hand?

1127
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:42,543
That was good.
Try again.

1128
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:45,879
'X‐ray's here.'

1129
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:47,681
‐ 'Where's Mark?'
‐ Next door.

1130
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:52,118
Mark, the police
are here for Mr. Nable.

1131
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:53,587
They need you
to medically clear him.

1132
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:54,655
Yeah, I'll be
there in a minute.

1133
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:55,856
Jeanie, find out
this boy's name.

1134
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:57,190
‐ Yeah.
‐ It'd be nice to know his name.

1135
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,826
Chest tube, 28 French,
set up the Thora‐Seal.

1136
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:01,662
Hang two more units
on the infuser.

1137
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:02,729
It's getting hard to bag.

1138
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:04,698
Yeah. Poor air entry
on the left.

1139
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,066
Lost the pulse.

1140
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:08,034
‐ Asystole.
‐ Alright. Start compressions.

1141
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,905
‐ I'm not feeling a pulse.
‐ Okay.

1142
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:14,007
He's bleeding out.
Let's get a central line kit.

1143
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:15,809
‐ Doug, you got to crack him.
‐ Thoracotomy tray.

1144
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:16,977
Give me a ten blade.

1145
00:41:26,704 --> 00:41:28,874
Mr. Nable, we need
to know your son's name.

1146
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:29,975
Is he going to be alright?

1147
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:33,045
They're working
on him right now.

1148
00:41:33,145 --> 00:41:34,412
I turned the gun..

1149
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:37,916
There weren't
any more bullets.

1150
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:42,487
I need a chest tube.

1151
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,022
Whoa, what
are you doing?

1152
00:41:44,122 --> 00:41:45,523
There's an obvious hemopneumo.

1153
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:47,793
The wound is in the
seventh intercostal space.

1154
00:41:47,893 --> 00:41:49,762
It could be strictly
intra‐abdominal.

1155
00:41:49,862 --> 00:41:50,963
She might not need
a chest tube.

1156
00:41:51,063 --> 00:41:52,798
The exam's consistent
with a hemopneumo.

1157
00:41:52,898 --> 00:41:54,066
Hang on a minute.
She's stable.

1158
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,333
Lydia, let's get an X‐ray.

1159
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:57,369
I don't think
she's too stable.

1160
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:59,237
Amy, does it hurt
anywhere else, honey?

1161
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:00,372
Take my hand, sweetheart.

1162
00:42:00,472 --> 00:42:01,974
Are my mom
and my brother okay?

1163
00:42:02,074 --> 00:42:04,142
Yeah. They're taking
care of them right now.

1164
00:42:04,242 --> 00:42:05,543
I thought we were
just gonna drive here

1165
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:06,912
and everything would be okay.

1166
00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:08,046
I know.

1167
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:10,482
Why did my daddy have a gun?

1168
00:42:10,582 --> 00:42:12,284
'My mom told him he
could take us all with him'

1169
00:42:12,384 --> 00:42:13,952
'if we came straight here
to talk to somebody.'

1170
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:15,553
It's okay.

1171
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:18,023
I thought we were just
gonna talk to somebody.

1172
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:25,497
‐ 'Malik, prime the lines.'
‐ 'Satinsky. Suction.'

1173
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:26,965
Do it.

1174
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:28,133
What do you have?

1175
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:30,869
A hole in the heart,
right ventricle.

1176
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:32,905
Keep your finger on it.

1177
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:34,572
Line's in. Hook it up.

1178
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:37,142
Two‐o silk
on an atraumatic needle.

1179
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:38,944
Rapid infuser ready.

1180
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:39,978
I'll occlude. You sew.

1181
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:41,413
Hold compression.

1182
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:42,815
Keep your finger
on the defect.

1183
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:44,416
Alright.
Don't stick me.

1184
00:42:44,516 --> 00:42:45,483
Chuny, we need
more blood.

1185
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,052
Okay. Hold this.

1186
00:42:49,421 --> 00:42:51,156
‐ How's she doing?
‐ She'll make it

1187
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:52,991
but there's an injury
to the spinal cord.

1188
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:54,492
We're taking
her up to CT Now.

1189
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:55,560
Alright, people.
Let's move.

1190
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,995
Keep me apprised.

1191
00:42:57,095 --> 00:42:58,263
Anna, did you call the OR?

1192
00:42:58,363 --> 00:42:59,397
They're waiting for us.

1193
00:42:59,497 --> 00:43:01,066
You're gonna
be okay, Amy.

1194
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,835
We're just gonna take you
upstairs to get some surgery.

1195
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:03,902
And we'll let you
know how your mom

1196
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:05,470
and your brother
are doing, okay?

1197
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,173
Tell the surgeon to call us
as soon as he knows anything.

1198
00:43:08,273 --> 00:43:09,474
‐ How's the boy?
‐ Still working on him.

1199
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:14,546
I think we should call
that psych resident Myers.

1200
00:43:14,646 --> 00:43:15,981

1201
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:17,449
‐ But he's coming back in.
‐ Great.

1202
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:19,351
She was gonna take..

1203
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:20,853
...Amy and Steven with her.

1204
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:24,122
I couldn't let her do that.

1205
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:27,125

00:43:46,644 --> 00:43:49,047
He's got a rhythm.

1220
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:50,482
Sutures still holding.

Alright.
Call the blood bank.

1224
00:43:56,154 --> 00:43:57,289
Have them send up eight units

1225
00:43:57,389 --> 00:43:58,623
type‐specific to the OR.

1226
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:00,425
‐ You got it.

1227
00:44:00,525 --> 00:44:02,260

Everybody ready?
Alright. Let's get him up.
