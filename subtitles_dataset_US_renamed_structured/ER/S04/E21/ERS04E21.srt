1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,307
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,343
It was really lovely last night.

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,547
I would really like you
to consider, um, a date.

4
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,349
Seeing as I‐I do
work for you..

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,652
...I don't think it
would be such a good idea.

6
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,121
‐ Oh, I see, you have a policy.
‐ Yeah, yes‐‐

7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,689
No fraternization
with people at work.

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,690
Oh, well, Okay.

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,327
‐ It's okay.
‐ He's in heroin withdrawal.

10
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,796
The mother's been stealing
his methadone between fixes.

11
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,164
So she split?

12
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,411
Peter, have you ever heard
of the Velvet Lounge?

13
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,680
Of course.

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,181
I saw in "The Tribune"
they're having

15
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,250
a jam session there tonight.

16
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,152
That's on the south side.
You don't want to go there.

17
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,854
What, you mean
it's a rough area?

18
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,124
No, I just mean
it's not a good idea.

19
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,594
Listen, when I was in Belfast,
I went to the Bog side

20
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:34,761
to hear Lick the Tins.

21
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,431
It's an IRA stronghold.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,435
It's not the same thing.

23
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,870
'Now, what are
the plans for his discharge?'

24
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,740
Well, his vitals are stable.

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,742
‐ Any vomiting or diarrhea?
‐ No.

26
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,276
He's keeping down PO's

27
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,478
and he's back
on his dose of methadone.

28
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,680
I'd like to start
him on a course

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,181
of long‐term withdrawal.

30
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,250
Mrs. Thorvaldsen
from DCFS come by?

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,319
Yes. We had a team meeting.

32
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,154
Everybody understands that this
baby cannot live with a mother

33
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,556
that steals his methadone.

34
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,290
We all agree with your notes.

35
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,859
The home
environment is unsuitable

36
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,230
'and social services
has found a foster family.'

37
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,232
People that have
experience with drug babies?

38
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,502
‐ Mother's a retired nurse.
‐ Yeah.

39
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,504
Hi.

40
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,173
Just making sure you don't
slip through the cracks, kiddo.

41
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,884
'Hi, Carter.'

42
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,786
I wanted to catch you
before you got in.

43
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,488
‐ Anything wrong?
‐ No, everything's great.

44
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,858
Uh, actually, you met my friend
the other night from Philly.

45
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,926
Max? Yeah, you
showing him the town?

46
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,728
Remember I told you
that I was involved

47
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,430
with somebody
and it wasn't quite over yet?

48
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,766
Yeah, I figured
he was the guy.

49
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,201
Yeah.

50
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,435
What about his
heroin addiction?

51
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,571
Oh, it wasn't heroin.

52
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,706
It was painkillers,
Percocet.

53
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,275
He's doing okay.
Actually, he's here for a job.

54
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,844
He's, uh, coming in this morning
to do a feasibility study

55
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,681
on setting up
a pedes unit in the ER.

56
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,616
That doesn't sound
like a coincidence.

57
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,485
Listen, uh..

58
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:06,920
...Carter, before
you run into him

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,623
I've‐I've given you a really
one‐sided picture of Max.

60
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,293
He's, he's smart,
he's very dedicated.

61
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,762
He's a,
he's a really good guy.

62
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,463
You want me to like him?

63
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,599
I just don't want
you to judge him

64
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,867
for things I've
said in the past.

65
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,803
Sounds like you guys are
already back together.

66
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,671
I don't know about that.

67
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,806
Honestly, I don't.

68
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,275
Where is he now?

69
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,343
My place.

70
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,835
Malik, who left
this with my mail?

71
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,971
Mr. Dougherty
from Salutech.

72
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,674
Yeah, well,
see that it gets returned.

73
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,009
Some salesman from
Salutech left me a pen.

74
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,477
Well, yeah,
I got mine right here.

75
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:38,979
He also left a bunch
of free samples.

76
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,782
Well, I won't be bribed
into using their products.

77
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,751
Kerry, Mark, you
know Dr. Keinholz

78
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,886
chief of pediatrics

79
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,420
and Dean of
the med school.

80
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,790
‐ Nice to see you.
‐ This is Dr. Rosher.

81
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,492
‐ 'Doctors Greene and Weaver.'
‐ Nice to meet you.

82
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:56,396
Dr. Rosher's a pediatrician
and assistant professor at Chop.

83
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,698
He's evaluating the need

84
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,333
for pediatric emergency
centers at urban ER's

85
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,835
and we feel very fortunate

86
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,937
that he's responded
to our call for a study here.

87
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,039
I thought this matter
was still under discussion.

88
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,042
Well, it happens that Dr. Rosher
is free at this time.

89
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,612
I just finished a similar study
at Hennepin County.

90
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,479
Listen, I have to scrub
in a few minutes, but I'm sure

91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,481
you'll provide all the support
that Dr. Rosher needs.

92
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,484
‐ Sure, no problem.
‐ Thank you, doctors.

93
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,524
So, they sprung me
on you. Sorry.

94
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,892
No, it's fine, I'd
be happy to review

95
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,328
our pediatric census
statistics with you.

96
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,363
First, I'd like to get
a sense of the place.

97
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,465
Sure, you can
follow me around, Dr. Rosher.

98
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,334
I hate formality.
I'm Max.

99
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,969
‐ Mark.
‐ Kerry.

100
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,437
Is there any place
that I can stash

101
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,072
these things maybe
get a cup of coffee?

102
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,708
Uh, Randi, could you show
Dr. Rosher to the lounge?

103
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,777
‐ Sure.
‐ Thanks.

104
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,911
You know where
this comes from?

105
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,880
Doug Ross,
lobbying upstairs.

106
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,381
It's just
a feasibility study.

107
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,750
You think he doesn't
have an agenda?

108
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,051
He's trying
to find fault with

109
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,653
the way we handle
pediatric patients.

110
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,989
We have nothing to hide.
We take great care of kids.

111
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,724
Hey, Jeanie, do you
have a busy morning?

112
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,892
Not so bad. Why?

113
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,594
Our talk on managing
abdominal pain

114
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,395
with the med students
is next week.

115
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,030
Could you see if the slides
are ready at graphics?

116
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,832
‐ Sure.
‐ Thank you.

117
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,854
I would warn you, if you
don't see me making the coffee..

118
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,591
...I would avoid it.

119
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:34,460
Mocha, Vanilla, Amaretto.
It's my own very personal stock.

120
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,862
Mm.

121
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,698
Thanks. You're..

122
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:41,434
Randi, acting unit
service coordinator.

123
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,103
‐ How's it going?
‐ Hi.

124
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,607
Meeting everyone?

125
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:47,674
Yeah.

126
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,644
I encountered
the usual dynamic.

127
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,046
The attendings
see me as the spy.

128
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,881
Sent in to undermine
their authority.

129
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,750
Mm.

130
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,852
How are you doing?

131
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,987
It's a little awkward
seeing you here.

132
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,523
Was it awkward last night?

133
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,928
No.

134
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:08,995
No.

135
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,566
But now you're nervous.

136
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,035
I don't know.

137
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,671
I don't know, you just show up
and you're back in my life

138
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,973
and that's not exactly
how I planned it.

139
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,775
I never planned it
any other way.

140
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,746
‐ Peter?
‐ 'Yeah.'

141
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,048
Have you got a case
to present for morning report?

142
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,550
Should I wait outside?

143
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,986
Uh, when have you
ever waited outside?

144
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:37,624
Oh. You don't see me
as a shy English rose?

145
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,994
Elizabeth, I see you
as many things.

146
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,028
Shy is not one of them.

147
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,232
‐ Busy morning?
‐ A par thyroidectomy.

148
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,467
Mm‐hmm.

149
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:48,902
Hey, um,
I know you like jazz

150
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,004
so I was thinking maybe we could

151
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,006
go to the Coq d'Or
at the Drake Hotel.

152
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,975
I heard the guy on the piano
over there is pretty good.

153
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,510
Sure. That'd be great.

154
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,011
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

155
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,916
Peter?
Oh, hi, Lizzie.

156
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,152
Are we frequenting
the, uh, men's locker room?

157
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,655
Peter, I've got a pyloroplasty
at 3:00 p. m., any interest?

158
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,956
I'm scrubbing in with Anspaugh.

159
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,526
‐ 'Got it.'
‐ Oh, uh, I'm free.

160
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,260
Oh, that's alright.
I got a backup.

161
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,097
Did he see us?

162
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,067
I don't know.

163
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,505
Right, at least one exam room
with color murals and toys.

164
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,006
And then in chairs,
you section off

165
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,041
so the kids don't sit
next to some nut case.

166
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,677
So you're in favor of setting up
a whole department.

167
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:31,945
I'll get myself in trouble
talking about this

168
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,179
in front of my buddy.

169
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,015
No need for caution
on my account.

170
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,717
I'm keeping an open mind.

171
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,652
A department here
would be great

172
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,987
but I would settle for
a full‐time pedes attending.

173
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,056
That's the position
Doug is bucking for.

174
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,125
Whether it's me or somebody
else, it's important.

175
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,260
I won't lie to you,
I want the job.

176
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,862
So you have
a problem with that.

177
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,831
Hey, set up a pedes department,
what's next?

178
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,633
Geriatric emergency medicine?

179
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,801
Dr. Del Amico,
meet Dr. Rosher.

180
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,970
Stay on your toes,
he's doing a study on us.

181
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,672
I think she was
born on her toes.

182
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,240
Max was my attending
at Chop.

183
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,576
Ah, another ally.

184
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,111
Well, I'm really feeling
outnumbered by pediatricians.

185
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,781
Actually, I'm double‐boarded
in emergency medicine and peds.

186
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,816
'Dr. Rosher.'

187
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,685
I've pulled together
some charts which I believe

188
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,819
could be relevant
to your study.

189
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,120
Oh, sure.

190
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,789
And I've set up
a place for you in the lounge.

191
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,190
Actually, I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

192
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,892
Oh, well,
you know, I have time

193
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,727
to go over them
with you right now.

194
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,797
I'll see someone gets you if any
special pedes cases come in.

195
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,935
One Tina Marie Chambliss.
She wouldn't give her age.

196
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,671
Complains of fever
and facial erythema

197
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,105
following a facelift
five days ago.

198
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,574
She came in an ambulance?

199
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,642
It was a blepharoplasty
and a rhytidoplasty.

200
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,977
Looks like
a wound infection.

201
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,812
Uh, could we sign her in
under a different name?

202
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,614
I don't want her to be mobbed,
while she's here.

203
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,984
‐ Mobbed?
‐ Let the doctors do their work.

204
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,753
Hey, ma'am, you gonna have
to scoot on over here.

205
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:50,691
Uh, go on, honey.
I can tell you're in good hands.

206
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,160
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to examine your face.

207
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,597
I just look so awful.

208
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,865
Emmet, stay by me, honey.
Don't leave me.

209
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh, I'm right
here, sweetie.

210
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,636
Channeling my love
to help you mend.

211
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,670
‐ Temp's 102.
‐ That's good.

212
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,773
Let's get a CBC,
blood cultures

213
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:07,808
start a line.

214
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,109
Do you have any allergies?

215
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,077
Uh, she's allergic
to sulfa antibiotics

216
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,946
'and she had a cough
from the ace inhibitors.'

217
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,715
Dr. Emmet Chambliss,
her husband.

218
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,783
‐ I'm charged with her care.
‐ So you're her physician?

219
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,284
Uh, doctor of divinities.

220
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,254
Um, I'm diabetic.
You probably should know that.

221
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,057
Malik, add a Chem 7.
Give her a gram of Ancef.

222
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,391
Do you take insulin?

223
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,694
Uh, she gets 24 NPH
with ten of regular

224
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,630
in the morning,
12 of NPH, five at night.

225
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,199
He gives me the shots.
I can't stand needles.

226
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,234
Oh, what's that you're
putting on my face?

227
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,869
Uh, saline, just salt water.

228
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,938
Well, I‐I hope it's
not too harsh for my skin.

229
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,306
Uh, this is the cleanser
we normally use.

230
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,108
It's hypoallergenic.

231
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,811
Dr. Del Amico, I think you've
got a handle on this one.

232
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,180
Yeah, thanks.

233
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,248
What about our broadcast?

234
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,116
Oh, don't worry, honey.

235
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,052
I can get a mobile truck
with a satellite uplink

236
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,120
with just one phone call.

237
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,856
But how long am I
going to be sick?

238
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,090
Uh, you have
a serious infection.

239
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,959
You're going to need
some IV antibiotics.

240
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,027
Probably gonna be
a couple of days.

241
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,264
‐ Doug.
‐ 'Yeah.'

242
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,232
I've got a two‐year‐old kid
with severe rat bites.

243
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,367
Can we give him
something for the pain?

244
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,669
Yeah, I'll take
a look at him.

245
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,871
He's in exam two.

246
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,974
‐ What's the weight?
‐ 14 kilos.

247
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,977
Hey.
When did this happen?

248
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,979
About 6:00 a. m.,
they heard him scream.

249
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,853
'There were rats this big,
biting his fingers.'

250
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,388
'Eatin' him, because
of his screams'

251
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,056
'they thought he was
fighting with his brother.'

252
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,793
He's current on his vaccines
and up to date his tetanus.

253
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,031
She says they attack all of
the children in the building.

254
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:42,168
Okay, we're gonna start an IV.
Titrate morphine for his pain.

255
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,804
This one's through
the palmar fascia.

256
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,438
Plastics should
do it in the OR.

257
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,708
'Let's irrigate this wound.'

258
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,242
Tell 'em I'm gonna speak
to the authorities

259
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,811
to make sure there are
no more rats in the building.

260
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,885
He says they come
but they never do anything.

261
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,153
Well, this time they will.

262
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,093
‐ Hi, Bob.
‐ Well, hey, Jeanie. What's up?

263
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,762
I had the flu
a couple of weeks ago

264
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,063
and I can't seem
to shake a cough.

265
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,464
We're seeing
a lot of viral pneumonia.

266
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,266
You, uh, talk to a doc?

267
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,300
No, I didn't
wanna go through

268
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,969
a big work‐up for nothing.

269
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,137
So you want a quick chest film?

270
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,438
Could you?

271
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,206
You know two weeks ago,
I cut my hand

272
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,176
and I just wanted
a few stitches.

273
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,246
Next thing, I'm on a gurney
hooked to an IV for six hours.

274
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,114
'All these docs overreact.'

275
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,089
Should I flash your name
for your medical record?

276
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,058
No, that's okay.

277
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,060
'No problem. No paperwork.
That's what I like.'

278
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,232
Take a deep breath
and hold.

279
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,175
Have you seen Dr. Rosher?

280
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,210
I got a six‐year‐old
with pityriasis.

281
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,379
Dr. Weaver's holding him
hostage in the lounge.

282
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,215
Mark, I gave Dr. Rosher
enough reading material

283
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,384
I don't think we need to worry
about occupying his time.

284
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,119
I want him
to see how we work.

285
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,555
I'm gonna get him out of there.

286
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,124
Lizzie, meet
Tancred Baumgartner, 64.

287
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,459
History of hypertension
and peripheral vascular disease

288
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,061
80 pack year smoker.

289
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,363
‐ 80 pack years?
‐ Two packs a day for 40 years.

290
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,266
But I'm cutting back
I'm going to get hypnotized.

291
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,169
Mm‐hmm. So what brought you
in today, Mr. Baumgartner?

292
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,907
‐ Terrible pain in my legs.
‐ How far can you walk?

293
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:31,111
Six months ago, I could walk two
blocks before I had to rest.

294
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,179
Now he complains of calf pain
when he walks to the toilet.

295
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,549
I've got him on the schedule
for a fem‐pop bypass.

296
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,350
You should review
his films.

297
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,919
Don't worry,
Mr. Baumgartner.

298
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:43,289
We'll put a spring
back in your step.

299
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,825
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you

300
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,059
uh, have you given
any more thought

301
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,361
to that impressive offer
you got recently?

302
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,164
‐ Well, which impressive offer?
‐ There's been more than one?

303
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,433
I'm talking about
the senior lecturer's position

304
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,168
at the Gloucestershire
Royal Hospital.

305
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,336
I decided to pass.

306
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,071
Really? Did you
already let them know?

307
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,239
I've written them
a letter, yes.

308
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,174
‐ Ouch.
‐ What?

309
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,909
Takes guts, Lizzie.

310
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,545
You don't know if you
have a future here.

311
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:10,551
And have him lay flat on
his back for the next two hours.

312
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,218
I'll hand‐carry
the specimens to the lab.

313
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,120
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

314
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,956
And, Kerry, would you
take a look at this X‐ray?

315
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,423
Sure.

316
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,526
Oh, and, uh, don't forget
to get a gram stain.

317
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,395
What have you got?

318
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,364
Thirty one‐year‐old woman
with a three week history

319
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,032
of dry cough
and intermittent fever.

320
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,901
‐ Is she a smoker?
‐ 'No.'

321
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,503
Any travel
outside the country?

322
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,604
I don't think so.

323
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,039
Did you ask
about her HIV status?

324
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,340
I don't know if
she's been tested.

325
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,176
What do you see?

326
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:37,911
There might be
an early infiltrate

327
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:42,248
at the right base
or it may just be atelectasis.

328
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,951
‐ Where's the lateral?
‐ That's all we have.

329
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,020
Alright, repeat the film,
have her take a deeper breath

330
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,555
then and get
a lateral this time.

331
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,290
Also there's no name
on this film.

332
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,993
Let the techs know that,
that's really unacceptable.

333
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,195
Oh, and, Jeanie,
uh, the slides?

334
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,496
Sorry?

335
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,264
This morning
I asked you to get

336
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,300
the slides from graphics,
did you forget?

337
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,335
Uh, no, just haven't
had the time yet.

338
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,369
Should I have
someone else do it?

339
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,671
No, I'll get them right now.

340
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:05,672
Okay.

341
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,344
We need some help here.

342
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,514
We were coming from visiting
my folks up in St. Lioba

343
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,248
and our son
passed out in the car.

344
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,349
‐ Need a gurney.
‐ 'You got it.'

345
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,351
'Hey, Malik.'

346
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,320
We're also gonna need
high flow oxygen too, Malik.

347
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,388
‐ I'll set it up.
‐ Any history of heart disease?

348
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,457
‐ Uh, no.
‐ Is he on any medications?

349
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:25,692
No. He's perfectly healthy.

350
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,060
He never gets sick.

351
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,430
My God, what's wrong with him?

352
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,498
He's tachy at 150.

353
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,234
Resps are high, 28.

354
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,435
Why is he
breathing so fast?

355
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,504
‐ Does he have asthma?
‐ No.

356
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,406
Alright, Connie, put him
on a pulse ox and an EKG.

357
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:44,377
And I want a CBC, Chem 7,
blood gas, a chest film.

358
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:48,081
I'll start a line.
Sam. Sam, can you hear me?

359
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,650
‐ What's wrong with him?
‐ He's cyanotic.

360
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,151
You see how blue his lips are?

361
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,185
Means, he's not
getting enough oxygen.

362
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,587
Why?

363
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,155
That's what we're
gonna try and figure out.

364
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,961
How are you doing?

365
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,063
Oh, just trying
to look decent again.

366
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,731
I don't think
that's a good idea.

367
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,100
Oh, I can't
be seen on TV

368
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,369
without my woolly bears
and makeup.

369
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,038
‐ You ever see us on JGCN?
‐ No.

370
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,674
Jesus Gospel Cable Network?

371
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,742
The makeup could make your
infection worse, Mrs. Chambliss.

372
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,712
Oh no, now, honey,
you call me Tina Marie.

373
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,347
Hello, doctor.
Isn't she an angel?

374
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,150
I'm seeing the power of prayer
and modern medicine.

375
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,019
Well, we have her
blood test results

376
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,055
and there is
reason for concern.

377
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,323
My face?

378
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,659
No. Actually, your
kidneys are the problem.

379
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,260
I'm passing water.

380
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,162
Your BUN and
creatinine are elevated

381
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,764
indicating a problem
with your kidneys

382
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,432
probably from
your diabetes.

383
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,167
Emmet.

384
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,203
Doctor, what does
this exactly mean?

385
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,672
'It could simply
be dehydration.'

386
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,774
I'll, uh, give you IV fluids

387
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,410
'and, uh, hope your
renal function improves.'

388
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,712
I'm also gonna do a neuro exam

389
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:54,014
check sensation
in your extremities.

390
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,149
Whatever suits you, honey.

391
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,252
‐ Feel that?
‐ Mm‐hmm. Little pricks of pain.

392
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,287
Mm‐hmm. That's good.

393
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,058
That means you're not losing
feeling in your feet and toes.

394
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:09,195
Look out, Emmet,
she might test your heart.

395
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,398
I'm just kidding,
sweetie. Kidding.

396
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,803
So, if my kidneys fail,
what then?

397
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,739
Uh, if it progresses
to renal failure

398
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,474
'you'll need dialysis.'

399
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,476
This means a full
prayer vigil, Emmet.

400
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,646
Yes. Yes, we'll pray
for those kidneys.

401
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:28,549
Malik, I've got to find
somebody in public health

402
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,050
who can deal with a rat problem.

403
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,585
I know there's an office
for rodent control.

404
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,520
I've got a contact there.
Let me put you onto him.

405
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,656
It's really bad,
they were eating this kid alive.

406
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,457
In Philly, I got better effort
out of animal control

407
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,059
than public health.

408
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,162
This woman, Ms. Weldon
she's a real crusader.

409
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,631
She'll get them in there,
poison, traps

410
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,066
whatever they have to do.

411
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,068
Dr. Greene,
Dr. Carter wants

412
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,169
to see you
in trauma two.

413
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,203
Thanks, Yosh.

414
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,605
Here. Mention my name.

415
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,374
I treated her son once.
Come on.

416
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,442
You picked a good day
for pedes cases.

417
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,846
He seems a little better.
Why won't he wake up?

418
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,215
‐ Isn't the oxygen helping him?
‐ Yeah, it's helping.

419
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,784
For the moment
he's relatively stable.

420
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,652
I just haven't determined
what's wrong with him yet.

421
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,287
Dr. Carter,
meet Dr. Rosher.

422
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,822
‐ We've actually met.
‐ Yep, hi.

423
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,824
‐ What do you got?
‐ This is Sam Adams.

424
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,659
He's 11 years old, altered

425
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,529
'presented with
cyanosis, tachypnea tachycardia'

426
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,598
driving back from his
grandparents' farm.

427
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,700
He's still cyanotic
despite O2, ten liters.

428
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,401
'What are you thinking?'

429
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:25,739
Either a VQ mismatch or
something...toxic‐metabolic.

430
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,741
‐ Pulse ox?
‐ 92. It's pretty good.

431
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,810
Was he in a camper
or the back of a pickup?

432
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,145
No, he was in
a car with us.

433
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,379
Chest and cardiac exam?

434
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,215
No wheezing or rales,
regular rate

435
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,817
without murmur,
rub or gallop.

436
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,853
‐ Blood gas?
‐ PC02's 35, PO2's 380.

437
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,421
Suggesting?

438
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:43,189
That there's oxygen
dissolved in his blood

439
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,357
but he's still cyanotic.

440
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,792
What kind of farm was he on?

441
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,128
‐ My father raises tulips.
‐ 'Greenhouses.'

442
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,663
Yeah, I already
asked about that.

443
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:50,897
Well, because some
of the pesticides

444
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,833
you find in hothouses
contain cyanide.

445
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,135
Mm, if it were cyanide he would
have pinked up with the oxygen.

446
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,637
Besides, I've got
good pulses and there's

447
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,271
no smell of almonds.

448
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,707
So your best educated guess?

449
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,475
Methemoglobinemia.

450
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,578
Do another blood gas,
check that.

451
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:05,746
Go for it.

452
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,683
It's a tough case,
leaving it with an intern.

453
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:10,884
Think it's ill‐advised?

454
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,753
‐ You know Dr. Carter.
‐ I don't.

455
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:14,487
He's figured it out.

456
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,156
Diagnosis was correct.

457
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,357
But you didn't tell him.

458
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,660
He's here to learn,
not to be told.

459
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,562
Boy, is that
a mark against me?

460
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,597
Not in my book.

461
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,799
500cc fluid bolus
is on board.

462
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,300
‐ TKO the line.
‐ Okay. I got it.

463
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,873
There it is.
There's the answer.

464
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,175
Look at that arterial blood.

465
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,243
That's his blood?
It‐it looks more like chocolate.

466
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,179
‐ It's methemoglobin.
‐ What?

467
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,446
It's, uh, form of hemoglobin

468
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,848
that can't carry
oxygen to the body.

469
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,617
How‐how did he get that?

470
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,786
It's caused from a drug or
toxin, but we can treat it.

471
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:48,655
Take that up to the lab
and bring back methylene blue.

472
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,223
Peter?

473
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,458
Hey. I thought
you had a fem‐pop.

474
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,761
Done. I'm assisting
Anspaugh on a lung biopsy

475
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,797
and then Shenk
on a triple‐a.

476
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,733
Look, I think
Romano saw us.

477
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,768
‐ Why? What did he say?
‐ You know how he is.

478
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,403
He didn't say it directly

479
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:04,705
but he told me I
should have accepted

480
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,907
that position at
Gloucestershire Royal.

481
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,542
In so many words,
he was saying

482
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,777
he wasn't continuing
my sponsorship.

483
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,413
I suppose it's a matter
of insult to injury.

484
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,281
Why? Because
he came onto you?

485
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,584
Peter, the man has
an elephantine ego.

486
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,686
I don't care.
I'm not going for that.

487
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,522
Maybe it was inevitable.

488
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:22,723
Being sponsored by him

489
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:25,592
was difficult
at the best of times.

490
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,594
You know what?
Elizabeth, listen to me.

491
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,664
He doesn't own you.
He can't do this, okay?

492
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,899
Look, we'll talk later.
I have to scrub, okay?

493
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:33,967
Yeah.

494
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,505
Good, and we'll need
to explore and see

495
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,606
if there's
any flexor tendon injury.

496
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:40,641
Okay, right.

497
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,908
Chuny, will you take the parents

498
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,409
to the surgical
waiting room and see

499
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,978
if pedes has
a post‐op bed assignment.

500
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,713
Doug, Dr. Nagarvala
is here to see you.

501
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,448
Alright. What's up?

502
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,783
I'm sorry to bother you

503
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:52,318
but a woman came from
DCFS, a Ms. Newman.

504
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,621
She said there'd been
a change in the case status

505
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,757
and she's taking Josh
back to live with his mother.

506
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,324
‐ When‐when did that happen?
‐ Just now.

507
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,326
I came down
as soon as she left.

508
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,562
None of the doctors agree.

509
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,496
We're going to make
a formal appeal.

510
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,365
No, there's no,
there's no time for that.

511
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,368
I need the number for the county
health department in St. Lioba.

512
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,336
St. Lioba, home of
the White Corn Festival.

513
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,673
I went there with bikers once.
They had pink corn.

514
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,509
‐ You ever see that? It's gross.
‐ Can't say that I have.

515
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,844
When you get that number,
will you just page me?

516
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,513
Oh, how's it going?

517
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,515
I got a kid with
methemoglobinemia.

518
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:24,417
Oh, that's a great case.
What was the inducer?

519
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:27,353
Tox screen was negative,
but he was on a farm.

520
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,689
So I'm gonna get
the local health authorities

521
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,691
to, um, check it out.

522
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,659
Are you taking care of
Dr. Chambliss and Tina Marie?

523
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,827
Yes.

524
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,662
'Cause my mom
watches them by the hour

525
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,698
and she called and said they
announced on the cable station

526
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,900
that they're broadcasting from
here live saying she's dying.

527
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,603
‐ No. That is not happening.
‐ 'She's not dying?'

528
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,671
No, and they're not doing
the broadcast from here.

529
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,072
Dr. Greene said no way.

530
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,574
'Cause she
and my aunt are sitting

531
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,042
next of the TV
with their credit cards in hand.

532
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,877
Are you guys talking
about those televangelists?

533
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,846
‐ Yes.
‐ Yeah Dr. Emmet and Tina Marie.

534
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,480
Well, they must have
some kind of clout.

535
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,416
I just got a call
from administration

536
00:21:56,517 --> 00:22:00,521
saying we're to let
them do a broadcast.

537
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:04,625
Adele! Hey, Adele.

538
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:07,327
Hi. You're tough
to catch up to.

539
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,696
‐ Josh is my patient.
‐ Yeah, I read the report.

540
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,464
So, you understand the situation
he's in with his mother?

541
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,033
Sure, but there's been
a substantial change

542
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:14,735
in the environmental
circumstances.

543
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,737
Josh's mother now
lives with her aunt

544
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,104
and children's services
feels that the aunt

545
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,439
can take care of Josh.

546
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,473
Josh was born
addicted to methadone.

547
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:21,908
I know his medical history

548
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,910
but I've got an obligation
to return the child.

549
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,078
‐ Alright.
‐ Look, can you hold this?

550
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,347
Yeah.

551
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,115
We'll carefully monitor
Josh's progress.

552
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,817
We understand the situation.

553
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,519
Eve, as long as he
needs the methadone

554
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:35,021
the mother's gonna
steal it from him.

555
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,825
Look, I'm sorry.
He has to go home.

556
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:41,127
Oh yeah, okay, how's the aunt
going to pay for the meds?

557
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:42,996
‐ Well, he's on Medicaid.
‐ Okay, alright, yeah.

558
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,798
Some of these meds
are off formulary.

559
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:46,399
Now, I gonna have to fill out
a treatment authorization

560
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,668
request for him
to get them, right?

561
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:48,902
‐ Dr. Ross.
‐ I take him back in.

562
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:50,070
We give him an exam
and we send him home

563
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,738
with everything he needs.

564
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,507
Okay, how long is this gonna
take? Because the mother's‐‐

565
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,509
Long enough to fill out
some forms, that's all.

566
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,044
‐ Here we go, come on.
‐ Okay.

567
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,445
‐ Alright.
‐ Okay.

568
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,447
Okay, come here.
I got him. I got him.

569
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,083
Alright.
Alright.

570
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:05,952
Alright, well, just‐just give me
a second to lock up my car.

571
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,654
‐ Alright, here we go.
‐ Okay.

572
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,489
‐ Come on, you, you got it?
‐ Yep. Got everything.

573
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,557
Okay, here we go.

574
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:18,765
'Alright, Josh,
deep breaths for me.'

575
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,434
I'm hearing
basilar rales on the left.

576
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:24,404
Do a CBC, blood culture
and a chest film.

577
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,473
‐ Why? Wh‐wh‐what's wrong?
‐ Could be pneumonia.

578
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,076
‐ Pneumonia?
‐ You want to hear for yourself?

579
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,578
So what do I say
to the mother?

580
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:33,714
I mean, how long does
he have to stay?

581
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:35,982
Well, three or four hours
for the test results

582
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,719
and if it is pneumonia we have
to put him on IV antibiotics.

583
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,721
So it means
he's gonna spend the night?

584
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:41,888
Could be. Yeah.

585
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,693
‐ Okay.
‐ Alright.

586
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:52,432
Kid looks pretty good.
No fever.

587
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,801
‐ 'You sure you heard rales?'
‐ There's no rales.

588
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,771
‐ I'm keeping him.
‐ What's going on, Doug?

589
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,473
A seven month old baby
who's been admitted two times

590
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:01,908
for withdrawal I'm not
sending him home to be

591
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,477
a methadone source
for his mother.

592
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,112
Can't child services
take care of it?

593
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,983
I'm gonna do ultra rapid detox
and end his addiction today.

594
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,518
Ultra rapid?
What's that mean?

595
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,487
Quickly withdraw the kid
under deep sedation.

596
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,222
He's gonna go cold turkey
right here in the ER?

597
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,992
I talked to a pediatric
anesthesiologist in California.

598
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:21,494
I know the procedure.
It can be done here safely.

599
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,129
How long is that gonna take?

600
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,465
Twelve to eighteen hours.

601
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:28,001
You're going to keep him
hidden here for 12 hours?

602
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:29,570
Carol, I don't
have a choice.

603
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:36,610
Well, you can't
do it alone.

604
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,178
‐ Yes, I can.
‐ No, you can't.

605
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,246
No, I don't want you
putting anything at risk.

606
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,182
Yeah, well, we get caught

607
00:24:42,282 --> 00:24:45,118
we'll both help each other
through real estate school.

608
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,491
I'm going to put him
on a cardiac monitor

609
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:53,493
and a pulse ox. I'm gonna
do an arterial line.

610
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:56,730
We're going to
need a ventilator, okay?

611
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,731
Okay.

612
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:00,601
Here's the second dose.

613
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:01,968
Just run that
over five minutes.

614
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:06,507
How you doing?

615
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:11,077
I feel a bit tired,
but otherwise I'm okay.

616
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,979
Are my mom
and dad around?

617
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,882
Yeah, yeah. They went
to make some phone calls.

618
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,284
I can have
somebody go get 'em.

619
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,653
No hurry.

620
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,591
'How's your patient?'

621
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,892
I mean, aside
from his color?

622
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:28,729
‐ It's improving.
‐ Good call, John.

623
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,196
I just got to figure out
what caused it now

624
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,932
see if anybody
else is at risk.

625
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,635
I've heard a lot
about you from Anna.

626
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:36,069
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

627
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:38,672
She told me you'd
become close friends.

628
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:40,273
I heard what you went
through with your cousin.

629
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,708
I'm sure she
was a big help.

630
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,276
She told you
about that, huh?

631
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,111
Well, you know Anna,
she doesn't keep secrets.

632
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:49,115
Yeah. I don't really see
how that concerns you, though.

633
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,985
Well, what she's learned
about drug addiction

634
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:54,888
she had the misfortune
to learn through me, John.

635
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,256
I understand
it's a private thing

636
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:57,290
I meant no offense.

637
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,659
No, Forget it.

638
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:04,264
‐ Dr. Romano.
‐ Peter.

639
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:06,199
I thought you were a dried
fruits and nuts kind of guy.

640
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,768
Nothing healthy in here.

641
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,269
I'm not here to eat.
I was looking for you.

642
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,304
And you found me.
You don't mind if I eat?

643
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:12,806
No.

644
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,207
So, what's up?

645
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,276
Listen, what
Elizabeth and I do

646
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:19,079
in our personal lives
should not impact her career.

647
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:20,313
What you're doing
in your personal lives?

648
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,648
And what would that be?

649
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,016
I know you saw us
in the locker room

650
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:25,185
then hinted to her
that she wouldn't receive

651
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,120
your sponsorship next year.

652
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,789
Now, we both know
that's not right.

653
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:33,059
Look, I, uh, I had no idea
you and Lizzie were an item.

654
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,928
I swear I didn't.

655
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:37,964
But don't worry.
I mean, I'm happy for you.

656
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,966
So you didn't see us?

657
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,903
No, but you're
having an affair, terrific.

658
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:46,239
Actually, it puts certain
things in perspective.

659
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,240
Hey.

660
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,611
Congratulations.

661
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:51,778
Excellent choice.

662
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:03,657
‐ Need some help?
‐ No, thanks, Lydia.

663
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:05,325
‐ I got it.
‐ Who needs a vent?

664
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,093
Nobody.
Uh, respiratory called.

665
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,995
They need it upstairs.

666
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,197
‐ Mr. Chambliss.
‐ Uh, Dr. Chambliss.

667
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,166
I just want you to know that I
think that this broadcast

668
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:14,868
from the ER is inappropriate.

669
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,670
Oh, I assure you,
just like I assured

670
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,104
your public affairs people
you'll be referred

671
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,640
to in the most
positive way.

672
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,041
‐ Dr. Del Amico?
‐ Hmm?

673
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,943
I want you to stay in
the room during the broadcast

674
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,678
and if you feel that
Mrs. Chambliss' health

675
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:27,080
is being compromised
in any way, call me.

676
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,414
No problem.

677
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:29,916
A little help here!

678
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,918
I got it.

679
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,921
‐ 'Alright, What do we got?'
‐ Cylla Voliotis, age 12.

680
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,289
Blunt trauma to the right eye.

681
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,825
Concussion, possible
right facial fracture.

682
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:40,994
Okay, let's go to trauma one.
You the mother?

683
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:42,295
No, I'm a phys ed teacher.

684
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:43,764
It happened on
the school playground

685
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:45,165
she was running
and hit a lamppost.

686
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:46,900
Alright, did the school
call the mother?

687
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,134
Uh, they're trying but

688
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:49,836
I have an emergency
consent form.

689
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:52,873
Good, good. Okay everybody,
nice and easy on my count.

690
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:55,175
One, two, three.

691
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:56,877
It hurts so bad,
I can't stand it.

692
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,979
I know. Don't worry.
We're gonna take care of you.

693
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,247
‐ Morphine?
‐ Yeah, let's start with four.

694
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,717
‐ Partially extruded globe.
‐ Does she have vision?

695
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:06,319
‐ Can you see, darlin'?
‐ It's all red and blurry.

696
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,988
Okay, how many fingers
am I holding up?

697
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:10,223
‐ Three.
‐ Good, good!

698
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:12,826
Iris and lens are intact.

699
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:17,330
No vitreous hemorrhage
or detached retina.

700
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,367
Okay, let's get one percent
Lidocaine with epi

701
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,936
Betadine and a Steridrape.

702
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,404
No optho consult?

703
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:27,708
No. We've done this before.

704
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:32,212
Alright, he's out.
Let's tube him.

705
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:36,917
How do we know when
the withdrawal's complete?

706
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:40,353
After 12 hours of the narcan
blocking the narcotic..

707
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:43,023
...they have
a 98 percent success rate.

708
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:44,958
When he wakes up he shouldn't
have any withdrawal symptoms.

709
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:45,992
I'm in.

710
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,996
‐ Pulse ox 98.
‐ BP?

711
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,264
'110/70.'

712
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,068
Good breath sounds.

713
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,337
‐ Heart rate?
‐ One twenty.

714
00:28:57,437 --> 00:29:00,106
‐ He's a little tachy.
‐ Alright.

715
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,509
We'll let him
settle down a bit.

716
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,377
How's it going,
Cylla?

717
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:06,412
I'm scared.

718
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:07,814
Alcaine's in.

719
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,015
Good. Okay.

720
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,752
Well, you feel that?

721
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,520
What?

722
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,056
Okay, I think we're
about ready to go.

723
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:18,391
So, what kind of music
do you like?

724
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:19,960
Spice Girls.

725
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,862
Oh, really? Who's your
favorite Spice?

726
00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:23,797
Yosh, methyl cellulose.

727
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:26,432
What is it, Sporty Spice,
All Spice?

728
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:29,770
Uh, Cylla Spice?

729
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,505
No. I like Posh.

730
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:35,241
Okay, good. I need you
just to hold still.

731
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:36,376
Okay, hold still.

732
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:43,016
‐ 'Sterile applicator.'
‐ 'Here you go.'

733
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,852
I'm just gonna
invert the lashes.

734
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:51,491
Okay.

735
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,259
There.

736
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:57,497
I can see a little better.

737
00:29:57,598 --> 00:29:59,966
Yeah. Yosh, eye shield.

738
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:04,337
Yeah, it's gonna
be a little blurry

739
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:06,807
for a while
and a little sore.

740
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:09,242
Let me know when
her parents arrive.

741
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:11,377
She'll need
an orbital CT.

742
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,914
And, uh, optho
can see her.

743
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:16,282
'Praise the Lord! Yes!'

744
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:19,152
'Praise him
for his blessing'

745
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:21,321
'prompted by your prayers
and offerings.'

746
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:27,071
It is only by your faith
that I will survive my ordeal.

747
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:33,166
Only hours ago when pain
coursed through me.

748
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:36,402
'Emmet.'

749
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:40,006
Emmet, you tell them.

750
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:44,144
Brothers and sisters the Lord
has put another trial before us.

751
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:46,847
Tina Marie has just learned
from this lovely lady.

752
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:48,549
No, she's not a movie star.

753
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:50,450
This is Tina Marie's doctor.

754
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:53,486
Now, will you tell us the nature
of Tina Marie's illness?

755
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:56,389
Well, she has cellulitis
and renal insufficiency.

756
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:59,626
Uh, and what does that mean?

757
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:02,596
Um, she has a problem
with her kidneys.

758
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,631
‐ But she will survive?
‐ Yes.

759
00:31:04,731 --> 00:31:08,134
Yes! She will survive through
the power of Christ Jesus

760
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,203
and by your prayers
and golden offerings.

761
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,572
Oh, Emmet, Emmet, Emmet.

762
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:15,475
I can feel the power
of prayer right now!

763
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:18,111
I can feel it!
It has started!

764
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,445
We all feel it, honey.

765
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,514
Do you feel it, doctor?

766
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,617
‐ No.
‐ Well, come on!

767
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,652
Here, take Tina Marie's hand.

768
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:29,656
We will have
a prayer interface.

769
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:31,592
People are watchin'
and waitin' for you, honey.

770
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,294
Yeah?

771
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:38,464
Feel the power of the love
that courses through us.

772
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:42,503
God, through you,
who has saved my life.

773
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:47,240
Kerry, I've got
another set of X‐rays.

774
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,408
Let's have a look.

775
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,381
Is there a name on these?

776
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,517
They're mine.

777
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:00,386
These are
much better images.

778
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,454
Did you look at these?

779
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:02,455
No.

780
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:06,159
Well, it looks clean.

781
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:10,196
Why did you order them?
Cough? Fever?

782
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,665
‐ Yeah.
‐ What about night sweats?

783
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,366
No, but I have
trouble sleeping.

784
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:15,135
Forgetfulness?

785
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:17,704
The, uh, those slides I
put in your mailbox, but, um..

786
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:19,272
Yeah, there's been
forgetfulness.

787
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,578
Jeanie, I want you
to know something.

788
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:28,281
Whatever your status even if you
have a measurable viral count

789
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:30,684
no one's going
to overreact.

790
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,586
There's going to be
a job for you here.

791
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,158
We should draw some blood.

792
00:32:40,193 --> 00:32:42,696
‐ 'He didn't see us?'
‐ 'Yeah, that's what he claims.'

793
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:45,265
So I read him wrong and
you told him all about us?

794
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:47,200
I told him our lives
are none of his business

795
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,570
and nothing that we do should
affect your standing here.

796
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,371
You got heavy with him.

797
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,406
Yeah.

798
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:56,109
I don't know, maybe I should
have kept my mouth shut.

799
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,745
Well, taking up my cause
was very gallant of you, Peter

800
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:00,581
but it seems
we've gone public.

801
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,522
Good breaths sounds
bilaterally.

802
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:11,457
Heart rate's down
to a 100 pulse ox 99.

803
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:13,159
He's stable.
Let's start a second line.

804
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,996
I want to be ready for anything
before we give him narcan.

805
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,564
'Are there gonna be
side effects?'

806
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:19,365
It could make him
hypertensive.

807
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,401
We have Nipride,
but no Esmolol.

808
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,504
I want both ready
on drips.

809
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:25,572
‐ I'll go get them.
‐ 'No, I'll do it.'

810
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,040
Kerry Weaver might wonder

811
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,575
why you're here
after your shift.

812
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:31,344
Suction.

813
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:35,015
Lizzie, can you
retract distally?

814
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:40,654
Good. I've got
the room I need.

815
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:42,055
Now, we can all settle back.

816
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:44,758
So, Shirley,
let me ask you something.

817
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,060
Suppose you asked
someone out on a date..

818
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,529
‐ I'm married.
‐ Yeah.

819
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:50,564
Just hypothetically,
we have a lengthy procedure.

820
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:53,299
So, you ask this person
on a date and they beg off

821
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,068
claiming they don't
get involved

822
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,603
with fellow colleagues
from the workplace.

823
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,605
‐ You've got some oozing.
‐ I've got it.

824
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,774
Then you find out this person
is having a love affair

825
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:02,075
with a fellow colleague.

826
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:04,044
Now, why do you
suppose they lied?

827
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,179
The fellow colleague
is married.

828
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,581
A married person's response

829
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:09,349
but let's say
that he's not married.

830
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,718
They didn't want to offend
someone's overblown ego.

831
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:13,253
That's a thought.

832
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:16,557
But suppose this person
made up that silly story

833
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,692
about keeping sex
and work separate

834
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,194
just so they could continue
playing the field?

835
00:34:21,294 --> 00:34:23,630
That's absurd.
Clamp again, right here.

836
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,666
I don't‐don't know.
Shirley?

837
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:28,068
I agree. They're probably
still shopping around.

838
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:37,277
I thought your shift
ended hours ago.

839
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:38,311
Yeah, I got involved.

840
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,379
Esmolol?

841
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,747
Teenager with
a tachyarrhythmia.

842
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:41,848
How about Adenosine?

843
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:43,349
Already tried it.

844
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,384
Lasted for
a few seconds.

845
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:45,552
I got it under control.

846
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:53,727
Dr. Carter, I just got
this fax for you.

847
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:54,728
Mm.

848
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:01,535
This is the explanation
for the, uh, methemoglobinemia.

849
00:35:01,635 --> 00:35:02,803
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

850
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:04,437
It's from a, uh,
local health service

851
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:05,672
near the grandparents' farm.

852
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,674
See, ground water
from several local areas

853
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,644
has been found to have heavy
concentration of nitrites

854
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:13,146
due to an inorganic
waste contamination.

855
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:14,280
Oh, I'd draw blood
on the parents.

856
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,315
They might be borderline.

857
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:16,550
Yeah, I did that already.

858
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,151
I'm just waiting
on the test results.

859
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,523
Randi, did you get
labs back on Chambliss?

860
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:23,557
Yep, they're in here.

861
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:24,558
Thank you.

862
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:27,894
Is that a pedes case?

863
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:29,596
If it is,
I'll put it in my study.

864
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:32,265
Sorry. It's a repeat glucose
on the televangelist.

865
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,668
Oh. I heard you
looked great on TV.

866
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:36,169
Someone saw me?

867
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,704
The nurses, they had
it on in the lounge.

868
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:40,774
What a nightmare.
They're total frauds.

869
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:43,677
Not serious?
But I‐I phoned in a big pledge.

870
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:46,212
Uh, the woman
used her disease

871
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,781
to‐to milk money
out of poor people

872
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,349
who probably
believe all of it.

873
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:50,751
It's a living.

874
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,385
You know, at least
they're not practicing law

875
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:55,355
or polluting streams,
selling insurance.

876
00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:56,923
So, what's the,
what's the deal on getting

877
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:59,159
a genuine Philly cheesesteak
in this town, huh?

878
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:01,327
Forget about it. I've looked
everywhere. They don't exist.

879
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:02,929
How about an Italian. I'm on
a very substantial per diem.

880
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:04,631
And I'm on call.

881
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:06,533
Well, if you're still
partial to Chinese take‐out

882
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,234
how about a candle‐lit dinner
for two in the doctors' lounge?

883
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:09,770
Sure, I'd love to.

884
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,338
Uh, Jeanie, when you have
a minute, could I see you?

885
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:14,207
Sure, Kerry.

886
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:15,709
You can go now,
I'll bandage him up.

887
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:16,843
Thanks, Yosh.

888
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,217
I got your labs back.

889
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:26,953
I'm very happy to say
it's all good news.

890
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:29,856
Your viral load remains
non detectable.

891
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:32,726
Your white count's normal
and you're not even anemic.

892
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:36,697
Guess I was getting myself
worked up over nothin'.

893
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:39,232
I can understand.

894
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:40,567
But remember,
I took responsibility

895
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,268
for monitoring your health

896
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,705
so you shouldn't be
on your own looking at X‐rays.

897
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,473
Yeah, you're right.
That won't happen again.

898
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:49,676
What do you think
about the forgetfulness?

899
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:52,412
Yeah, well, you've
complained of sleeplessness.

900
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:53,914
I haven't slept much
in the last month.

901
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,716
Have you been taking anything?

902
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:58,418
Well, lately,
I've been taking Halcion

903
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,854
which could explain, okay..

904
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,623
The fact is, Jeanie

905
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,858
I mean, you've had
such a rough time

906
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:08,361
with Al moving away
and‐and Scotty..

907
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,864
...that alone could
explain your symptoms.

908
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:13,534
Yeah, you're right.

909
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:16,402
If you ever want to talk..

910
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:17,604
Thanks, Kerry.
That'd be good.

911
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:18,772
I'd like that.

912
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:20,941
Good.

913
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,577
The figures are ten percent
above our projections

914
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:25,946
and I think there'll be real
cassette sales on this one.

915
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:27,881
Well, what about
next time?

916
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:29,482
Do I die on the TV?

917
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:31,918
Don't make stupid jokes.

918
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,887
Um, your blood sugar's
still elevated.

919
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:35,789
I need to give you
a little more insulin.

920
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:38,725
Uh, I'm gonna make some
phone calls, sweetie.

921
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:44,464
How often do you, uh, test your
blood sugar at home, Tina Marie?

922
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:47,333
Oh, um, what‐what's that
you're supposed to do?

923
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:50,637
Um, oh, four times a day?
I don't know.

924
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:52,005
To prevent
complications, yes.

925
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:55,542
Well, what kind
of complications?

926
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,043
Um, blindness,
heart attack

927
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:58,845
loss of peripheral
circulation.

928
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,981
Well, those are all
good prayer vigils.

929
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,649
I'm not joking.

930
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:04,518
You need to take
responsibility for your health.

931
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,587
Take your problem seriously.

932
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:09,656
Honey, my problems
are all I got.

933
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:12,392
You mean, you wouldn't
make a living without them?

934
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:14,360
Well, I sure as heck
wouldn't have Emmet.

935
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:18,965
You're such a lovely thing.

936
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:20,400
Are you married?

937
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,401
No.

938
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,972
Emmet and I were married
when we were in high school.

939
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:30,010
Oh, we were crazy in love.

940
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:35,982
You'd never know it
to see us now, would you?

941
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:38,519
It's not for me to make
a judgment about that.

942
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:43,990
I tell you one thing,
Emmet won't leave me.

943
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:46,527
Ever.

944
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:48,061
God has..

945
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:50,363
...has given me
the way to keep him close.

946
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,469
He may not love me..

947
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:01,107
...but he loves the way
caring for me makes him look.

948
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:06,547
Well, I wouldn't be
in a marriage without love.

949
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,615
Oh, honey,
everyone thinks that..

950
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,484
...but things change..

951
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:14,020
...and you make do.

952
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:20,460
So be careful.

953
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:21,595
Thank you.

954
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:28,468
So, I suppose
the Coq d'Or's a bit dressy.

955
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:29,870
Yeah, uh, but you know what?

956
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,905
Actually, I didn't
make reservations there.

957
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,608
‐ Our date's off?
‐ No, no.

958
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,476
We're going
to the Velvet Lounge.

959
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:39,813
That's fantastic.

960
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:42,048
You know, people are gonna look
at us like we're crazy, right?

961
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:44,150
Yeah, but you know
that doesn't bother me, Peter.

962
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,786
Yeah, well, I wish
I could say the same.

963
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:51,525
Look, I can't change what
I am any more than you can.

964
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,760
Whatever feelings I have
for you are based on..

965
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,961
...on who you are

966
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:57,163
not what I want you to be.

967
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:59,600
Elizabeth, you're not from here.

968
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,067
'I mean, you know what, you
didn't grow up the way I did.'

969
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,538
Yeah, I wish I could
say one, two, three

970
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,106
and all my feelings
about your skin color

971
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:07,741
would disappear,
but it doesn't work like that.

972
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:11,111
‐ Do you understand that?
‐ Yes.

973
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:12,646
But I don't want
to subject you to something

974
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,047
you're not ready for.

975
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:19,119
You know, I've never
met anybody

976
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:23,089
that makes me laugh or blush
or whatever the way you do.

977
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:24,758
I‐I‐I'm trying to
work through this

978
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:26,426
but, you know,
you've gotta trust me, alright?

979
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:29,530
Mm‐hmm.

980
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,965
Come on, let's go
to the Velvet Lounge.

981
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,737
Hey. Philly cheesesteaks.

982
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:40,473
Right here. I found them
in Chicago and they deliver.

983
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:42,108
Can you believe that?

984
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,477
You want one?
More than enough.

985
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:45,646
No thanks.

986
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,848
Oh, come on, you get
a free angioplasty

987
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,650
with a small order.

988
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,852
Free quadruple bypass
with the dinner special.

989
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:55,789
No?

990
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,758
Listen, I was
wondering, maybe, uh..

991
00:40:57,858 --> 00:41:00,160
...you'd like to join Anna
and I for dinner sometime.

992
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,795
Ah, you really want
an ally, don't you?

993
00:41:01,895 --> 00:41:05,031
No. It's about
your friendship with her.

994
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,166
I don't want her
to cut herself off

995
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,201
from people she likes.

996
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:11,237
Make it easier for her
to go back to you?

997
00:41:11,337 --> 00:41:13,039
Am I hearing jealousy?

998
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,108
Maybe once, but not now.

999
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,945
It's just that I
think that you're trouble.

1000
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:20,113
'Maybe I'm wrong.'

1001
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:21,848
Sort of hope I am.

1002
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:22,983
But that's what I think.

1003
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,886
So I might laugh
at your jokes

1004
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:29,222
and never give you any
indication of how I feel.

1005
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,124
'But I wanted you
to know that.'

1006
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:33,760
Enjoy your dinner.

1007
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:37,931
Hey, Mark, you know,
I've been thinking

1008
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:39,900
there's a storage area
off the hallway

1009
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,636
that could be outfitted
as a pediatric exam room.

1010
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:43,870
The janitor's closet?

1011
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,839
It's small, but children's
beds are small.

1012
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:47,273
And we could hang
the IV bags up on

1013
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:48,975
those hooks they use
for the brooms.

1014
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:50,511
Uh‐huh, this is a joke.

1015
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:52,245
Well, maybe
I'm just facing reality.

1016
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,080
I mean, you're
obviously behind the idea.

1017
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,882
You gave Dr. Rosher
a grand tour.

1018
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:57,217
Yeah, and by the way,
he was very impressed

1019
00:41:57,317 --> 00:41:58,719
with the way we handle
our pedes cases.

1020
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,887
Oh, Mark, Doug is your friend.

1021
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:02,255
You‐you think Rosher's report

1022
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:03,857
will help him get
an attending position.

1023
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:05,526
I appreciate loyalty.

1024
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:07,961
I just don't think it should
be at the expense of the ER.

1025
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,063
My friendship with Doug
has nothing to do with this.

1026
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:12,032
I don't happen
to believe that a pedes unit

1027
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:14,668
or a pedes attending in this ER
is a big improvement.

1028
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:17,838
Dr. Greene, uh, Jeanie wants
you to sign off on a suture job.

1029
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:19,640
Will you go on record
with that to Anspaugh?

1030
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,242
Yes, absolutely,
when the time's right.

1031
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:23,710
Where is she?

1032
00:42:36,144 --> 00:42:37,141
Pulse ox 89.

1033
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:39,476
What's going on?

1034
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:43,047
Decreased breath sounds
on the left.

1035
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:44,081
Maybe it's a collapsed lung.

1036
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:45,549
Should I get
a portable X‐ray?

1037
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,551
Well, it can't be.
His pressure's not that high.

1038
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:51,088
Put him
on 100 percent oxygen.

1039
00:42:51,188 --> 00:42:52,223
Could be a mucous plug.

1040
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:53,557
I'll get a suction catheter.

1041
00:42:56,027 --> 00:42:57,962
Looks good.
Infected abrasion?

1042
00:42:58,062 --> 00:43:00,231
‐ Right here.
‐ She cleaned it up good, huh?

1043
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:02,199
I'll change the dressing
when you come in to see Haleh.

1044
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:04,201
Sure. On Thursday.

1045
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:12,443
'It's the secretions, let go.
Hook up the vent.'

1046
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:14,311
'Pulse ox 98.'

1047
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,147
What the hell's this?

1048
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:18,282
Let me explain this to you.
This boy is my patient.

1049
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:20,284
Ketamine drip.
What are you doin' in here?

1050
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:22,987
I'm doing an ultrarapid detox.
Everything's under control.

1051
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:24,455
'Like hell it is.'

1052
00:43:24,555 --> 00:43:26,090
Is this baby even
a registered patient?

1053
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,992
‐ Mark, he‐‐
‐ Is he on the board?

1054
00:43:28,092 --> 00:43:30,327
If you just let me explain
the circumstances, the mother‐‐

1055
00:43:30,427 --> 00:43:32,897
You don't have
consent, do you?

1056
00:43:32,997 --> 00:43:36,300
You've got an intubated kid
under deep sedation.

1057
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,334
'Mark, Doug's got
this under control.'

1058
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:38,903
We've gotta move
this kid.

1059
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:40,204
You're not even gonna
hear me out on this?

1060
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:41,372
‐ No, I don't need to.
‐ BP's 190/100.

1061
00:43:41,472 --> 00:43:43,007
I tried .3 mics
per kilo per minute.

1062
00:43:43,107 --> 00:43:45,042
Gina, bag him.

1063
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:46,110
Alright, let's get
to the PICU.

1064
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,411
We can do it right here.

1065
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:49,480
‐ Where's the chart?
‐ I don't have a chart.

1066
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,215
Is this how you practice
medicine? Let's go.

1067
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:53,350
Right here, I wrote everything
down on that piece of paper.

1068
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,486
Oh, that's great, that's great.

1069
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,388
I don't believe this.
Inga, call the PICU.

1070
00:43:57,488 --> 00:43:59,323
Tell them we've got
a critical patient coming up.

1071
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:00,557
‐ I'm gonna need a name.
‐ What's the name?

1072
00:44:00,657 --> 00:44:02,093
Listen, we don't have
to do this.

1073
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:04,128
‐ What's the baby's name?
‐ Josh McNeal.

1074
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:06,130
Baby McNeal,
about six months old.

1075
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,500
‐ Ketamine drip, intubated.
‐ What's going on?

1076
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,269
I found Doug in exam four
detoxing this baby.

1077
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:14,305
‐ What?
‐ I found him by accident.

1078
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:15,539
Carol, did you know about this?

1079
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:17,574
‐ I was helping him.
‐ Helping him?

1080
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:19,110
The baby was stable‐‐

1081
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,978
Yeah, this is a violation
of every ER policy.

1082
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:22,479
They've got a bed
ready in PICU.

1083
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,415
Tell them I'll bring him up,
set‐up with basic too.

1084
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:26,350
‐ I'm going up with it too.
‐ Yeah, you're damn right.

1085
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,952
You're going,
you're gonna explain this

1086
00:44:28,052 --> 00:44:29,253
to the hospital
administration

1087
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:31,022
and the executive
committee.

1088
00:44:31,122 --> 00:44:33,424
‐ Let's go!
‐ 'You lied to me, Doug.'

1089
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:35,192
You looked me right
in the face and lied to me.
