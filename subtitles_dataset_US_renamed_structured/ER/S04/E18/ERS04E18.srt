1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,273
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,209
Ah, ah, thank you.
Thank you.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,211
‐ So it's true?
‐ I've been tryin' to tell ya.

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,646
I'm not renewing my fellowship

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,548
'cause I'm applying for
an attending position.

6
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,783
You should have had some sense.
Called your family.

7
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,519
It was not your decision,
Charles.

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,620
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,688
And here are some condoms.

10
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,489
‐ Use them.
‐ I will.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,291
The, uh, bone marrow registry

12
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:26,527
found eight people

13
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,529
who preliminarily match
your marrow type.

14
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,197
‐ David.
‐ I've got something in my eye.

15
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,498
Could you?

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,335
Who the hell was that?

17
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,641
'Yosh, I need a hand.'

18
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,075
What have you got?

19
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,145
Boxes, antibiotics,
clinic expendables.

20
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,047
Right here, Jerry.
Thank you.

21
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,183
Ow. You know, heavy lifting
is not in my job description.

22
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,752
Hey, where we gonna
put this stuff?

23
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,087
Um, you know, let's put it
in the lounge for now.

24
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,289
Hey, Carol. Delivery dude's
waitin' on a check out here.

25
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,625
I'll be right there.

26
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,460
Carol, wh‐what is all this?

27
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,228
Oh, um, Mrs. Carter came through

28
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,197
with another donation
for medical supplies.

29
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,532
If it's okay with you

30
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:06,567
I thought I would stash
them in the lounge

31
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,401
until I find a storage space.

32
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:12,072
Oh, far be it for me to impede
the good work of the clinic.

33
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,206
So, tonight's
the big night, huh?

34
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,508
Yep.

35
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,609
Any last minute things
I can help you with?

36
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:16,843
Everything's under control.

37
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,312
Alright, I just,
I'm really impressed that

38
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,081
you volunteered
to do this year's banquet.

39
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,315
Oh, Jerry's been helpin' me out.

40
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,084
Uh‐huh, so what's on the menu?

41
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,086
Well, we have
herb‐roasted chicken.

42
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,454
‐ We have scalloped potatoes‐‐
‐ Uh...Dr. Greene?

43
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,456
Actually, things didn't go
quite as planned.

44
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,726
‐ Wh‐what do you mean?
‐ I didn't wanna worry you.

45
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,494
You're worrying me, Jerry.

46
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,097
Well, the caterer couldn't do
the spread for the money we had

47
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,099
so, I had to make alternate
arrangements.

48
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,167
Oh, I hope it's not a buffet.

49
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,469
No, it's not.
It's a Smorgasbord.

50
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,505
Mark, do you have a minute?

51
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,473
Uh...sure.
Smorgasbord?

52
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,510
Yeah, it's gonna be great.
I got a great Swedish caterer.

53
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,877
She's a friend
of my Aunt Greta's.

54
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,346
What was that strange memo
from the dean all about?

55
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,448
Uh, apparently,
he wants to explore hiring

56
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,884
a, uh, pediatric
emergency attendent.

57
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,353
‐ And whose dumb idea was that?
‐ Doug's.

58
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,723
Doug? D‐Doug Ross
went to the dean?

59
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,759
Uh, yeah, and the dean thought
it was worth investigating.

60
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,594
And you're telling me
that Doug Ross

61
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,229
is actually interested
in such a position?

62
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,664
He might be.

63
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,900
No, as a, as emergentologists,
we're trained to handle

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,368
anyone who comes
through the door.

65
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,303
We do not need
a pediatric attending here.

66
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,305
Yeah, don't worry.
It's not gonna happen.

67
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,741
Okay, they're gonna make
a committee

68
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,543
they'll determine that
it's not cost‐effective

69
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,477
and it'll all be history.

70
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,412
'Miss Beavans, please.
Just let us run some tests.'

71
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,781
I don't have time.

72
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,150
She's got a high fever
and she's vomiting.

73
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,552
You've kept me waiting
for over three hours.

74
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,253
If I don't get to work
right now, I'm gonna be fired.

75
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,588
It'll just take a few minutes.
That's all it's gonna take.

76
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,289
That's what the nurse
said an hour ago.

77
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,825
She could, she could have
a‐a kidney infection, or worse.

78
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,193
Just let us get a urine sample.

79
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,227
I'll bring her back tonight.

80
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,763
I can't let you leave with her.

81
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,464
‐ You can't stop me!
‐ The police would say I can.

82
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,232
You'd call the cops on me?

83
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,934
Absolutely. For‐for
endangering a child? You bet.

84
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,603
Wait! I'll call the cops
for kidnappin'!

85
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,637
What's going on here?

86
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,238
She's got a 105 fever.

87
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,541
She's vomiting for two days,
no source of infection.

88
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,242
He threatened
to call the cops on me.

89
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,712
I'm sure we can work this out
without police involvement.

90
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,615
I am not letting you leave
without giving this child tests.

91
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,283
Like hell you won't!

92
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,251
Bring her back
or you're gonna be sorry!

93
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,419
He wants to be in attending?

94
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,842
Pedialyte, you make sure
she gets plenty of that.

95
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,878
Ibuprofen for fever. And then
we'll call you with the results.

96
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,279
Now, you sure you don't
want me to call your boss

97
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,480
and tell him
why you're late?

98
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,983
‐ Don't bother.
‐ Okay. Alright.

99
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,484
Son of a bitch.

100
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,353
Sure hope
it doesn't rain tonight.

101
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,922
The parking lot's such a schlep
and I'm wearing a new dress.

102
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,592
Not to worry.
It is not going to rain.

103
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,894
Channel Two News said
it's gonna storm.

104
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,963
Channel Two News doesn't know
what they're talking about.

105
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,865
No bursitis, no rain.

106
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,266
Hey, Carter, can I grab
a ride with you and Anna

107
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,734
to the banquet tonight?

108
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,936
‐ Doug's workin' late.
‐ I'm not goin' with Anna.

109
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,439
You two break up?

110
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,608
We're just friends.

111
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,777
Oh, I thought you were dating.

112
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,846
No. No. No. I mean we've gotten
really close, but no.

113
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,281
You thought we were dating, huh?

114
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,716
Yeah, I thought I picked up
on something.

115
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:43,850
Something that she said?

116
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,285
No, I thought I picked up

117
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,653
on some chemistry
between the two of you.

118
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,321
Hmm.

119
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,557
I mean, there's been
moments, but, um..

120
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,526
...you know you hate to
screw up a good friendship.

121
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,829
That's lame, Carter.
Ask her out.

122
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,933
I hope Romano doesn't page me.

123
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,434
He sure keeps you
on a short leash.

124
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,736
I'd cut it in a heartbeat

125
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,404
if I weren't afraid
of losing my visa.

126
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,906
Uh, Morgenstern
might sponsor you.

127
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,041
‐ Huh! Out of the frying pan.
‐ What do you mean?

128
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,443
Well, he's a strange fish,
Morgenstern, don't you think?

129
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,045
‐ No, not really.
‐ You respect him?

130
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,479
Yes, of course. Why?

131
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,748
I heard he was
cutting up cadavers

132
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:15,882
in the anatomy lab.

133
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,917
‐ So?
‐ Well, it's nothing.

134
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,519
I suppose I'm looking

135
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,987
for a convincing reason
not to go back home.

136
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,956
Whoa, is your fellowship up?

137
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,457
No. I've been offered
senior lecturer

138
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,926
at Gloucestershire
Royal Hospital.

139
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,393
Wow! Congratulations.

140
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,762
Yeah, I'm not sure
I want to go back

141
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,597
into that old boys
network again.

142
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,533
At least here, a woman
has a fighting chance.

143
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,600
'Ready, one, two, three.'

144
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,335
‐ Ooh.
‐ Gently.

145
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,903
71‐year‐old male,
Lyle Swanson.

146
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,705
T‐boned when a drunk ran a red.

147
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,941
No LOC, BP 150 over 98.

148
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,943
Pulse 90, resps 25,
minor lacs‐‐

149
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,847
Allison...look at you.
How are you?

150
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,049
I'm doin' fine, Dr. Corday,
thanks to you.

151
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,416
She's been on the job
three days.

152
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,518
Wouldn't know
she's just a trainee.

153
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,553
How's your leg?

154
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:53,954
Oh, I got a ways to go

155
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,021
but I'm gettin'
the strength back.

156
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,489
I'm thrilled for you.

157
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,058
Could we finish
with the bullet, please?

158
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,828
Sorry. BP 150 over 98,
pulse 90, resps 25.

159
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,630
Minor lacs to the head
and lower extremities.

160
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,898
Patient noticed chest pains
after slamming

161
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,032
into the steering wheel.

162
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,467
Well done.

163
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,002
Any time. See you.

164
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,737
No evidence of pneumo.

165
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,773
Good peripheral pulse
without extremity tenderness.

166
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,075
Pupils equal.
Disc margins clear.

167
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,543
'What are you thinking?'

168
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,879
Worst case scenario,
cardiac contusion

169
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,080
or an aortic tear.

170
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,615
Start with a chest x‐ray.

171
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,783
Excuse me?

172
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,050
Get a chest film.

173
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,419
I've got
a paraesophageal hernia.

174
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,021
Probably torsed my stomach.

175
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,122
Are you a doctor?

176
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,390
Pathologist.

177
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,758
Better rule out a volvulus.

178
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,827
Lydia, call for
a portable chest.

179
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,764
Peter, what do you think?

180
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,166
I think Dr. Swanson
just beat us to the diagnosis.

181
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,536
Hey, are you going to this,
uh, banquet tonight?

182
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,605
Uh, sounds kind of hokey.

183
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,540
Actually, it was
great fun last year.

184
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,775
It was a nice dinner.
It's good wine.

185
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,443
Everybody ended up
doin' the limbo.

186
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,813
‐ I don't know.
‐ Oh, come on.

187
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,681
I guess,
if you're gonna go.

188
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,716
Would you like to go together?

189
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,083
Sure. Why not?

190
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,752
Alright, I'll pick you
up at uh, 8 o'clock?

191
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,886
Great.

192
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,557
Jerry, why didn't you tell me
there was a deposit?

193
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,191
'Cause I thought you were
taking care of the band.

194
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,060
Look, if I'd known there was
a deposit, I would've paid it.

195
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,562
No, you don't understand.

196
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,531
I've got 60 people
showin' up tonight.

197
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,566
‐ You cannot cancel on me.
‐ Mark, telephone.

198
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,701
Can you hold on a second?
Is it important?

199
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,969
It's the florist
for the banquet tonight.

200
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,170
I'll tell her
you're with a patient.

201
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,905
No, no, no.
What does she want?

202
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,473
Well, she tried to deliver
your centerpieces

203
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:21,842
to the Shangri lodge

204
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,577
but there was nobody there
to receive 'em.

205
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,611
Uh, have them delivered here.

206
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,547
‐ To the ER?
‐ Yeah.

207
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,149
Look, you've got to be able
to find a band for me tonight.

208
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,551
You know what, I have couple
buddies that are musicians.

209
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,986
Jerry, back to work.

210
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,221
What's that?
"The Machine?"

211
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,923
That sounds good.
Fine, book 'em.

212
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,025
I'll pay the late fee. Yeah.

213
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,126
Damn it.

214
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,963
Labs are back
on Quinesha Beavans.

215
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,731
She's got gram‐negative
rods in her urine.

216
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,668
Her CBC shows a left shift.

217
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,636
‐ Urosepsis.
‐ Probably.

218
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,204
Ah, it's good thing you had
Mrs. Beavans stick around

219
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,739
so you could run the tests.

220
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,841
Make sure you tell
Kerry Weaver about that.

221
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,109
Let's see, you want me
to call her

222
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,544
and make sure
she brings in Quinesha

223
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,979
for IV antibiotics?

224
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,782
I can be diplomatic, buddy.

225
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,250
I know you can.

226
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,120
Dr. Swanson made a correct
self‐diagnosis.

227
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,623
He's got a
nasty‐looking volvulus.

228
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,558
Looks like he's gonna
need a gastrectomy.

229
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,594
Have you ever removed
the entire stomach?

230
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,095
No. What about you?

231
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,797
In a frog.

232
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:17,931
Morning, folks.

233
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,766
Good morning,
Dr. Morgenstern.

234
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,101
So, what's on the agenda?

235
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,504
A rather fascinating case.

236
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,572
Pretty spiffy.
Who is this?

237
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,908
Lyle Swanson, 71‐year‐old
physician who presents with‐‐

238
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,876
Swanny?

239
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,820
David Morgenstern, Dr. Swanson.
I took histology from you.

240
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,255
In fact, you inspired me to
become a surgeon.

241
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,059
You made the most beautiful
axial slices of the brain.

242
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,294
That means a great deal
coming from you, sir.

243
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,996
Dr. Swanson is a world authority

244
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,032
on immunofluorescent
tumor stains.

245
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:55,802
I'm afraid you have
a gastric torsion.

246
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,808
I should have had that damned
hernia repaired years ago.

247
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,745
Well, I had an MI
six months ago.

248
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,980
I ignored the symptoms
for weeks.

249
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,181
What's your plan?

250
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,850
Well, we'll do
an open procedure.

251
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,685
That way we can
explore your belly.

252
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,555
Can you operate
laparoscopically?

253
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,923
I believe your case
is too complicated for that.

254
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,192
‐ Nonsense.
‐ A lap volvulus?

255
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,293
It's less invasive.

256
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,062
The recovery
time is quicker.

257
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,030
Peter, what do you think?

258
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,066
Um, well, it's worth a try.

259
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,101
We can always convert
to an open procedure.

260
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,036
Lily, book an OR in my name.

261
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,673
Which one of you young
turks would like to assist?

262
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,041
Elizabeth?

263
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,077
You're the skeptic,
how about it?

264
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,612
Terrific.

265
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,614
Isn't a Smorgasbord
kind of old‐fashioned?

266
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,848
Oh, it's gonna be great.

267
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,650
I'd like to see a menu.

268
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,185
We're having pickled Herring

269
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,087
Swedish meatballs,
limpa bread

270
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,656
and my mom's making
a tub of borscht.

271
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,892
W‐wait, your mother's
doin' the cooking?

272
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,961
‐ She's doin' it for free.
‐ Did you page me?

273
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,631
Uh, yeah. Got a bowel
obstruction in two.

274
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,165
You're sure it's not
just constipation?

275
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,934
Yes, I am certain.

276
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,669
Hell of a job you ER docs have.

277
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,170
You have to scout out
the territory

278
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,241
and then call in the big boys
to go in for the kill, huh?

279
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,110
‐ Anna, you got a minute?
‐ Sure.

280
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,946
Listen, I got a call from the
national bone marrow registry.

281
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,247
You gave some blood last week?

282
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,316
Uh, yeah, in the drive
for Dr. Anspaugh's son.

283
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,784
Don't tell me that I matched.

284
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,252
No, uh, unfortunately,
not for Scotty

285
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,254
but you did match
an out of state patient.

286
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,089
Wow. That's great.

287
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,158
That's kind of a tough
procedure, isn't it?

288
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,961
It's not too bad, and if
I can arrange it for today

289
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,063
would you be willing
to do it?

290
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,632
That soon?

291
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,734
The patient needs the marrow
as soon as possible.

292
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,935
I'll give you a few days off
to recuperate.

293
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,703
I could perform
that procedure

294
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,338
after I check out this
bowel obstruction if you want.

295
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,842
Yeah, and what exactly
does it involve?

296
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,376
I'll drill about
50 small holes

297
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,647
in your pelvic girdle
and suck out the marrow.

298
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:47,681
Uh‐huh.

299
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:48,715
We'll give you an epidural.

300
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,083
You won't feel a thing.

301
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,284
Piece of cake.

302
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,388
‐ Think about it.
‐ Okay.

303
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,293
Hey, be honest with me.

304
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,195
Think I have what it
takes to be an attending?

305
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,665
‐ Of course you do.
‐ Thank you.

306
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,300
Think of me as diplomatic?

307
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,434
What does that have
to do with it?

308
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,170
Answer the question.

309
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,272
Well, it's not the first word
that springs to mind, no.

310
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,741
What would the first word be
that would spring to mind?

311
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,309
Um, stubborn.

312
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,379
Opinionated, insouciant.

313
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,818
‐ Insouciant?
‐ Look it up.

You've only played it
about a billion times.

323
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,949
Are you done eating this stuff?

324
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,118
‐ It's not very good.
‐ Yeah, I know.

325
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,154
How about I order us a...pizza?

326
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,156
Uh, if you want.

327
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,125
Maybe some rocky road
for dessert?

328
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,797
What is this,
the pain getting worse?

329
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,899
This thing isn't working
as good as it used to.

330
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,434
Okay, I'll, uh,
I'll get Dr. Ross

331
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,336
to adjust it for you, okay?

332
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,004
Wait. Don't leave yet.

333
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,906

Dr. Bad News.

338
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,153
How you feeling, son?

339
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,925
Well, me and Jeanie
were gonna share a pizza.

340
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,932
We, uh, we need to talk.

341
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:57,043
Your bone marrow failed to match
the last two potential donors.

342
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,413
Win some, you lose some.

343
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,550
Hey, we'll, uh,
we'll come up with plan B.

344
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,487
Okay? Your dad and I have
discussed some new therapies.

345
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:15,562
There is something called a...
phase‐one chemotherapy trial.

346
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,966
But it's...highly experimental.

347
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,035
At least it's still
a possibility, right?

348
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,105
Yes.

349
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,306
Couldn't be any worse

350
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,340
than the nuke juice

351
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,375
they've already given me.

352
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:34,848
There could be
some severe side effects.

353
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:39,085
‐ And...the chemo could‐‐
‐ Make me croak.

354
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,189
We don't have to make a decision
right this minute.

355
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,494
What do you think, Jeanie?

356
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,264
I think it's a chance.

357
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,134
Would you stay with me
if I got the new chemo?

358
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,168
Of course I would.

359
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,841
I wanna do it.

360
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:14,254
You sure lucked out
getting that lap.

361
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,022
You like working
with Morgenstern?

362
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,191
Of course.
He's one of the best.

363
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,861
Why is it I don't feel
comfortable around him?

364
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,229
Hmm, can't imagine.

365
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,497
You know, last week
he bolted out

366
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,332
midway through
a pericardiocentesis.

367
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,034
Claimed he had
something in his eye.

368
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,435
Well, then he must have.

369
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,038
It seemed to me
like he froze up.

370
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,608
Ah, you can't believe that.

371
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,310
Let me tell you something
about Dr. Morgenstern.

372
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,647
He's taught me more than all
the other attendings combined.

373
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,349
Yeah. Maybe I'm looking for
an excuse to get out of this.

374
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,286
I don't have much experience
with laparoscopic procedures.

375
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,556
Ah! Now, see, that's it.

376
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,957
You know, whenever
you're nervous

377
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,626
you go after the attendings.

378
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,028
Do I really?

379
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,465
Well, I guess I do.

380
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,067
Have you ever done
a lap volvulus?

381
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,504
Oh no, but I'd love to.

382
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,105
In that case, be my guest.

383
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,043
‐ Are you serious?
‐ Yeah.

384
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,079
I'll do your biopsy and then
I'll come and observe you.

385
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,048
Perhaps I'll learn something.

386
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,319
Well...okay.

387
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,957
Um...I, uh,
I owe you.

388
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,532
David.

389
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,100
I hope I'm, uh,
not disturbing you.

390
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,469
Oh, heavens, Kerry,
you never disturb me.

391
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,005
Is that a lap volvulus?

392
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,707
Heard you're doing one
on Dr. Swanson.

393
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,344
Yeah, just looking at
one of my old teaching tapes.

394
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,346
Never hurts to review
the finer points of establishing

395
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,048
a pneumoperitoneum.

396
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,184
He told me that you were
one of his brightest students.

397
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,186
Aww, good ol' Swanny.

398
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,655
He's from the old
school of medicine.

399
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:58,058
Cares about the science
and the soul.

400
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,160
Well, I, came up
to bring you

401
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,529
the minutes of the blood
utilization committee.

402
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,732
Thought you might be interested,
now that you're back on staff.

403
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,634
You're always
looking out for me.

404
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:11,004
Which reminds me, are you coming
to the ER banquet tonight?

405
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,606
After all, you're
part of the family.

406
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,274
Well, it sounds like great fun.

407
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,076
Good. I'll see you there.

408
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,077
Righto.

409
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,550
So I spoke to the
pain management team.

410
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,618
It's alright.

411
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,620
‐ Sorry.
‐ It's alright.

412
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,089
We're gonna increase
your morphine dosage.

413
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,356
Okay.

414
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,758
Where's Jeanie?

415
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,460
Jeanie, well, she's probably
down in the ER, working.

416
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:39,365
No. She promised to stay with me
when I get the new chemo.

417
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,701
So I spoke to your dad
about that.

418
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,769
He's a lil' worried
that you may not understand

419
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,639
what it means to go into
a phase‐one treatment study.

420
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,440
I know.

421
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,309
The chemo could make
me a lot sicker.

422
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,544
Yeah. It can.

423
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,079
And you're willing
to go through with that?

424
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,281
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

425
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,383
Hey, Jeanie.
Where have you been?

426
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,353
I was down in the gift shop
and I got you a lil' something.

427
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,255
The new hot rod.

428
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,391
You let me read that
when you're done, alright?

429
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,060
So, uh, Scott and I
were just talkin'

430
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,764
about the pros and cons
of the phase‐one study.

431
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,800
And I was telling Dr. Ross
that we're gonna go for it.

432
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,368
Yeah, we are.
He's a pretty brave guy.

433
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,703
Yes, he is. Very brave.

434
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,106
Yes, I'll hold.

435
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,544
Hey, so I talked to Anna
and we're going together

436
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,245
but don't call it a date.
I'm not callin' it a date.

437
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,680
No, no, it's urgent.

438
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,349
I‐I have to speak
to Mrs. Carter immediately.

439
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,452
Well, page her out
of her board meeting.

440
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,454
‐ What's goin' on?
‐ Carol wrote a bad check.

441
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,422
And our medical supplies
are getting repo'd.

442
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,825
Your grandmother wrote me this.

443
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,762
Could you please have her
call me back? Thank you.

444
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:44,164
She put a stop payment
on her foundation check?

445
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,067
‐ Yep.
‐ What did you do?

446
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,136
Well, uh, nothing, you know
last week we had some bad press.

447
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,272
We gave out
birth control to teens.

448
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,474
I don't think Gamma's
anti‐birth control.

449
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,076
She does hate publicity, though.

450
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,711
What should I do?

451
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,312
Maybe you could promise that

452
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,314
you won't use her foundation
money for birth control.

453
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,516
Yeah, well, I would if
I could reach her.

454
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:05,351
Dr. C, eye exam in one.

455
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,353
Hey, I'm sure it's just
a big misunderstanding.

456
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,658
‐ Is the patient ready?
‐ He's asleep.

457
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,160
Okay. The monitor goes
at the head of the table.

458
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,797
And the endoscopic tower's
on the wrong side.

459
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,832
Dr. Morgenstern
requested it this way.

460
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,467
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Yes, doctor. Quite sure.

461
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,670
Shirley, how nice to see you.

462
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,271
You still collecting old 45's?

463
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,541
Just picked up a rare buddy
holly that's swab neat.

464
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:28,742
It's great to have you back.

465
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,344
Well, it's good to be home.

466
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,846
Peter..

467
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,148
...I‐I thought your associate
was going to assist.

468
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,617
Uh, she's doing a biopsy.

469
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:39,119
So, she'll be by later
to observe.

470
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,453
So it's you and me.

471
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,455
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Just like old times.

472
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,792
Shirley, I left a‐a CD
of some Peruvian panpipe music

473
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,761
by the scrub sink.
Would you mind putting it on?

474
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,696
Not at all, Dr. Morgenstern.

475
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,264
You'll like this, Peter.

476
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,835
The music is mysterious,
and yet soothing.

477
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,640
You have a scratch
on your cornea, Mr. Bartlett.

478
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,608
I'll be right back with some
antibiotic eyedrops for you.

479
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,711
Hi, Carter, do you
have a minute?

480
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,379
Sure.

481
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,715
‐ Somethin' wrong?
‐ Uh, no.

482
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,585
Well, actually I matched
for a transplant candidate

483
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,453
from the blood that
we donated last week.

484
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:15,288
You're gonna
donate bone marrow?

485
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,524
‐ Yeah.
‐ That's great.

486
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:21,461
Yeah, but I guess I won't make
it to the banquet tonight.

487
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:25,431
Yeah, no, you should be
sore for a couple of days.

488
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,701
Why? It's a simple
procedure, right?

489
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,269
Not much to it.

490
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,403
Have you ever done one?

491
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,373
Hmm, about 12 or so,
last year.

492
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,440
Would you do mine?

493
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,643
Really?

494
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,311
Yeah.

495
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,213
I don't mean to
sound like a wimp.

496
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,816
I'm just, I just feel
a little nervous about it.

497
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,952
I've never even seen you flinch.

498
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,554
Not even
in the bloodiest traumas.

499
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,957
I'm serious. It's different
when you're the patient.

500
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,359
Just a big chicken, huh?

501
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,928
Don't rub it in, please.

502
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,264
No, no. Hey, it's just, um...
I think it's surprising.

503
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,365
If you don't
want to do it, it's fine.

504
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,901
No, no, I'd be honored.

505
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,203
I'll do it as soon as
I'm finished with my patient.

506
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,471
Okay. Thanks.

507
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,674
Appreciate it. Bye.

508
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,679
Hey, Mark. Did Romano
see that kid with the appy?

509
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,881
Uh, yeah,
he's examining him now.

510
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,950
So, is everything set
for the banquet tonight?

511
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,885
Seems to be moving right along.

512
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,655
The university club put on such
a lovely banquet last year.

513
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,590
It's too bad
it wasn't available.

514
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,358
It was. I just thought
that the Shangri lodge

515
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,327
would be a, you know,
different choice.

516
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,395
And you actually chose
the Shangri lodge

517
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,831
over the university club?

518
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,398
Yeah, little less pretentious,
don't you think?

519
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,567
Uh, yeah, whatever you say.

520
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,801
That appy kid's dry as a bone.

521
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,336
Do me a favor,
buff him up, Greene.

522
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,471
Give him 200 cc's normal
saline every 15 minutes.

523
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:39,973
Uh, that's way too much
fluid for a kid.

524
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,374
I already gave him
two 500 cc boluses.

525
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,576
Well, that's nice.

526
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:43,677
I want you to give him 200 cc's

527
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:45,311
every 15 minutes for an hour

528
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,613
and then send him up to the OR.

529
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,615
You guys are always
fluid‐overloading these‐‐

530
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:49,716
Just follow my orders
on the chart, please.

531
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,384
Look, this is my ER

532
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,419
and I'll manage the patients
down here the way I see fit.

533
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,721
Hey, Greene..

534
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,526
I guess you got
some stones after all.

535
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,794
You're the boss.

536
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:09,570
I'll free up the esophagus
with the harmonic scalpel.

537
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,339
When I was a resident,
we didn't have cautery.

538
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:18,444
We had to tie every vessel.

539
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,880
Tell me, Peter.

540
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,615
Where do you find
the two branches of the vagus

541
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:22,983
at this level of the esophagus?

542
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,519
They rotate and become
the anterior and posterior.

543
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,521
If you cut them,
the stomach won't empty.

544
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,455
Right you are.

545
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:30,991
Speaking of empty and stomach

546
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,627
anyone try that new, uh,
Mexican restaurant on Dearborn?

547
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:36,997
I heard they make
a great chimichanga.

548
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,366
Shirley, could you turn
down the thermostat?

549
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,602
'Right away, sir.'

550
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,937
‐ You okay?
‐ Of course.

551
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,606
I was doing laps
back in the days

552
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:47,508
when those monitors
were still black and white.

553
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,376
‐ Uh, Dr. Morgenstern.
‐ What?

554
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,614
Uh...you're dissecting
near the esophagus.

555
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:56,883
Thank you, doctor, but
I don't need instruction.

556
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,986
That phrenic ligament
is really fibrous.

557
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,056
Are you sure it's not mucosa?

558
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,658
Damn it!

559
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,360
Peter, your job is to assist me
anticipate my moves.

560
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,630
I am, but he's got varices.
You could nick one.

561
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,865
Turn.. turn the music off.

562
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:13,700
Don't pull so hard
with the babcock.

563
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,702
You'll tear
the gastric artery.

564
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,704
‐ I'm not pulling.
‐ The hell you're not.

565
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,740
Dr. Morgenstern,
you're obscuring my field.

566
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,708
Oh, son of a bitch!

567
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:22,876
You tore
the left gastric.

568
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,910
I wasn't anywhere near it.

569
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,411
Suction.

570
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,814
Give me a ten‐millimeter
sucker, open‐ended.

571
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,516
Give me more suction. I can't
see what I'm coagulating.

572
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,518
‐ Alright, we have to open.
‐ No, no, no, no.

573
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,019
We can control the bleeding.

574
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,721
Every time I suck,
the abdominal wall collapses.

575
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,890
I can't see a thing.

576
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,124
Well, then stop sucking.

577
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,926
What are you
wearing tonight?

578
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,461
My velvet dress.

579
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:42,896
The one you
wore last year?

580
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,097
I didn't pass out and rip mine

581
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,632
in the parking lot
like someone I know.

582
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,367
Hey, Jeanie, you coming
to the banquet?

583
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,102
No, I'm gonna finish up some
charts and stay with Scott.

584
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,604
Oh, no luck with
the donor match?

585
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,739
‐ Nope.
‐ Jeanie, can I talk to you?

586
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,874
Yeah.

587
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:55,475
I'm concerned about
Scott Anspaugh.

588
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:56,743
You sure he wants
to go through

589
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,011
this experimental
treatment?

590
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,846
‐ Why? Did he say he didn't?
‐ No.

591
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,414
Then what are you
concerned about?

592
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:02,949
Well, he's got this big‐time
crush on you, right?

593
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,718
Doug, the boy's 12 years old.

594
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,152
12‐year‐olds get
big‐time crushes.

595
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,021
He'll do anything
to please you.

596
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,723
No. He just wants
a chance to get better.

597
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,157
You seen the way
he looks at you?

598
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,458
You're overreacting.

599
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,960
He lights up
when you're around.

600
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,862
I'm just saying, I think
he's taking the chemo

601
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,831
because he thinks
you want him to.

602
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:20,433
I want him to make
his own decision.

603
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:21,768
I know that you do.

604
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:22,869
I don't know
that he can.

605
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,012
'Pressure's dropping.'

606
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:33,680
We've lost too much blood.
We've got to open.

607
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,815
Let's do a mid‐line.

608
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,416
Shirley,
instrument tray.

609
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:38,418
Two more units of
cross‐matched.

610
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,953
‐ Scalpel.
‐ Hemostat.

611
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:41,622
He's a bloody mess.

612
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:42,823
Get that liver
out of the way.

613
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,625
Deaver retractor.

614
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,126
The varices
are bleeding.

615
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:48,428
‐ Suction.
‐ 3‐O silk on a pass.

616
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,495
‐ Can you see the bleeder?
‐ Not yet.

617
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,797
Bradying down.

618
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:51,998
Two more units
of blood.

619
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,066
We've got to crack him.

620
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,835
Let me suture.

621
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,003
'No, we've got to
stop the bleeding.'

622
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,138
We're losing him.

623
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,873
I can't find the bleeder.

624
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:02,008
Alright, we've got to crack him.

625
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,510
It's those damn varices.

626
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,178
Dr. Morgenstern,
it's been three minutes.

627
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,647
Damn it.

628
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:09,049
He's dying! Move!

629
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:12,485
Rib spreader.

630
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:15,622
Damn it! I said rib spreader!
Let's move, people.

631
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,991
Statinsky.

632
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:20,827
'Okay, aorta's clamped.
Do we have a pulse?'

633
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:23,564
'No pulse. He's in v‐fib.'

634
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:25,899
I'm starting internal massage.

635
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,167
Still in v‐fib.

636
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,502
The lungs aren't expanding.

637
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,103
Increase the volume.

638
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:33,073
Lap pad.
I can't get a grip.

639
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,609
'Still no pulse.'

640
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,110
Give me the epi.

641
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,879
'Come on, let's move.
Let's go.'

642
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,718
Tray's ready.
Here are your gloves.

643
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:45,752
Thanks, Kit.

644
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:47,888
Call if you
need anything.

645
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,923
‐ 'Carter, are you ready?'
‐ Uh‐huh.

646
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,561
Epidural didn't hurt a bit.

647
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,062
'See, I told you
you had absolutely nothing'

648
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,964
'to be nervous about.'

649
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:01,835
Sure. That's what they told me
when I had my tonsils out.

650
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,970
I was 12 and, um..

651
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,906
I was in terrible pain
after the operation

652
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,074
so they gave me dilaudid.

653
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,711
Trouble is they gave me too much
and I couldn't wake up.

654
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:12,979
'It's really weird, you know.'

655
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,682
I could hear the
nurses' voices and, uh..

656
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,619
I couldn't speak
or move.

657
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,754
I thought I was
gonna die.

658
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,989
And then I made
a promise to God

659
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,792
and I said, "If
you let me live

660
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,862
I'll be a good person
for the rest of my life."

661
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,564
Then you came to
and decided to devote

662
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:32,265
your life
to medicine?

663
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,734
Something like that.

664
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:37,170
Hey.

665
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,205
I'm really relieved
you're doing this. Thanks.

666
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,307
Oh, hey.

667
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,243
Okay, don't tell me

668
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:44,645
when you're gonna
stick the needle in.

669
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:45,779
‐ Okay?
‐ I won't.

670
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,848
I'm just gonna prep
with betadine.

671
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:48,849
Alright.

672
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,696
Your, uh, drape fell off a bit.

673
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:03,496
Oops.

674
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,170
Alright, here comes
the betadine.

675
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,939
I can't let you examine him
until after the autopsy.

676
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,742
I know. I just want
to review the anatomy.

677
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:17,744
That's quite an
unusual request.

678
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,245
Peter, why are you
so interested?

679
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:23,584
Well, uh, you know, it all
happened so unexpectedly.

680
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:25,652
I've known Dr. Swanson
for 20 years.

681
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,120
It's not easy
for me, either.

682
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,222
So do you think
it would be possible

683
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,858
to sit in
on the autopsy?

684
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,359
Sure.

685
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,861
Tomorrow, 4 p. m.

686
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,731
Thanks.

687
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:40,100
You down here checking
on the Swanson autopsy?

688
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,670
Yeah. I assisted on the case.

689
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,205
I know.

690
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:48,074
David Morgenstern
filled me in.

691
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,911
Alice, when do you expect
to have the report?

692
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,278
In a couple of days.

693
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:53,714
Sooner the better.

694
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:57,984
I'm sorry about what happened
with Dr. Morgenstern.

695
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,654
‐ Was there a problem?
‐ No, not really.

696
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,623
Anesthesiologist said there was
a disagreement in the OR.

697
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,090
But when I spoke to David
he downplayed it.

698
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,391
Right.

699
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,994
I understand Dr. Swanson
had a cirrhotic liver

700
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,830
and varices,
secondary to Hep B.

701
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,865
Yeah, he did have varices.

702
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,834
No wonder you couldn't
stop the hemorrhaging.

703
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,235
We'll run an M&M.

704
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:17,070
See if we learn something
from this tragedy.

705
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,805
Why don't you
take charge?

706
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:20,707
Gather all the charts
and the tape.

707
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,942
The tape?

708
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,911
We frequently tape
laparoscopic procedures.

709
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,913
See if the operation
was recorded.

710
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,149
If it was, you can
take us all through it

711
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:30,350
step by step.

712
00:27:32,452 --> 00:27:34,187
Chuny, can you give me
a hand with these?

713
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,189
‐ Shouldn't leave 'em out here.
‐ What are these doohickeys?

714
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,791
It's a miniature
stethoscope.

715
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,359
It's a theme.
Dumb idea?

716
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,261
No. Just tacky.

717
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:44,130
Hey, did you talk
to Gamma yet?

718
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,766
No, she never
returned my call.

719
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:46,833
This might not
be about you.

720
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:47,968
What?

721
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:49,703
I'll go talk to her
after I get off.

722
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:52,305
Thanks. Oh, and by the way,
Anna said she'd call you later.

723
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,708
‐ Oh?
‐ She was in a lot of pain.

724
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:57,310
Took a taxi home. Guess
she's gonna miss the banquet.

725
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,783
Viper convertible.

726
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,251
It's pretty cool, huh?

727
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,954
Yeah, I'm going to get one
just like it.

728
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,456
Cobalt blue, with a
white racing stripe

729
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:11,992
down the middle.

730
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,896
Yeah. Think you
can handle it?

731
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:18,999
You'll see when I
take you for a ride.

732
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,001
You haven't mentioned
any of your friends lately.

733
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,736
You want me
to give them a call

734
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,471
maybe have some guys
come visit?

735
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:28,041
Not really.

736
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:31,745
They're...I don't know..

737
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,780
...just kids.

738
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,716
I'd rather
be with you.

739
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:40,887
Look at those wheels.
Magnesium.

740
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,058
What are you doing?

741
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:47,728
Applying for a swing loan
against the equity of my house.

742
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,195
If I can't depend
on the Carter foundation

743
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,831
and until I get
some new grants

744
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:53,834
I'm taking out a loan
to keep the clinic open.

745
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,836
‐ Am I losing my mind?
‐ Maybe.

746
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,904
Six‐month‐old twins
in respiratory distress.

747
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,074
Parents said they had the flu.

748
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:02,809
Went down
in the waiting room.

749
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,477
Give me a pediatric
crash cart.

750
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,146
Clear trauma two. I got him.

751
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,280
Come on.

752
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:13,419
Ah, hey, Shirley,
can you help me?

753
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,888
If it's about the case

754
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,289
I gave the nursing notes
to Dr. Morgenstern.

755
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:18,058
Actually, I just need to know,
was there a tape made?

756
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:19,425
I didn't make one.

757
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:22,062
Okay, if there was a tape made,
where would it be?

758
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:24,197
Try the OR. The equipment's
still in there.

759
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,900
Thank you.

760
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,869
Check
the video recorder.

761
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,044
Ah, damn it.

762
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:41,014
Draw up racemic epi.

763
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,482
Yosh, you help Doug.
I'll help Mark.

764
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,885
‐ 'Need a hand?'
‐ 'Yeah, get the O2.'

765
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,419
Carol, I need the line.

766
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,988
This one's wheezing
and retracting.

767
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:49,355
Pulse ox 92.

768
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,391
Yosh, give me
albuterol nebulizer

769
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:53,927
.5 cc's in two of saline.

770
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:55,428
She's not breathing.

771
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,496
Lily, intubation tray.

772
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:57,898
Carol, I need that line.

773
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,032
I can't get a vein.

774
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,101
I'll go in interosseous.

775
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,569
Let's move her up.

776
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:04,204
How's the other one?

777
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,172
Stable. Yosh, move her
out of here.

778
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,544
I can't see the cords.

779
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:11,945
Laryngeal edema.

780
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:13,279
Probably syncytial virus.

781
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:14,548
She's cyanotic.

782
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,449
Trach tray.
Suction.

783
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,519
‐ Hold the suction. Hang on.
‐ What?

784
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:20,020
I'm going to compress
the chest.

785
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,454
Wait for an air bubble
and follow it

786
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,857
down with the tube.

787
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:25,125
‐ Okay.
‐ Alright.

788
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,896
I see the bubble.

789
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,900
I'm in.

790
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,001
Bag her.

791
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:42,909
Okay?

792
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,611
Peter?

793
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:47,848
I've been looking
for you.

794
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:49,950
You're one of the finest
residents I've ever worked with

795
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,317
and what happened today

796
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,353
has no bearing
on those feelings whatsoever.

797
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:56,857
I plan to support you
in any way I can.

798
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:57,891
Support me?

799
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:59,292
When it comes time
for M&M

800
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:01,094
I'm prepared
to review this case

801
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:02,328
strictly on medical facts.

802
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:03,930
Of course.

803
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,232
I believe Dr. Swanson died
from ruptured varices.

804
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,538
That's not
what happened.

805
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,173
What do you think
happened?

806
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:14,575
Wha..

807
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:25,118
You accidentally cut
the gastric artery.

808
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,087
I've been a surgeon
for 20 years.

809
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:29,122
I've never "accidentally"
cut anything.

810
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,658
Well, then,
how did he bleed out?

811
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:34,160
You avulsed the left
gastric with your clamp.

812
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,529
No, I didn't.

813
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:38,565
The tape of the procedure
will show that.

814
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:40,000
What tape?

815
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,968
Well, I was hoping
you made one.

816
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,539
Sorry.

817
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:47,641
Let's not
let this escalate, Peter.

818
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,342
As chief of surgery

819
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:51,077
I could make this an issue
of your insubordination.

820
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:52,478
I don't want to do that.

821
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,180
I would have never taken over
if I didn't believe‐‐

822
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,982
You did more
than take over, Peter.

823
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,051
You pushed me away from
the operating table.

824
00:31:58,151 --> 00:31:59,586
That's grounds
for dismissal.

825
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:01,622
If a man's life
wasn't at stake‐‐

826
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:04,057
A man's life was at stake.

827
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:07,093
And that life was lost.

828
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:09,129
I'd appreciate it if
your preparation for M&M

829
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,697
focused on the medicine

830
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:13,967
and not hypotheticals
and accusations.

831
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,936
I think Dr. Swanson
deserves at least

832
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,971
that measure of dignity.

833
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:26,146
The clinic's done
a lot of really good work

834
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,548
in the family's name.

835
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,182
I'm glad you
feel that way.

836
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,685
So doesn't it make sense
to continue funding it?

837
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,487
I think it's time
Carol Hathaway

838
00:32:34,588 --> 00:32:37,524
looked for other
funding sources.

839
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:40,160
She's worked very hard
to make a go of this clinic.

840
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,494
I don't think it's fair

841
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:43,163
to pull the rug right out
from underneath her.

842
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,666
I'm surprised at your interest
in the foundation.

843
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:47,734
How many years
have I tried to involve you

844
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,570
in our family's
charitable activities?

845
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,639
This isn't about the foundation.

846
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:54,074
What is it about, John?

847
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:56,009
You're angry with me
about Chase

848
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,212
so you're taking it out
on the clinic.

849
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:02,315
I am angry that your cousin
will be debilitated

850
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,750
for the rest of his life.

851
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,419
It's not something I would
take out on others.

852
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,555
Chase barely accepted my help.

853
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,591
He didn't want
the family to know.

854
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:14,561
None of you wants the family
involved in your lives.

855
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,163
That's unfair.
I care about the family.

856
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:21,067
You certainly care
about the money.

857
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:23,336
What?

858
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:26,306
You live off
a family trust, John.

859
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,543
Well, Gamma, if that is
all you think of me

860
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:32,112
then you can keep your money.

861
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:34,147
As you wish, John.

862
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,658
David.

863
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:49,429
Hi. You know, I heard
about Dr. Swanson.

864
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,197
Hard losing Swanny
like that.

865
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:54,034
Yeah. Why don't you come with me
to the banquet tonight?

866
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:55,702
Thank you, Kerry.
I just wanna go home.

867
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:01,141
Mark...you know,
I've been thinking all day

868
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:03,577
about the dean's proposal
for a pedes attending

869
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:05,145
and I think we
should fight it.

870
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:07,213
I'm a little torn,
I just saw Doug Ross

871
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:08,414
saving a six‐month‐old's life.

872
00:34:08,515 --> 00:34:10,383
Good. Doug is a
good pediatrician.

873
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,218
He's just not
management material.

874
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:13,820
He's never been
interested before.

875
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,255
This isn't just
about Doug.

876
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:16,657
It's a policy change

877
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:18,224
that would undermine
our authority.

878
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:20,460
I'm not worried
about my authority.

879
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,428
I think ER attendings

880
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:24,164
run the best
emergency department.

881
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:25,198
‐ I agree.
‐ Good.

882
00:34:25,298 --> 00:34:26,700
‐ Good.
‐ Okay.

883
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,535
'Alright, let's see now.
Watch this.'

884
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:34,274
Hey, I'll be right back.

885
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:36,276
Quinesha came back
for IV antibiotics.

886
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:39,379
I was entertaining her
a little bit with the..

887
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,147
Uh, how's her mom's job?

888
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,783
It's good. I called work.
She's going to be fine.

889
00:34:42,883 --> 00:34:45,519
‐ Good for you.
‐ Yeah.

890
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:48,589
Listen, I'm serious about
the attending thing.

891
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,557
You ought to give it a shot.

892
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,559
Yeah? Yeah.
Here we go, kiddo.

893
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,130
Dr. Swanson taught half
the attendings here.

894
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,199
Everybody loved him.

895
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,835
I'd get all my ducks in
a row if I were you, Peter.

896
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,403
I did nothing wrong.

897
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:04,705
Rumor has it
you took over.

898
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:05,872
I had no choice.

899
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,273
That's your opinion

900
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:09,375
but justified or not,
you're a resident

901
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,778
and Morgenstern's the chief.

902
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,751
Oh, I'm sorry.

903
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,556
So much for your bursitis.

904
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:24,324
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

905
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:27,127
Look, hot borscht will be up
in five minutes, alright?

906
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,531
Hey, has anybody seen the band?

907
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:32,298
Uh‐uh. I don't see
any food, either.

908
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:34,635
Don't they usually serve
hors d'oeuvres at these things?

909
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:37,303
Wouldn't wanna spoil your
appetite for the smorgasbord.

910
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:39,405
Mark, the bartender asked
me for a drink ticket.

911
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:40,774
I didn't bring
any cash.

912
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:42,609
‐ Um, here.
‐ One each?

913
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,678
Hey, buddy, come here.

914
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:45,712
Kind of an unusual place.

915
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,280
It's great.

916
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,482
It's different, you know,
but it's great.

917
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,517
It's a disaster.

918
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:51,618
I wouldn't say that.

919
00:35:51,718 --> 00:35:53,219
Here, you want
another drink?

920
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,155
‐ No, no.
‐ It's really nice, Mark.

921
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,890
‐ Mark Greene?
‐ Yeah?

922
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,625
I'm "The Machine."

923
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,661
‐ Band's here.
‐ Excellent. Great.

924
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:02,863
You guys need help
bringing your stuff in?

925
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:04,497
No guys. Just me.

926
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,366
You're "The Machine?"

927
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,501
The whole machine?

928
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:23,449
Hey...Carter...
over by the moose.

929
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,852
I'm sorry. I couldn't get
my grandmother to listen.

930
00:36:25,952 --> 00:36:26,887
Well, somebody did.

931
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:28,188
She messengered over

932
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,556
another check
this afternoon.

933
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:31,224
Whatever you said
really worked.

934
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:32,593
Thank you so much.

935
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:33,827
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ I'm coming. See you.

936
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:35,829
Watch your head
on the moose.

937
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,468
‐ Hi.
‐ Why aren't you home in bed?

938
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,571
What, and miss my
first ER banquet?

939
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:46,940
How's the pain?

940
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,208
Oh, it's okay now

941
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:49,610
after a couple
of percodan.

942
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,711
Ah.

943
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:52,613
Makes for a very
pleasant banquet.

944
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:54,347
I should pass them around.

945
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:55,616
Well, you look..

946
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,217
Thanks. So do you.

947
00:36:58,451 --> 00:36:59,820
Yeah, you know,
we've kind of been

948
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,355
dancing around this thing
a little bit, you and I

949
00:37:02,455 --> 00:37:06,459
and, uh, this afternoon,
during the bone marrow..

950
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,361
Actually, a couple points
during the year

951
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:11,431
I kind of felt like
we had a chemistry.

952
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:16,002
‐ Or not.
‐ No. No, you're right.

953
00:37:16,102 --> 00:37:18,572
I mean, there's definitely
been a...you know..

954
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:20,273
Alright, well,
let me say this.

955
00:37:20,373 --> 00:37:23,677
Uh...I haven't made a move

956
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:26,379
because I didn't want
to screw up our friendship.

957
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:29,282
Yeah. No, you've been
a great friend.

958
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:31,618
The only real friend
I've made here, actually.

959
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:34,788
But?

960
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:36,690
But?

961
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,659
But there's this other guy.

962
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,027
Ah, yeah. The guy you
told me about in Philly?

963
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:42,428
Yeah.

964
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:43,964
The guy with the, uh,
drug problem?

965
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,701
Well, I think that's
past him now, so, um..

966
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:49,503
but we were together
for a really long time

967
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,038
and, uh, we've not been
together for a while.

968
00:37:52,138 --> 00:37:53,640
Just not completely over.

969
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:58,579
I guess I'm just not
quite there yet, you know.

970
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,613
But, uh..

971
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:00,881
Hey, I understand.

972
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:02,783
You do?

973
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:05,652
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

974
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:06,987
What are friends for?

975
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:12,058
Hey, Dr. Greene,
the crowd's getting restless.

976
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:13,994
Why don't you give them
some drink tickets

977
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:15,929
while the, uh,
machine is setting up.

978
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,497
Alrighty.

979
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:19,766
Ah, ah, saved
by the smorgasbord.

980
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:22,636
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

981
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:23,737
Yes! Whoa! Yeah!

982
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,843
‐ What happened?
‐ He's arrested.

983
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:31,512
‐ Fever's 104.
‐ Is he septic?

984
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:33,346
That's what happens when
they get to this stage.

985
00:38:33,446 --> 00:38:34,648
I'm surprised
he's not DNR.

986
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:36,416
He's about to start
a phase‐one protocol.

987
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:37,483
Poor kid.

988
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:38,552
Still no rhythm.

989
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,386
Okay, let's give him
two of epi.

990
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,755
Would you take over
the bagging, please?

991
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:43,690
Somebody should
call his father.

992
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,592
What is it
with these parents?

993
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:47,994
Why don't they
just let these poor kids go?

994
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,463
We've got a rhythm.

995
00:38:50,564 --> 00:38:53,867
Okay, let's give him
tobra and ceftaz.

996
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,670
‐ You want hydrocortisone?
‐ 'Yes, please.'

997
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,439
'Good work, everyone.
We have got him back.'

So try not to hold

1016
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:50,123
Each day, we work together
as a family.

1017
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:52,125
Because we're a family

1018
00:39:52,225 --> 00:39:55,796
it's no secret that it's been
a rough year for me.

of you for helping me'

00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,403
You stuck by me
when I needed you

1022
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,739
and you've given your best

1023
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,710
to make our ER a place
that we can all be proud of.

being my family.'

'I had the babcock on the lesser
curvature of the stomach.'

1044
00:41:02,965 --> 00:41:03,717
I wasn't pulling hard.

1045
00:41:03,717 --> 00:41:05,759
There's no way I could've
been near the left gastric.

1046
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:09,161
Is there any way you could
have caught the artery?

1047
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:11,864
No. Morgenstern was
dissecting the esophagus.

1048
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:15,200
My clamp was on the stomach
the entire time.

1049
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,704
Then it's your word
against his.

1050
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:21,640
So, um...how much did
you see on the monitor?

1051
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:24,844
I got there just before you
performed the thoracotomy.

1052
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:26,779
Mmm. In time to see me push him.

1053
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:28,280
Yeah.

1054
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,915
Look, I'm willing
to express

1055
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:32,051
my concern about
his competency.

1056
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:34,186
Oh, no. The last thing
I want you to do

1057
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:37,022
is jeopardize
your career over this.

1058
00:41:38,924 --> 00:41:41,093
I don't know, maybe
my clamp did slip.

1059
00:41:41,193 --> 00:41:42,194
You don't believe that.

1060
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:43,663
You just told me
you had the clamp

1061
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:44,997
on the stomach
the entire time.

1062
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,267
I‐I'm sure I did.

1063
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:51,771
Peter, if you're sure
that's what happened..

1064
00:41:54,907 --> 00:41:56,441
Yeah.

1065
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,110

1084
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:36,281
So you feeling better?

1085
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:37,817
Yeah.

1086
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:38,984
Good.

1087
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:40,820
The antibiotics
are working.

1088

You've got a big
decision to make.

1089
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,429
I told you
what I want to do.

1090
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,464
I know. Just
hear me out.

1091
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:56,435
I'm gonna love you

no matter what
you decide

1093
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:02,107
and I'll always
be there for you.

1094
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:05,778
So if you want
to take this chemo

1095
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,446
you have to do it
for yourself.

1096
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:12,785
Not for your dad
or for your sister

1097
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:15,988
or for me.

1098
00:43:16,088 --> 00:43:18,390
‐ Understand?
‐ I think so.

1099
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:23,395
A man has to make
decisions for himself.

1100
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:26,932
I don't want any more chemo.

1101
00:43:30,202 --> 00:43:31,536
Okay.

1102
00:43:31,636 --> 00:43:33,072
You know what I want?

1103
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:38,778
I want to get in that Viper.

1104
00:43:41,213 --> 00:43:43,983
Cobalt blue with
a racing stripe.

1105
00:43:45,217 --> 00:43:47,552
Put the top down and drive.

1106
00:43:47,652 --> 00:43:50,555
And where would we go?

1107
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,924
California.

1108
00:43:52,024 --> 00:43:54,559
Mmm. Surfing?

1109
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,529
Ride the curl at Zuma Beach.

1110
00:43:57,629 --> 00:44:00,800
Sounds like fun.

1111
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,135
And we'll stay
for the sunset.

1112
00:44:03,235 --> 00:44:04,303
Sure.
