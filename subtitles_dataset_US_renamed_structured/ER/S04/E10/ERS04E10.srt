1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,173
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,509
How does a week
in St. Bart's sound?

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,544
St. Bart's?
In the Caribbean?

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,046
I defend you in
a civil rights suit against you.

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,749
In exchange,
I play doctor for a day.

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,818
You know and I know this
was not about your HIV status.

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,119
Do I?

8
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,721
Anna, this is my cousin, Chase.

9
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,155
‐ Hi.
‐ This is Anna Del Amico.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,423
We're interns together.

11
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,758
‐ Where's my mom?
‐ 'She's a young woman.'

12
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,560
She deserves
a chance to keep her leg.

13
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,761
Got a hot one eh, Lizzie?

14
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,162
Couldn't ask
for a better candidate

15
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,564
for a free fib
transfer candidate.

16
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,699
‐ She's crumping!
‐ Get on it, Corday!

17
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,400
Sternal saw!
Sternal saw!

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,308
'Doug. Hey.'

19
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,477
It's time
to get up.

20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,181
A few more minutes.

21
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,150
Uh‐huh.

22
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,852
You have to
get up now.

23
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,720
Your shift's over.

24
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,156
You got all day.

25
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,257
What time is it?

26
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,359
It's 6:10.

27
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,727
How was your night?

28
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,729
Ah, I hate night shifts.

29
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:03,830
Did you get tomorrow off?

30
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,465
Not yet. Did you
get tonight off?

31
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,400
No. I owe too many shifts.

32
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,102
Christmas Eve
is gonna cost me double.

33
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,671
This is so unfair.

34
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,574
Yeah, well, flex your muscle.

35
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,108
You make the nurses' schedule.

36
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,277
Yeah, which is why
I get stuck with it.

37
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,879
Carol can work Christmas,
she doesn't have a life.

38
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,346
they don't even
feel guilty about it.

39
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,483
Yeah, make 'em
feel guilty about it.

40
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,886
Now that's the
Christmas spirit.

41
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,253
Tell them about us.

42
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,755
This is stupid.

43
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,124
I'm not going anywhere.

44
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,358
You know that.

45
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,095
I know.

46
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,164
I know.

47
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,638
200! Clear!

48
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,808
‐ One more. Clear!
‐ Herb, Herb, you finished?

49
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,275
‐ Yeah.
‐ You said couple of minutes.

50
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,476
Finito, all
done, okay guys

51
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,778
break it down
that's a wrap.

52
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,413
Yeah, very good, George

53
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,582
you're very
good very believable.

54
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,783
Listen, is there there
any papers I need to sign?

55
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,318
Nah, a couple
of formalities

56
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,320
I'll send them over this
afternoon, you're done.

57
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,421
That's it? I'm clear?

58
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,523
Yeah, yeah.
The law family

59
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,757
wanted an apology.

60
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,391
‐ An apology? From me?
‐ Ah‐h‐h.

61
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,893
No possibility, I said.

62
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,596
You're all done, you're clear.

63
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,697
I want a picture with you.

64
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,932
‐ No, no, no.
‐ Chris.

65
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,433
‐ No, no, no, that's okay.
‐ Hey.

66
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,201
I made the lawsuit
disappear, come on.

67
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,904
Smile, this
is going up on my wall.

68
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,199
Good morning.

69
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,802
Good morning.

70
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,373
‐ 'Need some help?'
‐ No, I'm fine.

71
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,476
I...uh, damn it!
On second thought, yeah.

72
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,778
Waited till the
last minute, huh?

73
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,280
‐ Yeah.
‐ What Did you clean them out?

74
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,848
Well, I'm bringing the baby
to my sister's house.

75
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,249
You know I can't be outdone.

76
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,618
Yeah. Just don't
get discouraged

77
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,853
if he ends up playing
with all the boxes.

78
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,555
Hey, what are those
for the Christmas party?

79
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,691
Yeah, they're pizzelles.

80
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,458
Like, uh, Italian
Christmas cookies.

81
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,560
My mom bakes
them every year.

82
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,661
I thought I'd give it a try

83
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,229
since I won't get home.

84
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,463
It's not quite
the same, you know?

85
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,365
Yeah.

86
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,601
'Hey can you give us a hand?'

87
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,635
'What's with the dog?'

88
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,236
Put this in the doctors lounge.

89
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,305
A blind pedestrian
versus auto, hit and run.

90
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,541
A head trauma, brief LOC.

91
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,643
GCS 15, moves
extremities times four.

92
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,612
'Name's Bart. Lives
under the bridge.'

93
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,846
Homeless guy with
a guide dog?

94
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,380
Not his fault I told him to go.

95
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,749
I heard the traffic stop.

96
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,518
Okay, hold up, hold up, hold up.

97
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,754
‐ How's your neck? Any pain?
‐ What's going on?

98
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,557
‐ Can you feel this?
‐ Oh, uh, it's snowing.

99
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,758
Alright, let's
get him inside.

100
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,826
No! You don't understand.

101
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,327
My eyes! I can see!

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,530
Sir! Sir!
Try not to move, okay?

103
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,497
You're‐you're a black
man in‐in a brown coat.

104
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,033
She's blonde
in a red jacket.

105
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,434
I can see.
I can see.

106
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,637
Oh, Santos.
Santos, is that you?

107
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,091
It's a miracle
that's what it is.

108
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,492
You're a miracle worker, doc.

109
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,594
That's what we all say
about him.

110
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,595
'The room's green.'

111
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,362
'There's a big light above me.'

112
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,865
Pupils are equal, round
and reactive to light.

113
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:59,966
Your shirt's brown

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,102
under a yellow
apron thing.

115
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,570
‐ How many fingers?
‐ Three.

116
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,405
‐ Yep. He can see okay.
‐ I told you.

117
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,773
Guess you have
the magic touch.

118
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,374
If the X‐rays
come back normal

119
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,410
send for a non‐contrast CT

120
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,746
'Wait. Wait!
What's your name?'

121
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,814
What do you
think his scam is?

122
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:14,948
I don't know

123
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,482
but that guy
was never blind.

124
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,818
Wait.

125
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,386
‐ Hey, what's his name?
‐ Dr. Benton.

126
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,858
Lydia, don't suppose you could
cover for me tomorrow night.

127
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,627
Oh, I wish.
I'm cooking Christmas dinner

128
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,361
for Al's family
all 25 of them.

129
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,063
You're lucky
you're working.

130
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,065
You're doing it wrong.
You gotta plug in a string

131
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,800
and then separate
it one at a time.

132
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,868
‐ Oh, really?
‐ Yeah.

133
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,503
Why don't you show me?

134
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,872
Hey, Carter, do you
know if your grandparents

135
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,440
would like any
food or anything?

136
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,608
For what?

137
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,643
They're coming to
check out the clinic

138
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,010
this afternoon 3 o'clock.

139
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,847
Their annual pilgrimage
to their worthy causes.

140
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,081
It's that bad?

141
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,483
No, but the clinic
won't be the only thing

142
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,085
being checked out.

143
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,155
Henry!

144
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,389
Something wrong?

145
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,991
No, I‐I feel
much better.

146
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,059
Why?

147
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,627
You're on time.

148
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,663
Oh. I suppose I de..

149
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,565
I suppose
I deserve, I deserve that.

150
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,133
Uh, listen, I still have
to pass this clerkship.

151
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,002
No one's pulling for you
more than I am, Henry.

152
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,104
Chuny, can we get a gram of
Ancef for our friend in two.

153
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,172
Sure thing.

154
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,840
Oh that's, that's good, see

155
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,576
because the way I figure it
the only thing that

156
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,610
I really haven't done

157
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,779
is a major
emergency procedure.

158
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,013
That's a matter of opinion.

159
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,515
So, why don't
you just give me, uh

160
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,084
an LP or an
intubation or something

161
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,719
and then, you
can ship me off

162
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,187
with a clear
conscience.

163
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,723
I, I brought
my own gloves.

164
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,391
Look, please, I..

165
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,797
Uh, Merry Christmas
to you, too.

166
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,533
Who was that?

167
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,735
I hit my
limit on my credit

168
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,605
so they froze my card.

169
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,206
I mean can you believe it?
It's Christmas Eve and

170
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,474
I had your
present all picked out.

171
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,612
How much do you owe?

172
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,180
$600. And you know I was
making a dent in it

173
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,783
but with the holidays
and everything it's just..

174
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,455
Listen, I haven't gotten you
a present yet, either, so..

175
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,558
Why don't I pay your balance?

176
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,827
As a Christmas present.

177
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,961
No, I cannot
let you do that.

178
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,596
Sure, you can.

179
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,132
But you have to promise
not to go and spend it on me.

180
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,103
‐ Really?
‐ Anybody home?

181
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,072
‐ Carol?
‐ Oh, what happened to you?

182
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,641
I went chimney sweeping
for this little guy.

183
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,075
Jonathan, 7‐years‐old.

184
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,511
‐ His brother found him stuck.
‐ Playing Santa?

185
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,246
No, trying to prove
Santa could make it.

186
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,814
Complains of
shortness of breath‐‐

187
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,116
Carter, give me a hand.

188
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,118
Still having
difficulty breathing.

189
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:35,722
BP 140/92, resps
at 32, tachy at 150.

190
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:36,823
On O2 ten liters.

191
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:37,924
'What is this?'

192
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,726
Respiratory distress.
On my count.

193
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,094
One, two, three.

194
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,629
Is there place
I can get cleaned up?

195
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,065
Oh, yeah there's
a shower down the hall.

196
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,534
Alright, pulse Ox is 88.

197
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,002
Stridorous
breathing and hypoxia.

198
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,938
Two of versed
followed by 50 of sux

199
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,640
and five of Pavulon IV.

200
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,775
What do we do, Henry?

201
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,911
‐ Uh, increase the O2?
‐ No.

202
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,781
Six ET Tube.

203
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,517
The soot that he inhaled
could cause tracheal edema.

204
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,686
'The swelling might make it
harder to intubate him.'

205
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,654
‐ So, we intubate now?
‐ That's right.

206
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,524
Jonathan, Jonathan,
we're gonna put you to sleep.

207
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,526
And then, we're gonna put
a tube in your windpipe

208
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,060
to help you breathe okay?

209
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,161
Can I try it?

210
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,597
Kids are kind of tough.

211
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,198
This isn't really
a teaching case.

212
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,033
Next time, Henry.

213
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,107
‐ Jeanie, you're working today?
‐ Yeah.

214
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,842
I didn't see you
on the schedule.

215
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,711
I'm volunteering
at the clinic.

216
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,045
What are
the needles for?

217
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,279
Man with hepatitis B,
he's been sharing

218
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,681
with his friends
in the park.

219
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,049
You're giving
them to him?

220
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,184
I'm gonna replace
them from clinic stock.

221
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:41,087
That's not my concern. I just,
uh, it's against the law.

222
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,656
Well, do you want
him to pass it on

223
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,024
or get infected
with something worse?

224
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,325
Just be careful.

225
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,160
Know who you're dealing with.

226
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,695
The patient
won't report me, Kerry.

227
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,564
Will you?

228
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,300
Hey, St. Peter.

229
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,902
I heard about
your miracle.

230
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,571
Yeah, well some
of us have the touch.

231
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,272
Where's the blind guy
who needs the CT?

232
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,307
‐ He's not blind.
‐ He's not here either.

233
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,044
He took his dog and left
AMA about ten minutes ago.

234
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,746
Said he wasn't hanging
around a crummy hospital

235
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,714
when there's a whole
world out there to see.

236
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,616
Yeah, he just wanted
some attention.

237
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,284
Don't sell
yourself short.

238
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,320
So you're gonna work a shift?

239
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,356
I have been known to practice
medicine on occasion.

240
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,259
No. I meant, I thought you had
backup covered scheduled.

241
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,127
Oh, the truth is
I gave him the day off.

242
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,929
Figured I should
keep an eye on you

243
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,766
make sure you made
that plane tonight.

244
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,268
Hey, Kerry could we we
get a taxi voucher for Pablo?

245
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,302
He doesn't have any shoes.

246
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,837
Where are your
shoes, Pablo?

247
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,806
My shoes are gone,
have no shoes.

248
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,374
Yeah, we've been over this
before. You know what, Pablo?

249
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,677
I'm gonna try and get you
something to wear home, alright?

250
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,045
‐ Alright.
‐ I'll call you a cab.

251
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,647
I'll wait outside.

252
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,882
No, no, you know what
wait in chairs.

253
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,049
It's cold outside.

254
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,986
Oh, okay. I'll
wait in chairs.

255
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,654
♪ Feliz navidad ♪

256
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,056
‐ Feliz navidad, Pablo.
‐ Thank you, Kerry.

257
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,125
You know just curious
who pays for those?

258
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,194
The vouchers? Us, why?

259
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,996
Why? You probably got
a cab company to comp them.

260
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,698
‐ Yeah.
‐ Good PR.

261
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,365
And you promise to call
them for paying customers.

262
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,001
Oh, I wonder why no one
thought of that before?

263
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,368
We do it at
other ERs.

264
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,871
‐ 'We'll try it.'
‐ Excuse me.

265
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,974
Do you have a scrub top,
I could borrow? Greg Powell.

266
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,142
I'm the paramedic
who brought in the boy

267
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,343
who got stuck in the chimney.

268
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,245
Oh, right, God,
I didn't recognize you.

269
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,047
‐ You clean up well.
‐ Well, thank you.

270
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,749
A scrub top isn't
gonna keep you very warm.

271
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,950
I'll get you a coat,
from the Goodwill POW.

272
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:17,984
Are they clean?

273
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,085
Oh, and very fashionable.

274
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,787
‐ Oh.
‐ Follow me.

275
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,389
Careful watch
your step, it's icy.

276
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,892
Vinnie Capoziello,
48‐year‐old man

277
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:29,029
experienced acute onset
crushing substernal chest pain

278
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,196
shortness of breath.

279
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,365
BP's 50, palp, resps 28.

280
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,767
O2's at ten liters.

281
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,935
Saline's wide open.

282
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,436
Whoa, ho, he's sweating.

283
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,339
Diaphoretic. Are you feeling any
pain now, Mr. Capiozelli?

284
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,241
‐ Maria.
‐ How bad, Carter?

285
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,743
He's in cardiogenic shock.

286
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,277
Trauma two.
I'll be right in.

287
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,311
I'll get it.

288
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,413
Uh, sure. Great.

289
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,883
Ellis West, visiting attending.
Carter, is it?

290
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,251
‐ Uh‐huh.
‐ What do we have?

291
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,419
MI, hypotensive and cyanotic.

292
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,355
Alright, let's
start a dopamine drip.

293
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,090
Titrate to
a systolic of 100.

294
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,159
Give him aspirin
and 5,000 units of heparin.

295
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,328
‐ He's bradying down.
‐ 0.5 atropine.

296
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,364
Pansystolic murmur.
Hold that heparin.

297
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,966
I‐is that bad?

298
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,768
Could be a ruptured
left papillary muscle

299
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,369
or interventricular septum.

300
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,071
Does that mean that
we're going to intubate him?

301
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,774
‐ 'Yeah, maybe.'
‐ Okay, can I, can I try it?

302
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,175
‐ Med student?
‐ Yes. George Henry.

303
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,743
I can't get a pressure.

304
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,245
‐ Whoa, he's‐he's crashing.
‐ Need a hand?

305
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,981
Nah, it's alright,
Kerry. Thanks.

306
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,415
Amp of epi and
a mig of atropine.

307
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,950
You, bag him.

308
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,419
‐ Heparin?
‐ I held it cause of a murmur.

309
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,154
Maria.

310
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,090
I love you, Maria.

311
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,927
‐ What?
‐ I love you, Maria.

312
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,129
‐ Come on, Henry, bag him now!
‐ 'Let's intubate him.'

313
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,198
Alright I got it.
out of the way. 8.0, please.

314
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,465
Hey, wait a minute I thought
I was gonna get to do this.

315
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,701
Not now, Henry.

316
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,436
What you got in here, Bricks?

317
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,971
Gifts, mostly.

318
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,807
No time
to ship them all.

319
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,109
‐ What time is your flight?
‐ Half past 4:00.

320
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,944
I just need to catch up
on some post‐op notes.

321
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:51,978
Before I leave.

322
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,179
They'll wait
till you get back.

323
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,480
You can assist me
with the vascularized

324
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:57,017
free fibular
transfer on the Beaumont girl.

325
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,084
‐ Today?
‐ Yeah.

326
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,286
I wanna be out
of town next week.

327
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,088
What's her neuro status?

328
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,824
Anesthesiologist signed off.

329
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,927
She's stable enough to undergo
the next phase of her surgery.

330
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,995
The first phase
put her in a coma.

331
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,496
Lizzie, we started
this reconstruction

332
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:11,865
let's finish it.

333
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,200
If she comes out,
she'll have her leg.

334
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,138
That's 45 minutes.
I'm calling it.

335
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,907
Time of death 13:38.

336
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,477
You can stop now.

337
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,979
Good effort, gentlemen.

338
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,013
Part of the job, Henry.

339
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,215
Sometimes, you lose them.

340
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,017
I‐I didn't get
to intubate him.

341
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,886
Sorry, it had
to be done fast.

342
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,855
He was coding.

343
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,759
Do you, uh...want
to try it now?

344
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,163
He's...he's‐he's dead.

345
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,933
So? You're not going
to hurt him, right?

346
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,503
I'll get a death kit.

347
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,371
Wait are you
sure we can do this?

348
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,173
You want
to pass, don't you?

349
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,375
Try a 7.5.

350
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,777
Okay.

351
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,014
‐ Insert it laterally.
‐ Okay.

352
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,952
Sweeping the tongue
out of the way

353
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:10,023
and placing the tip
of the blade on the vallecula.

354
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,057
'You see it?'

355
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,325
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,128
Hey, gen‐gently, man.
Come on. Easy.

357
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,230
You don't wanna
break his teeth.

358
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,900
'Advance until
you see the cords'

359
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,869
and then, lift
the scope 45 degrees.

360
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,971
‐ Oh, my God. Vinnie.
‐ Who are you?

361
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,472
Joey, his brother.
What happened?

362
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:28,875
Uh, he had a heart attack.

363
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,143
Is he gonna be okay?

364
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,177
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,313
Uh...keep going.

366
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,380
It might be better
if you waited outside.

367
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,049
I wanna to be with him.

368
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,151
Nah, I really think it'll be
better if you wait outside.

369
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,320
Come on, push the epi
and another round of atropine.

370
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,256
‐ Sexual assault victim come in?
‐ Trauma one.

371
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,324
I'll get the rape kit.

372
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,292
‐ How bad?
‐ 'Bad.'

373
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,994
67‐year‐old woman
found bound gagged

374
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,295
and unconscious
by a neighbor.

375
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,463
‐ GCS 15.
‐ Oh, my God.

376
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,332
Multiple lacs
contusions and abrasions

377
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,367
'possible nasal fracture.'

378
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,269
Let's get
a cross table C‐spine

379
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,471
cath her and dip
the urine for blood.

380
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,073
Nasal fracture, alright.

381
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,508
Are these burns on
her mouth and eyes?

382
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,609
No, we had to pull
off the duct tap

383
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:03,910
so she could breathe.

384
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,479
BP 135/70, pulse 120.

385
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,915
Looks like a possible
ankle fracture here.

386
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,050
You're gonna be alright, ma'am.

387
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,118
We're going
to take care of you.

388
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,220
‐ Where are the cops?
‐ 'On their way.'

389
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,556
‐ Oh, God.
‐ What?

390
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,069
Hey, Jeanie,
I have a follow‐up otitis.

391
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,103
Could you see him
in the clinic?

392
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,371
Yeah, sure.
Send him in.

393
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,574
‐ I'll be right there.
‐ Okay, thanks

394
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,034
'10‐0 prolene.'

395
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,336
Avoid any
axial twisting.

396
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,973
This lumen
is quite narrow.

397
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,342
Hey, bovie that bleeder.

398
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,513
‐ Got it.
‐ Retract distally.

399
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:14,548
It's always nice to take
care of any unfinished business

400
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,250
before the holidays
don't you think?

401
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,484
Pardon?

402
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,121
So we can have
a vacation with no worries.

403
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,624
Allison has a
few left, I'd say.

404
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:24,958
'You know...worries.'

405
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,329
Kerry, can I
talk to you privately?

406
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,064
‐ Not now, Jeanie.
‐ 'It's important.'

407
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,599
‐ It'll have to wait.
‐ It can't wait.

408
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,436
I'll be right back.

409
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,041
I left my meds at home.

410
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,375
It'll take me over
an hour to get back there

411
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,443
and I need to keep
on a strict regimen.

412
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,645
What do you need?

413
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,580
I know you handle
the ER needle sticks.

414
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,649
I thought you could dispense
a dose of my triple cocktail.

415
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,084
Of course.

416
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,986
I meant, what's your
crixivan dose?

417
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,222
800 milligrams.

418
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:59,459
It's, uh,
150 3TC, 200 AZT?

419
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,394
That's right.

420
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,566
Thank you.

421
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,403
Um, w‐what do
we tell them?

422
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,673
What we would had
to tell them anyway.

423
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,975
Just follow my lead.

424
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,780
Well?

425
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,315
How is he?

426
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,117
Your brother had
a massive heart attack..

427
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,021
...that produced a rhythm

428
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,456
that was
incompatible with life.

429
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,560
We applied every lifesaving
measure at our disposal

430
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,128
but were unsuccessful.

431
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,330
Oh, no. No.

432
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,431
'I'm afraid he
didn't make it.'

433
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,066
'No!'

434
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:45,739
I'm sorry.

435
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,473
Y‐y‐you should know

436
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,710
that his last
thoughts were of you.

437
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,245
What? What did he say?

438
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,715
"I love you, Maria."

439
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,049
Maria?

440
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,317
I‐I'm Angela.

441
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,352
Maria is Joey's wife.

442
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,622
'Maria?'

443
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,757
'That bastard!'

444
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,462
Mrs. Larkin, I'm going
to need to use a solvent now

445
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,731
to get the rest of the tape off

446
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,633
it may sting a little.

447
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,468
Nurse Hathaway is going
to ask some questions.

448
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,304
They may be difficult to answer
but they're very important

449
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,841
in catching and prosecuting
whoever did this.

450
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,242
And in helping us treat you

451
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,178
medically,
Mrs. Larkin. Okay?

452
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,715
My name's Carol.

453
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:31,652
To your knowledge
did penetration

454
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,154
occur vaginally?

455
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,622
Yes.

456
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:38,258
By a penis?

457
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,760
Yes.

458
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,529
By anything else?

459
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,665
Any foreign object?

460
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,633
Mrs. Larkin?

461
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,134
I don't know.

462
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,270
Maybe.

463
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,506
Did ejaculation occur?

464
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:56,176
I don't think so.

465
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,278
It happened so fast.

466
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,816
He, he grabbed me
from behind and..

467
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,385
'a‐and threw me
on the floor'

468
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,187
'and he hit me.'

469
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,590
'He‐he hit me and..'

470
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,492
'...and kicked me
again and again.'

471
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,329
'He broke my glasses.'

472
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,465
Did you see his face?

473
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,202
'I don't remember it.'

474
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,671
Just the tape and...and then..

475
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,212
Can you finish this, Carol?

476
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,115
Nurse Hathaway is going
to collect some samples.

477
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,384
Uh, she needs a sedative

478
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,654
valium, five milligrams, PO.

479
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,692
‐ Hey, Peter.
‐ 'Uh‐huh?'

480
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,460
Guess what.

481
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,863
I was curious about your
miracle so I looked him up.

482
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,898
Bart Periard.
He was in last year.

483
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:54,535
The chart says he's Blind.

484
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:57,270
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Mm, take a look for yourself.

485
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,239
And there's nothing to
indicate that he was faking it?

486
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,942
No, he came in
with a minor leg lac

487
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,476
that he got falling
out of a dumpster.

488
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,212
Doesn't look like they
did a visual acuity test.

489
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,949
Huh. I wonder
what's his angle.

490
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,383
Who knows?

491
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,386
The lord works
in mysterious ways.

492
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,523
‐ Are you Dr. Benton?
‐ Yeah.

493
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,659
Tommy Gruger.
I'm a friend of Bart's.

494
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,894
I just saw him on Michigan
Avenue playing with his dog.

495
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,897
He could see,
says you did it.

496
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,632
I'm sorry.
Your friend is mistaken.

497
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,933
Please, help me.

498
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,602
I wanna walk again.

499
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,806
You cured him.
Why won't you cure me?

500
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,407
I'll believe
whatever you say.

501
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,777
I'm sorry, there's
nothing to believe, okay?

502
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,379
'I'm gonna take your picture
now, okay, Mrs. Larkin?'

503
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,947
Broken nose,
fractured ankle

504
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,449
multiple lacerations
and contusions.

505
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,686
Duct tape used
on her mouth.

506
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,989
Vaginal penetration,
possible foreign object.

507
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,724
Anything else?

508
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,960
Yeah. Yeah, they wrote on her.

509
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:57,297
The word whore
in black magic marker.

510
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:00,233
That suggest something?

511
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,768
'Maybe.'

512
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:05,338
Do the, uh, injuries seem
consistent with her story?

513
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,373
Story? You think
she might have made this up?

514
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,309
A victim's account
isn't always accurate.

515
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,746
Yeah, it's hard to take notes
when you're being bludgeoned.

516
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,281
Give her a break,
she's been through a lot.

517
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,551
Okay. We'll take
care of it. Thanks.

518
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,253
No problem.

519
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,922
‐ Your taxi's downstairs.
‐ Great.

520
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,024
Has Allison Beaumont
been moved from recovery?

521
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,826
She's just coming
out of anesthesia now.

522
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,694
Uh, no, not this one.
She's in a coma.

523
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,897
I don't think so.

524
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,933
Tell the cab
to wait a minute.

525
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,770
Allison?

526
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:37,938
Can you hear me?

527
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,405
Don't try to speak.

528
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,441
Just squeeze my
hand if you hear me.

529
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,010
'I'm Dr. Elizabeth Corday.'

530
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,412
'Do you know
where you are?'

531
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,447
You're in hospital.

532
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,481
You were involved in a very

533
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,883
serious automobile accident

534
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,885
ten days ago.

535
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,419
Do you understand?

536
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,456
Are you in any pain?

537
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,661
What is it?

538
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:01,928
Uh..

539
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,674
I'm afraid she didn't survive.

540
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,776
'Your mom died.'

541
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,447
I'm sorry.

542
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,483
Hey, hey, what's that?

543
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,652
Hey, oh, nothing.

544
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:28,088
Uh, Mark, here this guy
dropped this stuff off for you.

545
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,489
I think it's more lawyer stuff.

546
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:30,657
Ah, don't worry.

547
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:31,892
‐ It's good news.
‐ Oh, good.

548
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,493
So, come on,
what is this, is that for me?

549
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:35,796
‐ What'd you get me?
‐ No. Mark, don't. No.

550
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:37,631
Come on.
What'd you get?

551
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,799
Oh!

552
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,635
Who's the heavy
artillery for?

553
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,804
A friend of
mine...her son.

554
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,106
God I wished they had
this stuff when I was a kid.

555
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,675
Mark, I've finished
Mrs. Larkin's rape form.

556
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,443
I wanted to know if
you want to review it with her

557
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,745
before I give it to the cops?

558
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:54,114
‐ I'll give her a minute.
‐ Alright.

559
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,415
Mark, that was a lie.

560
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,783
This is for my son.

561
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,787
He's five.

562
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,023
You have a son?

563
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,691
Yeah.

564
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:06,527
I‐I haven't seen
him since he was two

565
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,530
but I talked to him
on the phone a few times.

566
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:10,731
You never said anything.

567
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:12,132
I know, I'm..

568
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,767
I know, I'm sorry.

569
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,836
'It's really complicated.'

570
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,071
'His father and I broke
up when he was born.'

571
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,575
You know I wasn't
really together back then

572
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,845
so I decided to let
Joe's parents take care of him.

573
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:26,547
He lives in a, um..

574
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,550
He lives in a trailer park
right outside Kankakee.

575
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,951
I'm going to seal
the rape kit now.

576
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,620
‐ Is that alright?
‐ Uh, yeah. Sure.

577
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:36,757
I know that this is
the best thing for Jason

578
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,860
although I, uh..
Miss him, you know?

579
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:41,595
Sure. I can only imagine.

580
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,398
But at least,
this year, for Christmas

581
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,800
I can send him
some nice things.

582
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,802
‐ Sure.
‐ Yeah.

583
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,840
What kind of sicko
would rape an old lady?

584
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,108
I know, I can't begin to count

585
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,510
the amount of times
I've done this.

586
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:57,644
It never gets any easier.

587
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:59,012
I'd get worried if it did.

588
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,180
Hey, Chuny, I don't suppose

589
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,414
you'd wanna work
for me tomorrow.

590
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,749
You'd get
time and a half.

591
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:04,585
Sorry. I'm going skiing
in Michigan with Alex.

592
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,820
Just the slopes, the snow
and a hot tub built for two.

593
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,088
Sounds great.

594
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,923
Hey, Carol, some
blue‐blood old lady is here

595
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,558
with Santa Claus
looking for you.

596
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:12,926
Already? She's early.

597
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:16,062
I'm sorry. As policy,
I don't give to panhandlers.

598
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:18,899
I recommend the Lakeshore
Shelter at 10th and Wacker.

599
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,567
Two bucks.

600
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,168
‐ Buddy, just give it a rest.
‐ Up yours, Santa.

601
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:23,504
Hey, go wait over there.

602
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:24,838
someone will
be with you in a minute.

603
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,641
I don't want someone.
I want the miracle man.

604
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,643
I'm so sorry about this.

605
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:30,777
Thank you so much for coming.

606
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:31,945
My pleasure.

607
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,980
This is another of my grandsons

608
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,649
Chase, John's cousin.

609
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,584
Hi. I'm Carol Hathaway.

610
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,419
Do you smell smoke?

611
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:45,058
Oh, my God! Cynthia,
get the fire extinguisher!

612
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,793
‐ 'Hey, look out!'
‐ 'Quick!'

613
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:49,462
‐ Do you know how to use it?
‐ Yes.

614
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,904
Nice job.

615
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,706
It's been, um..

616
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,874
...a little crazy
around here today.

617
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,011
Oh, man!

618
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:13,920
'All these lights need to
come down. They're way too old.'

619
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,055
Oh, even Rudolph?
I just bought him.

620
00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:17,891
Uh, Rudolph can stay.

621
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:18,959
Carol, we need to talk.

622
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:20,527
In a minute.

623
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:23,163
So, this is where the
clinic patients wait

624
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:24,798
before they're seen.

625
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,066
Tell me about it.
I've been here over an hour.

626
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,669
Um, we're still
working out a few kinks.

627
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:30,537
Sharing space with the ER

628
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,539
Is, well, it's confusing.

629
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:34,708
Hey, Merry Christmas, gamma.

630
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,643
Oh, Merry Christmas.

631
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:37,844
I was just
giving her the tour.

632
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:39,279
Great. Where's‐where's gramps?

633
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,982
He overdid it playing
squash at the club.

634
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:43,249
Thought it best
to stay home.

635
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:44,718
Oh, must have been
pretty serious to keep him

636
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:45,752
out of the Santa suit.

637
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:47,821
We have an excellent substitute.

638
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,122
‐ Ha ha, yes.
‐ Hi, Scooter.

639
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,557
Very sharp.

640
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:51,858
Is the new improved?

641
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,093
Changing of the guard?

642
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:54,728
‐ Uh.
‐ I sure hope not.

643
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,763
Chase is
executive heir apparent.

644
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,599
We can't all be doctors.

645
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,267
Would you like
to see an exam room?

646
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:02,636
Hmm.

647
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:05,539
Hey, Nat, how's
it going, man?

648
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:07,173
Ah, just fine, Dr. Benton.

649
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:09,275
‐ How are you?
‐ Ah, can't complain.

650
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,145
‐ Having a little trouble?
‐ Yeah. She's 15 years old.

651
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,114
Bound to die on me sometime.

652
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:15,616
How's that baby of yours?

653
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:17,551
Ah, loud.

654
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,786
Actually, I'm looking
forward to his first Christmas.

655
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,887
Pretty soon,
you'll be begging him

656
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,556
to come home for Christmas.

657
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:25,158
Enjoy him while he still
wants to hang with his old man.

658
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,594
I'll do that.

659
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:29,630
‐ Hey, Merry Christmas, Nat.
‐ Merry Christmas.

660
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,766
Hey, hey, look at that!

661
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,134
She's working.

662
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:43,944
‐ Hey, Mark.
‐ Hi.

663
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,345
You know if we have any decaf?

664
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,280
Decaf? What's the point?

665
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,950
Well, Carter's
grandmother's asking for it.

666
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,785
Listen, did you catch that?

667
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,687
‐ What Cynthia said?
‐ What?

668
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,889
She has a kid.

669
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,624
A 5‐year‐old boy.

670
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,326
Yeah, living with her
ex‐boyfriend's parents.

671
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,062
Is this the first
you've heard of it?

672
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,730
Bad sign?

673
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:04,931
You're asking me?

674
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:07,200
Doug warned me
not to get involved.

675
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,170
Well, I mean if she's
expecting something of you

676
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,872
you're not willing to give

677
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,140
you're not doing her
any favors by dragging it out.

678
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:15,976
I'm not dragging
anything out.

679
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,878
Cynthia's great.

680
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,249
'Hey.'

681
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:25,218
I thought
you were flying home.

682
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,053
I postponed
to the red‐eye.

683
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,089
Allison Beaumont
came out of her coma.

684
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:31,057
Well, what's the prognosis?

685
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,926
Neurologically,
she looks good.

686
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,095
Romano and I did the
fibula transfer on her leg

687
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,229
this morning.

688
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,331
Congratulations.
Good work.

689
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:41,001
Part of me wants
to run in their and confess

690
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:43,203
tell her that it was my
enthusiasm for the procedure

691
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:45,872
that put her in
a coma in the first place.

692
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:48,141
Look, you saved her leg.
She's out of danger.

693
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:49,175
She's better off.

694
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,044
That's it, isn't it?

695
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,880
Purging my guilt will
help me to feel better.

696
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:55,716
It certainly
won't help her.

697
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,918
Bad things happen to people.

698
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,921
But you...you did your job.

699
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,623
Merry Christmas.

700
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,959
So, you have
any idea what happened?

701
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:08,128
Early morning, guy jumped
through her apartment door.

702
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:10,430
‐ It wasn't a secure building.
‐ Do you have any leads?

703
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,099
No, she wasn't much help.
It's all still a blur.

704
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,968
What about the writing?
Does that make it personal?

705
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,302
Look, doctor, uh?

706
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:17,738
Greene.

707
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,973
We can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

708
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,742
We appreciate
your concern.

709
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:23,910
We'll handle it
from here, okay?

710
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:27,814
Sure, you will.

711
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:31,752
Well, what did she do,
liquidate a toy store?

712
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:34,888
You know Gamma Mill
never comes empty‐handed.

713
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,156
Who you supposed
to hand this out to?

714
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:39,025
Who cares? As long
as it makes her feel good.

715
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,461
I suppose we can pass them
out on the pediatric floor.

716
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:44,698
Hey, so did, uh,
gramps really overdo it

717
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,700
or does he just have
an aversion to hospitals?

718
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:50,203
All men over 70 have
an aversion to hospitals.

719
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,706
‐ Don't take it personally.
‐ No, it's a relief actually.

720
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:55,308
I don't have to defend
my wasted life in medicine.

721
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,043
You don't think
gamma will report back?

722
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:59,212
Well, it's a stay
of execution then.

723
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:00,380
He probably just
wants to wait

724
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,783
and get me on
his home turf.

725
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,150
He still thinks
you're a surgeon.

726
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,020
Yeah, I'm a coward.

727
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:08,254
Ah, you're braver
than I, my friend.

728
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,156
John, this
Mel Sauderback

729
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,025
headache, fever, malaise.

730
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,494
I think, he needs a spinal
tap to rule out meningitis.

731
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,296
I thought I might do it.

732
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:18,865
‐ He has diarrhea?
‐ Oh, yeah.

733
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:21,167
It's the stomach flu, Henry.

734
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,303
Oh. Oh.

735
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:26,272
Honestly? Continuity
of care is hard to measure.

736
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:30,110
Ah, sometimes you're part
care giver, part social worker

737
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,045
even part parent sometimes.

738
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,914
‐ And, um, Jeanie? Hi.
‐ Yeah.

739
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:35,516
I'd like you to meet
Millicent Carter.

740
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,983
‐ Oh hi, I'm Jeanie Boulet.
‐ How do you do?

741
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:38,351
Jeanie's
a physician assistant

742
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,386
who is helping us out
in the clinic today.

743
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,788
Cops are done
with Mrs. Larkin.

744
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:43,223
Can we scrub
the writing off?

745
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:44,257
I'll be right there.

746
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,859
Don't let me keep you.

747
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,961
Umm, actually
Jeanie, would you mind if

748
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:49,362
Mrs. Carter followed you around
while you saw some patients?

749
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,931
Sure.

750
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:52,298
Only if they're
comfortable with me there.

751
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:54,234
‐ That's no problem.
‐ Great, thank you.

752
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:58,104
pCO230, pH 7.4.

753
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,542
All good news.

754
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:04,310
How would you like to take
that tube out of your throat?

755
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:06,112
Hmm? I thought you might.

756
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,016
Alright.

757
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,319
When I tell you I want you
to take a deep breath in..

758
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,090
...and blow out hard

759
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,525
as I pull out the tube.

760
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,528
Can you do that for me?

761
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:24,064
Okay.

762
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:27,500
Now. Breathe in..

763
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:30,871
...and blow.

764
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:35,241
Well, great.

765
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,978
Great. That's better.

766
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:40,146
No. Don't try to speak.

767
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,548
The tube's been
in for over a week.

768
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,016
Your throat
needs time to adjust.

769
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,587
Okay?

770
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,122
Let me get you
some ice chips.

771
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:54,861
Can you ring the head‐and‐neck
surgeon on call, please?

772
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:55,896
Is it an emergency?

773
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:57,564
It's Christmas Eve.

774
00:29:57,598 --> 00:29:59,299
Just do it, okay?

775
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,203
Gina, have you
been tested for HIV?

776
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,506
‐ No.
‐ You should.

777
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,608
Look, the boys
are all in high school.

778
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,275
They don't have AIDS.

779
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,376
That's not true.

780
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,145
And with
your history of chlamydia

781
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,547
you're at greater risk.

782
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,015
I got to get home.

783
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,382
I can draw
some blood right now.

784
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,151
No. I'm cool.

785
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:22,022
Gina, look,
if you are HIV‐positive

786
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:23,356
and you decide
to have this child

787
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:26,026
you'll want to protect
it against infection.

788
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,127
There are drugs
that you could take now

789
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,328
that'll help reduce
the chances

790
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,631
of passing the virus
along to your baby.

791
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:33,600
Look, I don't
have AIDS, okay?

792
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:36,302
I don't sleep with
gay guys or druggies.

793
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,437
Neither did I.

794
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:40,373
You have AIDS?

795
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,308
I'm HIV‐positive.

796
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:47,347
How long will
the test take?

797
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,951
Chuny, someone
paged me for a consult?

798
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,218
Not that I know of.

799
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:55,288
God, no.

800
00:30:57,457 --> 00:30:59,926
Hey.

801
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,595
He wouldn't calm down
until I promised to call you.

802
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:02,896
What is it?

803
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:04,097
You're not going
to believe this.

804
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,331
He's blind again.

805
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,568
No nystagmus
with the opticokinetic drum.

806
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,536
Is that him, is that Dr. Benton?

807
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:12,072
‐ What's his name again?
‐ Bart.

808
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:14,508
'I can't see no more, doc.'

809
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,910
'You have
to touch me again.'

810
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,311
Okay, look
straight ahead, Bart.

811
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,090
Have to touch me, doc.

812
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:33,960
Please...do like
you done before.

813
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:35,128
Touch me.

814
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:40,400
Okay, um..

815
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,335
...try again.

816
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:44,104
Okay, let's get
him up for a CT.

817
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:45,939
One more time.
Just one more time, doc.

818
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,040
Try it again, please.

819
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,975
'One more time.'

820
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:52,378
I'll dress this an orthopedist
will look at your ankle

821
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,147
and we'll admit
you for observation.

822
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,652
They'll be
so disappointed.

823
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,320
I'm sorry?

824
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,558
I play the organ at church.

825
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:08,094
They always have
an organ for Christmas mass.

826
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:09,495
I'm sure
they'll understand.

827
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,699
It's probably too late
to find a substitute.

828
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:15,569
Mrs. Larkin, you have
to stop worrying about mass.

829
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,639
You've been through
something horrible.

830
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:20,607
I don't want
to talk about that.

831
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:22,375
You don't have to.

832
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,946
It's so hard.

833
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,315
I'm so angry.

834
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,286
'I hate him.'

835
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,589
'Whoever he is.'

836
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,058
There's nothing wrong with that.

837
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,528
I can't be like that.

838
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:45,398
I have to forgive.

839
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:50,170
You don't have
to forgive anybody.

840
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:52,506
He did this, not you.

841
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,512
Hating him won't
make this go away.

842
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:04,518
I'm afraid nothing
will make it go away.

843
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,458
Kerry, can you
cover my last half hour?

844
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:13,459
There's something
gotta take care of.

845
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,494
What is it?

846
00:33:14,528 --> 00:33:16,229
I covered for you
this morning

847
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:18,565
and you do have that bionic
attending from Synergix to help.

848
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,366
‐ Sure, I'd be happy to.
‐ Okay.

849
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:23,169
Merry Christmas.

850
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,105
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

851
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:30,343
'Hey, you leaving?'

852
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,779
Listen.. I gotta do this thing.

853
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:35,448
Um, can you take the El home?

854
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,317
‐ To your home, right?
‐ I don't know.

855
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,120
I'm gonna have
to call you later, okay?

856
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:42,623
Okay.

857
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:46,459
I'm sorry
I've been so busy.

858
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,562
Did you get to see
anything interesting?

859
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:50,764
It's been a very
enlightening experience.

860
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:52,298
Is there anything else
you'd like to see?

861
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:54,535
No, I've seen
everything I needed to.

862
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,236
Uh, may I use your phone?

863
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:57,437
Yes, of course.

864
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,605
Uh, we're having
a potluck dinner

865
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,073
if you'd like to stay.

866
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:01,374
No, thank you.

867
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,378
‐ Is she upset?
‐ I'm not sure.

868
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,751
Oh, John, I'm
ready to leave.

869
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,485
‐ Where's your cousin?
‐ I thought he was with you.

870
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:13,787
Maybe he's handing out gifts.

871
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,388
‐ Are you talking about Santa?
‐ Yeah.

872
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,524
He went out
for some fresh air.

873
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,594
Santa, you in there?

874
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,230
What is this?

875
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:26,600
‐ It's nothing.
‐ Nothing?

876
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:27,701
Sh‐shut the door.

877
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,538
Are you crazy?

878
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:32,773
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

879
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:35,509
Just a little...stocking
stuffer.

880
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,511
This isn't funny.

881
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:38,545
How long you been doing this?

882
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,614
Oh, John, just chill out.

883
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:42,415
It's.. I'm not an addict.

884
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:45,085
I just.. I do it
when I'm bored, okay?

885
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:50,223
I cannot believe
how stupid I was.

886
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:52,258
A spider bite.

887
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:53,894
That was from
skin popping wasn't it?

888
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,129
‐ You lied to me?
‐ Can you blame me?

889
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,864
Oh, come on
you're smarter than this.

890
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:59,399
I got it under control.

891
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,701
Yeah, so does
every street junkie

892
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,503
that I see come
through this place.

893
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,671
I am not a street junkie

894
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:07,173
and I, buy pure stuff.

895
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:09,610
Yeah, I don't care,
I don't care how pure it is.

896
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:12,378
You know, I thank you for
the medical advice, doctor

897
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:15,281
but I'd prefer it
if you were just my cousin.

898
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:20,253
Taking to hiding out
in cars, have we?

899
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:21,555
Filling in for
your grandfather

900
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:23,624
doesn't entitle you
to his bad habits.

901
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:26,226
I had some...work I had to do.

902
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:27,528
Or his excuses.

903
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:34,167
Something that matter?

904
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:37,871
No. I better get back.

905
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,541
Come a little
early tonight, John.

906
00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:42,643
Your grandfather
would like to talk to you.

907
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:44,645
I'll try.

908
00:35:44,678 --> 00:35:47,581
That is one
nasty‐looking craniopharyngioma.

909
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:50,383
Right here, compressing
against the optic chasm.

910
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,918
So that explains
the blindness.

911
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:54,688
Boy from the size of it,
it's been growing for years.

912
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:56,657
How do you account
for the temporary sight?

913
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,692
Ah, sometimes,
the mind plays tricks on you.

914
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:01,294
So the head trauma
could have caused it?

915
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,463
Or maybe it triggered
some visual memory.

916
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:04,965
No, no, no, this guy could see.

917
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,267
Trust me,
I was there. I saw it.

918
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,269
I don't know what to tell
you, from the medical evidence

919
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:11,237
'in front of me,
I mean there's no way'

920
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:14,207
this man has seen anything
for five or six years.

921
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,377
Lizzie, I thought you'd
be somewhere

922
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,411
over the Atlantic,
by now.

923
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:20,213
Oh, slight change of plans.

924
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,782
Oh, I didn't make you
miss your flight did I?

925
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:23,383
No. No, I just decided

926
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,587
on spending Christmas
in Chicago after all.

927
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,388
Awesome.

928
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:29,422
I'm on my way to a party.

929
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,492
A friend of mine is, uh

930
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:35,596
renting out the entire top floor
of the prudential building.

931
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:38,364
You want to come along?

932
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:40,266
Oh, thank you,
but, uh, no.

933
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,435
I'm waiting on
a head‐and‐neck consult.

934
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:43,904
Oh, for the Beaumont girl.

935
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:45,539
Yes, I'm afraid her vocal

936
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:46,673
cords might be paralyzed.

937
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,241
Hmm.

938
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:49,342
Well, don't hold your breath

939
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,645
on the consult, that is.

940
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:53,814
He's probably on his way
to a party somewhere himself.

941
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:56,382
Just the same.

942
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,718
Well, maybe New Year's Eve.

943
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:59,586
Hmm. Lovely.

944
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:03,023
Carol, I got three
things to say to you

945
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,758
Gladys Knight,
Atlantic City, fourth row.

946
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,326
What do you want, Connie?

947
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:07,994
My girlfriend has
tickets for New Year's.

948
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:10,864
I'm so there you gotta get
someone to cover for me.

949
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,332
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

950
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:13,567
Is Carol Hathaway here?

951
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,935
Yeah, I'm her.

952
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:16,637
Holiday design.
I have a delivery for you.

953
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,038
‐ Oh where is it?
‐ Outside.

954
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:20,974
‐ Why don't you bring it in?
‐ It won't fit.

955
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:22,743
'Wow!'

956
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:24,410
‐ Now, that's a tree.
‐ It's gorgeous.

957
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:27,047
I can't believe
they got it in here.

958
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,449
‐ Sign here.
‐ Thank you so much.

959
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:31,752
Merry Christmas.

960
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:33,520
Merry Christmas to you, too.

961
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:35,455
Who is this from?

962
00:37:35,488 --> 00:37:38,725
"Happy holidays from
the Carter family foundation."

963
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,060
‐ 'Oh, my God.'
‐ 'What?'

964
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:43,329
‐ It's a check.
‐ A 150 grand.

965
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:44,898
Oh, my God.

966
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,967
I guess she
liked it here.

967
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:17,363
Hi. I'm Mark Greene.

968
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:19,399
‐ I'm the doctor..
‐ I know who you are.

969
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,703
Yes. Uh..

970
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:24,404
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

971
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:26,840
It's Christmas Eve,
Dr. Greene.

972
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:28,542
I know.

973
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,384
What the hell
you doing here?

974
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,655
Uh, I came to apologize.

975
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:43,489
I thought you was
above all that.

976
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:45,859
And your uptown
lawyer he blew us off.

977
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:47,093
He‐he was wrong.

978
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,430
Uh, I was wrong.

979
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:53,900
Look, I can't tell you if my
assumption about your brother

980
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:56,369
was racism or experience.

981
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:58,905
Probably both.

982
00:38:58,939 --> 00:39:00,841
I can tell you
that I used you.

983
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,679
It wasn't you.

984
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:06,813
No.

985
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,448
Feel better now?

986
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,484
Maybe.

987
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:15,088
Can't front, though.

988
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:18,525
Hell, I was glad when I
heard you got beat down.

989
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,393
'I wanted you to hurt..'

990
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:26,066
And whether you get messed up

991
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,035
or we get a million dollars

992
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:31,371
my brother's still dead.

993
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,075
Some punk dealer shot him.

994
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,579
And there's no meaning in that.

995
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:41,381
I'm sorry.

996
00:39:57,798 --> 00:40:00,133
‐ Dr. Benton?
‐ Yeah.

997
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:01,668
How'd you know?

998
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:02,803
Your shoes squeak.

999
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,709
Come to give me
the bad news?

1000
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:13,747
You've a very large
brain tumor.

1001
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,849
It's what caused
the blindness.

1002
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:19,520
It's operable, but, uh,
because of the place and size

1003
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,688
it's going to be
difficult to completely remove.

1004
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:23,056
However,
with a little radiation

1005
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,625
there is, uh..

1006
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:28,729
...a good chance of survival.

1007
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:32,032
So, I'll be able to see again.

1008
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:33,667
Well, once the
tumor is extracted

1009
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,103
it's possible,
but...highly unlikely.

1010
00:40:38,705 --> 00:40:40,841
It was highly
unlikely I'd see today.

1011
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:43,544
Medically, that was impossible.

1012
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:46,046
I spent all afternoon
in the park, you know

1013
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:49,082
just...watching.

1014
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,786
Santos playing
in the snow and..

1015
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:54,721
'...steam coming
up off the water'

1016
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:56,590
'and‐and the way'

1017
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:59,893
snow falls lightly on the trees.

1018
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:04,130
It's beautiful, innit?

1019
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,835
Yeah. I guess so.

1020
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:12,138
Trust me.

1021
00:41:13,106 --> 00:41:15,175
It's beautiful.

1022
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,582
‐ Hello.
‐ Hey, good day?

1023
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:23,650
It ended good.

1024
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:24,985
Guess who got tomorrow off?

1025
00:41:25,018 --> 00:41:26,720
So you flexed a little
muscle, did you?

1026
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:27,854
Well, I had to give up
New Year's

1027
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,756
but I figured it's worth it.

1028
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,626
‐ Oh, no.
‐ What?

1029
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:36,563
Uh, I volunteered to work
for Anna tomorrow.

1030
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:37,698
She's an intern.

1031
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:39,165
I just thought maybe we'd

1032
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,568
spend more
time together then.

1033
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:42,736
Oh, you didn't.

1034
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:43,937
No, I didn't.
That's a lie.

1035
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,205
Oh, God!

1036
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:46,239
Would have been
romantic, though.

1037
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:47,641
Well, yeah.

1038
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:51,177
You're looking at me.
What?

1039
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:52,312
Come here.

1040
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,147
Can I have
your attention, everybody?

1041
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,717
Hello? Can I have
your attention, please?

1042
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,919
I have an announcement to make.

1043
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:00,987
Can you turn down that music?

1044
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:05,291
Okay, I have kept
this a secret far too long.

1045
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:07,728
Doug Ross and I
are seeing each other again..

1046
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:12,699
And we're very happy.

1047
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,334
Okay, pay up, pay up.

1048
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,269
I was a week to late
I thought New Year's for sure.

1049
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:18,572
Yeah, I'm surprised
they kept it a secret this long.

1050
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:19,740
You knew?

1051
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:21,007
Please, honey, it was obvious.

1052
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,809
‐ Well, I didn't know.
‐ Me, either.

1053
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,110
Maybe, uh, something

1054
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:25,679
that you guys
didn't know is

1055
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:27,914
uh, that, uh, we've
been seeing each other

1056
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:30,116
for, uh, a little
while now, again

1057
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,686
and, uh, I think
it would be great

1058
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,820
if she were to marry me.

1059
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:37,057
I mean everyone
talk her into it.

1060
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,625
Help me talk
her into it.

1061
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:41,261
To Carol and Doug,
get it right this time.

1062
00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:44,097
‐ 'Guys! Congratulations!'
‐ Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!

1063
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:47,968
You always have
to outdo me, don't you?

1064
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,003
I had the opportunity,
and I took it.

1065
00:42:50,036 --> 00:42:51,672
Congratulations. I'm so
happy for the both of you.

1066
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:53,373
‐ Thank you, Dr. Carter.
‐ Thank you.

1067
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:55,709
'Hey everybody let's move
this party outside.'

1068
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,210
So you gonna stick around
till I get off work?

1069
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,846
Hell, no.

1070
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,650
'Careful.'

1071
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:04,818
Whoa.

1072
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,323
Promise to meet
me at the airport

1073
00:43:10,356 --> 00:43:11,792
or I'll take
you there myself.

1074
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:14,194
I didn't pack
my bathing suit.

1075
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:17,397
Don't worry. I know
a private beach.

1076
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,767
‐ Merry Christmas, Kerry.
‐ Yeah. You, too.

1077
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,168
'So, you got plans tonight?'

1078
00:43:22,202 --> 00:43:23,904
Yeah, I plan
to be alone.

1079
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,405
You want some company?

1080
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:27,307
Don't you have some family
obligation or something?

1081
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,976
I've had enough
family for one day.

1082
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,344
John?

1083
00:43:31,377 --> 00:43:33,179
Whoa. You okay?

1084
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:34,380
Listen, I got
the blood gas

1085
00:43:34,414 --> 00:43:36,382
on the asthmatic in three.

1086
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,051
Only took me
two sticks.

1087
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:40,821
Great. Put it on ice
and run it up to the lab.

1088
00:43:40,854 --> 00:43:41,988
Okay.

1089
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:44,958
Hey, Henry, Henry, Henry.

1090
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:46,259
Merry Christmas.

1091
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:49,162
Oh, John,
I‐I didn't get you anything.

1092
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:50,196
It's your evaluation.

1093
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,331
Congratulations.

1094
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:52,966
You just passed
emergency medicine.

1095
00:43:54,868 --> 00:43:57,103
‐ I don't know what to say.
‐ Do me a favor?

1096
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:58,371
Stick to brain research?

1097
00:43:58,404 --> 00:43:59,706
‐ I promise.
‐ Alright, then.

1098
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,842
I will, thank you, John.

1099
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,977
‐ Thank you.
‐ Okay.

1100
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,179
Okay.
Thank you.

1101
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:10,416
‐ Thank you.
‐ Henry.

1102
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,451
Okay.

1103
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:13,286
‐ Okay.
‐ Goodnight.

1104
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:14,855
‐ Goodnight.
