1
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,107
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,709
Dr. Greene,
excuse me.

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,110
But, I've actually done
quite a few more

4
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,512
ER procedures than she has.

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,413
I used to sell vitamins
over the phone.

6
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,215
Th‐that's kind of
in the health field, isn't it?

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,383
You know, you just want your boy
to have his daddy's last name.

8
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,085
So, what's wrong with that?

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,453
How's your busy social calendar?

10
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:22,122
It's not as busy.

11
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,157
This is Elizabeth Corday,
new surgical resident.

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,358
It's a pleasure,
how do you do?

13
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,160
Maybe it would be best
if I stepped in

14
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,196
and took over some
of the administrative duties

15
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,232
while you're recuperating.

16
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,567
Bless you, Kerry Weaver.

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,068
You got the job.

18
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,069
What?

19
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,253
Wait.
Hold on, hold it.

20
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,254
Here!

21
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,223
Oh, thanks.

22
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,825
It's five minutes by car.

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,862
Fifteen minutes on the el.

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,364
‐ You're not enjoying this?
‐ No, should I?

25
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,766
Doug, it's a secret romance.

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,300
Isn't that what
sells bad novels?

27
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,469
It shouldn't be a bad novel.

28
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,238
That's my train.

29
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,608
Ah. Oh, yeah, get that.

30
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,110
‐ See you at work.
‐ Bye.

31
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,179
'He continues to gain weight
at a very good rate'

32
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,414
and he's spending
more time awake.

33
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:22,783
What about his lungs?

34
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,518
We've weaned him down
to a quarter liter.

35
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,786
'So, when can he come home?'

36
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,721
'I'd say, a week or less.'

37
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,757
Oh...you hear that, pumpkin?

38
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,626
'You're gonna come home
in a week.'

39
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,860
Are you sure
that's not premature?

40
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,495
I'm concerned
about his immune system.

41
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:36,863
Frankly, I think
there's more risk of

42
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,199
nosocomial infection here.

43
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,201
Should he be circumcised
before he comes home?

44
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,870
That's what my mother told me.

45
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,439
Dr. Tabash and I discussed it,
and we decided against it.

46
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:48,441
Well, isn't it healthier?

47
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,243
Some studies seem
to indicate that circumcision

48
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,678
protects against UTI's

49
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,680
and may reduce
the risk of cancer.

50
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,349
Yeah, I don't find
those studies conclusive.

51
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,451
I'll just teach him
proper hygiene.

52
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,153
Peter, I don't want
to take any risk.

53
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,755
Uh, Dr. Tabash..

54
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,690
...what about immunization?

55
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,693
'After discharge with OPV,
he could shed virus'

56
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,762
and I don't wanna put
the immunosuppressed children

57
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,330
here at risk.

58
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,599
Oh, I've got a thymectomy.

59
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,835
Peter, are we gonna
talk about the circumcision?

60
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,870
Honey, he doesn't need one.

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,808
‐ Good morning, Doug.
‐ Hey, Mark.

62
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,810
You don't wear scrubs
to work anymore?

63
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,946
I get tired of...having people

64
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,482
hit me up for a diagnosis
in line at Starbucks.

65
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,219
Dr. Greene, there's an explosive
diarrhea in exam four.

66
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,521
Yeah? Well, what's
Weaver doing?

67
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,722
She's not in yet.

68
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,791
See if Del Amico
can take it.

69
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,312
The decision
to appoint you

70
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,282
acting chief
of emergency services

71
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,652
did not come simply because
Dr. Morgenstern recommended you.

72
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,653
Of course.

73
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,492
In fact, many feel
Dr. Morgenstern's approach

74
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,530
to management is...not something
we wish to see perpetuated.

75
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,699
With all due respect
to Dr. Morgenstern

76
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,333
I'd have to agree.

77
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,935
I know we're way beyond
our projected budget.

78
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,671
One point seven million
over last year.

79
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,440
We are in a crisis situation.

80
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,843
And that's why
I've drafted this.

81
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,312
It outlines measures
that if applied now

82
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,948
would put us back on budget
within six months.

83
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,784
So much waste is simply due
to lax administration.

84
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,420
Well, you've never
struck me as lax, Kerry.

85
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,390
And this job is not about
winning popularity contests.

86
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,560
That's never been
my goal, Donald.

87
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,662
Just Don.

88
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,331
There will, of course, be a
re‐evaluation of the situation

89
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,800
when Dr. Morgenstern recovers.

90
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,869
But, I'm confident

91
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,704
that you'll make things work.

92
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,740
Thank you for your trust.

93
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:05,979
Yes!

94
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,901
Hi. I'm Cynthia Hooper.

95
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,102
I think they called
from personnel‐‐

96
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,670
Sure, sure, hi.

97
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,872
‐ Hi.
‐ Cynthia. I‐I‐I'm Jerry.

98
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm the unit service coordinator

99
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,942
so I'll be training you.

100
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,578
Come on around. Uh..

101
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,047
Uh, Cynthia, this
is Nurse Haleh Adams.

102
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,849
'Uh, Dr. Ross, Cynthia Hooper,
my new assistant.'

103
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,951
‐ Hey, hi.
‐ Hi.

104
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,021
Oh, Nurse Hathaway, hi.
Well, here I am.

105
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,556
Yeah, hi.

106
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,392
Cynthia Hooper, remember?

107
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,961
You interviewed me.

108
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,730
Oh, yes, I did.

109
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,131
Anyone seen Mark?

110
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,766
Check in the lounge.

111
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,335
Uh, so, let's start you
on some basic procedure.

112
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,539
Anything interesting,
Dr. Carter?

113
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,974
Yeah, thought I'd take
a look at this cellulitis.

114
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,909
From now on, cases
will be taken in order.

115
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,477
No more cherry picking.

116
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,112
Here's a little old lady,
weak and dizzy.

117
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,548
Jerry, have you paged
my med student?

118
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,382
Yes. I paged him twice.

119
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,752
Oh, Anna, uh, there's a patient
in curtain three if you wanna

120
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,620
teach your student
how to debride an ulcer.

121
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,622
‐ Yeah, thanks, Maggie.
‐ Sure.

122
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,924
Haleh, I'd like each nurse
to get a copy of these

123
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,993
policy changes
by the end of the day.

124
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,767
Did you give personnel
the wrong name?

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,002
I picked her.
She'll be fine.

126
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,037
Fine? Mark,
she was a disaster.

127
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,438
She has no previous experience

128
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,840
that matches the job
description.

129
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,842
Well, I considered all
the other candidates.

130
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,411
And she seemed like
the best of the lot.

131
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,814
Well, you know, we could always
interview more candidates.

132
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,516
Wasn't necessary.

133
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,518
Look, I spoke with her
after the interview

134
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,187
and she explained to me that
she was just having a bad day.

135
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,090
‐ A bad day?
‐ Don't worry. She'll be great.

136
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:33,927
What?

137
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,562
New chief of
emergency services

138
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,931
has decided
to change some policy.

139
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,033
"No shift overlapping."
What does that mean?

140
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,835
If we don't punch out by 7

141
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,838
she'll do it for us.

142
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,675
Dr. Del Amico,
do you remember me?

143
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,210
Of course, Carla.
How are you?

144
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,812
I hear the baby's
doing great.

145
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,680
Yeah, he is.

146
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,481
I was wondering if you have
some time when you're finished.

147
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,950
‐ You know, if we could talk.
‐ Oh, yeah.

148
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,720
Actually, we can talk now,
Old Tim won't mind.

149
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,222
Debriding his ulcer seems
to have a sedative effect.

150
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,624
I've started
nursing little Reese.

151
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,825
He's coming home
in five days.

152
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,459
‐ That's great.
‐ Yes it is.

153
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,595
I'm real excited,
been buying car seats

154
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,196
baby strollers, you know?

155
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,700
I love those baby shops.
Everything in 'em is so cute.

156
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,502
Um, I was wondering.

157
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,203
‐ I want to ask you a question.
‐ Yeah?

158
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,840
Do you think I should
have him circumcised?

159
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,642
It would, it would be
my preference, sure.

160
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,544
Uh, hold on a second.

161
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,179
Debride to here and then
dress it with tegederm, okay?

162
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,884
Is circumcision healthier?

163
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,853
I recommend it, I don't think
there's any question

164
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,622
that it's better for hygiene
and uh, I dunno

165
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,223
between us, I just
like the way it looks.

166
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,659
Don't let Peter
hear you say that.

167
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,126
Oh, yeah?

168
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,962
No, seriously, I wouldn't
have any second thoughts about

169
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,865
having it done. It's really
in your son's best interest.

170
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,967
Could you do it?

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,836
Sure, I'll do it today.

172
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,006
Hey, I heard a laforte 3
facial fracture came in.

173
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,975
Dr. Doyle gave it
to Dr. Del Amico.

174
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,677
She's in with
the maxillofacial surgeon‐‐

175
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,044
'Coming through!
Coming through!'

176
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,913
I got it!

177
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,215
Forty‐one year old male.

178
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,650
Motorcycle versus
delivery truck.

179
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,951
Wearing a helmet.

180
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,587
Blunt trauma
to the chest and abdomen.

181
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,722
BP 110 over 70.
Pulse 110.

182
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,557
We couldn't get a line in
the field, he's a tough stick.

183
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,859
Okay, follow me to trauma two.

184
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,028
On my count, everybody,
one, two..

185
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,630
...three.

186
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,000
CBC, chem seven,
type and cross for four.

187
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,168
Let's get a portable c‐spine
chest and pelvis.

188
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,570
You're not kidding,
"tough stick"

189
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,771
nothing but track marks.

190
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:25,972
Let me slide
around you, Connie.

191
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,910
Whoa! Right upper quadrant
tenderness with guarding.

192
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,078
'Let's get an abdominal
CT with contrast.'

193
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,549
‐ I can't get a vein.
‐ Mmm...I got one.

194
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,651
Damn! It blew.

195
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,822
Okay, give me
a central line kit.

196
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,023
'And what you got, John?'

197
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,157
Don't worry about it,
I got it.

198
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,291
I'd like to hear it.

199
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,727
Forty‐one year old male.

200
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,128
Motorcycle versus
delivery truck.

201
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,930
Right upper
quadrant tenderness.

202
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,232
'I ordered a CT and now I am
putting in a central line.'

203
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,867
Anna will take this, you know
there's three patients

204
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,669
waiting for sutures, nobody can
find your med student.

205
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,103
Come on,
I already started.

206
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,573
Carter, sutures.

207
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,180
Start the saline.
Vitals are stable.

208
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,816
Estimated blood loss 300 cc's.

209
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,686
We got 800 cc's in so far.
Repeat blood pressure‐‐

210
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,255
Al? Al? What happened?

211
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,758
Clutch slipped on a crane
and the cart knocked me and Bill

212
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,926
into a ditch,
but I'm alright, I'm fine.

213
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,662
‐ Just a little dirty.
‐ Jeanie, don't worry about him.

214
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,797
We've taken harder knocks
playing one‐on‐one.

215
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,265
Alright, come here.

216
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,202
‐ What do you need?
‐ Uh, prednisone.

217
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,107
This med room
really needs reorganization.

218
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,109
Why don't you write
a prescription for that?

219
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,344
I only need seven.

220
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,648
You know, we can't keep giving
away our pharmacy stock.

221
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,650
You know, I was reviewing
our financial records

222
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,086
and I noticed that
your salary's being paid

223
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,154
by emergency medicine
and not pediatrics.

224
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,656
Mm‐hmm? That's something
that Morgenstern

225
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,924
and Bernstein worked out.

226
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,192
But doesn't that mean the ER

227
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,794
is underwriting your fellowship?

228
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,029
For which they get
my full services.

229
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,298
Morgenstern thinks
it's a two‐way street.

230
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,734
No, but Morgenstern
is not in charge now.

231
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,402
Wh‐what is the exact nature
of your fellowship?

232
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,271
M‐maybe I could review
your research proposal.

233
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,073
Sure.

234
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,909
Can you get me a copy
by the end of the day?

235
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,276
If I can find one.

236
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,912
Dr. Weaver, they need you
in trauma one.

237
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,347
‐ Thanks.
‐ Uh‐huh.

238
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,249
Yes, this is Dr. Carter
calling again.

239
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,918
Can you have Henry page me?

240
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,686
No, no, actually,
don't have.. Hello?

241
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,789
Don't have him page me,
have him come to the ER.

242
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,158
Because he's doing
a clerkship!

243
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,028
That's right, he's on duty,
he's on duty.

244
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,697
Dr. Greene, Dr. Doyle
pulled me off of a trauma

245
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,265
this morning
to cover sutures.

246
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,267
I really don't think that's
the best use of my time.

247
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,903
Well, maybe she thought she was
more qualified to cover it.

248
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,140
Well, she didn't cover it.
She gave it to Dr. Del Amico.

249
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,242
Which is getting to be
standard procedure around here.

250
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,678
Carter, the suture room
is the intern's place

251
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,814
unless you can get your student
to carry the load.

252
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,349
Anna, how's your
student doing?

253
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,384
‐ Oh, she's a gem.
‐ There you go.

254
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,055
Hello?

255
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:56,923
Hello?

256
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,294
Hello?
Henry, is that you?

257
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,796
I think it's
this damn hallway.

258
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,997
You better be careful
with that thing.

259
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,799
Oh, I‐I don't use this
around patients.

260
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,400
I don't mean that.

261
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,469
I know a guy who got one free
from a pharmaceutical rep.

262
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,237
The first month,
his bill was 300 bucks.

263
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh, hey, well, I, hey,
I limit my calls.

264
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,909
Plus, the whole thing you
can write off on your taxes.

265
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,110
Right.

266
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,080
So, it's like
an economy move.

267
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,715
It's not all that bad,
I'll get you cleaned up

268
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,149
and then I'll suture it.

269
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,718
I guess we lucked out,
huh, Bill?

270
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,086
Oh, yeah.

271
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,788
I can't figure out
where all this blood came from.

272
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,190
It's Al's from when
he fell on me.

273
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,898
I knew it would
tear me up

274
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,101
but, uh, I had
to grab the cable.

275
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,036
Can you move
your fingers?

276
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,206
That's good.

277
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,975
That's good.
Have you had a tetanus shot?

278
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,777
Uh, yeah.

279
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:54,147
Uh, about a year ago.

280
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,417
‐ Are you allergic to any drugs?
‐ None that I know of.

281
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,186
Hey...there's my guy.

282
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,757
‐ How's the hero?
‐ How's it look?

283
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,392
They'll fix you up.
They can fix anybody up, right?

284
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,530
You know, this man
saved two lives.

285
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,331
How are those guys?

286
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,900
They got away
without a scratch.

287
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:17,103
Listen, Casey...I want to take
care of you on this, okay?

288
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,339
Whatever this costs,
I'm gonna pay for it.

289
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,374
I wanna keep everybody working
like we've been working.

290
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,810
But, uh, you know,
I got to keep a lid on things.

291
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,046
So, I don't want this going
on to workers comp.

292
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,281
I don't know how bad
this is gonna be.

293
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,916
Well, what are we
talking about here?

294
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,819
‐ Some stitches, a cast?
‐ He might need surgery.

295
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,855
'That's okay, you put it
on your health insurance.'

296
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,389
I pick up whatever
spills over

297
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,291
and I keep you on
the employment rolls.

298
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,894
I don't know how my hands
are gonna work after this.

299
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,966
You know what this is gonna cost
me if it goes on workers comp.

300
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,500
If he doesn't go
on workers comp

301
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,003
he won't qualify
for disability.

302
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,772
Suddenly, nurses
know everything.

303
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,408
I'm gonna go
make some calls.

304
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,115
I had an interesting wound
earlier this morning.

305
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,483
A linoleum knife.

306
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,485
'The cut was as clean
as with a scalpel.'

307
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,220
‐ Huh.
‐ 'Hey, Carter.'

308
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,855
Can you take a case for me?
I'm suddenly swamped.

309
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,023
Sure.

310
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,093
Hey, uh, Chasity..

311
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,260
...dress that for me, would you?

312
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,599
Twenty‐seven year old woman,
altered level of consciousness.

313
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,101
No evidence of trauma.
Her husband brought her in.

314
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,036
Thanks, Anna.

315
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,106
Mr. Torren?
I'm Dr. Carter.

316
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,908
I'll be taking
care of your wife.

317
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,910
I don't know what happened,
last night, she was fine

318
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,978
but I couldn't wake
her up this morning.

319
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,980
Could she have
hit her head somehow?

320
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,381
I don't think so.

321
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,521
Did she complain earlier
about having a headache?

322
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,355
Fever? Nausea?

323
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,224
No, nothing.
She was fine.

324
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,593
Heart and lungs are normal.
That's good.

325
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,862
She's not having
any trouble breathing.

326
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,297
Kirsty, honey,
can you hear me?

327
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,968
For God's sake,
baby, what's wrong?

328
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,103
Please just wake up.

329
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,305
Pupils are
mid‐positioned and fixed.

330
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,282
Corneal reflexes still intact.

331
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,884
That's good.

332
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,586
What‐what are you doing?

333
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,354
I'm going to check
the movement of her eyes

334
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,456
adjusting to the changing
position of her head.

335
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,525
It'll tell us if there's
brain stem involvement.

336
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,041
‐ Uh, no doll's eye response.
‐ What does that mean?

337
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,476
'Uh, It's a little
early to tell.'

338
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,680
I‐I wanna check some labs
and do a head CT.

339
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,147
Why don't you go
wait in the waiting room

340
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,616
and I'll, uh,
keep you posted.

341
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,450
It's bad, isn't it? I can tell
by the way you're acting.

342
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,686
We're really not gonna
know anything

343
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,154
until we've run the tests.

344
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,290
Well, do whatever
you have to, anything.

345
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,558
I have really good insurance.

346
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:53,960
‐ Okay.
‐ Please?

347
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,111
Excuse me.
Where's the Benton baby?

348
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,379
‐ Reese?
‐ Yeah. No. Benton.

349
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,381
Reese Benton?
He's in the procedure room.

350
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,382
Okay.

351
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,154
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait,
What are you doing?

352
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,956
I'm circumcising him.

353
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,958
No. I don't
want him circumcised.

354
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,594
Well, you don't want me to leave
it half‐done, do you?

355
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:28,662
There.

356
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,397
Look, I didn't
want him circumcised.

357
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,999
Who gave you permission
to perform this procedure?

358
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,668
Will you open up
the xeroform gauze, please?

359
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,203
‐ His mother.
‐ Well, she had no right to.

360
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,239
Look, I'm sorry.
I assumed it was agreed to.

361
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,341
No, it wasn't.

362
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,243
But, uh, this isn't
between you and I.

363
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,045
It's between
you and Carla.

364
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,580
And uh, it's done.

365
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,981
Let's get this little guy
back into his‐‐

366
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,283
No, no, I‐I‐I got him.
I got him.

367
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,519
Come here, come here, come here.

368
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,621
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

369
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:57,290
Come here, come here.

370
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,428
Shh shh shh.

371
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,430
Shh shh shh.

372
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,033
It's okay, it's okay.

373
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,015
Edema of the brain stem.
Probably an infarct.

374
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,585
I'd go along with the
symptoms you described.

375
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,319
How did she respond
to sternal rub?

376
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,654
Withdrawal.

377
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:29,122
Alright, let's see.

378
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,597
Yeah, she's decerebrating now.

379
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,231
I don't think it'll
be long before she goes

380
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,633
into full respiratory arrest.

381
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,069
She's 27 years old.

382
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,505
Any family members around?

383
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,139
Her husband.
He's in shock.

384
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,374
He doesn't know
what to, what to think.

385
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,144
Be sure you talk to him
about organ donation.

386
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,817
They'll be taking you up
to x‐ray in a few minutes.

387
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,452
‐ How's the pain?
‐ Okay.

388
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,255
Since whatever they're
giving me through that tube.

389
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,325
Better living
through chemistry, huh?

390
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,227
I'm sorry we had to cut
your shirt to pieces

391
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,429
in order to get it off.

392
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,198
Time for a
new one anyway.

393
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,400
'With my first
disability check.'

394
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,105
Is this yours?

395
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,677
Uh, no‐no, officer,
not mine.

396
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,147
Did you smoke this today?

397
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,083
Never saw it before.

398
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,719
You were operating dangerous
machinery, men were hurt.

399
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:36,823
Men are alive because
I grabbed a running cable, lady.

400
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,660
Because I tore
my hands to shreds.

401
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,830
You can smoke it..

402
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:46,767
...or stick it where
the sun don't shine.

403
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,735
I told you,
it's not mine.

404
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,339
Alright, I'll just
ask your boss.

405
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,608
Maybe he dropped it.

406
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:58,478
Okay.
Oh, Dr. Greene.

407
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,680
Hi. How was
your first day?

408
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,347
Oh, she's doing great.

409
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,316
We're, uh, we're just
starting lab requisitions.

410
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,350
Oh, I'm so lucky.

411
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,385
After my interview

412
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,787
I didn't think I had a chance.

413
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,322
‐ What‐what happened?
‐ A disaster. I cried.

414
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,762
We're glad that you're here.

415
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:16,763
Thanks.

416
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,502
‐ Hi.
‐ Heather.

417
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,136
I left a message
on your machine

418
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,605
about the sports
medicine dinner.

419
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:25,839
Yeah, and I left
a message that

420
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,240
I wasn't gonna
be able to make it.

421
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,609
Yeah, well, you sounded
a little vague

422
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:31,244
so, I'm giving it
a face‐to‐face try.

423
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,613
Come on, it's such a coup
if I show up

424
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,214
with a handsome,
brilliant doctor‐‐

425
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,216
Oh, and you couldn't find
anyone else, so..

426
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,551
Okay, busted.

427
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,620
Look, I already bragged
I was bringing a doctor.

428
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,588
I know it's a mercy date,
but I'll make it up to you.

429
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:42,789
‐ I promise.
‐ I'm sorry.

430
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,558
Tonight, I just can't.

431
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,426
Is it me or the event?

432
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,794
I mean, um,
does "no" mean never?

433
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,696
No. It, just tonight.

434
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,598
'There's a truck in the
ambulance bay, someone's hurt.'

435
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,434
‐ I‐I should check this out.
‐ Okay.

436
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,770
If there's a lot of blood.
It could be an arterial injury.

437
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,171
Grab some lab pads.

438
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,673
Let's get a pressure
dressing out here.

439
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,942
He was ejecting a clip
and shot himself in the leg.

440
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,211
Glenda, don't leave
the ordnance.

441
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,780
Yo, you can't take
no weapons in there.

442
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,182
This is our best stock,
I can't leave it in the truck.

443
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,383
Give it to me.

444
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,953
Hey, Jer, keep these safe, man.

445
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,420
Jerry, we're going
to trauma two.

446
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,322
‐ Glenda.
‐ I'm right here, honey.

447
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,558
You secured the weapons, baby?

448
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,225
Yes, baby, I did.

449
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,761
We were on our way
to a guns and flags show

450
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,228
up in Lansing
to set up a booth.

451
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,198
Glenda, come close.

452
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,534
Don't let them take the leg.

453
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,503
Don't let 'em, Glenda.

454
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,874
I was concerned
about his health.

455
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,909
My son's health is on my mind
24 hours a day.

456
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,443
‐ Our son.
‐ What?

457
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,680
You can't divide our
baby's life into categories.

458
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,348
'Say I'm in charge of health,
and you do the diapers, no.'

459
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,618
You use the medicine
to hide behind so we don't talk.

460
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,452
Carla, we're talking now.

461
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,890
This isn't
a conversation, okay?

462
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,492
'Cause you don't care
what I think or feel.

463
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,262
I might not be your choice
for the mother of your child

464
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,364
but I'm not gonna be left out,
we'll have to share.

465
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,400
Like you shared
in the circumcision, right?

466
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,737
I was mad.

467
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,774
Come on, come clean, Peter.

468
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,342
Your attitude about circumcision

469
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,577
has nothing
to do with his health.

470
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:11,912
It has to do with
you wanting him

471
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,413
to look like you
in the shower.

472
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,315
So, what if I do?
Carla, he's my son.

473
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,650
Then why didn't
you say that, then?

474
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,318
I understand that.

475
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,986
Instead of you blowing off
a lot of medical steam

476
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,823
that don't make no...damn sense.

477
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,993
Carla, what happened
to that boy's penis

478
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:28,962
should have been
left up to me.

479
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,701
This type of stroke
can happen to anybody.

480
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,837
It might be
something congenital.

481
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,038
It's so unfair.

482
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,673
But as long as
she's still alive

483
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:40,941
I mean, there's hope, right?

484
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,709
As the swelling increases

485
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,278
it may affect
her ability to breathe.

486
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,347
'Then, the question
becomes whether'

487
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,551
'it's in Kirsten's best interest
to put her on a ventilator.'

488
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,985
Let her die?

489
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:55,989
We can sustain her life
on a respirator..

490
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,793
...but the question is,
what kind of life would it be?

491
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:03,396
I can't believe that it's all
just gonna be over like this.

492
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,968
Mm‐hmm.

493
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,873
You might think about whether
organ donation is something

494
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,542
that she would want.

495
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,910
Yeah.

496
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,379
Yeah.

497
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,347
Kirsten would wanna
help people.

498
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:27,320
Did you see that?

499
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,822
Oh, she may move a little bit

500
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,691
'from time to time.'

501
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,465
'Oh, my God, she's talking.'

502
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,767
'Do you hear? She's talking.'

503
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,736
Kirsty honey, can you hear me?

504
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:48,975
‐ What?
‐ 'Yes.'

505
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,878
Yes, honey, it's me.

506
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:53,947
She's coming around.
Oh, my God!

507
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,416
'She's alright.'

508
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,723
Sinus tach
on the scope.

509
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,591
Entrance wound on the left
medial thigh crossing

510
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,694
the midline exit wound
by the lateral fibular.

511
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:09,596
Let's get him portable
x‐ray down here.

512
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,932
‐ Ed, you feel this?
‐ Yeah!

513
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:13,834
No DP
or posterior pulses.

514
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,936
Dr. Greene, that woman
with the stroke, she's awake.

515
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,671
‐ What woman?
‐ 'The brain stem bleed.'

516
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,806
‐ No, she can't be.
‐ She is. She's talking.

517
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,808
Go on.
I'll call vascular.

518
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:22,976
Did you show me
the right CT?

519
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,911
Yes. She was comatose.

520
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:28,048
Carter...people with
brain stem infarctions

521
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,083
they don't just wake up.

522
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:35,121
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

523
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:36,657
What happened to me?

524
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,025
Well, that's what we
want to determine.

525
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,460
Follow my finger.

526
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,528
How do you feel?

527
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:43,396
She's fine.
Look at her.

528
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,599
Fine.
Just a little tired.

529
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,102
How long do I
have to stay here?

530
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,171
We need to keep you under
observation for a while.

531
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:54,007
‐ Dr. Carter.
‐ Excuse me.

532
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,110
See this?

533
00:22:58,178 --> 00:22:59,713
This little schmutz?

534
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,481
Could be a warning leak
from the aneurysm

535
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,584
trickled down and caused
her brain stem to swell.

536
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:04,951
Sh‐should we do an LP?

537
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:06,820
No. That'd be
a waste of time.

538
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,054
Uh, this could blow.

539
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:10,524
Let's get an MRI
right away. Okay?

540
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:15,195
Brought some clothes
for you to wear home.

541
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,396
Nice.

542
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:20,033
Does Bill know
you're HIV positive?

543
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,672
No.

544
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,941
Well, I‐I think
you better tell him.

545
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:30,010
My blood didn't
get mixed with his.

546
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:32,178
I mean, you saw for yourself
he doesn't have a cut on him.

547
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,147
He's got
some skin abrasions.

548
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,553
Look, Jeanie, uh..

549
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,087
...these are working
guys, okay?

550
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:44,024
It‐it's not like
around here.

551
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:46,527
That gets out,
I'll be out of a job.

552
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,062
It was rough telling
people here, but I did it.

553
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,233
He should be tested, he should
be put on the triple cocktail

554
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:56,169
until his test results
come back.

555
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:59,139
‐ For a few scratches?
‐ Yeah!

556
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,044
How long you think they'll
take doing Ed's x‐rays?

557
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:06,680
Uh...just depends on
how backed up they are.

558
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,114
Whoa! How much is this?

559
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:09,983
Two hundred
and seventy five bucks.

560
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:13,520
Here. Put this up
to your shoulder.

561
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:15,589
Feel the potential.

562
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,891
'Last year, we sold
those to everybody.'

563
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,660
'You ever hear
of Colonel Draht?'

564
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:20,694
Uh‐uh.

565
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:21,995
He is doing some fine work

566
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:24,197
with weapons, training
patriots down in Texas.

567
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,766
Like that guy
from Waco?

568
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:28,735
What's the range on it?

569
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,136
'That'll chug a grenade'

570
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,173
into an area target
at 350 meters.

571
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,542
Buy it!
I'll give you a break.

572
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:37,944
But with Ed hurting all week,
we sure won't make the gun show.

573
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,115
‐ Jerry!
‐ 'Honey, it's disarmed.'

574
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,650
The Feds have us hamstrung.

575
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:46,620
It's illegal to sell
usable ordnance.

576
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,154
'But if you
take that home..'

577
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:51,858
...there's a kit
for 70 bucks.

578
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,259
Mm‐hmm, my neighbor
has this dog

579
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:55,061
that barks all night
every night.

580
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,565
Woof!
Woof!

581
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:34,100
Damn, I guess Ed
used a kit on that one.

582
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,212
No. No, I‐I don't belong
to any organizations.

583
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:48,114
‐ This was all an accident.
‐ I think it's against the law.

584
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:49,916
Look it up in the book.
I don't write them.

585
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,752
That is our personal property.

586
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:54,821
I know my rights
according to your constitution.

587
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:57,624
'Can you hear me?

588
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:59,192
How about when I speak
like this?

589
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:04,665
Yes, but the‐the ringing
is really loud.

590
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,132
‐ Oh, what?
‐ It tickles.

591
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,034
Oh, sorry.

592
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,804
Well, eardrum
is intact.

593
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,839
Let me take a look
at the other side.

594
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:14,975
I hope they're clean,
my ears.

595
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:17,143
Very clean.

596
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:18,845
If the tinnitus
continues‐‐

597
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,013
Tinnitus?

598
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,848
The ringing
in your ears.

599
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,349
Uh, you may have to go
see a specialist

600
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:25,385
just to get your hearing
checked, okay?

601
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,020
Uh‐huh.

602
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,088
Thanks.

603
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,958
You know, I feel
really safe here.

604
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:33,393
After today?

605
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,929
I think it's having
all you doctors around.

606
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:38,632
I don't feel like
I'm out there on my own.

607
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:41,101
Out there on a smile
and a shoestring.

608
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:42,135
Isn't that from something?

609
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,904
Oh, "Death Of A Salesman."

610
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,639
We did it when
I was in high school.

611
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:47,841
My teacher told me
I had talent

612
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:50,210
but he was just trying
to get into my pants.

613
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:53,179
I think I saw
that play in college.

614
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:55,882
It's so sad when that guy
looks back over his whole life

615
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:58,284
and there's
just nothing there.

616
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:02,022
Yeah.

617
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:03,256
I better get back
to learning codes.

618
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,792
‐ So...thanks again.
‐ Sure.

619
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,264
So...do we have exposure?

620
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,066
We've mobilized
the proximal segment

621
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,400
and we've
got a clean edge.

622
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,036
So this is the
weapons merchant

623
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,938
who cost us
an ambulance?

624
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,074
Damn lucky
it won't cost him a leg.

625
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,946
Dr. Corday will assist

626
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,448
in the anastomosis
of the popliteal.

627
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,017
5‐0 prolene
on a c‐1 needle.

628
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:32,452
Uh, we normally use 6‐0.

629
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,855
No. 5‐0 is fine.

630
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:37,791
What is your preference
on procedure, Ms. Corday?

631
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,325
I've had good results
with the triangulation

632
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,694
technique of carel.

633
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,295
Ah! Favorite
among the British.

634
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,197
I had the pleasure of working
with the British surgeons

635
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,768
on the joint NATO
exercise in 1974.

636
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:50,370
Tell me, do you know
Sir Lyle Sugden?

637
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:53,173
Oh, Suggy? Yes!

638
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,275
Perhaps you don't know.
He's dead.

639
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:59,112
‐ Oh! Great loss.
‐ No. Rather a relief, actually.

640
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,815
Towards the end he got a bit
shaky for slash and dash.

641
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:05,118
"Slash and dash?"
Oh, I love those British terms.

642
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:08,254
Dr. Benton, suppose Ms. Corday
asked you for a torch..

643
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,190
...what would you give her?

644
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:12,092
Actually, I've taken
to saying "flashlight."

645
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,928
Once in the field hospital,
mid thoracotomy..

646
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,296
...we had
a power failure.

647
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:18,364
Sir Lyle yelled,
"A torch, a torch!"

648
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:19,733
I thought
he had snapped.

649
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,035
Is he going
to burn the OR?

650
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,504
I said,
"Maybe when we finish

651
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:25,806
we should all break
for a cuppa, what oh?"

652
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,241
Stand back!

653
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,476
‐ What have you got?
‐ Laura Quentin, 18.

654
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:34,314
Upper GI bleed.
Tachy at 115.

655
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:36,149
I gave a liter
of normal Saline.

656
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,450
I know her.

657
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,285
Alright, come on.
Let's go, everybody!

658
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,486
‐ Ready?
‐ Everybody ready?

659
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:42,823
One, two, three.

660
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:45,826
Let's get a CBC, PT and
a type and cross four.

661
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,393
It's probably from repeated
vomiting. She's bulimic.

662
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:48,995
She was in here
a few weeks ago.

663
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,096
Why wasn't she admitted
to psych?

664
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,498
I'm scared.
Am I gonna die?

665
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,268
No. You're gonna be okay.

666
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,504
Well, no wonder
she's back here.

667
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,907
Run another liter.

668
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:02,108
Who's attending?

669
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,177
Greene.

670
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,780
So we're picking
up his slack?

671
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:08,982
Well, we are, aren't we?

672
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,452
Yeah, right there.

673
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:14,454
That's a bleed
in the left anterior

674
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:15,522
inferior cerebellar artery.

675
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:16,990
Yeah, process the film.

676
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:19,092
‐ I'll call a neurosurgeon.
‐ Yeah.

677
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,461
Mrs. Torren?

678
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:24,164
Mrs. Torren!

679
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:26,066
Dr. Greene,
she's decerebrating!

680
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,834
I'll set up
for intubation.

681
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:30,003
Carter, get her husband
to sign a consent

682
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:32,338
for immediate surgery.
I'll book an OR.

683
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:33,874
‐ Is she alright?
‐ No.

684
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,375
‐ She needs immediate surgery.
‐ Surgery?

685
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,844
The MRI just showed a leaking
aneurysm in her cerebellum.

686
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,479
It has to be operated
on immediately.

687
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:41,014
We'll need you to sign
this consent form.

688
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,816
I'm not signing
anything.

689
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,851
You just told me she was dying
and you wanted her organs.

690
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,486
And now she's fine and‐‐

691
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,989
She is not fine. She has a
hemorrhage in her cerebellum.

692
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:50,957
When she went in there,
she was fine.

693
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:53,960
Carter, transport is on the way.
Be ready to intubate.

694
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,495
I have to find Dr. Corelli.
He's in surgery.

695
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:57,330
‐ We don't have consent.
‐ What?

696
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,133
She was fine...talking.

697
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,568
I don't want you
opening her head.

698
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,469
Mr. Torren, listen
very carefully.

699
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:05,438
Your wife will die
if she does not have

700
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,107
an operation as soon
as possible.

701
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,474
I want her moved!

702
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:09,976
That will kill her.
Is that what you want?

703
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,344
I know how you care
for your wife

704
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,613
but please
let us operate.

705
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:15,849
I'm serious.
We are talking minutes.

706
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:28,595
These are the post‐op forms
Dr. Anspaugh prefers, okay?

707
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:31,464
What a dreadful
old gasbag!

708
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,099
I mean, he's a
decent enough surgeon

709
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:37,403
but all that banging on,
pathetic anglophilia.

710
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:40,507
Tell me, do you
call it "pimping?"

711
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,108
‐ What?
‐ You know.

712
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:43,176
Treating you
like a med student

713
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:44,578
with all those
silly questions.

714
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:46,079
We call that "pimping."

715
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:48,248
Yeah. Yeah, that's
what we call it.

716
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,350
Fortunately, in the UK
the old tosses

717
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:51,985
are too lazy
to come to the ORs.

718
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:54,187
What?

719
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,388
We don't usually refer

720
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,123
to our senior surgeons
that way.

721
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,925
Oh, so I should stop
speaking my mind?

722
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,927
Oh, no, no, no.
Not on my account.

723
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,233
I watched her talking
on the phone to Anspaugh

724
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,402
and girlfriend
did not look happy.

725
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:13,073
Her first day,
and the ER blows up!

726
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:15,341
I don't imagine
he would have said, "Attaboy!"

727
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,512
I see they got
that door repaired.

728
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,113
‐ Dr. Weaver.
‐ Yeah.

729
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:22,549
I‐I'm just so relieved
that no one was hurt.

730
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,518
Thank you, doctor.

731
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,552
‐ 'Doug.'
‐ Yeah?

732
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:27,453
I know it's been
crazy today

733
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:29,623
but did you get a copy
of your research?

734
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:33,159
Yeah, I just haven't had
a chance to do it yet, Kerry.

735
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:35,095
Maggie? What have you,
uh, got?

736
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:38,498
‐ Uh, abscess.
‐ Simple I and D.

737
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:42,235
Hmm. Looks like
a fairly deep abscess.

738
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,705
Uh, booths in that bar
are all rotten.

739
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,207
There's nails sticking up,
maybe an inch.

740
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,142
Did you, uh,
read my directive?

741
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,376
Uh, yeah.

742
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,346
'Oh, that really hurts.'

743
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:56,382
Yeah, most people don't
understand what's at stake here.

744
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,986
The county is just looking
for an excuse to close this ER.

745
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,157
Lab tests, x‐rays, CT scans.
They just cannot be justified.

746
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,459
Next time you sit on a nail,
you should get in here sooner.

747
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:10,230
People just won't realize that
I'm trying to save this place.

748
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:13,199
Uh, I‐I need
the half‐inch iodoform.

749
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:17,037
I'm hoping that a few people
will understand

750
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,640
and come on board.

751
00:32:19,673 --> 00:32:22,108
Oh...yeah.

752
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,078
Cut?

753
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,017
Where's Dr. Corelli?

754
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,418
In three, finishing
a laminectomy.

755
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,020
You can't go in there.

756
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:36,990
Dr. Corelli?

757
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,525
Mark Greene.
ER attending.

758
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,293
You know
this is not allowed.

759
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,729
Dr. Corelli, I've
got an emergency.

760
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:44,497
It better be good,
Dr. Greene.

761
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:46,667
Twenty five year old woman
came in comatose

762
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,735
followed by periods
of brief lucidity

763
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:51,137
after which
she decompensated.

764
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:55,341
She's posturing GCS 5.
MRI shows a cerebellar bleed.

765
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,377
I took the liberty
of booking OR five.

766
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,712
Helen, can you
close for me?

767
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:06,452
‐ Five pounds enough?
‐ Alright.

768
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,054
Okay, buddy, you're gonna
feel a little pressure

769
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,623
right here at the top
of your leg.

770
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,625
In the past I've found
ice and trendelenburg

771
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,627
excellent adjuvant therapies
for reduction

772
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,596
of these inguinal hernias.

773
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:20,400
‐ Can we get an ice pack?
‐ Sure.

774
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,703
Alright, buddy.
Now we're gonna fix you up.

775
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:26,239
But first thing we gotta do...
is stand you on your head.

776
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,308
‐ Kind of weird, huh?
‐ 'I like your technique.'

777
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,644
‐ Cranking the bed?
‐ No. With the children.

778
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,178
You're so at ease with them.

779
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:34,581
Well...that's where
I spend all my time.

780
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:37,417
All your time?
That's certainly dedication.

781
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,653
I've come to crave
a bit of leisure.

782
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,421
Yeah, it's not all work
and no play.

783
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:43,056
How you doing there,
big guy?

784
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,058
So, when one plays,
where does one play?

785
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,459
I mean, here in Chicago?

786
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:51,231
Alright. Now...I know
you can take pain.

787
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:54,267
Let's see if you could
take a little cold. Ha?

788
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,602
Aah, what a guy!

789
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:57,203
Alright. Why don't we
just wait and see?

790
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:59,305
So you were about to tell me
how to unwind..

791
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:00,707
'...or perhaps you'd
like to show me?'

792
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:04,477
That's if you're up
for playing Virgil to my Dante.

793
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:08,448
Uh...well, um, nothing really
comes to mind, um..

794
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:11,618
I have a patient to see.

795
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:15,155
Well...if you think of a place,
I'd like to invite you.

796
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:18,358
I'm‐I'm involved with someone.

797
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,326
It's not a problem.
Bring her along.

798
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:25,566
Hey, man, we ever
getting out of this place?

799
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,634
Pretty quick. I think they're
about through with us.

800
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:29,269
How's that wrist?

801
00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:31,505
It's okay. The doctor called it
a "Colles' fracture."

802
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:32,639
It's not so bad.

803
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:33,840
Bill, uh, Jeanie's here

804
00:34:33,874 --> 00:34:36,276
because you've
got to be tested.

805
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:38,344
Well, tested for what?

806
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:43,584
I'm HIV positive.

807
00:34:43,617 --> 00:34:47,521
HIV? You're not talking
about having AIDS, right?

808
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:48,589
Yeah, I am.

809
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:54,427
Uh, when we landed together,
I was bleeding pretty bad.

810
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,396
I‐I'm‐I'm sure my blood
didn't get mixed

811
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,398
when you were scratched up,
but you should be tested

812
00:34:58,431 --> 00:34:59,733
just to be safe.

813
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:03,904
So I could get AIDS?

814
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:07,808
It's a very
remote possibility.

815
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:09,843
You got it?

816
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,550
Oh, man!

817
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,784
You're out there
working with us

818
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:19,686
and you got AIDS?

819
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,688
I gotta get by
like everybody else.

820
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:24,257
We know how to live with it, we
know how to take precautions‐‐

821
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,892
Except now maybe
I got infected.

822
00:35:25,926 --> 00:35:27,293
Jeanie will take
some blood.

823
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:28,595
That way we can
make sure you're okay‐‐

824
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,196
No!

825
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,698
Not her!
I want someone else.

826
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:33,567
Hey, come on, man.
We're talking about Jeanie‐‐

827
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,135
Not her!

828
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:39,472
I'll get a nurse.

829
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:56,256
Carol, hey!

830
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,558
I know what you're thinking
and you're wrong.

831
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:59,425
I'm busy.

832
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,694
I just got to follow
you around‐‐

833
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,495
Why follow me?
Why not follow her?

834
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,330
'If I didn't have to do
this secrecy tab‐‐'

835
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:06,567
I think this secrecy thing
works for you just fine.

836
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,268
‐ I didn't flirt with her.
‐ 'No, no!'

837
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:09,836
She asked you out for a drink

838
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,204
because she likes
the way you hold an ice pack.

839
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,338
I told her that
I was attached

840
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,374
I didn't say
who I was attached with.

841
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,376
Couldn't say that
Carol Hathaway was my‐‐

842
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:18,411
‐ Your what? I'm your what?
‐ Come here.

843
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:22,448
I wanna be with you
and I wanna be here with you

844
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:23,817
because I wanna be with you.

845
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,753
If you don't trust me,
then this doesn't work.

846
00:36:26,787 --> 00:36:28,989
I have a lot
of things to do.

847
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,557
I'll be at the el.

848
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:31,958
Dr. Greene?

849
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:35,495
I just got off
with the OR.

850
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:36,697
They clipped the base
of her aneurysm.

851
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,231
‐ Caught it in time?
‐ Yeah.

852
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:39,866
She stands a chance
at a full recovery.

853
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,367
Her husband's sitting in tears,
he wants to say thank you.

854
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,836
Uh, Carter, this was more
your case than mine.

855
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,838
Oh, come on!
You made the diagnosis.

856
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:46,607
Look, when credit
is offered, take it.

857
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,841
It doesn't happen often
around here.

858
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,276
‐ Taken.
‐ Mark!

859
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,712
‐ Laura Quentin's back.
‐ Who?

860
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:53,379
The bulimia patient.

861
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:54,948
I need your signature,
so medicine can come down

862
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:57,718
and admit her.
Is that a problem?

863
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:59,686
Because I didn't
admit her before?

864
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:05,025
It was a mistake. I should have
admitted her last time.

865
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,492
Well, last time,
she wasn't critical.

866
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:07,694
So, technically,
it wasn't.

867
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,462
Well, I didn't
go the extra mile.

868
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:11,632
No, it shouldn't depend on
doctors to go the extra mile.

869
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:13,734
We need a safety net.

870
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,736
We're an ER,
not a clinic.

871
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,437
‐ She's doing it.
‐ What?

872
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,873
Weaver's punching us out.
We are working for nothing.

873
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:22,543
'Yo, she can't do that.
I got another hour.'

874
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,411
Kerry?
Kerry.

875
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:26,647
This is a really
bad idea.

876
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,948
It's not a matter of choice.

877
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:29,482
I'm not singling out nurses.

878
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:30,884
All departments
have to cut back.

879
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,352
Well, who's gonna do
nurses' duties?

880
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:33,954
‐ The interns.
‐ The interns?

881
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,523
Come on, Carol, I see
people standing around

882
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:39,425
at the end of their shifts
talking, planning social events.

883
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:41,862
It can't go on. Nurses' time
isn't billed for.

884
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:43,630
They don't
generate income.

885
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:46,499
No. They just
generate care.

886
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:49,736
No, no, no. I just had
a change of plans.

887
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,739
D‐don't worry. There's a tux
rental place right by here.

888
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,474
Yeah, listen, instead
of that rubber chicken

889
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:56,710
you know, uh, why don't
we go to Stella Mare.

890
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:58,579
You know,
have a nice dinner?

891
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,514
We can be a little late.

892
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:02,683
Great!
Okay.

893
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:04,818
‐ Big night?
‐ Yeah, why not?

894
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:07,453
‐ Sounds great.
‐ Yeah, it is.

895
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,022
Sorry.

896
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:11,324
Ah, looking good.

897
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:12,993
Looking good.

898
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:14,828
Yeah, um...hey,
you just, uh...

899
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,597
there's one more spot
right there by the door

900
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,532
where the paint's
chipped off.

901
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:19,900
A couple
of finishing touches

902
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,434
and they're gonna
have it all cleaned up.

903
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,003
I've been checking
your employment file.

904
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:25,438
You've accrued 26 days
of vacation time.

905
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,340
Yeah, I've never‐never
taken a day off.

906
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:28,809
I'm thinking about
using it to go down

907
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:30,877
to the Gulf Coast of Alabama
after the first of the year.

908
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:33,980
Perhaps you should start
taking that time right now.

909
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:36,717
Now? It's like
a million degrees down there.

910
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,451
I've never
been to Mobile.

911
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:41,622
I understand there's some lovely
antebellum homes down there.

912
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:46,560
Did you ever find
that student of yours?

913
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:49,896
The lab said he went to the fish
hatchery for salmon sperm.

914
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,666
They got pretty
backed up in sutures.

915
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,967
You saying
that's my fault?

916
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,636
I'm saying that's
where I assigned you.

917
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,671
Will Dr. Del Amico
be doing sutures anytime soon?

918
00:38:57,704 --> 00:38:58,772
What?

919
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:00,106
I'm just wondering.

920
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,642
How long you're
gonna continue to give

921
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,076
Dr. Del Amico all
the interesting cases

922
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:05,746
while I get assigned
to suture Siberia?

923
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:07,080
What the hell are you
talking about?

924
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:09,449
I'm just asking if there
isn't something about

925
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:14,154
Dr. Del Amico that you find
especially...appealing?

926
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:15,421
Meaning?

927
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:17,958
Oh....you know
what I mean.

928
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:25,732
Oh! That's great!

929
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:27,133
That's great!

930
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:34,941
‐ What?
‐ Ask him.

931
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:37,578
By the way, Anna,
I‐I love your hair.

932
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:40,747
Thanks.

933
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:42,649
What's that about?

934
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:43,784
Nothing.

935
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:45,519
Oh, come on.
It's the end of the day.

936
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:48,188
‐ I could use a laugh, too.
‐ It wasn't that funny.

937
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:50,190
She has a weird
sense of humor.

938
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:53,126
Okay. So it's
a private joke.

939
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,662
Hey, congratulations
on that, uh..

940
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:57,764
...that stroke lady.
I heard it was a good save.

941
00:39:57,798 --> 00:39:59,900
Thanks. Thanks
for giving it to me.

942
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:02,503
Yeah, I was swamped.

943
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:03,804
I'd like to return the favor.

944
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:07,107
Don't. Please.
I hate feeling indebted.

945
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,175
Wait, you know what? There is
something that you could do.

946
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:10,811
‐ Sure.
‐ Uh..

947
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:12,445
Th‐this morning you said
something about the cellphone

948
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:13,780
being deductible,
you know, about taxes.

949
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:15,081
I'm getting
completely hammered.

950
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:16,717
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you could deduct

951
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,184
stethoscope, lab coat, books.

952
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:19,653
Otoscope?

953
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:22,623
Oh, yeah! Absolutely.
All equipment.

954
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:24,591
Why don't we have dinner?
We can talk about it.

955
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,192
Uh...tonight's
the laundromat.

956
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:28,094
Ah...me too!

957
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:29,563
Me too.

958
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,664
We could do
our laundry together.

959
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:31,865
I'll do your
tax planning.

960
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:32,899
You know,
laundry's deductible.

961
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,500
Really?

962
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,137
Okay. I'll, uh,
get us some sandwiches.

963
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:38,905
Great!

964
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:05,832
Doug.

965
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:10,537
I had prepared
a very elaborate argument.

966
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:11,905
Does this mean
I don't need it?

967
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:13,907
I already had
the argument...with myself.

968
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,909
I hope there wasn't
any name calling involved.

969
00:41:15,942 --> 00:41:17,944
No, it was very civil.
You won.

970
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,980
Oh, so I do better
when I'm not there.

971
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:21,782
This time, yeah.

972
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:26,820
‐ So you trust me?
‐ This time.

973
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:30,156
Hey.

974
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,058
Are you
keeping score?

975
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:35,095
‐ Yeah! You're ahead.
‐ I'm sorry, what?

976
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:39,299
"Talk on rotator cuff injuries
in track and field."

977
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,067
What exactly
does that mean?

978
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:43,103
You're the doctor.

979
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:44,571
You're supposed
to know that.

980
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:45,839
Yeah, well, I probably
did know that

981
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:48,709
before we drank this.

982
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:49,910
I have an idea.

983
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:52,212
Why don't we drink
another bottle

984
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:54,748
and then we can obliterate
all medical knowledge.

985
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:56,082
Sounds good.

986
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:04,725
What?

987
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:07,994
I missed you.

988
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,663
Oh, come on.

989
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:11,297
You never called.
You vanished.

990
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:14,601
I was a fool, okay?
I'll make it up to you.

991
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:15,602
Promise?

992
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:32,597
Won't work with dimes
and nickels.

993
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:33,741
You gotta use quarters.

994
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,484
You don't happen to have any
quarters on you, do you?

995
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:42,836
Cool.

996
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:54,380
You should let
your wife do this.

997
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:56,215
My wife?

998
00:42:56,249 --> 00:42:58,084
Oh, yeah! She's getting
some sandwiches for us.

999
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,252
Better she does it.

1000
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,320
You don't know
what you doing.

1001
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:03,990
What are you doing?
Sorry!

1002
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,224
‐ Wait‐‐
‐ I don't know.

1003
00:43:05,258 --> 00:43:08,561
This thing just,
like, broke on me.

1004
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:12,398
It can't take
this kind of load.

1005
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:14,400
I mean, you've ever
used a dryer before?

1006
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:16,335
Sure, yeah. I've used
a dryer before.

1007
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:17,971
It's just, the one in my
neighborhood handles

1008
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:19,973
loads like this.
Even bigger ones all the time.

1009
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:21,975
Wow!

1010
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:25,678
Okay.

1011
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:27,914
Alright,
we gotta get this.

1012
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:30,216
Um...uh, let me see.

1013
00:43:31,517 --> 00:43:33,219
Okay.

1014
00:43:33,252 --> 00:43:35,588
Wow!

1015
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:38,191
How about a hoagie?

1016
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,392
Here.

1017
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:43,562
Oh.

1018
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:48,101
Oh, no!

1019
00:43:48,134 --> 00:43:50,403
Eww!

1020
00:43:50,436 --> 00:43:51,938
Wow!

1021
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:54,908
It's gonna be a long night
in the laundromat.

1022
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,124
What's wrong?

1023
00:44:11,157 --> 00:44:14,393
Nothing.
I just, uh..

1024
00:44:14,427 --> 00:44:16,262
I just, uh..

1025
00:44:19,098 --> 00:44:21,034
I don't know.

1026
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,139
I...used
to turn you on.

1027
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,542
No, no, you..
you turn me on.

1028
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:31,144
I just..

1029
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:38,017
I guess I've just
been a lil'..

1030
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,352
...stressed out.

1031
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,721
Um...I'd rather
you didn't smoke in here.

1032
00:44:42,755 --> 00:44:45,291
