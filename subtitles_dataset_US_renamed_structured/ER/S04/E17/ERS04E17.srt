1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,508
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,543
You just choose not to!
Thank you!

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,545
Next month my hair
will grow back

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,113
and you'll still be sorry.

5
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,414
Just for that,
I get to pick the movie.

6
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,182
How long's it been
since you've had something

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,184
really juicy, Peter?

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,385
From this point on,
a pediatrician

9
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,354
'is consulted in
all peds cases.'

10
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:23,389
Carlos must have put
Reece into day care.

11
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,325
HemoAid in vascular procedures.
Have you heard of it?

12
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,628
‐ It's the artificial blood.
‐ Felt you might like in on it.

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,495
You don't mind if I step in
and take over a little bit?

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,097
Praise Allah, no!

15
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,533
Six OD's, three
in respiratory arrest.

16
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,267
‐ What is it?
‐ It's Chase.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,569
He has probable brain damage.

18
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:45,245
Alright. So give it up.
Where are we going?

19
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,613
Actually, we're right here.

20
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,648
‐ We are?
‐ Uh‐huh.

21
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,419
Rock climbing?
Are you serious?

22
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,188
Well, you said you
wanted to get into shape

23
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,690
for Yosemite
this summer, so..

24
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,359
This is the bomb.
Jeanie, you're the best.

25
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,563
This place is packed.

26
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,665
Listen, I wanna talk
to you about this.

27
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:08,468
‐ Doug, a couple of chairs.
‐ Okay. Alright. Okay.

28
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,303
Hey, what happened to Carter?

29
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,638
'I don't know.
I found him that way.'

30
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,239
Yeah, he's really
filling out, isn't he?

31
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,608
Yeah, seventy‐fifth percentile

32
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,342
for full‐term his age.

33
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,544
Looks like you've
really gotten a handle

34
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,312
on this parenting routine.

35
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,581
You know what? It's easy.

36
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,517
I just make a schedule
and stick to it.

37
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,220
As a matter of fact, that's our
15 minutes of quality time.

38
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,322
Daycare for you
and a fem‐pop for me.

39
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,893
Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?

40
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,394
Are you ready?

41
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,429
Oh.

42
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,467
And a quick pit
stop at the showers.

43
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:45,138
Yeah, right. Oh, man.
Go ahead and laugh.

44
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,307
Alright, come on. Come here.

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,375
You got daddy. You got me.

46
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,513
You got me. Alright, say bye.
I'll see you guys later.

47
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,347
‐ 'Bye.'
‐ 'Bye.'

48
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,619
Peter Benton the father.
You gotta see it to believe it.

49
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,221
Alright. Now, w‐w‐what
I've been thinking about‐‐

50
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,557
Carter? Carter! Carter!

51
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,225
‐ What?
‐ Your pager.

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,461
Oh, man.

53
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:11,364
It's the ER, of course.

54
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,233
I knew we wouldn't get
a chance to sit down.

55
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,635
Well, listen, if you still
wanna talk maybe we can catch

56
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,770
the Bulls‐Cavalier game
tonight at McGee's.

57
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,672
We haven't been out on
the town together in a while.

58
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:22,175
‐ Sure. Alright. Maybe.
‐ You can check with Carol.

59
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,744
I don't have to
ask her permission.

60
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,548
Oh, man!

61
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,250
‐ I tried to swerve around him.
‐ Please don't let him die.

62
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,518
Get me 8 units of HemoAid.

63
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,286
‐ Hemo‐what?
‐ Blood substitute.

64
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,556
‐ Grab consent forms.
‐ Where the hell is everyone?

65
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,658
‐ I've paged them all, twice.
‐ What's the situation?

66
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,725
Seventeen‐year‐old complaining
of neck pain

67
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,460
contusions and abrasions.

68
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,428
‐ Get this off of me.
‐ Try taking slow breaths.

69
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,797
‐ Check the next one.
‐ Yeah.

70
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,666
‐ What do we got?
‐ 20‐year‐old passenger.

71
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,400
No seat belt,
complaining of neck

72
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,435
left shoulder, chest
and abdominal pain.

73
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,437
'Questionable LOC
for several seconds.'

74
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,373
Up and over.

75
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,408
Check her vitals.
See if she's hypovolemic.

76
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,744
Need a cross‐table C‐spine,
chest and pelvis x‐rays

77
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,412
CBC, and dip a urine.

78
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,281
Was the transportation
time under half an hour?

79
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,550
Must've been. Accident
happened at Jackson and Loomis.

80
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,752
‐ Lungs are clear.
‐ I got the HemoAid.

81
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,555
‐ What's her name?
‐ Ann Witchger.

82
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,257
Ms. Witchger, I'm conducting
a potentially lifesaving

83
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,693
research project here in the ER.

84
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,261
Tell me, do you object
to the use of blood products?

85
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,630
Have they been
tested on animals?

86
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,698
Bowel sounds present.

87
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,732
Yes. I believe they have.

88
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,001
No. No animal testing.

89
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,637
‐ Pulse 100. Resps 20.
‐ BP's normal.

90
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,806
Where the hell's all
this blood coming from?

91
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,777
'Cow's blood?'

92
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,713
We got it from
a slaughterhouse.

93
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,415
‐ This is all cow's blood?
‐ I told you it was a bad idea.

94
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,750
We were on our way to protest

95
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,653
the university's use of
cats in their research labs.

96
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,588
We thought buckets of blood
would make an impression.

97
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,856
Mmm, it did.

98
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,390
Did you hear what these
girls were transporting?

99
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,392
‐ We just heard.
‐ What do you got?

100
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,494
One squirrel, DOA.

101
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,721
Oh.

102
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,456
Reminds me of "Carrie."
The movie, not the attending.

103
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,358
You're funny.

104
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,827
Speaking of movies,
can we go to the 7 o'clock?

105
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,395
I don't think I'm gonna
make it to the 9:20.

106
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,530
I thought we were
going tomorrow night.

107
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,731
I thought we
said tonight. Why?

108
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,765
Uh, well, no,
I just told Mark

109
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,833
that we'd watch
the Bulls game.

110
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,367
Oh, well,
it's a good time

111
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,503
for you to tell
him your decision.

112
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,970
We can, we can watch
the game anytime.

113
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,772
You know what? I think
you should see Mark.

114
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,775
Hey, Doug. I just got
a call from Neal Bernstein.

115
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,744
He said your ER
fellowship‐renewal

116
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,945
papers were
due two days ago.

117
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,714
‐ They were.
‐ You can't just blow this off.

118
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,481
If you want your fellowship
to continue‐‐

119
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,418
Kerry, maybe I don't want
my fellowship to continue.

120
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,521
Got a kid in Exam 4
with a pencil up his nose.

121
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,956
‐ We need to discuss this.
‐ Alright. We will.

122
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,561
‐ Hail, comrades!
‐ David!

123
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,796
We weren't expecting you
back until next month.

124
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,832
Well, I missed you
too damn much.

125
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,701
Look at this place. Looks just
exactly the way I remember it.

126
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,770
Well, actually, we have
made a few improvements.

127
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,772
Yeah, I saw you eyeing those.
Help yourself, Jerry.

128
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,841
I made those with my
very own two hands.

129
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,509
‐ It is Jerry, isn't it?
‐ Yeah, yeah.

130
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,444
Hey, David. You've
been gone a while.

131
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,913
One hundred and ninety
seven days. Give me a hug.

132
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,716
You're looking
trim there, Mark.

133
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,051
Thanks, you look
pretty good yourself.

134
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,554
You know, it‐it sounds hackneyed

135
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,955
but that
myocardial infarction

136
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,823
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

137
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,560
Well, you know, I had intended
to prepare a summary report

138
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,794
to bring you up to speed.

139
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,462
No, no, no, no, Kerry.
We'll talk shop later.

140
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,030
I'm here to spend some
time in the trenches.

141
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,632
To get back in
touch with the people

142
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,933
that make this place tick.

143
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,569
Mark, what you got?

144
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,036
Thirty two‐year‐old female

145
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,772
high fever for five days.

146
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,640
You know, one of
the things I learned

147
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,008
from my brush
with mortality

148
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,443
is that every
patient has a story.

149
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,445
Let's go learn
hers, shall we?

150
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,584
Clamp distally,
then check for leaks

151
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,819
at the proximal anastomosis.

152
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,821
Is that you, Peter?

153
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,591
Elizabeth? What
are you doing here?

154
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,693
I just wanted to confirm
our plans for this evening

155
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,695
to work on
Rocket's lit review.

156
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,698
Uh, seven to nine thirty,
Biomed Library.

157
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,566
'Yeah, yeah.
I'll meet you there.'

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,603
How about nine thirty one
we grab a bite to eat?

159
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,470
Look, Elizabeth, I have to,
uh, prep for an operation.

160
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,839
So if you don't mind,
could you, uh..

161
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,908
We could work at my place
and get some takeout.

162
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,776
Look, I know you've been
wanting to see me naked.

163
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,478
But this isn't
the way, okay?

164
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,581
Ah. Ah. Thank you.
Thank you.

165
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,682
So, what's your answer?

166
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,518
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Dinner. Fine, fine.

167
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:01,722
Um, but I've gotta
prep for a, uh..

168
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,625
...pancreatic pseudocyst
so I'm not gonna be able to..

169
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,099
‐ Please, someone help me!
‐ We need a gurney over here!

170
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,635
‐ What happened?
‐ My wife is pregnant.

171
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,969
‐ She passed out.
‐ Okay. Easy.

172
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,604
‐ It's okay.
‐ Come on over here.

173
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,907
‐ Jerry, what's open?
‐ Curtain Area 3.

174
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,909
‐ How far along is she?
‐ Karen's 18 weeks.

175
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,011
But she's been having
a really rough time.

176
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,647
Karen, I'm Dr. Del Amico.

177
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,981
We're gonna do some
tests on you, okay?

178
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,016
Ready? One, two, three.

179
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,718
Please don't‐don't hurt my baby.

180
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,521
We're not gonna do anything
to your baby, don't worry.

181
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,823
Open up.

182
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,626
Uh, dry skin and mucous
membranes. She's dehydrated.

183
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,628
'Start a line and bolus
liter of saline.'

184
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:45,632
‐ BP's 120 palp.
‐ Get a CBC, Chem‐7, and a UA.

185
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,901
‐ She's got no veins.
‐ I'll do an IJ line.

186
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,803
You're gonna be okay now.

187
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,109
That's alright, Karen.

188
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,713
Okay, now, just grab that
left handhold and you're there.

189
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,981
Alright.

190
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,116
‐ Alright!
‐ Ready to lower.

191
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,818
Lowering.

192
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,756
Okay.

193
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,858
Did you really
only take two lessons?

194
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,561
Yeah, my instructor said that
women are more natural climbers.

195
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,929
It's all in
the hips or something.

196
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,931
That's great.

197
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,866
I think after that climb
you deserve a pop.

198
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,002
What are you,
chickening out on me?

199
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,937
No. I'm not chickening.

200
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,740
I just thought you
might be thirsty.

201
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,775
Nice try, pal. Your turn.

202
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,653
Good job, Scott.
You're making it look easy.

203
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,958
‐ I can't.
‐ You're doing great.

204
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,727
Let me down.

205
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,861
'There's a foothold right
by your left foot there.'

206
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,696
Let me down. I wanna come down.

207
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,698
Okay. Lowering.

208
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,102
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have pushed so hard.

209
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,104
Did you hurt yourself?

210
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,607
We'll just take
a break, okay?

211
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,047
McGee's has those devil wings.

212
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,784
Come on. Hog Head McDunna's
$1.99 all‐you‐can‐eat taco bar

213
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,853
and live music
after the game?

214
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,955
Jerry, can you see that
these protocol summaries

215
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,623
make it into everyone's box?

216
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,692
For you, Dr. Corday,
it would be a pleasure.

217
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,860
‐ 'Elizabeth?'
‐ Yeah?

218
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,628
I was just looking
over your study

219
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:25,666
and I noticed that I'm listed
as the only faculty advisor.

220
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,168
Yes. Thanks for helping me
bring HemoAid to the ER.

221
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,737
I assumed that
Dr. Romano was involved.

222
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,172
Uh, he wanted to
stay more focused

223
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,975
on the surgical applications
of substitute blood.

224
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,044
I'm surprised that he let
you go ahead on your own.

225
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,113
Truth is, he
doesn't know yet.

226
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,783
Hmm. Trying to break free?

227
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,752
It's more like
branching out.

228
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:46,887
Do you mind being
the only advisor?

229
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,121
Not at all.

230
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,824
As far as I'm concerned,
the study's all yours.

231
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,893
Good.

232
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,795
She lost almost
six pounds last week.

233
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,097
BP's 100/60.

234
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,665
‐ I wanna go home.
‐ Please, honey.

235
00:09:58,699 --> 00:09:59,900
Let them help you.

236
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,935
Her OB's had her on
a saltine cracker diet.

237
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,904
How is anyone supposed
to survive on that?

238
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,672
I cannot lose this baby.

239
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,008
'She's already had
three miscarriages.'

240
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,677
‐ Karen?
‐ She's out. Trendelenburg.

241
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,918
‐ Oh, I'm okay. I'm okay.
‐ It's okay.

242
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,821
Uh, let's add multivites
and put her on a monitor.

243
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,989
‐ Wait. It's‐it's alright.
‐ Why is this happening?

244
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,290
She should be past
morning sickness.

245
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,992
In some women,
nausea and vomiting

246
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,694
persist throughout
their pregnancy.

247
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,730
Nine months of this?
She'll never make it.

248
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,065
Once her labs come back, we'll
find out what options we have.

249
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,034
I want you to do whatever
it takes to save her.

250
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,268
I understand.

251
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,204
Rock climbing?

252
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,774
Were you planning to
outshine me this summer?

253
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,876
‐ I paged Doug Ross.
‐ Good.

254
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,178
Listen, I was just about
to start a splenorenal shunt.

255
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,948
But, uh, I can get
somebody to cover for me.

256
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,216
I don't think that's necessary.
Scott just overdid it.

257
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,054
It's cool, dad. Jeanie
will keep me company.

258
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,223
Alright. But you'll page me just
as soon as Doug's looked at him?

259
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,859
Don't worry. I will.

260
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,093
I plan on kicking
some serious butt

261
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,895
at the Investigators' quarterly.

262
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,196
Dayton Memorial
can't come close

263
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,865
to my HemoAid
transfusion rates.

264
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,232
Congratulations.

265
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,768
I'm releasing distally.

266
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,135
'Looks dry.'

267
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,971
Hope you don't feel
slighted that I'm involving

268
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,372
Lizzie in the study
instead of you.

269
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,808
No. Of course not.

270
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,076
Peter, I never noticed
what a good liar you are.

271
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,778
What are the branches
of the popliteal?

272
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,180
Anterior tibial, posterior
tibial and peroneal.

273
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,116
You're the man!
Now comes the fun part.

274
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,887
Release proximally
and we'll watch the river run.

275
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,855
Dr. Benton, the daycare
center's on the phone.

276
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,324
‐ Is it urgent?
‐ 'They want you to come up.'

277
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,393
Okay, uh, ask them,
uh, tell them‐‐

278
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,128
Tell them he's on his way.
I'll finish up here.

279
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,097
Priorities, Peter.

280
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,399
Someone paged me.

281
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,802
Dr. Corday, Dr. Morgenstern.

282
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,337
Multiple GSWs to
the chest and abdomen.

283
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,106
Storeowner in his late 70s.

284
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,008
Shot with
a small‐caliber firearm.

285
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,045
BP, 70 palp. Pulse ox
falling, 92 on 15 liters.

286
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,413
His name's Won Sok Jang.

287
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,148
‐ 'Transport time?'
‐ 20 minutes.

288
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,883
Any relatives with him,
anyone to give consent?

289
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,318
‐ No.
‐ Ten blade.

290
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,154
He's a perfect candidate.
Get me four units HemoAid.

291
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,190
‐ He's getting cyanotic.
‐ Muffled heart sounds.

292
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,360
Neck vein distension.
Probable pericardial tamponade.

293
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,895
‐ Shall I?
‐ I've got it.

294
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,330
Pericardiocentesis tray.

295
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,133
Stick an alligator clamp
on that V‐1 lead.

296
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,201
BP's down to 40 palp.

297
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,173
Worked hard his
whole life for this.

298
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,009
‐ Pulse ox, 88.
‐ 'He's bradying down.'

299
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,183
David?

300
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,086
‐ Rate's 30.
‐ David?

301
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,094
I'm losing a pulse.

302
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,968
Uh, sorry. I‐I‐I've
got something in my eye.

303
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,169
Could you?

304
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,377
Got it.

305
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,281
Who the hell was that?

306
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,950
Our chief of
Emergency Medicine.

307
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,126
Hey, nurse, uh, I was called
down for a rule‐out appy.

308
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,596
‐ Dr. Carter is in Exam 3.
‐ What are you doing with those?

309
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,564
Taking them to Dr. Corday.

310
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,539
‐ Lizzie, what are you doing?
‐ Dr. Romano..

311
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,340
I didn't authorize the use
of HemoAid in the ER.

312
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,010
Uh, I've been trying to tell you
I moved ahead with an ER study.

313
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,311
‐ 'He's got a rhythm.'
‐ 'Faint pulse.'

314
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,979
And who said you could do that?

315
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,881
Dr. Greene signed on
as my faculty advisor.

316
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:38,351
‐ 'Dopamine, titrate‐‐'
‐ I see.

317
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,554
‐ I'd like to explain.
‐ Let's repeat a crit.

318
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,556
Well, I haven't moved my office.

319
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,262
I feel a lot better now.

320
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,165
That's because we
rehydrated you.

321
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,135
But with hyperemesis gravidarum,
the vomiting could continue

322
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,171
throughout your pregnancy
or even get worse.

323
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,907
I‐I can handle it.

324
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,943
Well, your labs
indicate that your

325
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,111
kidneys aren't
functioning properly.

326
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,312
And you have a low
potassium level

327
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,381
which could cause
cardiac arrhythmia.

328
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,952
I don't know what
Dave said to you

329
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,955
but I'm not giving
up this baby.

330
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,123
I'm not suggesting that.

331
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:21,161
But there are drugs available
which could reduce the vomiting.

332
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,230
But my OB said that drugs
could put my baby at risk.

333
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,968
There is that possibility.

334
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,004
But endangering your health
also puts your baby at risk.

335
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,142
I'm sure you'll
make a great mother.

336
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,311
But physically, you just
might not be able to be one

337
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,346
without some
medical intervention.

338
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,217
Would you take the drugs?

339
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,986
Yes, I would.

340
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,156
I can't.

341
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,392
Think about it.

342
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:56,897
If your condition worsens,
uh, your life could be at risk.

343
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,370
Hey, Doug, you ever been
to Hog Head McDunna's?

344
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,972
Great taco bar,
listen, I'm gonna have to

345
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,708
take a rain check on tonight.

346
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,475
Listen, Carol
can come along..

347
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,945
Hey, Dr. Ross, Anspaugh
wants you on the phone.

348
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,413
Oh, okay. Listen, I still
need to talk to you though.

349
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,219
We'll need a record of his
vitals after every bag was hung.

350
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,688
‐ You got it.
‐ Dr. Corday.

351
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,456
Uh, this is Lindsey Jang.

352
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,358
He is, um, your patient's son.

353
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,727
Uh, Mr. Jang, I'm sorry.

354
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,662
I wasn't aware any
relatives had arrived.

355
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,130
How's my father?

356
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,665
Well, he's being
taken to surgery.

357
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,300
His heart stopped, but we
were able to resuscitate him.

358
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,402
Did it stop because you
gave him fake blood?

359
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,740
No.

360
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,408
In fact, he
responded quite well.

361
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,244
One of the benefits
of HemoAid is that

362
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,247
it can transport oxygen to areas
where blood or saline can't‐‐

363
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,682
Who gave you
permission to do that?

364
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:49,716
I've got a consult.
Would you excuse me?

365
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,018
Good luck, Mr. Jang. Lizzie.

366
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,391
Mr. Jang, yes, we did use
an experimental product

367
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,227
on your father, but it
was intended to help him.

368
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,328
Here's some literature

369
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,130
explaining the protocol
being used.

370
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,266
He should've
gotten real blood.

371
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,736
‐ He did. If you'd just read‐‐
‐ I don't care about your study!

372
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,706
If he dies, I'm
holding you responsible.

373
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:22,082
‐ Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
‐ A little better.

374
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,117
Uh, listen, can I talk to you
outside just for a second?

375
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,285
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm‐hmm. Okay.

376
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,520
I wanna hear.

377
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,390
‐ Uh..
‐ Okay.

378
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,292
Okay. Alright.

379
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,095
Uh, your labs indicate
that you're pancytopenic.

380
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,130
'It means you have very
low blood cell counts.'

381
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,164
'Well, how low?'

382
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,165
We're gonna tap the bone marrow

383
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,433
see if it's producing cells.

384
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,235
Also, you'll have
to get transfusions

385
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,037
'and we're gonna have to
put you in an isolation room.'

386
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,438
Okay, you know, Doug,
maybe we should talk outside.

387
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,472
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Alright?

388
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,775
Yeah. We'll be back.

389
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,213
A bone‐marrow biopsy?
He could have the flu.

390
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,281
Flu wouldn't lower his
white cell count as much.

391
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,783
Well, his counts probably
haven't come back much

392
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,451
because of the chemo.
It's only been a few weeks‐‐

393
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,153
Jeanie, he needs the biopsy.

394
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,522
Well, I've seen
Scott at his worst.

395
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,189
You know, I'm sure
Dr. Anspaugh would agree‐‐

396
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,291
Dr. Anspaugh,
I already talked to.

397
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,294
And he said to move forward.

398
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,331
Okay. I'll, uh, I'll set
up Exam 4 for isolation.

399
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,332
‐ Alright.
‐ Okay.

400
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,200
Uh, about Scott's pain..

401
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,502
I'll take care of it.

402
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,172
Natalie Logan.

403
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,473
Off with one hat,
on with the other.

404
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,342
Hey, Yosh. Can you cover
me at the clinic tomorrow?

405
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,810
‐ Sure. Count me in.
‐ Great.

406
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:25,078
Nurse Hathaway.

407
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,312
‐ Hi, Natalie.
‐ Hi.

408
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,614
Does your dad wanna
come back for this?

409
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,816
‐ Oh, no, it's okay.
‐ It's not a problem.

410
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,852
Mark, have you seen
David Morgenstern?

411
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,486
No. And I'd rather not.

412
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,388
He just spent an hour with
my puncture wound patient

413
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,191
talking to her about her
collection of antique creamers.

414
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,460
He might have come back
to work a little early.

415
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,128
Oh, we need to discuss this

416
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,264
Doug Ross situation
at some point.

417
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,298
What situation?

418
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,432
Well, it sounds like he's not

419
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,101
coming back next year.

420
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,105
Does your father know
you're here for birth control?

421
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,440
Um, not exactly.

422
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,376
You won't tell him,
will you?

423
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,144
Not if you don't want me to.

424
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,312
How have your periods been

425
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,381
since your last
progesterone injection?

426
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,517
Light.

427
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,188
Any pain, leg cramps,
visual changes, weight gain?

428
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,391
Are you using condoms to prevent
sexually transmitted disease?

429
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,660
Sometimes my
boyfriend forgets.

430
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,596
It's your responsibility too.

431
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,898
‐ Yeah, I know.
‐ Alright.

432
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,866
Here's your
follow‐up reminder.

433
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,536
Have you come back
in three months.

434
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,405
And here are some
condoms. Use them.

435
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,340
I will. Thank you.

436
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,676
‐ Okay. Bye.
‐ 'Bye.'

437
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,846
John? You never returned
my call last night.

438
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,315
Sorry. I need to get
a new answering machine.

439
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,584
You also need sleep.
You look like the walking dead.

440
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,186
It's insomnia. I get it
every once in a while.

441
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,355
Yeah? Try this
for a quick fix.

442
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,590
‐ Doctor.
‐ Huh?

443
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,159
Just wanted to say
thanks for nothing.

444
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,162
I'm sorry, Mr. Fearn.
But your wife's not ready to‐‐

445
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,496
Save it for
your priest, okay?

446
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,165
You know what,
the minute I saw your name

447
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,433
I should've asked
for someone else.

448
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,368
‐ My name?
‐ You're Catholic, right?

449
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,603
What does that have
to do with anything?

450
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,171
Do you get extra
points for putting

451
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,339
a baby's life
ahead of my wife's?

452
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,574
‐ Is that how it works?
‐ Excuse me, uh‐‐

453
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:04,210
No, no, no. I‐I, I am Catholic.

454
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,446
And I'm Italian.
A‐and I'm a woman.

455
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,481
And I'm from South Philly.
And I'm a doctor.

456
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,283
And I have done
everything in my power

457
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,318
to help your wife
and your child.

458
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,486
Dave.

459
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,257
Listen, be patient.

460
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,192
Let her make her decision.

461
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,204
Hey, what's this I hear about
you not coming back next year?

462
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,239
‐ Leave it to Weaver.
‐ So it's true?

463
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,475
I've been trying to tell you.
I'm not renewing my fellowship.

464
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,911
'Cause I'm applying for
an attending position.

465
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,380
‐ Yeah.
‐ I can't be a fellow forever.

466
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,383
I don't know. You were on
your way to convincing me.

467
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,351
The only problem is
County General doesn't have

468
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,353
a Pedes ER Attending position.

469
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,655
Maybe it should.

470
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,356
A third of the cases
that come in here

471
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,992
one‐third of them are pediatric

472
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,226
but there's nobody
overseeing it.

473
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,327
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

474
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,596
So, a Pediatric Attending

475
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:56,997
would increase the care, right?

476
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,364
‐ So you're serious?
‐ Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

477
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,566
Doug, we're ready
for that biopsy.

478
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,334
Yeah, okay.
You back me up.

479
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,671
‐ Hey, Mark.
‐ Elizabeth.

480
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,007
I hear you got your
first HemoAid candidate.

481
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,409
Yeah. And lost him again.
No thanks to Dr. Romano.

482
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,012
‐ What'd he do?
‐ That's not important.

483
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,680
What can I say,
he's a jerk.

484
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:16,517
Actually, that
was perfectly put.

485
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,018
Don't let him get to you.

486
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,986
And if you need a backup,
give me a holler.

487
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,987
'Thanks.'

488
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,426
‐ Peter, what's wrong?
‐ Ah...Reece has a fever.

489
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,493
I've gotta get him
over to Carla's

490
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:28,729
and my damn car won't start.

491
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,664
Plus I've got
an ileectomy scheduled.

492
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,365
Well, I could take him.
My car's here.

493
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,535
Uh, you know, uh..

494
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,036
...I don't think that
would be a good idea.

495
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,271
‐ Come on, Reece.
‐ I'm a good driver, Peter.

496
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,774
Yeah, I know. I, I just
think it'd be awkward.

497
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,777
Well, fine. You drive and I'll
keep this little one company.

498
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,347
‐ Hello, sweetheart.
‐ Well, we could, uh..

499
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,415
Alright, we could just make it.
Uh, go get your coat.

500
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,584
Okay.

501
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:56,990
‐ Are you looking for a student?
‐ Uh, no. I see him. Thank you.

502
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,498
‐ Bull's‐eye.
‐ Kerry.

503
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,669
It's not wise
to sneak up on a man

504
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,837
when he's got
a needle in his hand.

505
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:13,607
I wanted to check on your eye.

506
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,309
Uh, much better, thank you.
Saline did the trick.

507
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,681
And after six months,
I figured it couldn't

508
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,448
hurt to brush up
on my anatomy.

509
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:26,419
Well, everyone can benefit
from that on occasion.

510
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,623
Do you ever think about
patients when you work on them?

511
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,492
You know, their, their
hopes, their dreams?

512
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,829
Honestly...no.

513
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,433
I never did.

514
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,603
But today, in that trauma
room all I could think about

515
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,070
was that old
grocer's life

516
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:46,707
and how he was
relying on me.

517
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,546
I don't know if you
heard, but...last month

518
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:56,617
I suffered a grand mal seizure
during a hazmat incident‐‐

519
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,085
‐ Then you know.
‐ Know what?

520
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,589
About perspective, about..

521
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:04,357
...looking at the big picture.

522
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,459
I know that
the big picture can be humbling

523
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,095
maybe even
destructive to one's focus

524
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:11,565
and‐and sense of confidence.

525
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,668
Nonsense.

526
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,772
Kerry Weaver,
meet John DeLeo.

527
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,741
Welder, father of five.

528
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:22,843
Never retired despite
crippling arthritis

529
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:26,613
outlived three of his kids,
never left Chicago.

530
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:29,516
You know all that
about this cadaver?

531
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,617
No. I made it up.

532
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:35,822
But if I did know, it wouldn't
make me less focused.

533
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,825
It would make me
a better doctor.

534
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,931
You're almost there.

535
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:47,801
‐ 'Crux of the climb.'
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'

536
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,136
'Just a few hundred feet to go.'

537
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,805
Your fingers search
across the blank rock

538
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,674
till you find
the perfect handhold.

539
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,841
You feel it?

540
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,143
I've got it.

541
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,547
Okay, Scott.

542
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,849
'I'm gonna put the needle
in now, buddy. Okay?'

543
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,819
Okay.

544
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,555
All you gotta do is
just hold on and breathe.

545
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:11,825
You're almost there.
You're almost to the top.

546
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:16,830
Okay, I got you.
It's okay, Scott. Hang on.

547
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,133
Hold on. Okay.

548
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,871
After the E light comes on

549
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,508
I have almost an entire day's
worth of petrol left.

550
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,142
Look, I'm not gonna
risk running out of gas

551
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,512
in the middle of Garfield Park.

552
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,746
For your sake, Reece,
I hope you don't

553
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,815
'inherit your father's
stubbornness.'

554
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,521
When we get
to Carla's restaurant

555
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:41,922
I'm gonna have to
double‐park and run in.

556
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:45,592
So you don't mind
waiting out in the car, do you?

557
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:47,761
Are you still
in love with her? Carla?

558
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,696
What are you talking about?
It was never love.

559
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,766
But you're worried about
her seeing us together.

560
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,736
‐ I'm not worried.
‐ Is it because I'm white?

561
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,538
Excuse me?

562
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:00,707
Well, we spend time together,
there's a chemistry

563
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,544
but there's an obstacle,
is it a racial problem?

564
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,912
Elizabeth, I don't even know
how to respond to that. I mean..

565
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,615
Damn!

566
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,951
‐ Are you okay? Reece?
‐ Yeah, we're fine.

567
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:11,985
Damn it!

568
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,857
Oh, my God!
Okay, okay, okay. Here we go.

569
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,626
Elizabeth, call 911!

570
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,695
Hold on. Hold on. Here we go.

571
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,669
‐ What do you got?
‐ Auto versus pedestrian.

572
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:29,770
‐ BP's okay.
‐ Dr. Corday?

573
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,538
130/85.

574
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:34,040
Yes, we got involved, um,
in a bit of an accident.

575
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:35,776
‐ We're here, Miss Ingram.
‐ Finally.

576
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,043
‐ Are you okay?
‐ Yes.

577
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:38,645
Dr. Benton was
involved as well.

578
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:39,846
Involved? He ran into me.

579
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,848
‐ Reece was with him.
‐ I got it.

580
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,817
'I was on my lunch break.
I need to call my boss.'

581
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,586
‐ Peter, you okay?
‐ Yeah.

582
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,921
‐ Let me get it.
‐ No. I got it. Come on.

583
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:54,528
Pulse is 160. Resps 32.

584
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:55,562
He was crying
right after it happened.

585
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:56,997
Now he's become somnolent.

586
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,965
‐ What happened, Peter?
‐ I backed into a pedestrian.

587
00:24:58,999 --> 00:24:59,966
Reece was in the back seat.
I think he's okay.

588
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,702
He was in his car seat.

589
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:03,103
‐ Alright. We'll check him out.
‐ Okay, okay, okay.

590
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:05,038
‐ Anna, can you take a look?
‐ Of course.

591
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:06,673
Hey, how's the pedestrian?

592
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,675
Don't worry.
She's in good hands.

593
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,844
‐ He feels warm.
‐ Yeah, he had a fever earlier.

594
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,713
‐ Hey, little fellow.
‐ No, no, no.

595
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:15,115
Let's get a CT of his head,
neck and abdomen first.

596
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:17,117
Peter, will you let me
look at that head lac?

597
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,885
We'll let Anna
check out Reece.

598
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,587
‐ No, it's okay. I'm fine.
‐ 'Peter, go with him.'

599
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,055
‐ 'It's okay.'
‐ It's fine.

600
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,560
Okay, let's get a CBC,
type and cross for four.

601
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,094
Let's get a chest and a pelvis.

602
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:30,597
‐ Dip a urine for blood.
‐ I have to get to work.

603
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:31,998
Someone's calling
your boss for you.

604
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,000
Harbilas and Kleiderman
Law Offices.

605
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,903
‐ Yeah. We got it.
‐ How is she?

606
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:39,305
Superficial lacs, multiple
contusions and abrasions.

607
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,874
Pulse ox, 99.

608
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,109
I checked her in the ambulance.
Her abdomen's benign.

609
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,612
‐ Okay. Now, does this hurt?
‐ Yes!

610
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:46,980
You were more worried
about your sick kid

611
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,615
than looking
where you were going.

612
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:50,016
I tried to explain
to her that you were‐‐

613
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,351
Peritoneal lavage tray.

614
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,019
I don't think
that's necessary.

615
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,622
Peter, Peter, you really
shouldn't be in here. Come on.

616
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:56,657
Has the trauma team
been paged?

617
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,891
Peter.

618
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,993
‐ Come on!
‐ Do it.

619
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,163
I should go check on Reece.

620
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:06,066
Anna's taking care
of him. Sit down.

621
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:09,670
‐ Did you lose consciousness?
‐ No. No. I was barely moving.

622
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:12,606
Well, it doesn't need sutures.

623
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,041
I never even saw her. She must
have been in my blind spot.

624
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,011
Well, don't beat yourself up.
It was an accident.

625
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:21,181
‐ Damn it! I'm missing surgery.
‐ Hey, Peter. Reece is fine.

626
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,049
‐ Did you get a CT?
‐ 'It's not necessary.'

627
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,051
Normal fundi.
He's alert and interactive.

628
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,820
Malik's giving him a bottle.

629
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,054
‐ Uh, thanks, Anna.
‐ 'Sure.'

630
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,790
Stay still.

631
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:31,692
‐ Damn it! Romano.
‐ 'Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.'

632
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:33,960
Stay still.

633
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:36,096
Okay.

634
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,664
Dr. Romano!

635
00:26:37,698 --> 00:26:38,899
Peter, where the hell
have you been?

636
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,200
Brin's been screaming
bloody murder.

637
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,035
Yeah, I was in a car accident.
I hit a pedestrian.

638
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,070
What were you doing out on
the town when you had surgery?

639
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,772
Dr. Romano,
I'm afraid Peter may have

640
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:46,973
brought you down here
for nothing.

641
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,642
Surgical consults
for your victim?

642
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:49,943
Uh, yes.

643
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,912
Let's see what kind of
damage you've wrought.

644
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,714
Elizabeth, what did you
tell that woman about me?

645
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:54,948
We were in
the ambulance together

646
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,650
she wanted to know
what happened.

647
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,051
She works for a damn lawyer.

648
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,020
Dr. Benton, these two
would like to question you

649
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,121
about the accident.

650
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:02,623
Oh..

651
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,826
‐ Hi, Jeanie.
‐ Hello.

652
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,828
Doug told me about
Dr. Anspaugh's son.

653
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,730
‐ 'How's he doing?'
‐ He's holding up.

654
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:11,732
'I wanted to tell you
I opened up the clinic'

655
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:14,701
so the staff can get tested
as possible marrow donors.

656
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:16,102
Jerry's e‐mailed
the other floors

657
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,704
and Anna's making up flyers.

658
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,039
It's a nice gesture,
Carol, but‐‐

659
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,406
I know it's gonna be
hard to find a match

660
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,042
but people wanna
do something.

661
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,777
Well, I appreciate it.
It's just a little premature.

662
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,779
I mean, his biopsy results
aren't even back yet.

663
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,749
Let's just give the kid
a chance, you know.

664
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:34,220
The pump is computerized,
so it's gonna release

665
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:36,256
the exact amount
of pain medication

666
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,824
whenever you push the button.

667
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,860
So you're calling
the shots, alright?

668
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:41,995
Can I OD if I press
this thing too much?

669
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,831
It's programmed to lock out
so that won't happen.

670
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,733
‐ Doug.
‐ Yeah.

671
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:48,034
Alright. Be back.

672
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:52,072
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

673
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:53,273
Donald Anspaugh called.

674
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:55,141
He's concerned about
putting Scott on PCA.

675
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,710
He called you?

676
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,011
He wanted to know
what the ER's policy was.

677
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,046
I told him we didn't have one
because I was unaware

678
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,048
that you were
using PCA on kids.

679
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:04,084
‐ Well, I am.
‐ You should've told me.

680
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:05,752
I didn't know that I had to
ask your permission.

681
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,988
‐ Keep me informed.
‐ Would you have told me not to?

682
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,756
Doug, I'm not asking you
to answer to me.

683
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,991
‐ Just speak up.
‐ Okay.

684
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,859
This is why we need
a pedes attending.

685
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:15,796
I'll talk to Anspaugh myself,
if that's okay with you?

686
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,942
So, what'd Romano
say about her belly?

687
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:30,511
He agreed with Corday.
It's benign.

688
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:33,013
‐ And her labs?
‐ They're not back yet.

689
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,215
Carter, you gotta
stay on top of this one, okay?

690
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:36,482
Scary, isn't it?

691
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:39,052
I mean, one second,
one‐one mistake

692
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:40,954
and your whole life
just changes just like that.

693
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,756
Has she had
any other complaints?

694
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,859
Yeah, she's got a headache.
But I don't think it's anything.

695
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,128
Alright. Order a CT.

696
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,997
‐ A CT?
‐ Yeah. Just do it, okay?

697
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:52,966
'No, no.
He's been a real trouper.'

698
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,869
That's my good boy.

699
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,804
Peter, there you are.

700
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:01,942
It's just a minor accident.
Come on. Come on. He's fine.

701
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:04,811
‐ What about you?
‐ It's not as bad as it looks.

702
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:07,080
You know, I was getting gas.
And then all of a sudden‐‐

703
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:10,951
‐ Yes. Elizabeth filled me in.
‐ Just the highlights.

704
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:14,354
Well, I should really
be getting Reece home.

705
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:16,189
Thank you again
for taking care of him.

706
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,258
You're very welcome.
You feel better now, Reece.

707
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:21,562
Hey. Call me if he becomes
irritable or lethargic, okay?

708
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:25,331
‐ I will. I will.
‐ Alright. See you.

709
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,801
She takes things
in her stride.

710
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,970
Like what?

711
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:32,906
Peter, you've
just got to relax.

712
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,909
You know, if I had taken the El
or waited for that taxi

713
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,978
or got my damn car fixed,
none of this would've happened.

714
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:41,582
Yeah, you mean, if only I
hadn't got involved. That's it.

715
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:44,851
Elizabeth, I didn't say that.

716
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:47,588
No. You didn't have to.

717
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:50,390
Diagnosis, too many bologna
and cheese sandwiches.

718
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:52,926
And too many hours
in front of video games.

719
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,595
‐ Fleets enema?
‐ Yeah.

720
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,162
And the number of
the local cub scout pack.

721
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:57,898
Boys need activities.

722
00:29:57,931 --> 00:30:00,834
Stay fit, make friends,
have fun, all at the same time.

723
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,003
‐ You came back.
‐ Why wouldn't I?

724
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:05,205
Dr. Weaver,
I'm losing a pulse on Plazik!

725
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,372
What's his history?

726
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:08,008
Presented with pyloric stenosis

727
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,576
secondary to
chronic ulcer disease.

728
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,278
Ate a big lunch,
followed by bad heartburn.

729
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,381
‐ He take any meds?
‐ Just bicarb. Baking soda.

730
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:18,885
‐ He's bradying down.
‐ Probably vasovagal.

731
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,120
Do you think the CO2
from the bicarb

732
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,822
is distending in his stomach?

733
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:25,425
Damn!

734
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:29,329
‐ Esophageal strictures.
‐ Here. David, let me try.

735
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,934
No. I can't get it either.

736
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,369
Get me an 18‐gauge needle.

737
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,204
‐ And a syringe.
‐ What are you doing?

738
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:41,174
We gotta decompress him
or he's gonna explode.

739
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:42,375
Are you sure?

740
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,352
Pulse is coming back.

741
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:54,420
Excellent work, doctor.

742
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,194
‐ Thanks for doing this, Mark.
‐ Thank you.

743
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,930
The bone‐marrow drive
is a great idea.

744
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,131
I'm glad you and Doug
are going out tonight.

745
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:06,366
He's really
looking forward to it.

746
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,102
What do you mean?
He canceled on me.

747
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:12,639
You're kidding. I told him
we could cancel tonight.

748
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:14,340
Excuse me.

749
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:17,210
Natalie? Is there a problem?

750
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:20,413
‐ Are you "C. Hathaway, R. N."?
‐ That's me.

751
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:23,149
I'm Natalie's mother,
Abbey Logan.

752
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:26,086
I found your
clinic follow‐up note..

753
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,189
...along with these.

754
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:35,328
Natalie won't talk to me.
So I thought you might.

755
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,198
Well, confidentiality laws
prevent me from discussing

756
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,100
Natalie's medical history.

757
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,968
'I just wanna know what's
going on with my daughter.'

758
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,504
I understand that.

759
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:45,438
Maybe I can answer some
questions for Natalie

760
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:48,241
in private that'll make her
more willing to discuss this.

761
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:51,277
‐ Whatever you can do.
‐ Okay. Come on.

762
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:03,524
Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie.

763
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:05,125
I had no idea it was
so important to you

764
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:06,527
to have your own
piece of the pie.

765
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,529
I didn't intend to
go behind your back.

766
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:11,031
Oh, no. Never apologize
for being ambitious.

767
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,232
I just wish you'd
spend your time on a study

768
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,234
that was more respectable.

769
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,504
Respectable?

770
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:21,007
Foisting substitute blood
on hapless John Does in the ER

771
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,009
and without their consent,
is a bit morally ambiguous

772
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:24,277
don't you think?

773
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,979
So you're concerned
for my soul.

774
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:27,514
Among other things,
how'd you like to become

775
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:31,484
the Chicago area coordinator
for the HemoAid OR study?

776
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:33,353
You are joking.

777
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,988
Drug company's
expanding the new science

778
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:37,257
and they've asked me
to oversee it.

779
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,992
If you join me,
you'll leap up the ladder

780
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:43,296
from worker bee to queen bee,
what do you say?

781
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,497
It's a generous offer.

782
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:47,233
Is it contingent on me
dropping my ER study?

783
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:49,736
I can't imagine
you'd have time for both.

784
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:52,973
Think about it.

785
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,478
Your parents obviously care.

786
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:00,013
Trust me.

787
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:03,483
This would seriously
flip them out.

788
00:33:03,517 --> 00:33:06,319
Maybe it would reassure them
to know you're being responsible

789
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,121
about birth control and STDs.

790
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:11,024
Yeah, but you're not
gonna tell them, right?

791
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:13,326
I can't tell them,
and I won't.

792
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,528
Okay.

793
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:17,063
But sometimes it's worse

794
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:19,065
when you shut out
the people who care.

795
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,301
And your mother is concerned.

796
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,269
Your father brought you here.

797
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,007
That wasn't my father.

798
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:32,579
That man who you
saw me with earlier..

799
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:34,280
...he's my teacher.

800
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:40,320
Natalie, are you having
sex with your teacher?

801
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:43,156
It's not like he forces me
to or anything like that.

802
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:46,292
I mean, we really
love each other, you know?

803
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:47,493
It's just
we gotta keep it quiet.

804
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:48,795
'Because if Jim's wife
found out‐‐'

805
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,130
‐ He's married?
‐ Yeah.

806
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:52,398
But she's real unstable,
his wife.

807
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,100
'So he can't
tell her just yet.'

808
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:57,804
But when I'm 18,
Jim's gonna get a divorce.

809
00:33:57,838 --> 00:34:01,575
This teacher of yours, Jim,
he's what? About 40 years old?

810
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:03,510
About that.

811
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,646
Natalie, what he's
doing is illegal.

812
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,482
No. No. I love him.

813
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:12,152
And he loves me. It's simple.

814
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:13,820
No. It's definitely not simple.

815
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:23,363
Biopsy results came in.

816
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,832
‐ And?
‐ Cancer's back.

817
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,569
How bad?

818
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:31,605
Lymphomas in the bone marrow.
That's why he was so anemic.

819
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:37,644
I told him
it was all behind him.

820
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:40,246
He made it through this before.
He can do it again.

821
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,882
But this means
bone‐marrow transplant.

822
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,417
Mm‐hmm, and more chemo, he also
gonna have to be isolated

823
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,386
'cause there's
a greater chance of infection.'

824
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:49,155
I did contact the National
Bone Marrow Registry.

825
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:52,158
His father or his
sister could match.

826
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:53,459
Does he know yet?

827
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:55,529
'No. I was about
to go tell him.'

828
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,130
'His dad's in there
with him right now.'

829
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:58,431
'I thought you'd
like to come along.'

830
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,300
No. I think they should
have some time alone.

831
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,102
You know,
I'll be by later.

832
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:07,340
Alright. Sorry.

833
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:19,753
'Well, I'm pleased
to say, Mr. Jang'

834
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,322
it looks like you've made it
through with flying colors.

835
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:24,424
He doesn't understand
English very well.

836
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:27,528
I just wanted to see
how he was doing.

837
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,738
My father wants to thank you
for helping save his life.

838
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:39,239
You're very welcome.

839
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,444
I told him
about your blood study

840
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:47,614
and even though I still
have reservations..

841
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,415
...he'd like to know
more about it.

842
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,585
Well, certainly.
With your help, of course.

843
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,489
Should you be here?

844
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:58,491
So how are you feeling?

845
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:00,861
Better. I'd like to go home now.

846
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:02,696
Well, as soon as
we're sure you're fine.

847
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:04,497
Your CT came back negative.

848
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:08,635
But these labs indicate
an elevated amylase and lipase.

849
00:36:09,803 --> 00:36:11,572
‐ Dr. Benton.
‐ Oh, Carter.

850
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:14,440
You missed something
in Miss Ingram's labs.

851
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:17,644
This level indicates
a pancreatic injury.

852
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:20,714
No. You missed something.

853
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,885
‐ BAL?
‐ 0.16.

854
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:26,887
Did you consume
any alcoholic beverages

855
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,655
'during your lunch break?'

856
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:35,796
Great news. Mr. Jang's
decided to remain in my study.

857
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,397
That's terrific.

858
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,365
I guess you won't
need help from me after all.

859
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,367
Uh, well actually,
I will still need your support

860
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,836
if I'm to make
a go of this.

861
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:46,439
‐ You having second thoughts?
‐ No. No. I'm staying put.

862
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:47,841
It may not be
the smartest political move

863
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:49,843
but it feels like
the right thing to do.

864
00:36:57,818 --> 00:37:00,654
Are you behind this marrow
drive? I'm very touched.

865
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:03,423
Actually, it was
Carol Hathaway's idea.

866
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:05,425
How did Scott
take the news?

867
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,961
That boy continues
to surprise me.

868
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:10,664
He is determined
to beat this thing.

869
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:13,333
He has a spirit
I haven't seen before.

870
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,403
Have you told Scott
about your own health status?

871
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:18,839
No. Of course not.

872
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:20,741
I didn't think so.

873
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:23,577
Somehow he senses something.

874
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,813
Respects you
as a kindred spirit.

875
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:30,551
Anyway, I know
he's eager to see you.

876
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:34,420
I wonder how many
donors actually match

877
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:35,856
for a bone‐marrow transplant?

878
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:37,858
I heard less than one percent.

879
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:40,694
I guess I won't wait
by the phone.

880
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:42,563
How's Chase?

881
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:45,599
Still pretty early.
You know Chase.

882
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:47,601
When can I visit him?

883
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:50,537
You know, Kenner's kind of
strict about visitors.

884
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:51,772
I know. Just tell him
I said hi.

885
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:54,474
You bet.

886
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:55,408
Your turn.

887
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:59,813
'You know,
she confided in me'

888
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:02,549
'cause she thought
her secret was safe.

889
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,417
Providing access
to birth control is one thing

890
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,886
sexual abuse
is something else.

891
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,754
Well, I just hope it doesn't
scare off the other kids

892
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,455
from coming in
to the clinic.

893
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:10,891
She did the right thing
by coming in here, you know?

894
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:13,894
‐ This is one unique case.
‐ Well, let's hope.

895
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:17,030
This guy's a 40‐year‐old man,
he's a teacher, he's married

896
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:18,832
and he's having sex
with a minor.

897
00:38:18,865 --> 00:38:20,767
'Carol, a policewoman's
asking for you.'

898
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:21,902
Says you got
a crime to report?

899
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,704
Yeah. I'll be right there.

900
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:24,871
As she sobered up,
she thought twice about

901
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:26,006
getting any lawyers involved?

902
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,407
Her exact words were

903
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,575
"I wanna crawl under a rock

904
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:29,776
and pretend
like this never happened."

905
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,545
Yeah, well,
she's not the only one.

906
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:33,647
‐ You were lucky, hon.
‐ 'Peter!'

907
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,981
I thought I'd missed you.

908
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:36,482
Oh, hi.

909
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:40,453
Listen, I ran into Dr. Brin

910
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,722
and I convinced him
to let me assist

911
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:43,924
on a thyroidectomy
in the morning, and, uh..

912
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,526
...I wanna go and check
on Reece on my way home

913
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,927
so I think we should
cancel tonight.

914
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,930
Yeah, I assumed that.
I need my car keys.

915
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:54,901
Thank you, Peter.

916
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,476
It was a thrill
to see you in action again.

917
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,513
We make a good team,
you and I.

918
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:09,816
I'm sorry if I was
presumptive before.

919
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,618
You're a conscientious
person, Kerry.

920
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:14,721
It makes you a good doctor
and a good manager.

921
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:17,724
Well, I tried to fill the void
while you were on leave.

922
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:20,026
And surpassed me.

923
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,962
Probably because
of your sincere interest

924
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:24,765
in all things administrative.

925
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:27,934
I never gave a damn
about the bureaucracy before.

926
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:31,572
Didn't...interest me then.

927
00:39:32,573 --> 00:39:33,674
And now?

928
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:37,711
And now...
everything interests me.

929
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:44,985
Carol, Anna, you two
have plans this evening?

930
00:39:45,018 --> 00:39:47,588
No, I did, and then I didn't,
and now I don't know anymore.

931
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:48,889
I'm free. Why?

932
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:50,657
Do you fancy a girls'
night at my place?

933
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:52,926
‐ I make a mean cosmopolitan.
‐ That sounds good.

934
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,494
‐ Sounds great.
‐ Say 8 o'clock?

935
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:55,629
‐ Good.
‐ Okay.

936
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,668
I, uh, don't know
what you two are doing

937
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:03,069
but I have plans
this evening.

938
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:04,671
So have fun.

939
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:07,708
Together again.

940
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:29,796
Jeanie.

941
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,901
It's okay.
I've made women cry before.

942
00:40:39,072 --> 00:40:40,941
How are you feelin'?

943
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:43,777
Well, this helps.

944
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,547
Are you sure you're not being
Mr. Tough Guy like earlier?

945
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,983
No. I really feel better.

946
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:51,117
Good.

947
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:59,560
My dad said that you could
come to Yosemite with us..

948
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:00,927
...if you wanted to, I mean.

949
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,095
Yeah, I'd like to.

950
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:06,800
Hey, the Bone Marrow Registry..

951
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:08,068
...found eight people who

952
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:10,571
preliminarily match
your marrow type.

953
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:13,940
Eight?
That's my lucky number.

954
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:16,677
We still have further matching
to do, you know? But..

955
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,178
Hey, it's a start. Right?

956
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:20,013
Yeah. It's a start.

957
00:41:22,115 --> 00:41:24,618
Seven brothers,
seven sister‐in‐laws

958
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:25,886
twelve nieces and nephews.

959
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,824
‐ Number 13 on the way.
‐ Oh, my God!

960
00:41:30,857 --> 00:41:32,993
You're considered
the family freak.

961
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,995
Oh, please, my aunt Tessa
bursts into tears

962
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:36,997
'every time she sees me.'

963
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,200
Well, my parents cope
by treating me..

964
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:42,035
...like a bachelor son.

965
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:44,104
Oh, come on, your families
must be very proud of you two.

966
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:45,939
Oh, sure they are.

967
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:49,943
But you, Carol, have
something that I really envy.

968
00:41:50,977 --> 00:41:53,013
What?

969
00:41:53,046 --> 00:41:55,248
A sex life!

970
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:56,917
Cheers to that!

971
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,620
I have no complaints
in that department.

972
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:01,054
Give us a little
something more than that.

973
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,724
Oh, please. Please.
Let's live vicariously, please.

974
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:05,158
You wanna hear
about my sex life?

975
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:07,260
‐ Yes! Yes!
‐ 'Okay.'

976
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:09,162
What do you wanna know?

977
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:10,964
Oh. Hold that thought.
Pizza's here.

978
00:42:10,997 --> 00:42:13,166
‐ Let me get it.
‐ No, no. No. I've got it.

979
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,172
‐ Oh, Peter?
‐ Hey.

980
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:22,909
Look, I know I should've
called first, but I, uh..

981
00:42:25,111 --> 00:42:26,880
‐ You were right.
‐ I was?

982
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:29,950
Yeah. I do have a problem
dating white women.

983
00:42:29,983 --> 00:42:32,052
You know, actually, this
isn't really the time..

984
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:34,855
No, no, no. Listen to me.

985
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:36,723
I mean, there's a lot of stuff
you don't understand and..

986
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:39,660
Hey, Elizabeth,
do you need some more...money?

987
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,798
I didn't know
you had company.

988
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:47,668
‐ Hi, Peter.
‐ Bye, Peter.

989
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:52,773
It was a spur‐of‐the‐moment
sort of thing, you know.

990
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:54,708
Oh, no.
You don't need to explain.

991
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,778
Peter, uh, maybe we could
do it some other time

992
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:58,979
now that you know
where I live.

993
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,046
Yeah, yeah.

994
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:08,088
Hey, cuz.

995
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:13,126
What you watching?

996
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,128
CNN?

997
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:17,698
Anything going on in the world
that I should know about?

998
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:23,036
Here.
I brought you something.

999
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:24,705
It's Walker Evans.

1000
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:27,774
A complete retrospective
of his work.

1001
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:31,077
I think there's a photograph
in here that you'll love..

1002
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,746
...if I can find it.

1003
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:34,314
Evening, John.

1004
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:36,282
Hi, Joyce.

1005
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,952
Why, Chase, look at that book
your cousin brought you.

1006
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:40,721
Wha..

1007
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:49,262
'Okay, Chase.'

1008
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:53,734
'Take a sip.'

1009
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:59,873
Oh, no! Your book!

1010
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:04,878
That's okay. Book's fine.

1011
00:44:06,212 --> 00:44:07,948
Book's fine.

1012
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:10,150
He's been having
more trouble with that hand.

1013
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,756
There you go.

1014
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,296
Not a perfect match,
but it'll do.

1015
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:25,065
Thanks, Joyce.

1016
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:28,769
'There we go.'

1017
00:44:34,908 --> 00:44:36,242
You want to try it?

1018
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:48,321
Okay, okay.
Hey, I'll do it. I'll do it.
