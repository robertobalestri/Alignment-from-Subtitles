1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,509
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,276
Oh!

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,245
I‐I'd invite you
back to my place

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,516
but, uh, I fear I'd be
taking advantage.

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,185
‐ 'I'm going to help you.'
‐ You have to help me!

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,121
I'm going to help you.
I'm going to help you, chase

7
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,723
but you got to
stick with me!

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,658
A delay in the vote at this late
there just isn't an option.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,260
I can't support something
I don't believe in.

10
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,596
When I was talking
to Greg Powell

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,731
it got intense

12
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,398
'and, um..'

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,767
And I kissed him.

Oh..

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,319
‐ Touchdown!
‐ Nice catch.

30
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,888
Hey, Dr. C,
how'd you get in?

31
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,124
I followed a snowplow
in from the Ryan.

32
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,292
What? Only one patient?

33
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,560
Yeah.
Bumsicle, defrosting.

34
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,261
'Yo, Jer!'

35
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,598
How much longer is Weaver
gonna keep you on nights, Jerry?

36
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,832
I believe her
exact words were

37
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,634
"until hell freezes over."

38
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,769
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk
to her about it again, actually.

39
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,805
You think I'd look good
in that cut?

40
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,239
Honestly?

41
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,274
No.

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,512
Carter, what do you think
the best approach

43
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,414
with Weaver is?
Contrition, indignation?

44
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,616
Begging.

45
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,283
Oh, I think I would
just appeal

46
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,652
to her innate sense
of fairness.

47
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,320
She has a sense
of fairness?

48
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,289
Yeah! Just remind her you've
been on nights now for, uh..

49
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,725
Four months.

50
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,927
And that you think that your
exemplary work history

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,695
and your many years
of loyal service

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,631
marred by only one
minor incident‐‐

53
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,298
Blowing up
the ambulance bay.

54
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,400
Makes it incumbent
upon her

55
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,603
to bring you back
to the land of the living.

56
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,404
I still say beg.

57
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,673
Hey, Anna's on?

58
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,808
Yeah, she's in exam
four, sleeping.

59
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,910
Hmm.

60
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,451
Yo, Carter.

61
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,591
'Nice throw!'

62
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,440
Carter?

63
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,676
Hey.

64
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,513
Hi.

65
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,814
What time is it?

66
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,016
It's 6:00. I didn't
mean to wake you.

67
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,751
I got to get up anyway.

68
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,952
No, no, catch
a few more minutes.

69
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,521
I'll go get us
some breakfast at Doc's.

70
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,022
What do you want bagel?
Coffee?

71
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,358
‐ Is it still snowing?
‐ Yeah.

72
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,662
Yeah, they said we might
get three more feet today.

73
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,531
‐ Wow.
‐ Maybe more.

74
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,633
Here. I brought
you a doughnut.

75
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,968
Oh, thanks.

76
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,272
How's Chase?

77
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,041
He's off the clonidine.

78
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,277
He's weak, but up and around.

79
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,979
Thanks for all your help
with him.

80
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,648
I was happy to.

81
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,420
What?

82
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,025
Well, I'll go get us
some breakfast.

83
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,994
‐ Scrambled eggs.
‐ What?

84
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,496
Scrambled eggs, please

85
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,399
with wheat toast,
a couple of blueberry pancakes

86
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,734
and an orange juice.

87
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,469
Coming right up!

88
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,705
Paramedics have a GSW, massive
blood loss. A few minutes off.

89
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,039
'They're having a hell
of a time gettin' here.'

90
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,941
They think they may lose him.

91
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,343
Rain check on that breakfast.

92
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,845
What do you got?

93
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,981
Multiple GSW to the chest,
abdomen and left thigh.

94
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,616
Estimated blood loss
is one liter.

95
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,850
Two liters saline in.

96
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,953
Abdomen is tense.
No bowel sounds.

97
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,856
Type and cross, and, uh,
get six units O‐neg down here.

98
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,392
‐ Are we still short?
‐ Yes. It's stuck at O'Hare.

99
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,827
We're runnin' low on blood.

100
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,461
With the storm and the flu,
nobody's donating.

101
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,797
Alright let's spin a crit.

102
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,665
Get a portable chest. Excuse me.
And a blood gas.

103
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,433
Did somebody use a machine gun
on this guy?

104
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,968
He's a security guard,
interrupted a rape.

105
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,639
Eight ET tube.
How long ago was he shot?

106
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,908
At least 20 minutes. We got
stuck, had to dig the rig out

107
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,042
in the middle of Halsted.

108
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,577
Hemopneumo. Chest tube tray.

109
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:11,712
Rape victim's
still on the scene.

110
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:12,879
Unit 57's got her.

111
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,981
An old lady,
must've been 70.

112
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,750
'Unbelievable.'

113
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,384
How's the old woman?

114
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,820
She's in rough shape,
but it looks like

115
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,487
he stopped her
from getting raped.

116
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,123
‐ I got the blood.
‐ 'They catch the rapist?'

117
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,891
No. But there's tons
of cops over there looking.

118
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,627
They think this guy
might've shot him.

119
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,529
Chest tube's in.

120
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,496
Okay. Good.
Let's call the OR.

121
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,732
And tell them
we're on our way.

122
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,501
‐ More blood?
‐ No. Save it.

123
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,136
Have Respiratory meet us
with a vent.

124
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,004
Maybe they'll finally
catch the son of a bitch.

125
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,740
About damn time.

126
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,074
If we get him upstairs
we can stop at the cafeteria.

127
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,643
Hey, hey, guys,
out of the way.

128
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,877
What do you got?

129
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,646
Multiple GSW
on his way to the OR.

130
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,980
He saved an old woman
from being raped

131
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,615
and got shot
for his trouble.

132
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,750
How'd you get in?

133
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:50,851
Oh, took the El.

134
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,819
Car was stuck.

135
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,155
‐ Whoa. No pulse.
‐ What?

136
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,623
Looks like
idioventricular rhythm.

137
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,658
Alright, take him back,
take him back.

138
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,760
Careful. Hey,
out of the way!

139
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,127
Listen, follow me.
We'll go around.

140
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,596
‐ Come on.
‐ Watch it.

141
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,497
‐ Whose patient?
‐ Mine.

142
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,466
Thoraseal's full.

143
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,434
Probably lacerated arteries.
Cynthia..

144
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,770
Hold on.

145
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,071
He was stable.

146
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,106
Yeah, well, he sure
as hell isn't now.

147
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,008
Careful.

148
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,143
‐ Thoracotomy tray!
‐ Let's get more blood in.

149
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,745
‐ How much?
‐ All of it.

150
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,781
‐ Should I order more?
‐ Yeah. At least four.

151
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,519
Somebody shut off
that damn alarm.

152
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,388
Rib spreader.

153
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,962
Come on.

154
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,864
Pericardium is tense.

155
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,502
‐ Incise. Release the tamponade.
‐ Ten blade.

156
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,938
Go laterally. Watch out
for the coronary arteries.

157
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,642
Suction. Come on, suction!

158
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,744
'Give me the pickups.'

159
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,479
‐ You're in my light.
‐ Four more O‐neg are coming.

160
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,748
Damn it!

161
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,116
Left ventricle's
shredded.

162
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,618
How many units in?

163
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,852
Three. The fourth one's up.

164
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,953
There's not
enough to sew.

165
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,622
Come on, we should still try.

166
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,524
'Call it, Carter.
Save the blood.'

167
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,659
He stopped an old woman
from being raped.

168
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,061
No good deed
goes unpunished.

169
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,504
‐ Time of death?
‐ 6:11.

170
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,206
Son of a bitch.

171
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,629
‐ 'Don.'
‐ Morning, Kerry.

172
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,863
Morning.

173
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,031
You're in early.

174
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,566
I was anxious to
hear the outcome

175
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,068
of last night's
SPG vote.

176
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,004
Well, after careful
consideration

177
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,105
and due in no small part

178
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,240
to your glowing
recommendation

179
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,776
the board will begin
negotiations with SPG

180
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,813
for an emergency department
management contract.

181
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,916
I'm sorry
to hear that.

182
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,720
You've placed me in a very
awkward position, Kerry.

183
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,222
I went to the board
at your urging.

184
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,224
Any misgivings
you had about SPG

185
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,659
should have been aired
weeks ago.

186
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,293
If we reverse
our position now

187
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,896
we are going to look
very foolish indeed.

188
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,000
I take it you have misgivings.

189
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,269
Yes, I do.

190
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,971
Well, the board
was anxious to know

191
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,606
whether the
senior ER staff

192
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,941
was supportive
of the idea.

193
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,076
You assured me they were.

194
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,011
If you were incorrect
in that assessment

195
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,246
and wish to go
before the board

196
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,114
and admit your error

197
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,183
that might carry
some weight.

198
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,119
So you want me
to fall on my sword

199
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,255
in front of the board
of directors.

200
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,758
It is your sword, Kerry.

201
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,095
So, my lease is up
February 1st..

202
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,329
Whoa, are you okay?

203
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,699
Oh, my God.
Yeah. Thanks, Mark.

204
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,367
Jerry, let's get some
mud mats down here

205
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,870
before someone slips
and kills themself.

206
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,638
Anyway, they want
me to move

207
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,807
or sign a new lease
for six months

208
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,309
and I was month‐to‐month,
but now they want me‐‐

209
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,678
Three patients?

210
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,245
It'll pick up soon
as it stops snowing.

211
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,847
Oh, yeah, all those
sick people

212
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,749
sitting around at home,
waiting around

213
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,251
just to rush in and ruin
our perfectly good slow day.

214
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,888
The 57's on their way
with a rape victim.

215
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,323
Anyway, um, it seems
silly for me to be paying rent

216
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,959
especially when I'm spending
every night at your place.

217
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,227
‐ What?
‐ Mark?

218
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,696
Jerry, get
some mud mats down

219
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,330
before somebody
kills themself.

220
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,865
Can I talk to you
a little later?

221
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,667
Yeah. Sure, okay.

222
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,168
And how much is your rent?

223
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,071
Well, $450 now but they
want to raise it to $500.

224
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,974
I could probably
help you out with that.

225
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,343
Oh. You know, I..

226
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,912
Do you want to talk
about this later?

227
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,080
No. I didn't mean
to make you fell uncomfortable.

228
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,682
You didn't make me
uncomfortable.

229
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,718
Okay, I'm gonna.. I have to get
these up to the lab.

230
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,419
Right.

231
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,254
‐ What?
‐ Nothing.

232
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,056
Uh, Randi called.
She's snowed in.

233
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,125
‐ Perfect.
‐ Uh, Dr. Weaver

234
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:28,094
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

235
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,063
Um..

236
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,397
I've been
working nights

237
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,766
for months now

238
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,134
and‐and while
I appreciate

239
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,202
that the accidental damage

240
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,704
that I inflicted
on the ER

241
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,206
cannot be dismissed
as inconsequential

242
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,242
nor insignificant.

243
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,710
I do, however, believe

244
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,179
that my eight years
of loyal service

245
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,214
along with my sterling
attendance record

246
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,918
and my seniority,
all demand

247
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,254
that I get my old
day shift back.

248
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,423
Is that it?

249
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,825
I'm also appealing

250
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,360
to your innate
sense of fairness.

251
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,129
Can you work
Randi's shift today?

252
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,265
Mm.. Pull a double?

253
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,268
‐ I'd love to.
‐ Fine. You're on days again.

254
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,837
Anybody see Carter?

255
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,272
He went over
to Doc's a while ago.

256
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,341
God, I'm starving.

257
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,943
Anna!
Breakfast is served.

258
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,212
Hey.. Oh, my God! John!

259
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,749
You okay?
You alright?

260
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,350
Oh, man, that smarts.

261
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,420
Damn it, Jerry, get
those mud mats out here now!

262
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,090
Ambulance is pulling up.

263
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,893
I'm never gonna get
my breakfast, am I?

264
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,460
Alright..

265
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,905
72‐year‐old‐woman,
respiratory distress, cyanotic.

266
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,372
She's unresponsive.

267
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,810
BP 90/70, pulse 56

268
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,079
resps 32, GCS ten.

269
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,048
‐ This one's mine.
‐ The snow's too deep.

270
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,150
We're gonna have to lift.
One, two, three.

271
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,886
Two large‐bore IVs,
ten liters O2 by mask.

272
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,355
Unable to intubate in the field
due to laryngeal edema.

273
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,790
Bastard tried
to strangle her

274
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,491
then pushed her down
a flight of stairs.

275
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,828
Head trauma,
multiple contusions.

276
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,796
There's a deformity
of the left hip.

277
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,867
Distal pulse is weak,
but present.

278
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,302
Decreased air movement,
stridor on inspiration

279
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,238
intercostal retraction.

280
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,041
‐ Pulse ox is 88.
‐ Let's tube her.

281
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,408
Caught her
in her parking garage.

282
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,210
Did the guard make it?

283
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,846
Guard died on the table.

284
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,447
'Son of a bitch.'

285
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,919
Uh, I can't see the cords.
Suction.

286
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,792
He gave up on
the magic marker

287
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,094
'used a knife
on her stomach.'

288
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,263
What do you want, doctor?

289
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,065
Um..

290
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,033
uh, blood gas.

291
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,802
CBC, chem‐7

292
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,337
type and cross for six

293
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,507
foley cath,
and dip a urine for blood.

294
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,810
Cross table C‐spine,
chest, pelvis and left hip.

295
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,379
‐ 'Let's do it.'
‐ Another one?

296
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,515
Damn it. I don't believe this.

297
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,149
‐ How's the hangover?
‐ Painful.

298
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,417
No hard feelings,
I hope?

299
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,519
No, of course not.

300
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,322
I'm really sorry.

301
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,258
There's a novelty shop
down the street from my flat.

302
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,896
You know, magic tricks,
rubber bugs, black soap.

303
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,430
I love that sort
of thing, don't you?

304
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,967
‐ Not really.
‐ Oh. Sorry.

305
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,869
Why are you so late?
It's not like you.

306
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,905
Oh, Carla wants to put
Reese into a day care.

307
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,439
He's not even a year yet.

308
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,842
I'm afraid you won't
get sympathy from me.

309
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,476
My mum gave me
to a nurse after I was born

310
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:31,845
and went away on holiday

311
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,514
in southern Spain
for three weeks.

312
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,181
It was nannies after that

313
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,018
and boarding school
by the time I was five.

314
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,452
Anytime,
Dr. Benton.

315
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,387
This colectomy is not getting
any younger.

316
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,256
Okay.

317
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,125
So anyway,
I'm on the phone

318
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,527
with this
nanny service.

319
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,362
450 a week, after taxes.

320
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,165
That's two‐thirds
of my take‐home.

321
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,900
You got any lunch plans?

322
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,335
I doubt I'll have time.

323
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,638
I'm buying.

324
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,140
Ah, it's a mess out there.

325
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,975
Schools are closed,
but we still got to work.

326
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,910
Honey, we always
got to work.

327
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,145
'Well, now..'

328
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,379
Pretty slim pickings.

329
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,281
‐ Any pedes?
‐ Not a one.

330
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,116
Uh, give me time to work
on my dictation.

331
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,351
'Do you have my X‐rays, please.'

332
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,653
What's going on
over there?

333
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,221
Uh, another of those
elderly rape victims.

334
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,057
The cops might catch
the guy this time, though.

335
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,626
They've got him cornered in a
warehouse down by the river.

336
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,494
I hope those dogs
tear him up good.

337
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,496
Yeah, no kidding.

338
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,500
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

339
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,446
Uh..

340
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,252
‐ You okay?
‐ Yes.

341
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,491
'No.'

342
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,060
I mean..

343
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,696
He's your best friend, right?

344
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,230
Mark? Yeah. He's..

345
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,033
I don't understand.

346
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,504
We have great times together.
We laugh.

347
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,506
'We have..
We‐we enjoy each other.'

348
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,509
I sleep over there every
single night, but he's..

349
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:09,976
I know that I make him happy.

350
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,978
I know I do.
I can tell, but..

351
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,550
He just keeps giving me
these mixed signals.

352
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,254
Well, I mean..
We have, um, uh..

353
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,656
I mean, you talk
to him about that?

354
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,958
Yeah, I talk about it
to him lots of times

355
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,459
but he just avoids it.

356
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,128
I mean..

357
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,300
we usually end up
having sex instead.

358
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:38,404
Is it me?

359
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:43,409
Does he think that maybe I'm not
good enough for him? Is that it?

360
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,311
Or is he just..

361
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,513
Is he just..

362
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:49,249
Scared 'cause he cares so much?

363
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,418
Okay, let's bag her.

364
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,987
Babinski's downgoing.

365
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,756
Pulse ox is coming up.

366
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,323
X‐rays.

367
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,061
Excuse me, gentlemen.

368
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,495
Guys, it's getting crowded
in here, wait outside

369
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,598
and we'll let you
know how she's doin'.

370
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,469
Uh, hip's dislocated.

371
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,738
Should we pop it back in
before we take her up to CT?

372
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,239
Yeah, we can get
post‐reduction film

373
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,642
after the non‐contrast CT.

374
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:16,743
Thanks.

375
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:20,246
‐ Vitals?
‐ BP's 110/70, pulse 88.

376
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,718
‐ Ready?
‐ Yeah.

377
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,525
Call CT to tell 'em
to set up a vent.

378
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,128
Okay, let's go.

379
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,665
Send a blood gas from CT.

380
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,767
And repeat a chest X‐ray

381
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,269
when she gets
back here, okay?

382
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,408
How's she doing?

383
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,610
Well, her vitals
are normal.

384
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:51,578
They put
her hip back in.

385
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,313
I'll get our stuff
back to the rig.

386
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,048
Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,118
You okay?

388
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,085
Yeah.

389
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,690
Hey, Connie, what do you do
for child care?

390
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,092
I got a sitter.
It was a nightmare.

391
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,393
Used to run up
my phone bill.

392
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,762
Eat me out
of house and home.

393
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,330
Eight bucks an hour.

394
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,699
‐ Eight bucks?
‐ My sister's paying ten.

395
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,535
Well, I finally gave up.

396
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,537
Put them upstairs
in day care. They love it.

397
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,704
Yeah, but, aren't they sick
all the time

398
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,205
being around
those other kids?

399
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,741
‐ Sure.
‐ Builds their immune system.

400
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,843
You know, there's a girl
in my building she baby‐sits.

401
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,310
I don't think
she's that expensive.

402
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,411
You want me
to give call her?

403
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,113
Need a baby‐sitter,
Peter?

404
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,849
Carla wants to put
Reese into day care.

405
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,617
And you're uncomfortable
with that?

406
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,519
Listen, Jerry, do you have any
more dictations for me?

407
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,454
You know, my mother
raised us at home.

408
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,222
You're the product
of a bygone era.

409
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,791
It's time to join
the modern world.

410
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:41,327
Listen, I'm doing these in
sutures if anybody needs me.

411
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,869
'Oh, Dr. Ross.'

412
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,537
Pedes is on the phone,
they're short staffed.

413
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:51,738
Wants to know
if you can come look

414
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,139
look at a newborn
up in the OB.

415
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,241
Yeah, fine. Thanks.

416
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:02,482
See you later.

417
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,855
Doug.

418
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,692
‐ Doug, come on.
‐ Is that the guy?

419
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:12,859
We were talking.

420
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,194
He was upset.

421
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,596
Another elderly
rape victim came in.

422
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,363
I was trying
to calm him down.

423
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,399
Was that the guy?

424
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,902
Yes, that's the guy.

425
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,904
I'm not seeing him
or anything.

426
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,739
No, you're not ready to
commit, that's fine.

427
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,574
You want to screw
firemen, fine.

428
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,810
Just don't humiliate me
in front of my friends.

429
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,779
Humiliate you?

430
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:34,915
What about the surgical tech
in the on‐call room

431
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,217
or the pedes nurse,
in the parking lot.

432
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,419
How about the drug rep with the
fake breasts and the big hair?

433
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,621
Ancient history.

434
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,255
I'd have to do
the entire bulls' line‐up

435
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,490
on the dammit mid desk
before I began to be equal you.

436
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,259
Is that what this is about?
This is about getting even

437
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,694
for things I did
a long time ago?

438
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:50,597
No. This is about me
needing some time

439
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,198
and you being really pissed off

440
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,367
that things aren't working out
as you planned.

441
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,436
I've spent years

442
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,573
years of my life,
changing to fit your needs

443
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,942
working around your schedules,
your insecurities

444
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,244
your inabilities to commit.

445
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,278
'Well, you know what, Doug?'

446
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,547
'It's not all about you.'

447
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,184
I know that may come as a shock

448
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,754
but a relationship
is give and take.

449
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:17,423
Two people as equals
and right now, I need something.

450
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,526
'So you can grow up
and accept it'

451
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,195
or you can go on being
the same selfish

452
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,630
self‐centered bastard
you've always been

453
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,866
and refuse to give me
the one thing

454
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,602
One thing I've ever
asked you for.

455
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,610
Mark, we're precariously
short of blood.

456
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,712
I'm going to ask
the staff to volunteer

457
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,881
rotate our people
upstairs to donate.

458
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,783
We don't have very many
patients anyway.

459
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,585
Sounds smart.

460
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:45,852
The board voted yesterday

461
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:48,288
to begin negotiations
with Synergix

462
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,323
to take over the management
of the ER.

463
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,925
Congratulations.

464
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,727
‐ That's what you wanted, right?
‐ Yes and no.

465
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,496
I've had disturbing reports
from other hospitals

466
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,964
about their cost‐control
techniques.

467
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:59,332
Uh, Mark?

468
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,634
Did you talk to Anspaugh?

469
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,903
He felt that if all
the ER attendings

470
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,605
opposed the decision

471
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,673
that would go a long way
toward scuttling the deal.

472
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,308
Won't that make us
look ridiculous?

473
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,010
I mean, we recommended
it, right?

474
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,613
Yeah, but then the heat
doesn't fall on any one person

475
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,781
if we all go to
the board together.

476
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,283
I've started contacting
the other attendings

477
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,754
and I was hoping I could
count on your support.

478
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,657
Well, show me the statistics
and I'll let you know.

479
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,991
‐ Good, thanks.
‐ Mark.

480
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,393
Cops caught that rapist.
GSW to the chest.

481
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,695
Paramedics
are bringing him in.

482
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,597
‐ Here?
‐ That's what they're saying.

483
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,600
‐ Tell 'em we don't want him.
‐ Let Mercy take him, or Rush.

484
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:35,969
Malik, prep trauma two
and alert surgery.

485
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,706
Come on, people.

486
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,811
There's no evidence
of penetration.

487
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:49,683
Thank God for small favors.

488
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,018
Who does something
like this?

489
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,419
I don't know

490
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,288
but if they find the guy
that did this

491
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,523
they should take him out
back, shoot him

492
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:59,660
and toss his body
in the dumpster.

493
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,294
‐ Hey.
‐ 'Hey.'

494
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,529
How's it going?

495
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:03,830
Great.

496
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,331
Really?

497
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,933
Cynthia cried on my shoulder
for about an hour.

498
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,902
What's that all about?

499
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,370
Her lease is up.

500
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,538
You want my opinion?

501
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:12,639
Not particularly.

502
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,608
Fine.

503
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,309
How's Carol?

504
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,578
She talk to you about it?

505
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,345
‐ About what?
‐ Nothing.

506
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,915
Um, we have a nasty
MVA on the Kennedy

507
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,851
and a family in a minivan
hit an overpass

508
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:27,554
and that, um,
rapist is here.

509
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:33,527
You should talk.

510
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,997
Two IVs in, no pulse

511
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,700
large‐caliber GSW
to the chest

512
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,635
multiple contusions,
canine bites

513
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,737
an open fracture
to the left femur.

514
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,038
Damn, he's just a kid.

515
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,040
Yeah, 19.
Name's Jack Miller.

516
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,411
We'll leave him
on the paramedic gurney.

517
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,647
‐ Who's up?
‐ Carter.

518
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,081
No breath sounds.

519
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,017
‐ This the rapist?
‐ One of you guys get him?

520
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,452
Nah. He was hiding there in the
crawlspace. Dogs found him.

521
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,887
'Too bad they called
the dogs off.'

522
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:02,488
Yeah, another 20 minutes
would have saved us all

523
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,524
a lot of trouble.

524
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:04,825
Got a rhythm
on the monitor.

525
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:06,927
‐ Should I setup another drip?
‐ Nope.

526
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,562
What's going on,
Dr. Carter?

527
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:10,063
PEA?

528
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,866
Yep. What's the differential?

529
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:16,469
Hypovolemia, hypoxia,
tension pneumo

530
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,738
pulmonary embolism

531
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:21,041
pericardial effusion,
tamponade.

532
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,609
How's the old lady?

533
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:23,777
She's going to be fine.

534
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,911
Chuny?

535
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:26,747
Bradycardic 48.

536
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,981
What do you want to do,
Dr. Carter?

537
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,783
Let the bastard die.

538
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,685
He's a patient.
Like every patient

539
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,554
he gets our
best effort.

540
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:34,555
Dr. Carter?

541
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,960
Amp of epi, IV push,
and a milligram of atropine.

542
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,497
You heard him.
Let's go.

543
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,667
What about an airway?

544
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,801
Yeah, he needs one.

545
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,435
Well, let's put one in.

546
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:50,804
Mark, that MVA is here.

547
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:51,872
Mother's in trouble.

548
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,607
I'll be right there.

549
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,109
Malik, you're with me.

550
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,544
Thank God.

551
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,913
Call me if you
need anything.

552
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,815
She was throwing up
last night.

553
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,750
No. Only a little bit.

554
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,852
I ate some saltines
like my sister told me to.

555
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,922
‐ That usually works.
‐ Do you throw up often?

556
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,792
I always eat the saltines
and then it goes away.

557
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:15,028
Last night, she ate
a whole thing of Cherry Garcia.

558
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,462
Robert!

559
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,565
Cherry Garcia's
my favorite, too.

560
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,768
Are you
having them again?

561
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,637
Have you had
these pains before?

562
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,805
Sometimes it'd hurt
a little bit

563
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,439
but it goes away.

564
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,141
These just keep
coming back.

565
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,944
Coming back, how often?

566
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,179
When? How many?
Eight...times?

567
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:36,750
During.. Kathie Lee
about eight or nine times.

568
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:39,686
Okay, I want you to
just lie back

569
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,555
and I'm going to take
a quick look, alright?

570
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,790
‐ Am I okay?
‐ You just relax.

571
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:45,759
Legs apart.
Good.

572
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:49,195
Okay.

573
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:50,764
Alright.

574
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:53,867
She's seven centimeters.

575
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,235
I'll get the fetal monitor.

576
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,504
Just keep breathing.

577
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:58,872
Weak pulse.

578
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,807
No breath sounds
on the left.

579
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,543
Neck veins are dilated.

580
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:03,577
Tension pneumo?

581
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,012
Sounds about right.

582
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:06,880
32 French.

583
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:12,052
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Central line.

584
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:14,120
This guy's going
to need volume.

585
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:16,022
Victim's coming to.
You guys want to talk to her?

586
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,831
Whoa.

587
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,738
Damn it.

588
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:33,640
He's losing
a lot of blood here.

589
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:35,241
Want me to go get Mark?

590
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,510
No.

591
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,246
He's bleeding out.
He's already lost a liter.

592
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,617
He needs blood, Carter.

593
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,018
How many more units
of O‐neg do we have?

594
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,020
This is it...
four units.

595
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:54,995
Alright,
let's auto‐transfuse him.

596
00:24:55,028 --> 00:24:56,697
‐ What?
‐ You're kidding?

597
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,164
‐ 'Use his own blood?'
‐ 'Hook up the cell saver.'

598
00:24:58,198 --> 00:24:59,566
The guy needs a transfusion.

599
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,101
And he's going to get one.

600
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:03,169
There's not enough. It's all
over the floor, Carter.

601
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:05,739
‐ This'll be fine.
‐ He needs blood, Carter.

602
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:06,973
And he's going to get it.

603
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,642
Hook it up to the central line,
wide open.

604
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,288
Shootin'.

605
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:23,289
AP pelvis next.

606
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,625
Call me when you're ready.

607
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:27,594
I'll be next door.

608
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:28,795
How's he doing?

609
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,163
He has a massive hemothorax

610
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,665
from the gunshot wound.

611
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,167
Possibly to
the pulmonary artery.

612
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,136
We auto‐transfused him
from the Thora‐Seal.

613
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:37,303
BP's up to 80 palp.

614
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,905
No kidding? You
auto‐transfused?

615
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,273
I've alerted the OR.

616
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,909
And I think
he's stable enough to travel.

617
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:44,878
Then let's
send him up.

618
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,551
‐ Anna, you coming?
‐ No. Thanks. Carter's got it.

619
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,020
Overweight 62‐year‐old

620
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,189
shoveling two feet
of wet snow.

621
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,791
I can't imagine why
he's having an MI.

622
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,159
Word on the grapevine

623
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:00,927
is you're mustering
opposition to SPG

624
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,028
among the ER
attendings.

625
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,930
I have to do
what I think is right.

626
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:05,231
The board has approved
the deal, Kerry.

627
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:07,367
Yeah, maybe
they can be dissuaded.

628
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,202
Come back here.
Come here. Come here.

629
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,708
I've put months of work
into this already.

630
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,076
Whatever concerns you had

631
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,377
you should have addressed
to me weeks ago.

632
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,812
You should have
been more forthcoming

633
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,380
about the
cost‐containment strategies

634
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,882
you've utilized
at other facilities.

635
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,149
We're a public company.

636
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:24,951
Whatever we do
is clearly spelled out

637
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,953
in our literature
and our prospectus.

638
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:28,154
Did you happen to read that?

639
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:29,723
Yeah, I had trouble
finding it

640
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,124
buried in all
the rosy profit predictions

641
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,694
and glossy photographs
of satisfied patients.

642
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:36,663
Come on. You're the one
struggling to turn this ER

643
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:38,031
into a cost‐effective
operation.

644
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,900
Are you telling me
you couldn't anticipate

645
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,935
what's necessary
to make it profitable?

646
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,670
I'm willing
to make hard choices, Ellis.

647
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:46,640
I'm not willing
to endanger patients.

648
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,208
Are you questioning my ethics
as a physician?

649
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,643
I'm not sure. Maybe.

650
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:50,977
‐ Kerry.
‐ Hang on a second, Carol.

651
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,245
You used me, Ellis.

652
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,346
That's what we've
been about, right?

653
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,215
You used me
to get this deal.

654
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:57,083
Well,
I don't like being used.

655
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,986
You underestimated me once,
and you were right to

656
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,888
but don't
underestimate me again.

657
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:04,725
I'll see you at the board.

658
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:05,992
'Are you okay?'

659
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,694
The patient, Carol.

660
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:10,063
27‐year‐old woman,
35 weeks.

661
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,432
Seven centimeters dilated,
fully effaced.

662
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,301
‐ Get her up to OB.
‐ Well, she won't go.

663
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:17,237
She's scared they're going
to take her baby away.

664
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,271
What?

665
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,305
She's retarded.

666
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,741
She wants
to leave AMA.

667
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,308
I've been treating her
at the clinic.

668
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:25,311
I think she'll stay
if we keep her down here.

669
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:27,013
I...I'm going home.

670
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:28,815
'You can't go home, Mary.
You're having a baby.'

671
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,884
Robert,
where are my shoes?

672
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,719
Mary, hi.
I'm Dr. Weaver.

673
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:34,755
Where are you going?

674
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,322
Mary, why don't
you sit down here

675
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:38,224
and let Dr. Weaver
examine you, okay?

676
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:39,459
'Mary, if you go home'

677
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,061
it could be very bad
for your baby.

678
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:43,063
I know you love
your baby very much.

679
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:45,198
You don't want anything
bad to happen, right?

680
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,433
So let me take a look
and we can talk about

681
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:48,735
'what we should do.'

682
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:52,706
Please? For your baby?

683
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:57,077
Good. Jeanie, let's get her
on a fetal monitor.

684
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,814
That's so we can check
your baby's heart.

685
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,282
Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

686
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,284
‐ A girl.
‐ How exciting.

687
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:05,752
And why
are you afraid

688
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,721
to go upstairs
to have your baby?

689
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:10,123
They'll take her.

690
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,792
Why are they going
to take her, Mary?

691
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:14,027
That's what
Judy said.

692
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,262
‐ Who's Judy?
‐ 'Her sister.'

693
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:17,397
Nine centimeters.

694
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,999
Do you live with your sister?

695
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,202
No. We live at
5214 East Chestnut.

696
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,738
Well, we don't take babies
when they have such nice parents

697
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,073
so why don't you
stay here with us

698
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:30,010
and we'll make sure
everything's going okay.

699
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,212
When did it
stop snowing?

700
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:34,014
Oh, I didn't
know it had.

701
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:37,417
Only the finest
culinary offerings

702
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,221
from the third‐floor
vending machine.

703
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:43,289
Tuna or cheese?

704
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:44,825
'I didn't know
if you were one of those'

705
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:46,092
truly fanatical
vegan people

706
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,061
or whether
a little bit of seafood's

707
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:51,331
'allowed to pass
your lips every so often.'

708
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:54,868
‐ Cheese, please.
‐ Ah! A true believer.

709
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,971
I must say I do enjoy a good
hunk of rare meat

710
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,039
every so often.

711
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,144
How long has it been
since you've had something

712
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:07,113
really juicy, Peter?

713
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,549
Oh, I don't know.

714
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:10,884
Uh...six years.

715
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:11,918
I thought as much.

716
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:13,119
Egg?

717
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,120
No.

718
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,257
Pity.

719
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,424
No, I...I eat eggs.

720
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:22,996
I just, uh...I just..

721
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:30,270
I've, uh...had a thought.

722
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,874
I have no family here..

723
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:36,843
...no ties... no time.

724
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:40,981
You have the baby,
but not much else.

725
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:42,248
'And with
our schedules'

726
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,885
it makes it almost
impossible to date

727
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,553
or even really meet someone

728
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:51,391
much less anything
approaching a real relationship.

729
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:56,029
So, uh...
I was thinking.

730
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:59,533
We're both adults...
attractive.

731
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:02,969
We, uh...
we enjoy each other.

732
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,140
Why not?

733
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:14,314
I won't disappoint.

734
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,459
I've made you blush.

735
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,629
Whoo!

736
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:33,233
I, uh...
I don't think I'd...I'd..

737
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,035
...I'd be comfortable
with that.

738
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,438
That's a pity.

739
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,481
Heard
the rapist made it.

740
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,250
‐ Good job, Carter.
‐ Has anybody seen Doug?

741
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,885
I'm gonna need
a pediatrician

742
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,386
to check out a newborn
in a couple of minutes.

743
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,288
I think he's still up at pedes.
I'll go page him.

744
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,923
I'm around if you
can't find him.

745
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,892
‐ Thanks Anna.
‐ You ever get anything to eat?

746
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,194
I lost my appetite,
thanks.

747
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,429
Excuse me, I'm looking for
my sister, Mary Cochran.

748
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:04,464
She's having a baby.

749
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:05,899
Hi, yes. She sure is.

750
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,233
I'm Carol Hathaway.
Come with me.

751
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,937
Is she alright?

752
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:12,472
Oh, she's doing great.
Not long now.

753
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:13,907
Can I see her?

754
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,942
Uh, sure. I have
to ask her first.

755
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,277
Hi, Mary. How you doing?

756
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,545
‐ I'm back.
‐ She's crowning.

757
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:19,580
Keep pushing.

758
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:23,083
Four, five, six, seven

759
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:25,318
eight, nine, ten.

760
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:28,589
Good. Now, don't push.

761
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:30,456
This is hard.

762
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,491
You're doing great.

763
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:33,059
He's ROA.

764
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,595
How you doing,
Robert?

765
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:35,662
Not going to
faint, are you?

766
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:37,230
I'm okay.

767
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:38,565
Somebody get Robert a chair

768
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:41,234
just in case he feels
like sitting down.

769
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,569
Your sister's
outside, Mary.

770
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:44,037
Judy?

771
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,039
Yeah. She wants to know
if she can come in.

772
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,440
‐ Yes.
‐ Carol, can you give me a hand?

773
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:48,675
Yeah.

774
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:51,377
Alright, Mary,
just one more time.

775
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,979
Mary, I'm here, honey.

776
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,649
'Let's give it everything
you've got, okay?'

777
00:31:55,682 --> 00:31:57,317
One, two..

778
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,424
...five, six,
seven, eight, nine..

779
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:05,491
There she is.

780
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:06,627
I see the head.

781
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,028
Look at all that hair.

782
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:09,696
Oh, wow!

783
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,131
Looks like you might
need someone

784
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:12,999
with pediatric experience
in here.

785
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,568
Oh, look.

786
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:15,636
She's beautiful.

787
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:21,642
Okay, Mary, this
is just the last little bit.

788
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,047
She's out.

789
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,650
Oh...oh, my God.

790
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:35,055
Welcome to the world,
Madison.

791
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,590
Is she okay?

792
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,191
'Yeah. Ten fingers..'

793
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:39,693
...and ten toes.

794
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,728
Okay, dad,
get in here and cut the cord.

795
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:43,496
Come on, Robert.
You can do it.

796
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,698
There?

797
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:46,166
That's the spot, there.

798
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:50,036
Go ahead.

799
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,104
Good.

800
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,608
So sweet.

801
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,680
Hello, baby.

802
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:01,715
Hello, little baby.

803
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:05,218
'Ten units
Pitocin, IV.'

804
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:08,254
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

805
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,292
Thank you
so much.

806
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,359
You're welcome.

807
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:20,734
Is the baby
okay mentally?

808
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,268
Well, it's too soon to tell

809
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:24,571
but she's seems
fine, alert.

810
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:27,273
There's no reason to think she
won't be perfectly normal.

811
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:32,112
When do the
social workers come?

812
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,348
They don't.

813
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:38,785
We don't call social services

814
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:42,388
when there are two
loving, adult parents.

815
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,624
You seem very nice

816
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:45,058
so I hope you won't
think me rude

817
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,092
but do you have
the training

818
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,728
to make
that assessment?

819
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:50,163
Well, they're doing fine
with the baby

820
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,331
they have
their own apartment

821
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:52,599
and Robert works.

822
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,100
Robert is the janitor

823
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,603
at his uncle's
muffler repair shop.

824
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:58,371
Neither of them drive

825
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,574
because they don't read
well enough top pass the test.

826
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:02,442
They have their own apartment
but I do their bills

827
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:05,211
and remind them to do
their laundry every week.

828
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:07,180
They are sweet, loving people

829
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,782
but they can't care
for an infant.

830
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:15,321
Do you think you're qualified
to make that assessment?

831
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,457
You know, I wish
that I weren't.

832
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,662
I can't tell you how much
I wish that I weren't.

833
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,367
Mark, did you get a chance
to look over

834
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,735
those Synergix reports
I gave you?

835
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,104
‐ Not very encouraging.
‐ So you're with me?

836
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,438
Sure. Whatever
you think's best.

837
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:35,108
Would somebody please
answer the phone?

838
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:36,577
ER.

839
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,111
The board finance committee
meets next Tuesday.

840
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:39,412
Can I count on you
to be there?

841
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,181
Yeah, as long as I don't
have to say anything.

842
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,116
Why isn't anybody
answering the damn phone?

843
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,317
Where is Cynthia?

844
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,519
Cynthia left hours ago.

845
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:47,120
She seemed upset.

846
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,488
‐ She left?
‐ Yeah.

847
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:49,890
Jerry?

848
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,758
Jerry?

849
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,126
‐ Jerry!
‐ What?

850
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,728
Answer the damn phone!

851
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,129
Blood's finally here
from O'Hare.

852
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,463
Blood bank's restocked.

853
00:34:57,497 --> 00:34:58,599
Peter.

854
00:34:58,632 --> 00:34:59,866
'Hey.'

855
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,702
Hey, I was looking
for you upstairs.

856
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:03,704
Yeah, a I had a hot appendix
turned out

857
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,405
to be unrefrigerated,
three‐day‐old pizza.

858
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,607
Do you have the forms?

859
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,241
Hold on.
Hey, where's Reese?

860
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,275
He's in the car.

861
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:10,343
You left him
in the car?

862
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:11,712
Yeah, he's with a friend.

863
00:35:11,745 --> 00:35:14,648
Dafina? Carla, she better not
be smoking.

864
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:16,750
Peter, the forms,
did you sign them?

865
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:18,151
Oh, I'm sorry.

866
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:20,286
I've been working all day.

867
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,557
I need those forms today
so Reese can start on Monday.

868
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,258
‐ Monday?
‐ Yes, Monday.

869
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,827
Are you going to sign them?

870
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,196
I don't know. I was trying
to check out other alternatives.

871
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,632
‐ Forget it. Just forget it.
‐ What?

872
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:33,734
‐ Just forget it.
‐ Carla, Carla, look, look.

873
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:35,936
I'm not convinced this is
the best thing for the baby.

874
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,871
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Peter.

875
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:40,473
Carla, I think I deserve more
than one day to make up my mind.

876
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:42,943
Fine. Take a week, a month...
hell, take six.

877
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,244
Just let me know
when you've decided

878
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:45,546
what's right for my life.

879
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,648
You know, it's not
just your decision to make.

880
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,351
Peter.

881
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:53,820
Wait! Where do you think
you're going?

882
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,789
To see my son.
He's in the car, right?

883
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,624
Peter, get back inside.

884
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:59,860
What? Is Dafina in here
smoking again?

885
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:02,328
Look, come by later.
You can see him then.

886
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,334
'Hey.'

887
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:14,240
Peter Benton,
Roger McGrath.

888
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:16,943
Roger McGrath,
Peter Benton.

889
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:19,412
Roger, will you put Reese
in the car seat, please?

890
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:26,452
Peter, I been meaning
to talk to you about this.

891
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:29,455
He works with Chandra
over at the CTA.

892
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,357
He's steady and smart

893
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:35,395
and...Reese loves him.

894
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:37,931
All in.
You take care now.

895
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,402
If you want to talk
about this later

896
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:43,837
give me a call, okay?

897
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:49,643
Hey, Scoot.

898
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:50,777
Hey, Chase.

899
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,348
You asked me
to drop by today.

900
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:57,283
Oh, right.
Right, right.

901
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:58,552
How you feeling?

902
00:36:58,585 --> 00:36:59,886
I've been better.

903
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:01,988
Nothing some crank

904
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:04,925
and a half gallon
of Stoli's wouldn't fix.

905
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:05,959
That was a joke, Scooter.

906
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:07,694
That's not very funny.

907
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:08,895
Listen, can you hang out
for a second?

908
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:11,431
There's a patient
I don't want to miss.

909
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:13,734
‐ Hey, Anna.
‐ Hi, Chase. How are you?

910
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:16,737
Oh, great. Never better,
thanks to you.

911
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,438
Your cousin there
did all the work.

912
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:19,472
'Hey, John,
when do you get off work?'

913
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:20,607
I could take you and..

914
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:21,808
...Anna out to a great dinner.

915
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:24,845
Uh, actually, I've got to..

916
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:26,046
Maybe some other time.

917
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,380
Take care.

918
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:32,418
Trouble in paradise?

919
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:33,520
Something like that.

920
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:35,822
You going to go
after her?

921
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:39,626
If you don't, I will.

922
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,027
Mark, have you seen Carol?

923
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:42,729
Yeah, she's down the hall.

924
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:44,965
A retarded couple had
a baby this afternoon.

925
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:47,634
She's teaching them
how to change diapers.

926
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:48,902
No kidding.

927
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:52,438
A little girl,
six pounds, seven ounces.

928
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:54,007
Name's Madison.
Seems fine.

929
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,809
Good for her.

930
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:58,712
Listen, uh,
Cynthia left early.

931
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:01,381
Chuny said she was upset.

932
00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:03,483
I'm going to talk to her.

933
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:04,618
I know what I'm doing, Doug.

934
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:06,553
If you say so.

935
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:10,624
Hey.

936
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:12,659
We saved that rapist today.

937
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:14,460
'Hell of a world, huh?'

938
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:15,796
Yeah. I'll see you later.

939
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:19,465
Anna!

940
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:21,334
Anna!

941
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,839
What the hell's
the matter with you?

942
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:28,441
Go back inside, Carter.

943
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,877
You're going to freeze
your ass off out here.

944
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:34,615
I don't understand. This
morning, everything was great.

945
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:36,717
I'm tired.
I was on all night.

946
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,685
Let's just call it a day, okay?

947
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,986
Is this about that rapist?

948
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,022
You know what this is about,
Carter!

949
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:43,023
No, I don't.

950
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:47,561
Why didn't you use
the blood on hand?

951
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:48,662
It's all we had.

952
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:50,096
So?

953
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,633
We used six units
on that guard this morning.

954
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,768
We were short then
and you didn't even blink.

955
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:57,704
'Why not use the blood
on the kid?'

956
00:38:57,738 --> 00:39:00,140
I thought auto‐transfusion was
the best course of action.

957
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:01,542
Oh, please.

958
00:39:01,575 --> 00:39:03,409
We could have done
a thoracotomy.

959
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:04,444
'We could have
pumped in blood'

960
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,079
'on the rapid infuser.'

961
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:08,414
Yeah, well, he lived.
He's in recovery.

962
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:10,751
Dumb luck!

963
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:13,687
You are one of the most
aggressive physicians

964
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,488
I have ever seen in trauma

965
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:18,124
and you auto‐transfuse him?

966
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:22,896
You didn't want to waste
the blood on the kid.

967
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,665
You didn't care
if he lived or died.

968
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:28,769
It's my trauma,
it's my call.

969
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:30,036
Would you have
done it differently

970
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,838
if the patient
hadn't been a rapist?

971
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,074
Come on.
Every case is different.

972
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:36,543
Did you withhold treatment
from that kid?

973
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:37,343
No.

974
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:42,583
John, did you
withhold treatment?

975
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:46,620
No.

976
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:11,077
Fancy meeting you here.

977
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:13,446
Hey.

978
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,048
'Listen, um..'

979
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:16,683
...you feel like any darts?

980
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:19,986
Just darts?

981
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,689
Yeah. Just darts.

982
00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:25,792
I mean, if that's okay.

983
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:27,427
Don't know what you're missing.

984
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,531
I've got
a pretty good idea.

985
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:36,803
As long as I'm not
being...unappreciated.

986
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:43,243
You know, darts
usually involves wagering

987
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,847
of a rather
substantial nature.

988
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,550
Alright, um...
a penny a point.

989
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:53,219
I've withdrawn
the contract.

990
00:40:53,253 --> 00:40:54,788
I called Anspaugh
and told him

991
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:56,489
that Synergix is
no longer interested

992
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:58,525
in managing county's
emergency department.

993
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,227
Why would you do that?

994
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,531
I only wanted the contract

995
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:07,500
if it meant working closely
with you, Kerry.

996
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:10,571
Apparently, that's
not possible anymore, so..

997
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:16,142
You are a smart, beautiful,
sexy woman

998
00:41:16,176 --> 00:41:17,578
and I don't want
you believing

999
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:21,515
that I used you,
because I didn't.

1000
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:23,617
'And I never
underestimated you.'

1001
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,618
Never once.

1002
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,754
You underestimate yourself.

1003
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:32,759
Take care.

1004
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:43,003
So you fold under.

1005
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:45,506
You fold up.

1006
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,677
And you fold over
just like that.

1007
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:52,713
Okay?

1008
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:53,980
Now you try.

1009
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:56,016
'Fold up.'

1010
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:57,150
Fold it over.

1011
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,053
That's good.
Try it again.

1012
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:10,130
Looks like
they're doing great.

1013
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:11,331
Yeah.

1014
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,166
So why is it
so hard for us?

1015
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,167
I don't know.

1016
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:20,273
I didn't mean to push you.

1017
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:27,814
Take as much time
as you need.

1018
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,184
I'll wait.

1019
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,605
Hey.

1020
00:42:55,842 --> 00:42:56,977
How long you been
sitting here?

1021
00:42:59,846 --> 00:43:00,914
About an hour.

1022
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:03,149
Give or take.

1023
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:11,858
I wanted him to die.

1024
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:17,964
I saw what he did
to that old lady..

1025
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:20,300
...and the others before
and I wanted him to die.

1026
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:25,872
I didn't think
he should have that blood.

1027
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:29,743
I mean if someone
had come in

1028
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:33,346
and they...really needed it..

1029
00:43:33,379 --> 00:43:37,350
If some little kid
had been hit by a car

1030
00:43:37,383 --> 00:43:39,185
or some old guy
had been accidentally shot.

1031
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:42,088
'If someone like that
had died'

1032
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,990
'because we wasted
the blood on that guy..'

1033
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:49,730
I don't know.

1034
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:55,736
It was my decision.

1035
00:43:58,404 --> 00:43:59,673
And I made it.

1036
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,212
And if he had died,
I don't know how I'd feel.

1037
00:44:12,118 --> 00:44:13,720
But I can't say that I'm sorry.

1038
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,266
I mean, was that wrong?

1039
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:29,169
Anna, are you sure?

1040
00:44:31,437 --> 00:44:32,405
No.

1041
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,341
I'm not sure.

1042
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:41,915
I'm not sure.
