1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,073
Previously on ER..

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,609
Carter, you come
here every day.

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,744
Sometimes you're really cooking
and sometimes you're not.

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,045
Alright,
let's auto‐transfuse him.

5
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,246
‐ What?
‐ You're kidding.

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,280
'He needs blood, Carter.'

7
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,516
And he's gonna get it.

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,117
Dad, I told you
I was gonna rent a car.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,384
Your mother
appreciates you coming.

10
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:22,122
Oh, there you are!
Oh, I'm so glad!

11
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,356
‐ Jerry!
‐ What!

12
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,691
Answer the damn phone!

13
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,459
Did you withhold treatment
from that kid?

14
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,161
It's my decision.

15
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,830
It was good that you
stayed focused on the patient.

16
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,064
Thanks.

17
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,099
Take as much
time as you need.

18
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,736
I'll wait.

19
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,727
Let's say we pull
into the ambulance bay

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,328
with a gunshot victim.

21
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,630
What are you thinking about?

22
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,765
‐ Excuse me?
‐ A fresh trauma patient.

23
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,534
What goes through your mind?

24
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,503
The basics of course,
airway, breathing, circulation.

25
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,839
Oh, yeah? But you docs don't
ever think about the scene.

26
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,375
You see two IVs, C‐collars,
backboards, monitors..

27
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,711
...all packaged
and ready to go.

28
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,913
But you have no idea
what we have to go through.

29
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,815
Which is why I'm here.

30
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,449
Listen,
a one‐day ride‐along

31
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,451
is not gonna tell
you the whole story.

32
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,386
You know, sometimes
we get shot at.

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,388
Sometimes we're out there
trying to save a banger

34
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,591
and there's airmail
coming in on us from all sides.

35
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,759
‐ Airmail?
‐ Yeah.

36
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,194
Garbage,
bottles, bricks.

37
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,896
Thrown from
the windows, from the roof

38
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,766
and we're down in the streets
trying to save a life.

39
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,568
Yeah, you gotta
keep your mind right.

40
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,869
It can make you cynical.

41
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,172
Well, let's hope
we have an easy day.

42
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,441
That's the way it usually
is when you docs ride along.

43
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,409
That's why you don't
get the big picture.

44
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,378
Remember, you're here
as an observer.

45
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,381
We have protocols,
so don't go off on your own.

46
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,383
Don't worry.

47
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,392
Hey, sure picked the right
day for your first ride‐along.

48
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,629
‐ So, where do we begin?
‐ Right here.

49
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,397
‐ Come on through here.
‐ What do you got?

50
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,301
20 to 30 victims, mostly minor.
Lacerations, burns.

51
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,236
One fatality.
We set up triage out there.

52
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,205
Hey, captain,
we're all shored up.

53
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,807
I need to take
a paramedic down.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,876
We got a guy
trapped under rubble.

55
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,544
Well, I'll go.
I'm a trauma surgeon.

56
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,345
County General,
Dr. Corday.

57
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,682
You have any experience
with confined‐space rescue?

58
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,284
No, but, uh, take me to him,
I'll see what I can do.

59
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,688
Okay. Gear her up
and take her down.

60
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,490
First section's pretty vertical,
maybe eight to 10 feet.

61
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,759
‐ Better to go head first.
‐ Uh‐huh, head first?

62
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,261
Yeah, once you get under
there's no room to turn around.

63
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,531
Now, the walls...are
pretty uneven

64
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,932
so, it's easier to brace
yourself with your hands.

65
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,834
Do you ever
do any rock climbing?

66
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,436
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Look,
will I actually fit in there?

67
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,906
Yeah, it's tight at first,
but near the victim it opens up.

68
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,909
‐ You claustrophobic?
‐ Uh, no, not really.

69
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,376
Alright.

70
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,945
Well, best if you go first.

71
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,580
If something goes wrong
I'll drag you out.

72
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,782
Yeah. Okay,
well, let's get on with it.

73
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,818
‐ Alright.
‐ Could you help me?

74
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:38,985
Ah.

75
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,392
‐ Alright?
‐ It's okay.

76
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,561
Alright, it's not far now.

77
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,700
Be careful, don't bump against
those four‐by‐fours.

78
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,435
'That's all that's holding
this place up.'

79
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,473
It's a little more open here.

80
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,577
We jacked up as far as we can.
All this is pretty unstable.

81
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,952
I can see him!

82
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,788
We're on the way!

83
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,662
Sir, are you okay?

84
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,730
Get me out.

85
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,331
It hurts.

86
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,568
Yes, I'll give you
something for the pain.

87
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,370
'Then we're going to
get you out, okay?'

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,308
Don't leave me.

89
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,845
We won't.
We won't leave you, I promise.

90
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,782
Okay, Dewey,
Give me the drug bag.

91
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,750
I need to start a line.

92
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,420
It's okay, sir.

93
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,422
If you just hang on.

94
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,825
Alright, okay.

95
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,394
‐ Hm?
‐ Mm.

96
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,496
‐ Oh, lilac.
‐ It's called "Spring Rain."

97
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,965
‐ It's nice.
‐ Really?

98
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,833
You don't, you don't think
it's too young for me?

99
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,635
No way. My mom wears
something just like that.

100
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,005
You know, I'm not gonna
have time to sit down.

101
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,507
I'm on from three to eleven.

102
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,175
‐ Really?
‐ How's it been going?

103
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,843
Uh, I got busy after lunch.

104
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,412
Doyle's out with the flu.
You heard anything from Mark?

105
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,814
Yeah, he's gonna try
to catch a flight

106
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,749
back either today or tomorrow.

107
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,586
‐ One coffee, please.
‐ 'Sixty cents.'

108
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,120
Hey, Carter!

109
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,022
How's the Optho rotation going?

110
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,558
Only a week to go. Long week.

111
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,494
Hey, maybe you can help me out.
I've been getting headaches..

112
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,430
...re‐reviewing these
hospital financial reports.

113
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,566
I think I need a new pair
of reading glasses.

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,802
Yeah, sure, come on up.
I'll check you out.

115
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,204
‐ Get you a new prescription.
‐ Thank you.

116
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,872
You keep that.

117
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,108
Jack Arteburn, 52,
fainted at a breakfast meeting

118
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,543
at Stanton Savings and Loan.

119
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,211
A and O on arrival,
vitals normal.

120
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,046
No ectopy on the scope.
Started a line for kicks.

121
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,815
Mr. Arteburn, did you
have any chest pain?

122
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,117
No, no, I was
just a little dizzy.

123
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,553
My secretary overreacted.

124
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,222
‐ Are you a doctor?
‐ I'm a physician assistant.

125
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,858
But I'll be, I'll be
seeing a real doctor?

126
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,127
Dr. Weaver, county dispatch
is calling, there's been

127
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,162
a fire and explosion
at a chemical warehouse.

128
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,765
They want to send us six minors
with burns and lacerations.

129
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,000
‐ Yeah, no problem.
‐ No problem.

130
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,569
Just a little bee sting, Leo.

131
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,741
Sorry. It's the only place
to put an IV.

132
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,042
Get me out of here!

133
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,010
Yep. We're working on that.

134
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,079
Now, you just hang on there.
I'll give you some morphine.

135
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,515
Make you feel much better.

136
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,651
Dewey, can you lift
up the saline?

137
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,818
Yeah.

138
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,764
He's got a good pulse.

139
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,733
Probably some broken ribs
and he can wriggle his toes.

140
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:47,934
But I can't assess
the right arm.

141
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,936
It's pinned at his shoulder.

142
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,706
If we could raise the concrete
just another inch or two.

143
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,208
No. Any movement
could bring all this down.

144
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,578
Just an inch,
then we might free it.

145
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,179
And I won't have to amputate.

146
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,516
No! No, please
don't cut off my arm.

147
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,185
No. We're trying
to save it, Leo.

148
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,688
We're gonna lift up that slab.

149
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,790
What else can we do,
if we're to get him out?

150
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,925
Okay.

151
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,927
I'm gonna need
more shoring down here

152
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,995
before we try anything.

153
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,129
I need a bone saw.

154
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,298
No. Don't do it, please.

155
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,568
Only as a last resort, Leo.

156
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,269
What about something
to reduce the friction?

157
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,071
Uh, grease?

158
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,740
No, it's too thick.

159
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,210
We need something we can pour,
like...vegetable oil.

160
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,946
‐ We got motor oil.
‐ Ah, yeah. Motor oil.

161
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,181
Lots of it.

162
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,918
We're gonna get you slick
as an eel and slide you out.

163
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,687
E, L, M.

164
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,924
N, E.

165
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,927
Very good. Very good,
Mrs. Melenger.

166
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,130
Okay.

167
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:54,801
Now I want you to tell me
which one is clearer, okay?

168
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,236
Number one..

169
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,006
...or number two?

170
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,075
Number two is very dark.

171
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,243
Okay, let's try
that again.

172
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,711
Number one..

173
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,714
...or number two?

174
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,083
It's black.
I can't see through that.

175
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,722
Yes. I think that is probably
a little too much tint for you.

176
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,223
‐ Okay, give me a minute here.
‐ Everything okay?

177
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,126
Not really. I think
your student needs some help.

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,929
Why don't I finish
up here, Dr. Carter?

179
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,098
There's a...a..

180
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,000
...glaucoma
patient in the ER.

181
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,702
‐ Needs a consult.
‐ Right.

182
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,071
Glenn Krakowski, 32,
working in a chemical warehouse.

183
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,673
Obvious right
tib‐fib fracture.

184
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,274
Starting to complaining
of abdominal pain.

185
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,178
BP 132 over 75.
Pulse 92. IV's in the field.

186
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,646
Okay, what about these guys?

187
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,782
Minor burns
and lacerations from glass.

188
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,049
‐ Anything for me?
‐ Yeah, right here.

189
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,384
Blood trauma,
abdominal pain.

190
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,786
‐ Is T‐1 open?
‐ Yeah.

191
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,053
Get start on him.
I'll take the others.

192
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,288
Sir, are you on any medication?

193
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,057
No, nothing.
I...I never get sick.

194
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,093
Uh, message
from Dr. Anspaugh.

195
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,128
He's giving
a lecture in Virgin Gorda.

196
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,396
That is the phone number
of the hotel.

197
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,131
'Hey, is that
Mr. Arteburn's chart?'

198
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,902
Yeah, yeah. Actually,
check this out. Blue Cross.

199
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,037
Not the HMO,
not the PPO.

200
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,673
Traditional
indemnity plan, gold.

201
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,675
Jerry, we treat
everyone the same.

202
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,644
I'm just thinking
about the budget deficit.

203
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,178
Mr. Arteburn, I have some

204
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,147
preliminary results
and I'd like‐‐

205
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,382
Look, if there's, if there's
any cause for concern

206
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,318
I'd really rather
go see my own doctor.

207
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,120
Well, you have some
changes in your EKG

208
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,288
that suggest that you may
have had a small heart attack.

209
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,990
Heart attack?

210
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,126
Yes, we should check a blood
test to make sure there was no

211
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,929
heart muscle damage, that takes
a couple of hours and if that's

212
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,164
normal, we can arrange
for a treadmill heart scan.

213
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,199
Look, would you call
my doctor, Greg Fonarow?

214
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,367
He's up on Chestnut.

215
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,769
I‐I just wanna
get his opinion

216
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,337
on what ever
you're gonna doing.

217
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,272
I'll call him as soon as
I get the blood test results.

218
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,774
Don't worry,
I think you'll find

219
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,209
we give the highest
standard of care.

220
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,414
It's your last quart, Leo.

221
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,151
I raised it
an inch. That's it.

222
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,318
Right.

223
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,822
‐ You ready?
‐ Ha.

224
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,824
One, two, three!

225
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,129
Let me check his arm.

226
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,898
‐ You got room?
‐ Uh, yep.

227
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,466
You said you wouldn't amputate.

228
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,168
Don't worry
it won't come to that.

229
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,336
Another good tug and we'll
get you out of the hole.

230
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,307
‐ You ready?
‐ Ready.

231
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,709
Then pull!

232
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,446
We don't have enough leverage
to lift him out of here.

233
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,716
‐ I need a come‐along.
‐ What's that?

234
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,750
It's a kind of winch..

235
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:25,919
Ah!

236
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,430
‐ What was that?
‐ I don't know.

237
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,870
Dewey here.
What the hell's going on?

238
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,873
'Explosion in the chemical area.
Abort and get out.'

239
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,176
Acknowledged. Cap says out.

240
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,377
No, you tell them
to bring that thing

241
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,813
we need so we can get him out!

242
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,480
Captain's not gonna
let anyone come down.

243
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,449
‐ Then you go get it.
‐ And leave you?

244
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,285
Yes. They've gotta
let you back down if I'm here.

245
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,321
Now go! I'm not leaving him!

246
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,358
‐ But hurry!
‐ Okay. I'll be back.

247
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,803
We're gonna die down here.

248
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,338
It's okay, Leo.

249
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,373
Just one more
piece of equipment..

250
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,375
...and we'll get you out.

251
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,847
Doug, I've got an 8‐year‐old

252
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,882
with altered mental status,
short of breath.

253
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,217
Babysitter called 911.

254
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,120
Ah, I stopped by
to see you this morning.

255
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,022
I had an early morning meeting.

256
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,891
Before 7:00?

257
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,526
Are you monitoring me?

258
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,394
Just offering you a ride.

259
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,798
Sophie? This is Dr. Ross.

260
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,567
‐ Hi, Sophie.
‐ Hi.

261
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,202
Hey, how long's she been sick?

262
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,506
Uh, her mom said she's had
diarrhea for a couple days now.

263
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,841
She said to give her
a spoonful of bee pollen

264
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,342
and raspberry tea
every four hours.

265
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,978
How are you feeling, Sophie?

266
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,480
I have to practice the piano.

267
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,583
She's altered.
When did that start?

268
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,818
I found her on the floor
and she had a bowel movement

269
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,054
and there was, uh, blood
in it. I couldn't wake her up.

270
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:11,057
Give her the ABG, a CBC,
a chem 20 and a chest X‐ray.

271
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,492
Want an IV of saline?

272
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,360
Uh, no, just a HEP block.

273
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,296
Is she gonna be alright?

274
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,898
Did you talk to her parents?

275
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,332
'I beeped her mom earlier.'

276
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,034
Could you try again?

277
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,202
Yeah.

278
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,374
You know, doctor, maybe,
if you'd gone to public school

279
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,545
you could've seen
one of my science programs.

280
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,514
I started them
right after the war.

281
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,448
Yes, try to keep
your eyes still.

282
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,150
Look at my earlobe.

283
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,085
You know, about 1950

284
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,988
I was on a TV program

285
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,123
and I liked it so much I wanted

286
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,458
to make it my life's work.

287
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,594
Yeah, what happened?

288
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,930
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

289
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,365
That son of a bitch, Mr. Wizard

290
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,000
came along
and left me dead in the water.

291
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,538
Yeah. Go ahead, laugh.

292
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,507
‐ Well, it looks good.
‐ Um.

293
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,108
I'm gonna need to
check your eye pressure

294
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,578
with a tono‐pen, Mr. Bikel.

295
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,547
‐ Dr. George.
‐ Dr. George?

296
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,616
Yeah, Tono‐pen,
I...the state‐of‐the‐art

297
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,585
we used to use the big one
with the air puff.

298
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,921
Oh, yeah, I'll put numbing drops
in your eyes first

299
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,089
and then we'll
measure the pressure.

300
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,291
Solid‐state micro‐circuitry.

301
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,361
But all in all, just a simple
pressure transducer.

302
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,197
That's what..

303
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,232
Oh, zip.

304
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,569
That's numbing already.
The numbing's coming fast.

305
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:32,005
Yup, let's press
this button and it works.

306
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,007
Don't you wanna know how?

307
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,642
'I could build you one.'

308
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:39,012
Sure, out of an ink jar,
finger cot and a swizzle stick.

309
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,047
Yeah, alright.

310
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,385
Uh, thirty‐five.
Your pressure's up a bit.

311
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,655
It doesn't look good.

312
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,224
Creatinine's 6.8.
Potassium's 7.3.

313
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,492
She's got acute renal failure.

314
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,695
Get me glucose,
insulin and Kayexalate.

315
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,462
What do you think
is shutting down her kidneys?

316
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,265
Uh, it could be,
uh, bloody diarrhea.

317
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,334
E. coli, probably.
Push two of Versed.

318
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,637
'Get an ET tube 6.5.'

319
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,372
'That's good. She needs
a central line for dialysis.'

320
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,474
Call for a pediatric
nephrology consult.

321
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,410
When can I go home?

322
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,345
Not for a little while, Sophie.

323
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,947
Dr. Ross' gonna
give you some medicine

324
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,549
that gonna make you very sleepy.

325
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,083
And when you wake up,
you're gonna have

326
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,085
a tube in your mouth
to help you breathe.

327
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,554
You won't be able to speak,
so we're gonna have

328
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,088
to do some hand signals.

329
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,957
Do you know what this means?

330
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,091
Okay?

331
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,593
Good. Are you good at charades?

332
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,562
'Here we go. Hold on.'

333
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,598
Alright,
crike, crike, crike.

334
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,700
Honey? What's going on?

335
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,970
Alright. Hang on. Okay, I'm
in, bag her. Are you the mother?

336
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,339
Get me an 11 French
Double‐Lumen catheter.

337
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,743
Sophie? Sophie?
Why is she unconscious?

338
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,745
We had to sedate her

339
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,647
to get the breathing tube
down her throat.

340
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,182
Oh, she wasn't sick when I left.
She had a little diarrhea.

341
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,617
We believe it's an E. coli

342
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,986
bacterial infection that's
causing the kidney failure.

343
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,055
E. coli? That comes from meat.

344
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,357
It's impossible!
She doesn't eat meat.

345
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,392
It can also come from
raw juices or sprouts.

346
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,395
Still, however she got it,
she needs dialysis.

347
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,531
Oh, no, I want
another opinion before

348
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,199
anyone put her in some machine.

349
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,234
‐ Don't have a lotta time.
‐ This is my daughter.

350
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,170
I have a right
to decide how she's treated.

351
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,471
Her high potassium
is high enough to cause

352
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:13,707
a cardiac arrest.
She needs dialysis.

353
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,209
If she doesn't get it, she is
gonna die. So, sign the consent.

354
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,411
Please?

355
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,084
No. My leg! I'm caught!

356
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,219
His foot's caught.
I'm gonna try and free it.

357
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,091
Can you reach it?
Can you loosen it?

358
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,428
What are you doing?
Don't touch that ja‐‐

359
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,763
‐ Just a tiny bit.
‐ 'No.'

360
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,098
The shoring's down! Get out!

361
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,332
‐ Ah!
‐ C'mon, let's go!

362
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,433
Wait.

363
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,369
‐ We can pull him out!
‐ 'C'mon, let's go.'

364
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,573
He's free!

365
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,642
Pull! Pull!

366
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,311
'Hang on!'

367
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,247
Pull, pull, pull!

368
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,683
Pull, pull, pull!

369
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,592
‐ How are you doing?
‐ Last one.

370
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,661
See you tomorrow
for a wound check.

371
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,730
Since the workers comp cases

372
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,665
make sure you call
the employee‐health coordinator

373
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,466
at the chemical plant
and fax them all‐‐

374
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,068
'I need some help!'

375
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,370
‐ What happened?
‐ We're from Prusack Chemco.

376
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,073
We were behind Building five
when the tank blew.

377
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,374
Manny went right into the stuff.

378
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,809
What kind of stuff?

379
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,478
Everyone got soaked.
It was a mess.

380
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,781
I threw these guys
in back of my pickup.

381
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,550
What‐what is that smell?

382
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,118
Solvent. Everyone got sick.

383
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,720
Okay, Jeanie,
take the other guys.

384
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:36,322
'Bag and seal all the clothes.
Glove up, everybody.'

385
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,659
I‐I'm gonna open some doors.

386
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:41,562
I want you to use one drop,
three times a day.

387
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,264
Three times a day.
One drop. Thank you.

388
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,365
Um‐hm.

389
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,869
What's the matter?

390
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,871
‐ Benzene.
‐ What?

391
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,807
It's benzene.
Don't you smell it?

392
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,709
Probably just stripping
the floors.

393
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,379
Stripping floors with benzene?
I don't think so.

394
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,282
‐ It's much too toxic.
‐ Um‐hm.

395
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,185
Ah, Doctor, before I go

396
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,187
...find out where
that smell is coming from

397
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,155
as quick as possible.

398
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,127
'Set up oxygen.
Pulse is weak and thready.'

399
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,862
Bilateral wheezes.

400
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,298
‐ What's going on?
‐ 'Chemical spill.'

401
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,734
Yosh, bag these clothes up
and get them outside.

402
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,135
'Take slow, deep breaths.'

403
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,837
'You want me to call your wife?'

404
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,438
You might be here a while.

405
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,440
We need fans in here.
I'll call Maintenance.

406
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,742
Get housekeeping to clean up..

407
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,846
‐ 'Give me a hand!'
‐ Oh, my God! Wait!

408
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,581
No one touch her
without gloves on.

409
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,249
Her clothes are soaked
through with this stuff.

410
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,585
Ready? One, two, three!

411
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,754
‐ Get a mask on her!
‐ 'Pulse ox.'

412
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,191
Roll her on her side.

413
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,928
‐ Don't let her aspirate!
‐ 'Suction.'

414
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,363
Ativan, two milligrams IV, now!

415
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,602
‐ She needs a line.
‐ 'Oh, my God, It's Dr. Weaver!'

416
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,437
Hey, don't walk through those
puddles. It might be benzene.

417
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,639
What is that?

418
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:01,542
It's a, it's a solvent.
It's toxic.

419
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,476
We don't wanna spread
this stuff around.

420
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,945
Keep this stuff contained.

421
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,279
'I mean let's go
with the Ativan.'

422
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,581
'Need to intubate.'

423
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,754
When we give an order,
it's for a reason!

424
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,255
I'm sorry. But we were so close.

425
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,757
You all could've been killed!

426
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,224
I'd have three deaths
to explain!

427
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,459
Man, I was worried about you!

428
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,493
Leo Leipziger.

429
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,295
Crush injury to the right arm.

430
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,698
BP 90 palp. Pulse 110.

431
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,499
We had a prolonged extrication.

432
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,502
‐ No kidding!
‐ Stay to the right.

433
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,437
We've got an unknown solvent
leaking out from a holding tank.

434
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,640
HazMat's setting up
for decontamination.

435
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,677
Chuny, we need at least
four more

436
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,811
of these to cover
the floor by "Admit."

437
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,513
I'll call Central. Here.

438
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,481
Anna, I want you to check
Ellenhorn's toxicology.

439
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,816
See what it says
about benzene exposure.

440
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,850
‐ Got it.
‐ Where to?

441
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,652
Uh‐h, Trauma 1.

442
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,254
Let's move the sickest patients
away from this stuff, double‐bag

443
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,856
all of the contaminated
clothes. Put them outside.

444
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,958
Heads up. Let's get the clean
patients to the back hall.

445
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,827
I'll cover them.
Randi, grab their charts now!

446
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,428
You guys need to air
this place out.

447
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,963
‐ Did you call HazMat?
‐ They're on the way.

448
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,231
There's another one
of these puppies

449
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,733
in the maintenance closet.

450
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,735
We'll blow that stuff
out of here in no time.

451
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:04,270
No, no, no! Don't plug that in!

452
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,006
Any sparks might
ignite the fumes.

453
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,407
‐ Great.
‐ Jerry, give me a phone!

454
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,676
Okay, what's the ETA on HazMat?

455
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,845
You gotta find that
disaster manual, Jerry.

456
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,347
I need surgical drapes,
the waterproof ones.

457
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,649
‐ 'Okay.'
‐ Yeah, better send a dozen.

458
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,483
Dispatch,
this is County General ER.

459
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:18,852
They'll be here
in less than five!

460
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,754
No, this is an emergency!

461
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,823
‐ Send the drapes up now!
‐ Wait, I need oxygen.

462
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:26,026
Yes, we're closing down to all
paramedic. No, immediately!

463
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,395
Hang in there, Leo.

464
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,496
Carol, I've gotta
major trauma patient.

465
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:31,532
‐ What's going on here?
‐ Benzene!

466
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,666
There's fumes all over the place

467
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:33,700
contaminating patients.

468
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:34,735
No, no, no, Dr. Corday

469
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:35,836
we're moving everybody out.

470
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,037
This man needs pre‐op labs

471
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,705
chest X‐ray,
peritoneal lavage

472
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,574
and immediate surgery
to re‐vascularize his arm.

473
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,775
Okay, take him
to the back hall.

474
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,443
‐ I'll call X‐ray.
‐ In the hall?

475
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,846
Malik. I want you
to prep that guy for a lavage.

476
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,614
‐ Notify the OR.
‐ You got it.

477
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,316
Where are you taking me?
What are we doing in the hall?

478
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,586
No, no, no, get outta
here! Get outta here.

479
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,054
There are fumes are coming
off the grills of the gurney!

480
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,856
I want to get out of here!
Where are my clothes?

481
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:57,791
‐ What happened to Randi?
‐ I don't know. She's fainted.

482
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,526
‐ You hit the lobby?
‐ Alright, Let's go!

483
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,562
‐ Clean patients only!
‐ How do we know who's clean?

484
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,564
‐ Hold, hold!
‐ Is Randi contaminated?

485
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,298
If it's on her clothes
she is, alright, let's move.

486
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,500
‐ Elizabeth, you okay?
‐ Yes, I'm fine, a bit messy.

487
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,670
But my patient's critical.
Where are we going?

488
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:12,005
'If the CEO's in a meeting,
get me her assistant.'

489
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,575
I'm‐I'm in full
disaster mode. I need a high..

490
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,943
Three victims from the blast
hole, decontaminated scene.

491
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:18,679
‐ What's the hell is this?
‐ You can't come in here.

492
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,446
‐ The ER's contaminated.
‐ What happened?

493
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,882
They just showed up
covered in benzene.

494
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:23,449
Okay, someone,
clear out the lobby!

495
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,484
You shouldn't have let them in!

496
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,586
You didn't control the scene.

497
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,820
They came in‐in a pick up truck!

498
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,088
Move this gurney out of the way!

499
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,491
‐ You just need to move!
‐ 'Move! Just move!'

500
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,827
'Okay, somebody
clear out the lobby!'

501
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:43,637
'Send them to Mercy
or something!'

502
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,706
Alright, everybody shut up!

503
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,808
‐ Everybody shut up!
‐ Send them to Mercy!

504
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:50,544
We're going to evacuate
the entire ER!

505
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:51,778
Check every room.

506
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,680
All contaminated
patients and staff

507
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:55,115
go to the ambulance
bay right now!

508
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,117
Well, now, how do we know
who's contaminated?

509
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,786
If you got a spot on your skin,
if you got a spot on your gurney

510
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,788
if you got a spot on your
clothes go outside right now!

511
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,056
You gotta move,
move now, move!

512
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,925
Let's move out.
Let's get him out

513
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,960
‐ Let's get her out.
‐ Dr. Weaver, how you doing?

514
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,429
Her seizing stopped.
She's postictal.

515
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,965
No, I‐I'm not going
outside without my jacket!

516
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,834
Can you get some blankets
for these people?

517
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,402
Anna, any non‐urgent cases we
should send home right now.

518
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:20,406
If you need stitches or if you
need X‐rays, go to the lobby!

519
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,908
Let me have this for a second.

520
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,476
How many critical
patients do we have?

521
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,878
‐ Right here.
‐ I got three, I got three.

522
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,412
Right here in the ambulance
bay, right here.

523
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,549
Seven, eight.
There's three outside.

524
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,450
That's 11.

525
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,352
All critical patients
should move to the, um..

526
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:36,456
...uh...go to,
go to the cafeteria.

527
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,991
‐ The cafeteria is big enough.
‐ Let's go.

528
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,893
Let's stock it
full of portable monitors

529
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,395
and all the oxygen cylinders
that we can find, okay, that's

530
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:43,964
where we're moving, so that's
where we're going. Let's go!

531
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:46,466
It's not advisable to move
the machine during dialysis.

532
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,500
Happens during a power failure.

533
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,602
This thing run off a battery?

534
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,170
No battery.
There's a hand crank.

535
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,538
Then start cranking.

536
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,640
Doc, pedes unit has a bed.

537
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:56,409
Alright. Get her ready.

538
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,411
Joint Admission Protocols

539
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,413
Quality Assessment
and Improvements.

540
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,549
Jerry, what are you doing?
I need Ellenhorn.

541
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,817
Um, check under the stack.

542
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,185
I'm looking
for the disaster manual.

543
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,921
It's gotta be here somewhere.

544
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,890
‐ Anna, what does it say?
‐ Uh, hold on, I just found it.

545
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:12,058
Hey, Carter, what about
Policy and Procedures?

546
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:14,628
‐ Maybe something in here that‐‐
‐ No, no, no, forget it.

547
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,029
Listen, go to the admit desk
grab all the charts

548
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,798
and take them
to Dr. Benton in the cafeteria.

549
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:20,166
‐ I'm sure there's probably‐‐
‐ Run, Jerry, to the cafeteria!

550
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,168
I got it,
it's under Hydrocarbons.

551
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:23,970
"Excreted in urine
as sulfate conjugates‐‐"

552
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:25,205
No, no, we don't need that.

553
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,973
Let's go
to Clinical Presentation.

554
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,108
Pulmonary System.

555
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:29,810
"Coughing, choking,
pulmonary edema

556
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:31,044
"where aspiration occurs."

557
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,045
I think that guy Manny aspirated

558
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,814
I don't think Weaver did.

559
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,449
Central Nervous System,
"inhalation displaces oxygen

560
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,851
"causing depressing sodium
lestogene

561
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,219
"and rarely, seizures from
hypoxia."

562
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,622
Supportive Care.
"Only treat with oxygen."

563
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:43,724
‐ That's what we're doing.
‐ She should be okay.

564
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,828
Alright, let's move
this table over here

565
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,530
up against the wall. Let's go!

566
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:50,597
Doctor, don't push it.
You're scratching my floor!

567
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,098
You, help him,
get it over there.

568
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:53,767
You do not order my people
around, you talk to me‐‐

569
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,801
The outlets.
Where are the outlets at?

570
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:56,069
Along that wall and that wall.

571
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,138
Alright, alright,
everybody, listen up!

572
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,774
Listen up, now, when
I call out the patient's name

573
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,909
give me their diagnosis.
Arteburn?

574
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,645
Uh, right here. Rule out Ml.

575
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:07,013
Alright, let's get him
over here. Center aisle.

576
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,882
‐ Nguyen?
‐ Shock, respiratory failure.

577
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,084
Alright, up against the wall.
He's gonna need a vent.

578
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,653
‐ Okay.
‐ W‐W‐W...where are you going?

579
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:14,054
I can't wait, Peter,
I need pre‐op labs

580
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,556
I need X‐ray
and I need to get him cleaned

581
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:16,590
and up to the OR.

582
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,592
Williams!

583
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,727
We gotta get some heat out
here or we're gonna freeze.

584
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,529
HazMat. What's up?

585
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,598
There's a benzene spill inside.
These patients are contaminated.

586
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,199
‐ We need some shelter.
‐ We'll set them up out here.

587
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:29,703
Keep 'em covered.

588
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:32,706
Hey, take these to the cafeteria
and set up a portable suction.

589
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,009
‐ Where's the spill?
‐ On the other side of the desk.

590
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,544
We're evacuating.

591
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:39,212
Right. That means everyone,
you too, doctor, uh?

592
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,781
‐ C...Carter.
‐ Captain Dannaker.

593
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,148
We're setting up a decon
in the ambulance bay.

594
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:43,984
Okay, we‐we're not
quite finished stocking

595
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:45,719
the ambulance bay and cafeteria
with medical supplies.

596
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,588
Our people will get
you everything you need.

597
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,189
Get everyone out now. You're not
gonna know what to look for.

598
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:50,891
You won't even know where
to find it, give me five minutes

599
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:52,025
I'll clear you the whole place.

600
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,661
‐ You got two!
‐ Okay!

601
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,530
Hey, Chuny, grab a crash cart

602
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:57,931
defibrillator
and a bunch of mayo stands.

603
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,533
‐ Right!
‐ You guys okay in here?

604
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,201
‐ Yup.
‐ Okay.

605
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:05,271
Hey Chuny, get a lot of saline.

606
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,541
Lots of it. Anybody in Exam 4?

607
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,843
'Carter, I need you down here.'

608
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,745
Inga Paulson,
coronary artery disease

609
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,847
congestive heart failure,
on dopamine and heparin drip.

610
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,248
‐ Help me move her out.
‐ Okay, I'll do it.

611
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,684
I need you take ACLS
drugs to the cafeteria.

612
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:19,820
Grab the biggest cart that
you can find and load it full.

613
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:20,921
You're gonna
move her and bag her?

614
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:23,957
Yeah. Just go, go, go!

615
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,793
Don't worry, Inga. We're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

616
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:28,695
This is ridiculous!
It's not gonna work.

617
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:29,963
There's not enough room.

618
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,598
Think we'll be better
off in the cafeteria.

619
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:32,966
No, I need her
in the ICU, alright.

620
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,100
Let's pull the lines
and close the circuit.

621
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:35,736
Stop cranking
so I can disconnect.

622
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,638
There's a liter of her blood's
in that machine, Doug.

623
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:38,872
I'm aware of that.

624
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,140
We should go
to the cafeteria now.

625
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:42,008
Hang on.

626
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,645
Alright. Now we got a loop.

627
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:46,312
Alright, start cranking
again. You come with me.

628
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:49,315
You take the other elevator
and meet us at PICU.

629
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,552
Keep cranking, don't let
that blood clot, let's go.

630
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:56,657
Good, Inga. Big squeeze
every three seconds.

631
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,158
Doing fine.

632
00:25:58,191 --> 00:25:59,760
This is the last one.
It's all yours.

633
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,895
‐ Get moving.
‐ What the hell?

634
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,830
A fire alarm. I'll deal with it.

635
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,867
Dannaker here.
Get me the fire control room.

636
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,269
What's that?

637
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:11,104
Fire alarm. Hang on.

638
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,272
Ah.

639
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,042
Wow, I lost the bag!

640
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,644
‐ Can you stabilize the tube?
‐ I‐I, I got it, I got it, yeah.

641
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,047
‐ What did you push?
‐ Nothing. I..

642
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,150
'What the hell's going on?'

643
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:26,687
It's elevator recall,
we're going down to the lobby.

644
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,888
It happens during emergencies.

645
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,656
Sophie, you okay?

646
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,828
Why have we stopped?

647
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:37,197
I don't know. How's her oxygen?

648
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,034
She's got two‐thirds of a tank.
20 minutes left.

649
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,369
Look at this.
Look, look at that!

650
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,141
Think they'll hear that?

651
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,977
Yeah, they'll hear it.

652
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,045
Damn.

653
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,366
‐ Excuse me. You're a doctor?
‐ Yes, I am.

654
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,435
I have to find my daughter.
She is a patient in the ER.

655
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,970
They won't let me in.

656
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:18,905
‐ Okay, um..
‐ You can't be here, ma'am.

657
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,340
‐ Ma'am, you can't‐‐
‐ No! Somebody help me!

658
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:21,975
You should check
in the cafeteria.

659
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,243
‐ She might be in there, okay?
‐ Let go of me.

660
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:24,711
Captain Dannaker?

661
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,813
Copy. No fire
verified on floor two.

662
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,815
Fire patrol, do a reset.

663
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,951
False alarm. Somebody smelled
fumes and panicked.

664
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:34,320
Jeanie...Jeanie,
why are we outside?

665
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:36,256
It's okay, Kerry, we're gonna
taking you to the cafeteria.

666
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,958
‐ Is she okay?
‐ A few wheezes.

667
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,359
‐ She's still altered.
‐ It's not from the benzene.

668
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,828
It's from the seizures.
She should be fine.

669
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,999
Some patients might need medical
attention before they go inside.

670
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,100
Your tents in the cold zone.

671
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,735
‐ Cold zone?
‐ Out here.

672
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,436
In there's the warm zone.
That's where we clean them.

673
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,005
Nobody goes in there
without a suit.

674
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,040
Same goes for the ER,
that is a hot zone.

675
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,275
‐ Are you Carter?
‐ Yeah.

676
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:57,143
Harriet Spooner,
VP of Operations.

677
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,812
Tonight,
I'm the incident commander.

678
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,014
Did you evacuate
the ER to the cafeteria?

679
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,048
Yeah.

680
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:03,149
The disaster plan calls

681
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,885
for evacuation
to Physical Therapy.

682
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:07,287
Well, it got a little chaotic
in there. We had to improvise.

683
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,022
We have an elevator
stuck between floors.

684
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,724
I'll find the building engineer.

685
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,025
‐ Is anybody on it?
‐ I dunno, the phone's dead.

686
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,827
The alarm's gone off.

687
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,932
Just keep your eye on it.
Now listen, Sophie?

688
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,200
We're going
on a little adventure.

689
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:21,802
'You are gonna
be fine and will have'

690
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,504
'a cool stories
to tell your friends about.'

691
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:25,338
Multifocal PVCs.

692
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,374
Let me see this.
Potassium's too high.

693
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:31,377
Push an amp of bicarb.
Buy us a little time.

694
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,116
Gotta run of seven, three.
Here, take it.

695
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,751
Bicarb. She'll be
going into V‐tach.

696
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,185
We don't have any.

697
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,286
Did you check the box?

698
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,955
You can't...you can't treat

699
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,525
hyp‐hyperkaliemia
without‐without bicarb.

700
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,027
It wasn't my idea
to move her like this.

701
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,795
Put a..

702
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,430
‐ So‐you can't..
‐ It's okay. It's okay, Sophie.

703
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,132
Alright,
what do you have in there?

704
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:55,468
Alright. We got epi, atropine.
How about lidocaine?

705
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,103
Lid‐alright,
I'll take lidocaine.

706
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:59,973
Uh, uh, 50 mg bolus,
and five every five minutes.

707
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:02,876
‐ Alright, alright.
‐ How's the oxygen?

708
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,210
Ten minutes.

709
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,814
You'll be fine.

710
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:09,816
Lavage is negative.
Let's get him up to the OR.

711
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,918
Hey, transport! Give us a hand.

712
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,160
Dr. Weaver?

713
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,563
I'm sorry. Have we met?

714
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,030
You're my doctor.

715
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:26,567
We should let her rest.

716
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,169
We got two more vents coming
down. Who gets the first one?

717
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:33,006
Um, let's start with Inga.

718
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,275
Are you sure, Inga?
It could be awhile.

719
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:37,143
Carter, where's your Attending?

720
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:38,378
Uh, Dr. Weaver's over here.

721
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:39,980
Listen, do you need
more nurses down here?

722
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:41,114
‐ Yes, we do.
‐ Alright.

723
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,850
I can float you
three from the ICU.

724
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,418
Kerry?

725
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,954
Harriet. Now, what,
what is going on?

726
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:50,156
I am so sorry,
I had no idea you were

727
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,592
debilitated by the incident.

728
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,293
What incident?

729
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:55,161
Kerry, remember I told you
there was a toxic spill?

730
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:56,396
Is she gonna be alright?

731
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:58,832
Yeah, lack of oxygen
caused a seizure.

732
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,266
But, we don't expect
any long‐term effects.

733
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,135
Uh, we'll
this is the action packet

734
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,904
for the chief medical officer
which I guess

735
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:06,239
for the moment, is you.

736
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,008
Here's a walkie.
I'm on channel four.

737
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,543
I'll‐I'll check
in with you in half an hour.

738
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:10,977
I've got to get back
to deal with the elevator.

739
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:12,212
Did you get the people out?

740
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,479
Yeah, the repairman's
on the way.

741
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,081
It'll shouldn't be
more than an hour.

742
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:17,518
'Where there two sets of doors?'

743
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:18,619
Yeah. Could you get your body

744
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:19,853
in here when I get it opened?

745
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:20,987
Doug, I can't. I gotta bag her.

746
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:23,123
Reach in! Get your body in here.

747
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,290
‐ Right there.
‐ Alright.

748
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,992
‐ Hang on.
‐ Ah!

749
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,493
‐ Watch your knee. Go.
‐ I got it.

750
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:29,495
Hang on, alright,
we've got two and a half feet

751
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,264
short of the floor.

752
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,399
‐ Hang on.
‐ Doug!

753
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:35,201
There's gotta be
a latch up here.

754
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:36,637
Doug, come down from there.
What if it starts to moves?

755
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,271
Well, you don't have
to worry about commitment.

756
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:41,141
‐ I'm serious, Doug.
‐ I got it. Right there.

757
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,577
‐ 'Oh.'
‐ Pull it. Give me another pull.

758
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,279
‐ 'What's that?'
‐ Oh, man.

759
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,348
It's not the EKG.
It's her pulse ox.

760
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:50,651
‐ How's her oxygen?
‐ The O2 sat's down to 89.

761
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,219
Oh, God! Sophie? Sophie?

762
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,155
‐ Alright, I got it.
‐ She's unresponsive!

763
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:57,658
‐ 'Anybody in there?'
‐ Yeah, here.

764
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,626
We got a little girl in here!

765
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,161
Got that? Okay.

766
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,129
Hold that there. We need oxygen!

767
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,198
‐ Get us out of here!
‐ We don't have time! Let's go!

768
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,134
'Get that box out,
we need oxygen right away.'

769
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:10,003
‐ Got it?
‐ Yeah.

770
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,507
Doug, it's not gonna
go any further than that!

771
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,042
Come on! Yeah,
It's gonna work. Hang on.

772
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:17,143
Watch your fingers. Hang on.

773
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:18,378
‐ Alright.
‐ Ouch.

774
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:19,445
‐ You alright?
‐ Yeah.

775
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,947
Okay, hang on.

776
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:23,183
Hold it, hold it
right there. Try this.

777
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:27,387
‐ Alright.
‐ It's not gonna open.

778
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,923
It's gonna open!

779
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,191
Come here.
Guys get your hands in here.

780
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,559
Grab hold!

781
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:34,060
Uh, alright, guys.

782
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:37,097
One, two, three!

783
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:42,135
‐ She needs oxygen!
‐ Got it. Got it.

784
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,438
Hook her up.

785
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:46,607
Go.

786
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,545
Ah! Here's our
little action hero.

787
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,179
How does it look?

788
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:55,616
Like ground beef. No, actually
more like chopped liver.

789
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:57,518
Yeah, but you think we have
a chance for limb salvage?

790
00:31:57,551 --> 00:32:00,386
You want my honest opinion?
No, I don't think you do.

791
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,955
Well, I'd like
to give it our best shot.

792
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:04,991
You got it, Lizzie.
No holds barred. 110 percent.

793
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,630
‐ Can you feel this?
‐ Ah, it's kind of numb.

794
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,164
Is that bad?

795
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:13,166
Well, It means
the leg is getting tense.

796
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,035
I've got to measure
the internal pressure.

797
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:17,971
Transducer's up in the ER.
HazMat will never find it.

798
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:20,140
Alright, well,
then I need an 18‐gauge needle

799
00:32:20,173 --> 00:32:22,643
IV tubing and a BP manometer.

800
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:25,145
You got it.

801
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:28,615
Then I watched them put you
on a gurney and give you oxygen.

802
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:30,150
Then what happened?

803
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:32,653
They moved me from
a yellow room to a green room.

804
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:34,487
That would be Trauma 2.

805
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:37,223
But where was I at that time?

806
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:39,159
Well, then they brought
you into the yellow room.

807
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:40,994
That's where they
removed all of your clothes

808
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:43,429
and put them
into a plastic bag.

809
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,268
‐ Two more to go.
‐ What about the ER?

810
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:49,636
It's gonna take awhile.

811
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,038
Is there a doctor around?

812
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:53,774
‐ Yeah, right here.
‐ It's kinda hard to breathe.

813
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,676
‐ I'll be right with you
‐ No. Suits only.

814
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,710
Suit me up. He's in trouble.

815
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:58,178
Even if you were certified

816
00:32:58,211 --> 00:32:59,646
it'd take you
15 minutes to suit up.

817
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,415
‐ He'll be out before that.
‐ Doc, do something!

818
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,417
You're not gonna let me
in there? This guy could die.

819
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,753
‐ Mike, give him oxygen!
‐ Morrie!

820
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:08,755
He's not talking,
doc, do something!

821
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:10,657
Get me an airway kit now!

822
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:12,058
Give him
a little more minute, doc.

823
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:14,194
You can tube him
as soon as he comes out.

824
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:18,098
'Morrie! Morrie!

825
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:21,067
'Help him!'

826
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:23,203
'Do something! Help him!'

827
00:33:23,236 --> 00:33:26,673
‐ That's pretty stupid.
‐ 'Do something for Morrie!'

828
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:28,041
'Morrie!'

829
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:33,246
He's dirty now. Let him do it.

830
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,449
‐ Anybody here an EMT?
‐ I'm a medic.

831
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:39,119
‐ You bag him when I'm done.
‐ You got it.

832
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,431
I'm in.

833
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,433
‐ Scrub him.
‐ Let's go, doc.

834
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:55,636
‐ Let's go.
‐ Wait.

835
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,408
'Dr. Carter. Dr. Carter.
Come in, Dr. Carter.'

836
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:04,210
Whoa‐whoa‐whoa,
I need to talk to her.

837
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:06,279
I got you covered, doc.

838
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:20,093
How's he doing?

839
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:22,829
He's picking up. Looks good.

840
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:24,330
Great.

841
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:34,641
‐ 60‐70.
‐ Wh‐what does that mean?

842
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:35,742
Uh, the pressure's too high

843
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,277
from the bleeding
inside your leg.

844
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,845
‐ We need to operate to‐‐
‐ Dr. Benton.

845
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,147
Dr. Del Amico, I
need you over here.

846
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,716
Jerry, book a room!

847
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,417
Charging to 200.

848
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,552
Clear!

849
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:46,587
Still in fib.

850
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,322
Alright, charge to 300.

851
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:50,490
Clear!

852
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:54,628
'Can we take him inside?'

853
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:56,830
Uh, in a minute.

854
00:34:56,863 --> 00:34:58,532
Hey, what about my shoes?

855
00:34:58,565 --> 00:35:00,500
Ernie, take care
of Dr. Carter.

856
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:04,304
SAT's up to 98.

857
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:05,639
He's waking up.

858
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:07,741
Yeah, sounds pretty good.

859
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:09,910
I think you're gonna
be okay, Morris.

860
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,311
Dr. Carter?

861
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:13,647
No, man, real shoes.

862
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,315
Malik.

863
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:16,750
‐ Help us move him inside.
‐ 'Hold up a minute.'

864
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:18,652
They're coding some old lady
in the cafeteria.

865
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:30,764
Chuny, I said charge
it to 360, let's go.

866
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:31,832
Wait a second
it takes time.

867
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:33,800
The battery's
low, okay.

868
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:34,935
Alright.

869
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,870
Clear!

870
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:39,305
Asystole, how long
we've been at this?

871
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:40,541
18 minutes.

872
00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:41,908
She never had a rhythm,
never had a pulse.

873
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:45,178
That's it.

874
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:46,647
Time of death, 22:09.

875
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,615
Peter, OR's ready
for Krakowski.

876
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,350
Uh, I've got a
fasciotomy, alright.

877
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:52,352
See if you can
find her family.

878
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:53,554
Did that lady just die?

879
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:54,688
I mean, is she dead?

880
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:59,325
Oh, then, they're not gonna
leave her there, are they?

881
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,627
Alright, where are
the pre‐op labs?

882
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,829
‐ Right here.
‐ How long will I be in a cast?

883
00:36:02,863 --> 00:36:05,532
Four to six weeks.

884
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:06,600
Anna's running the code?

885
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,869
Yeah, but you know
what we just..

886
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:11,938
Five rounds of epi,
two of atropine

887
00:36:11,972 --> 00:36:13,039
lidocaine..

888
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,412
Uh, bretylium,
amiodarone..

889
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:20,714
I should've had
her up in the ICU.

890
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,683
'Wouldn't have made
a difference.'

891
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:23,884
Might've.

892
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:25,919
No, you turned this
place into an ICU.

893
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:29,322
This isn't an ICU.

894
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,357
This is just something
we threw together.

895
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:36,563
She was strong, this
shouldn't have happened.

896
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:37,631
Take a look at her chart

897
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:39,566
inoperable triple vessel
disease.

898
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,435
'It was only a
matter of time.'

899
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:45,806
Mr. Arteburn, you okay?

900
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,675
Dizzy, very dizzy.

901
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,310
Supraventricular tachycardia.

902
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:51,678
'Adenosine, uh..'

903
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:53,647
‐ Six milligrams IV.
‐ We don't have any.

904
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,281
Jerry, run to the
pharmacy we need it.

905
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:58,418
Carter, do you need some help?

906
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:00,821
Jeanie, see if you can
help out Dr. Weaver there.

907
00:37:00,854 --> 00:37:02,656
‐ Take it easy.
‐ Pulse is weak, and thready.

908
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:04,925
Any chest pain,
Mr. Arteburn?

909
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,960
We can't wait for the Adenosine.
We gotta cardiovert.

910
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,262
Uh, Lily, grab a crash cart.

911
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:12,298
Let's get him into
trendelenburg.

912
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:13,800
I'll try carotid
sinus massage.

913
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:14,968
‐ Yosh.
‐ Yeah.

914
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:16,002
‐ Can you get a BP?
‐ Got it.

915
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:17,337
Lily, charge to 100.

916
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,439
Mr. Arteburn? Mr. Arteburn!

917
00:37:19,472 --> 00:37:20,541
‐ He's unresponsive.
‐ Come on, Lily.

918
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,275
‐ Give me those paddles.
‐ I can't.

919
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:23,777
‐ The battery's dead.
‐ I'll find an extension cord.

920
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,945
No, no, wait, there's
an outlet, right there.

921
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:26,379
Help me push it
to the wall.

922
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,514
'Move that gurney
out of the way.'

923
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:28,882
'BP's 60 palp.'

924
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,016
He's not moving much air.

925
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,384
'I got to tube him.'

926
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:35,055
Carter! Carter!

927
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,590
'Jeanie, get ready
to start CPR.'

928
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:38,925
I need an intubation tray.

929
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:42,295
Carter!

930
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:43,597
Lily, as soon
as you get power

931
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,298
we need to move him
against the wall.

932
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,333
Get over here, Carter.
John, I need you to bag him.

933
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,536
Almost ready.

934
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,505
Hold that.

935
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:08,321
Normal sinus rhythm.

936
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:09,355
What the hell are you people

937
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:10,957
doing to me? Give me a towel.

938
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:12,759
You passed out from an
abnormal heart rhythm.

939
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:14,094
We had to treat you
right away.

940
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,663
‐ By drowning me?
‐ The diving reflex.

941
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:19,600
It slows the heart down,
breaks the tachycardia.

942
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,935
You call this is the
highest standard of care?

943
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,070
Get my...get my doctor
on the phone now.

944
00:38:24,104 --> 00:38:25,606
I got the adenosine.

945
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,007
We're okay.

946
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,609
I'll meet you in recovery
in a few minutes.

947
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:29,910
I want to be there
when he comes around.

948
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:30,944
‐ Alright.
‐ Okay?

949
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:33,747
‐ Yes.
‐ Elizabeth.

950
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,015
Hello, Peter.

951
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:37,450
I'll be right there.

952
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,653
Oh, your eye
looks worse.

953
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:41,888
It's nothing, I'm sure it looks
nastier than it really is.

954
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:43,389
Uh, let me have
a look anyway.

955
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:45,726
You could have,
uh, hyphema.

956
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,897
So, I heard about
the big rescue.

957
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:52,633
Uh‐huh.

958
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,467
You were under a
collapsed building?

959
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,436
Yep, went to a lot
to avoid an amputation

960
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:58,972
but we had to take
his arm anyway.

961
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,006
‐ Esk, ow!
‐ Okay?

962
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,709
‐ You okay.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

963
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:06,146
I have to tell Leo about
his arm when he wakes up.

964
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,649
What about you?
You on call tonight?

965
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:09,850
I've got a fasciotomy.

966
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:12,385
After that, I'm free.

967
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:13,754
I could do with
some debriefing.

968
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:19,760
Take a deep breath in.
Now blow out.

969
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,395
Good.

970
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:23,429
Can we get a blood gas

971
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,464
in about 20 minutes.

972
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:27,133
Throat's sore.

973
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,102
‐ Give her some water.
‐ Yeah, here you go.

974
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,040
That was pretty
scary, wasn't it?

975
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:36,810
No, no, we do that kind
of thing here every day.

976
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:38,979
No, you were scared.

977
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:41,782
Tell the truth.

978
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:42,949
Yeah, I was pretty scared.

979
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:44,885
I was really scared.

980
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:48,522
Honey, I've been
looking all over for you.

981
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,525
‐ Is she okay?
‐ Yeah, she's fine.

982
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,493
I heard about the fumes.

983
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,095
‐ 'Was she exposed?'
‐ She was on a ventilator.

984
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:56,630
So her lungs weren't exposed.

985
00:39:56,663 --> 00:39:58,665
‐ She was never in any danger?
‐ No, mom.

986
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:03,704
They took really
good care of me.

987
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:08,642
‐ Excuse me, the ER.
‐ Mm‐hmm, okay.

988
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:10,511
Dr. Lemley, if you'll..

989
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:11,912
I'll come back, and check
up on your lil' bit.

990
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:13,514
You're in good
hands so, okay?

991
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:14,681
‐ Thank you.
‐ You're welcome.

992
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:17,083
Carol, hey.

993
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:20,020
You know, we should get pharmacy
to restock the drug box.

994
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:21,487
Sure.

995
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:22,923
So, you still mad at me
about this morning?

996
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:24,658
I was mad?

997
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:26,126
You accused me
of spying on you.

998
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,493
I never said that.

999
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:28,629
That's what you meant.

1000
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:29,830
No, I was annoyed.

1001
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:31,532
You don't need
to check up on me.

1002
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:32,666
I wasn't.

1003
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:36,937
I just wanted to see
you last night.

1004
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,739
Me, too.

1005
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,708
So we shouldn't let that
happen too often, should we?

1006
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:42,909
Well, I actually think
we shouldn't let

1007
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:44,845
that happen
at all, but..

1008
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,684
Here goes nothing.

1009
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,560
Okay, Mr. Arteburn

1010
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:37,063
let's put you down
into curtain one.

1011
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:40,801
Lily, take Manny, and
put him in curtain two.

1012
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:43,704
‐ Chuny, Morris, 2‐B.
‐ Carter.

1013
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:46,206
'Carter, I can
take it from here.'

1014
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,809
Anna, take the sickest
patients and put

1015
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:50,677
them in the trauma rooms
and curtain three.

1016
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:52,012
‐ Got it.
‐ Hey, Jeanie.

1017
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:54,114
I‐I like you, and Jerry
to update the board, and

1018
00:41:54,147 --> 00:41:55,315
get the phones back
where they belong.

1019
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:57,117
‐ You okay?
‐ Yeah, I'm fine.

1020
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,187
Uh, Carter, I spoke with Harriet
Spooner, the incident commander

1021
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,924
and I'd like to thank
you for helping me out.

1022
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:06,126
And, uh, the administration
would like you

1023
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,994
to speak with the press.

1024
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,830
'We'll meet them
together in the'

1025
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,933
'first floor conference
room at 11:15.'

1026
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:15,068
Well, in terms of dealing
with these people

1027
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:17,671
I think I've had a
little more experience.

1028
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:21,074
You know, it‐it's important
that the emphasis‐‐

1029
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:24,144
Nope! Morris get's that vent!

1030
00:42:24,177 --> 00:42:27,914
It's important that the
emphasis, emphasis be placed

1031
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:29,816
on the institutional
response to the crisis

1032
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,018
as opposed to any
individual act which they

1033
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:34,087
would tend
to sensationalize.

1034
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,990
I think it's best
to say, simply that we

1035
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:39,893
'followed a well‐rehearsed
disaster plan, and'

1036
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:41,662
'worked in concert
with the HazMat team'

1037
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,697
'to ensure the safety
of our patients'

1038
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,866
and also of the medical staff.

1039
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:48,635
Carter, the fire captain wants
to speak with you outside.

1040
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,036
Oh, right.
Uh, 11:15?

1041
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,838
‐ That's right.
‐ I'll be there.

1042
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:54,675
Dr. Weaver, I've looked at
some of the causative factors

1043
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:57,277
and I believe that I can
now identify those at blame.

1044
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,945
Jerry, what are
you talking about?

1045
00:42:58,979 --> 00:43:02,148
Well, I've been on night's,
and during that time

1046
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:04,217
the day unit service
coordinators have

1047
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,820
really let the central
work area deteriorate.

1048
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:09,222
Jerry, this was
a chemical spill.

1049
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,858
Yes, and‐and we were
impaired because we were

1050
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:14,394
unable to find this
important manual.

1051
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:16,930
I'm just saying that now
that I'm back on days

1052
00:43:16,963 --> 00:43:18,732
you can count on a higher
level of efficiency

1053
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:20,233
at the central work area.

1054
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:22,936
If you pass out again I'll have
everything under control.

1055
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,744
'Dr. Carter.'

1056
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:31,978
Want these back?

1057
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:34,981
'No. Souvenir.'

1058
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:37,183
So, how do you think your
people handled things?

1059
00:43:37,217 --> 00:43:39,886
Oh, pretty good.

1060
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,689
No, it was a
total disaster.

1061
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,357
You guys were caught
with your pants down.

1062
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,694
But, uh, you, you
personally did okay

1063
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:50,030
under the circumstances.

1064
00:43:50,063 --> 00:43:51,297
I think you're the
guy to work with

1065
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:53,867
on a schedule
of disaster drills.

1066
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,169
Oh, I don't have that
kind of authority.

1067
00:43:56,202 --> 00:43:58,371
I'm, uh, just an intern.

1068
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:01,808
You had me fooled.

1069
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:03,109
You should talk
to our chief of staff.

1070
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:12,318
It was good
working with you.

1071
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,963
‐ Hey, Carter.
‐ Hey!

1072
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,030
'When did you get back?'

1073
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:25,231
Came straight
from the airport.

1074
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:27,300
I'm on in five minutes.

1075
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:30,136
It's good to see you.
How's your mom?

1076
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,939
She's doing better.

1077
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,008
What's with the boots?

1078
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,977
It's kind of a long story.
