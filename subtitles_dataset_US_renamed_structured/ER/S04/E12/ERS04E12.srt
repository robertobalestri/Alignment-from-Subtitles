1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,307
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,474
We're gonna take care
of you.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,210
‐ Oh, God.
‐ What?

4
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,078
Are you questioning
my commitment

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,313
to this patient's
best interests?

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,681
‐ I got it under control.
‐ Yeah.

7
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,049
So does every
street junkie that I see

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,584
that comes
through this place.

9
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,119
Greg Powell. I'm the paramedic
who brought in the boy

10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,654
who got stuck
in the chimney.

11
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,355
If you don't let me draw some
blood the easy way

12
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:24,224
They'll get every nurse
in here to hold you down

13
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,425
and they'll draw it
the hard way.

14
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,428
He simply wants to keep
an eye on me.

15
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,796
Don't you, Dr. Benton?

16
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,673
Whew! Hey. I hope that's not
all you're wearing.

17
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,842
It's got to be
ten below out there.

18
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,477
What?

19
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,613
How you hide all that
hair in that hat.

20
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,114
Must be the Eighth
Wonder of the world.

21
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,315
Oh, you laugh away, Elvis.

22
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,153
I can't believe they give me
the coldest day of the year

23
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,588
to do my paramedic
ride‐along.

24
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,157
I'm going to go
regrout the tub

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,125
and then I'm gonna
watch some daytime TV.

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,627
Springer's doing a special

27
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,396
on teens impregnated
by transvestites.

28
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:04,831
‐ Get out of here.
‐ Alright.

29
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,100
‐ Dearborn and Clark. 5 o'clock.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

30
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,468
‐ I wrote it down.
‐ Okay. Fine.

31
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,103
You know, I really
hate surprises.

32
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,738
I'd‐I'd like for you to
tell me what it is.

33
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,340
You know, I can't 'cause
I really love surprises.

34
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,110
Alright, then.
Dearborn and Clark at 5 o'clock.

35
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,679
‐ Okay. Hey.
‐ Hmm?

36
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,448
Say it.

37
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,817
Say what?

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,752
You know what I..

39
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,387
What I always say first.
You say it.

40
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:31,825
‐ I love you.
‐ Sounds good to me.

41
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,463
‐ Is that Scott Anspaugh's CT?
‐ It sure is.

42
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,865
‐ Hey, Jeanie.
‐ Hi.

43
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,366
I'm Dr. Romano.
I don't believe we've met.

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,135
Are you new
to the surgical service?

45
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,137
I'm Jeanie Boulet, I'm a
physician assistant in the ER.

46
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,739
I didn't know you were involved
in this case.

47
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,207
It's the chief
staff's kid, Peter.

48
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,709
Everybody wants
to get involved.

49
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,177
Dr. Anspaugh requested
I start all of Scott's lines.

50
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,713
Anspaugh's no fool.

51
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,380
You start more lines
with sugar.

52
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,252
‐ So, what's the verdict?
‐ He's obstructed.

53
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,188
‐ He's gonna need surgery.
‐ Oh, man.

54
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,489
‐ Thanks.
‐ Hey!

55
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,358
Can I get a decaf
from you?

56
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,293
Decaf? It's 7:30
in the morning.

57
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,562
I've been so jumpy
the last couple of days.

58
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,430
Any caffeine, I think
I'd blow an aneurysm.

59
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,632
That's a lovely thought.

60
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,199
Want to sit
somewhere else?

61
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,701
‐ It's the smoking section.
‐ Oh.

62
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,269
Fell off the gum wagon,
did you?

63
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,904
Ah, don't start.

64
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:18,905
Wouldn't dream of it.

65
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,676
What's up? You're
making me nervous.

66
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,514
‐ This.
‐ Ah, you shouldn't have.

67
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,850
Open it up.
Open that up.

68
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,252
When'd you guys
pick these out?

69
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,354
We didn't.

70
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,590
I'm gonna surprise her.
I told her to meet me downtown

71
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,825
this afternoon, and then, uh,
she and I are gonna go

72
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,595
to the clerk's office and get
a marriage license.

73
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,729
That is a surprise.

74
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,498
I just want
to show her I'm serious.

75
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,367
Well, sounds like
a big night.

76
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,336
And then I'm gonna
get a, uh, uh, a limo

77
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,373
and we're going to
the Ironhedge Lodge in Dundee

78
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,576
and then, at one minute
after midnight

79
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,243
the, uh, the
Justice of the Peace

80
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,478
will perform the ceremony.

81
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,581
‐ That sounds great.
‐ Yeah.

82
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,949
Now, alright,
what would make it perfect

83
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,219
is if, uh, if you would agree
to be the best man.

84
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,222
‐ You think you have to ask?
‐ Yeah?

85
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,657
‐ Yeah, I'd be honored.
‐ You'd do that?

86
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,893
What do you think?

87
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,895
Oh, I can't believe this.

88
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,497
Every other woman I ever went
out with, it was just..

89
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,232
You know, I..
I‐I knew it was wrong.

90
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,234
And now I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with her

91
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,370
and...I'd, um,
I'm talking like an idiot here.

92
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,006
You're acting like someone
who's going to be a husband

93
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,808
tomorrow morning.

94
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,909
A husband.
Can you imagine that?

95
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,299
Hey, Carol!

96
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,333
You ready to go?

97
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,035
Yeah. Here,
let me help you.

98
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,070
What have you got here?

99
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,872
Saline, gauze, et cetera.

100
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,507
Got the fisheye
from some guy

101
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,908
at the admit desk,
but he didn't say anything.

102
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,043
Yeah, I know. It's the
same with the clinic.

103
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,912
County supplies
are County supplies.

104
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,581
Everyone else,
back off.

105
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,783
Whew! You got
the heat going in here?

106
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,619
Yeah, but Powell's got dibs
on music selection till noon.

107
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,689
Doris doesn't appreciate
quality musical entertainment.

108
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,490
I didn't know
you two rode together.

109
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,993
Usually we don't. I guess I just
woke up blessed this morning.

110
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,996
‐ Greg Powell, right?
‐ Good memory, Nurse Hathaway.

111
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,467
What have we got?

112
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,036
Lower right quadrant pain
with vaginal bleeding.

113
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,871
She's shocky. BP's 50 palp.

114
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,673
Gave two liters
of saline in the field.

115
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,975
Alright, let's go. Let's get a
CBC, type and cross match.

116
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,476
Six units to start.

117
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,945
Looks like a
ruptured ectopic.

118
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,848
Let's get her
to the OR right now!

119
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,583
Aren't you guys from Lady
of Pity catchment area?

120
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:17,951
Yeah.

121
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,686
Is there a reason you endangered
this woman's life

122
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,454
by bringing her
all the way to County?

123
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,690
It was a damn good reason.
Lady of Pity's ER is closed.

124
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,125
You guys are the closest
receiving hospital.

125
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,392
Yeah, that's ten minutes
right there.

126
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,828
Tell me
about it.

127
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,996
‐ Here's the O‐neg!
‐ Alright, hang two units.

128
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,932
She's hypovolemic.

129
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,642
Who's fighting?

130
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,777
I'm Spinal,
and that's Sabre Wulf.

131
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,580
I was doing okay,
but then he sabre‐stomped me.

132
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,049
Oh, he did
the fireball. I'm dead.

133
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,985
Hey, I want to talk to you
about the surgery.

134
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,854
My dad already talked
all that noise.

135
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,056
I know. Would you give me
a hand here?

136
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,758
I just want to talk to you
about it, too.

137
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,497
The tumor you had
last year is back.

138
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,567
'And they need to operate
again to remove it.'

139
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,068
I'm not having
any more operations.

140
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,905
‐ I know you're scared.
‐ 'I'm not scared.'

141
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,541
Just sick of all their crap.

142
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,710
"This is the last one,
Scotty."

143
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,878
"Got it all, Scotty."

144
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,513
Yeah.

145
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,416
Hey, if you don't have this
surgery, you're gonna die.

146
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,718
Good.
I'd rather die.

147
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,489
Okay.

148
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,891
Guess I'll have
to find someone else to share

149
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,927
my rinkside Blackhawks‐Islanders
tickets with then.

150
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,763
Nice try.
Like you're a hockey fan.

151
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,665
What, girls can't like
bone‐crushing

152
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,801
high‐sticking action?

153
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,436
Okay, who's Tony Esposito?

154
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,941
Blackhawk's goalie. Vezina
trophy winner...'70 and '72.

155
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,676
‐ Not bad.
‐ Yeah.

156
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,779
What do you care, though? I
mean, you're fixing to die, so..

157
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,147
So, you really got
those tickets?

158
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,552
'Post‐op, day two.'

159
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,621
Wound is granulating well
without drainage.

160
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,056
‐ Afebrile on cefotetan.
‐ Okay.

161
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,224
Next.

162
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,126
Lizzie! Long time, no see.

163
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,662
Oh, Dr. Romano.
Did you get my message?

164
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,030
I wanted to see
if I could be excused

165
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,898
from the Anspaugh
tumor resection.

166
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,900
And why would
that be, doctor?

167
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,235
I'd like to assist
Dr. Kotlowitz

168
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,904
on Allison's vocal cord surgery
this afternoon.

169
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,040
No problem. Never
had you scheduled

170
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,875
to work with me
in the first place.

171
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,544
But my name was on the board.

172
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,945
I thought since so much
of your energies

173
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,613
have been going towards head
and neck surgery

174
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,148
that you were considering
changing specialties.

175
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,717
Of course not.
It's only this case.

176
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,118
You have nothing
to worry about, sweetheart.

177
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,920
I taught her
everything she knows.

178
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,921
'Next.'

179
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:40,160
Ellis! Is it true Lady
of Pity's ER is closed?

180
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,596
No, no, not closed, uh,
but they're not accepting

181
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,030
paramedic traffic right now.

182
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,132
Well, critical cases don't
tend to be walk‐ins.

183
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,034
No. What's
the matter, Kerry?

184
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,537
I just had a 29‐year‐old woman
nearly bleed out

185
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,905
because she was in the back
of an ambulance

186
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,907
for 15 minutes longer
than was necessary.

187
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,175
That's a bad situation.
As a matter of fact

188
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,943
it's cases like hers
that forced SPG

189
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,745
to reconfigure
our Lady of Pity ER.

190
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,514
I don't understand.

191
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,282
Well, they had a substandard
trauma panel

192
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,218
and neurosurgical
coverage was spotty at best.

193
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,087
As soon as we can
get some new docs

194
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,155
and upgrade their equipment,
they should be back up at 100%.

195
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,624
Yeah, how soon
will that be?

196
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,025
I don't know.
sooner the better.

197
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,193
More importantly,
how's your patient?

198
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,995
‐ Is she okay?
‐ She'll probably live.

199
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,030
She had the best medical care
in the world. That's why.

200
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,199
She was lucky. That's why.

201
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,068
Mr. Dwyer, we're ready
to start the procedure.

202
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,269
‐ Is that a toothpick?
‐ Dr. Carter.

203
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,838
Yes, it is,
but in your case

204
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,107
this is a state of the art
medical device.

205
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,275
We think you may have
contracted dracunculosis

206
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,577
from the river water.

207
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,612
Dracun..
What?

208
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,213
Uh...guinea worm.

209
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,315
It's native to North Africa
and Middle East.

210
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,217
You get it from drinking
contaminated water.

211
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,852
It moves through
your system for months

212
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,687
and then lays its eggs
below your skin there.

213
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,322
Oh, wait, wait wait.

214
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,591
A worm has been crawling
through me for almost a year?

215
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,992
Yep.

216
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,293
Why didn't the other doctors
didn't catch this?

217
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,895
Well, it presents
like an abscess.

218
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,964
When you had it drained,
it only made it worse.

219
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,301
‐ Wh‐what's to be done?
‐ Controlled removal.

220
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,305
Ow.

221
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,341
‐ 'Ow!'
‐ Sorry.

222
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,877
Harrison says these babies grow
to be a meter long.

223
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,014
I really didn't need
to hear that.

224
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,716
I got about two centimeters.

225
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,284
Toothpick, please.

226
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,687
And a length of tape.

227
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,189
Oh‐ho‐ho. Okay. You want
to keep that tape down

228
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,593
and then come back daily
to, uh, continue the extraction.

229
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,261
I got to catch a 6:00 a. m.
flight to Cairo.

230
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,996
Why can't you just yank it out?

231
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,165
Because if we pull out more than
two centimeters a day

232
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,800
it'll break off.

233
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,169
I gotta put it for Combat Pay.

234
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,237
Hey, John.

235
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,106
‐ Anna.
‐ Hi, Chase.

236
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,776
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ I feel nauseous.

237
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,611
I remembered
a couple Thanksgivings ago

238
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,046
when we had bad pheasants and
you hooked everybody up with

239
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,015
uh, whatever that was.

240
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,751
‐ Compazine.
‐ It worked like a charm.

241
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,320
I‐I thought you could
give me a script.

242
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,090
Excuse me
for a second.

243
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,858
Come here.

244
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,394
Now, I know that you didn't
just drive all the way over here

245
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,698
from the loop
to get Compazine.

246
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,100
This isn't exactly the thing you
bring to the company nurse.

247
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,868
Why? Oh, 'cause you don't want
your mom and dad

248
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,169
to find out that you've
been shooting heroin.

249
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,338
I'm‐I'm not.

250
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,874
I mean, I..

251
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,811
I stopped two nights ago,
and I just, I..

252
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,713
I need something
to get over the hump.

253
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,980
Well, if you need Compazine
to get over the hump

254
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,415
then you're in withdrawal.

255
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,250
So, why don't you go upstairs
to the cafeteria

256
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,219
have a cup of coffee and I'll
go and I'll do the paperwork

257
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,253
and I'll get you
into a detox center.

258
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,022
You're overreacting.

259
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,990
Listen, you could have gone
to any doctor in this city

260
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,325
but you didn't,
you came to me.

261
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,127
I think you're
asking for my help.

262
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,195
I think you've read
too many 12‐step pamphlets‐‐

263
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,897
No, I can't even help you. If
you're gonna slam the door‐‐

264
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,433
No, you can help me.
You just choose not to.

265
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,801
Thank you!

266
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,438
Best thing you can do
is let him go.

267
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,941
Pardon me?

268
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,678
Sorry.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

269
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,179
It's just that a friend
of mine in med school

270
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,915
had a drug problem,
and I've had this conversation

271
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,084
more times than you
could ever imagine.

272
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,953
I appreciate your concern,
but I can handle this.

273
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,454
I know.
You don't want to talk.

274
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,090
But, uh, don't let him drag you
into this. He's gonna try.

275
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,059
I'm not going to get
dragged into anything.

276
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,226
Excuse me.

277
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,768
Cajun tofu gumbo.

278
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,903
And don't make
that face.

279
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:13,206
Whatever happened to beef stew
and five‐alarm chili?

280
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,741
Olbes is macrobiotic

281
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,342
Audia's trying to lose
his holiday pounds

282
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,144
me and Zadro are doing
that zone diet.

283
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,846
‐ Do you have any kings?
‐ Go fish.

284
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,314
I knew I should have taken
the PD exam.

285
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,217
Hoagies and donuts.
Those guys know how to eat.

286
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,486
‐ You have any tens?
‐ Uh, yes.

287
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,290
Carol, please, tell me
that you're a real American.

288
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,458
Red meat,
the occasional brewski.

289
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,927
I have to admit,
I'm not a really big fan

290
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,461
of nuts and berries.

291
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,964
You hear that, man? Now, that's
the voice of common sense.

292
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,099
Well, Mickey D's
is right up the street.

293
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,433
No one's
keeping you here.

294
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,368
Although I have to say,
Zadro brought by

295
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,370
some incredible
flourless carob brownies.

296
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,872
They were...good.

297
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,241
Carob. Ca..

298
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,876
Why bother, bro?

299
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,245
Powell, you really
are a caveman. Eights?

300
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,114
That's us.

301
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,017
'...68‐year‐old woman..'

302
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,086
More, uh, tofu for you there,
big daddy.

303
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,025
You know, I had a lumpectomy
and a lap choly on my schedule

304
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,527
before this,
but when Anspaugh says

305
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,529
jump,
I say, "Sieg heil."

306
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,765
'I'm gonna transect the ileum
with a GIA stapler'

307
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:16,102
reinforce the staple lines
with 4‐0 silk lembert sutures.

308
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,171
Reinforcing the staple lines.
That's very thorough.

309
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,074
Your British colleague is not
always so detail oriented.

310
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,909
I haven't noticed that
to be true.

311
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,111
No question, her baby blues
would look at damn sight better

312
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,081
over this bowel than your mug,
but you know female surgeons.

313
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,283
No, I don't.
Why don't you tell me.

314
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,484
Always something to prove.

315
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,419
Often at the expense
of the case at hand.

316
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,021
One of the things
I like about you, Peter.

317
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,057
You're not one of those
militant minorities.

318
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,427
Dr. Romano, we have the results
of the frozen section.

319
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,462
'B‐cell lymphoma?'

320
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,164
‐ Yes.
‐ Oh, damn.

321
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,532
I knew it.

322
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,868
Well, someone's gonna have
to tell Anspaugh

323
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,302
and I am voting
for you, Peter.

324
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,176
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Oh, hi.

325
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,911
Uh, uh, Dr. Weaver,
glad you could join us.

326
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,513
I was just explaining
to Dr. Ruiz here

327
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,281
about our plan to pursue
industrial contracts.

328
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,249
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

329
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,851
Uh, sure, sure.

330
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,353
I'm sorry. The ER
doesn't stop for lunch.

331
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,089
So, why don't you go on up,
take a seat

332
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,524
and we'll join you
as soon as we can.

333
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,358
Thanks.
What's up?

334
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,027
I've been doing
a little research

335
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,962
and it seems SPG
has closed down

336
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,231
60% of their trauma
centers in the Midwest.

337
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,265
‐ What is that?
‐ Where'd you hear that?

338
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,034
It's on the internet.

339
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,069
Well, if you had questions,
I wish you'd come to me‐‐

340
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,872
You know, I did.
You gave me the party line.

341
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,407
Well, since I don't know
where you got your figures

342
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,042
I can't address them
specifically

343
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,045
but what I can say
is that a 60% downgrade rate

344
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,180
taken by itself doesn't reflect
our reconfiguration strategy.

345
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,550
You know what, Ellis, it's me.
You can speak English.

346
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,284
Okay, let me give you
an example.

347
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,221
Kellogg Memorial
in Detroit

348
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,356
was a shambles
as an acute care facility.

349
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,091
Now it's a nationally
recognized hernia center.

350
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,426
Yeah, that doesn't
do you much good

351
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,460
if you've got
a stab wound to the chest.

352
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,095
Neither does a hospital

353
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,631
bankrupted by unreimbursed
trauma care.

354
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,933
So, emergency care is only
for people who can pay for‐‐

355
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,167
No, come on. Now you're trying
to twist my words.

356
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,368
Yeah, you know,
you're avoiding my‐‐

357
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,505
I'm not avoiding
your questions.

358
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:02,108
Look, if you're worried
about County, don't.

359
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,644
Trust me,
you guys are essential.

360
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,512
‐ You're not going anywhere.
‐ How could we?

361
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:09,282
If everyone else closes, someone
needs to handle the Trauma.

362
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,985
‐ Are you going to lunch?
‐ No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

363
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,255
What to pick, what to pick.

364
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,190
Oh. Um, Dr. Carter, you got
a couple of messages.

365
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,559
From who?

366
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,627
Um, they were all from your
Cousin Chase.

367
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,295
He says you can call
in your prescription

368
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,597
at De Gooyer's
pharmacy on Randolph.

369
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,131
Unbelievable.

370
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,001
Carter, I need your John Hancock
on this, please.

371
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,370
‐ Hey, Malik.
‐ 'Hey, Jeanie, what's up?'

372
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,605
You still got that friend
at startime tickets?

373
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,339
Yeah. Rosco.
Sure. What you need?

374
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,008
I need a couple of rinkside

375
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,677
Blackhawks‐Islanders tickets
on the 20th.

376
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,046
Uh‐huh. And I want world peace
and a date with Tyra Banks.

377
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,082
I know. No, seriously,
can he get them?

378
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,684
Yeah, you can get them, but you
know that's gonna run you.

379
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,085
That's okay.
Just ask, okay?

380
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,386
Well, if you're living
that phat

381
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,654
I might need to get
a date with you.

382
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,092
Hey, Chase, this is John.
You there? Pick up.

383
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,996
Alright, call me back
when you get this message.

384
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,131
I'm at work.
You know the number.

385
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,033
'So, Allison..'

386
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,337
...see, the two cords on the
screen need to touch and vibrate

387
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,373
in order for you
to regain your voice, hmm?

388
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,711
But, as it is now,
the left one is paralyzed.

389
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,080
So, if you understand me, blink
once for yes, twice for no.

390
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:19,052
Good. Dr. Corday.
You here to observe?

391
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,487
I'm actually here for Allison,
if she doesn't mind.

392
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:24,658
'Oh, fine. I was just
explaining the procedure.'

393
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:29,095
Alright, now I'm going to make
a slight incision

394
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,064
'but you should only
feel a little bit of pressure.'

395
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:32,533
'Okay?'

396
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:38,238
Kerry. Why aren't you at that
big SPG luncheon?

397
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,340
Had some work to do.

398
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:44,077
Well, everything seems to be
trucking right along though.

399
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,648
For the most part, sure but, uh,
this is a big step we're taking.

400
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,984
I agree. Thanks to you, we're
lighting a fire under the board

401
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,318
to institute
some real change.

402
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,754
Yeah, and I think we should
be 100% sure

403
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,990
that turning the ER over
to an outside management group

404
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,025
is what we want to do.

405
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:02,996
‐ Well, isn't it?
‐ On paper, sure.

406
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,197
Is there something
the matter, Kerry?

407
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,032
No. No, not at all.

408
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,602
I just thought we could delay
the board vote a week or two

409
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,703
make sure we have
all our‐‐

410
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,739
‐ Dr. Anspaugh.
‐ Dr. Benton.

411
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,440
How can I help you?

412
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,009
Well, we, um..

413
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,311
We got the results
of, uh, Scott's frozen section.

414
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,347
Alright.

415
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,483
‐ Uh, we can discuss this later.
‐ No, it's fine.

416
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:26,587
Let's see.

417
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,123
There's been a recurrence
of his lymphoma.

418
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,393
Uh‐huh.

419
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,728
'We got everything
that we could see.'

420
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,262
It's hard to know
if we got it all

421
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,198
until we take a look
at the tumor margins.

422
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,335
Do you see
any serosal seeding?

423
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,237
No.

424
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,573
What about infiltration
to the liver or spleen?

425
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,375
No metastasis.

426
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,748
Okay.

427
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,183
Well, continue then, and, uh..

428
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,186
...let me know when, uh..

429
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,188
...Scott is awake.

430
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,724
So, Kerry,
where were we?

431
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,128
Ha! You owe
me a dollar.

432
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,130
No, no, no , no,
I only smoked half a cigarette.

433
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,065
Half a cigarette
is still a cigarette.

434
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,466
You know, at the rate
we're going

435
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,268
we're gonna be
in Club Med by February.

436
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,738
No, that is not true,
because that was my last one

437
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,806
and I'm going back
on the gum tonight.

438
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,508
Oh, you know what I was thinking
we could do tonight?

439
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,643
‐ What?
‐ S'mores.

440
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,477
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Do you remember camp?

441
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,147
Marshmallows,
Graham crackers, chocolate.

442
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,316
I'd love to, but I can't, okay?
I got‐I got to do something.

443
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,652
‐ What?
‐ It's for Doug.

444
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,087
But, uh, maybe Saturday night?
Take a rain check?

445
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,355
‐ I'll bring the marshmallows?
‐ Oh..

446
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,759
‐ Dr. Greene.
‐ What's up, Carter?

447
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,827
I was wondering if I could have
the rest of the shift off?

448
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,663
‐ Why?
‐ It's a family emergency.

449
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,464
‐ Is everything okay?
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah.

450
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,866
Just some things
I need to take care of.

451
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,668
‐ Alright. I'll let Doyle know.
‐ Thanks.

452
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,541
‐ Hey, Carter.
‐ Hey.

453
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,576
'What are you eatin'?'

454
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:59,112
Um...PB and J on wheat.

455
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,313
I thought you were on
until 7:00.

456
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,415
I was.

457
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,085
‐ You feeling okay?
‐ Mm‐hmm. Yeah, fine.

458
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,454
You're leaving in the middle
of your shift.

459
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,456
It's about your cousin,
isn't it?

460
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,525
I know what I'm doing.

461
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,862
You don't look like
you know what you're doing.

462
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,430
And you don't know anything
about my family

463
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,632
so just drop it.

464
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,503
Oh, God!
One more flight!

465
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,538
Apartment 3H!
Oh, hurry, hurry!

466
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,806
'Please hurry!'

467
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,141
In here! In here!
Oh, please!

468
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,543
'Hurry!'

469
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,447
Oh, my God, she's dead.

470
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,883
‐ She's dead.
‐ No! She's not dead.

471
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,418
Are you okay?

472
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,687
‐ Do something!
‐ Some help here.

473
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:42,823
‐ You have to go something!
‐ Some help here.

474
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:43,924
‐ How long have you been here?
‐ 'About five minutes.'

475
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,425
She wasn't breathing.

476
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,893
‐ Get her out of here, will you?
‐ I love you!

477
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:48,394
'I got a faint pulse.
Powell.'

478
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,830
‐ 'Powell!'
‐ 'I'm in, I'm here.'

479
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,265
'Oh, God, no!'

480
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,667
‐ 'I love you, mama!'
‐ Oh, come on.

481
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,368
Let's go.

482
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,470
‐ I'm gonna start an IV.
‐ Let them do their work.

483
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,606
‐ Stand back.
‐ Come on.

484
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,907
Come on, please, please, please.

485
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,543
IV's in.
BP's 60 palp.

486
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,545
‐ Oh, God.
‐ She's in fib.

487
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:05,846
Alright, charge it to 200.

488
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,549
Clear!
Nothing.

489
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:09,916
Come on, damn it!
Come on!

490
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,753
Charging 300! Clear!

491
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,320
‐ Nope.
‐ Again.

492
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,256
Charging 360!
Clear!

493
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,858
Oh, mama. Please, help her.

494
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,960
‐ Nothin'.
‐ Help her, help her, help her.

495
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,328
Come on! Breathe!

496
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,330
Don't you die on me.
Don't you friggin' die!

497
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,200
‐ Powell!
‐ Amp of epi!

498
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,804
'Oh, mama..'

499
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,873
'I shouldn't
have left her.'

500
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,778
Okay, I got a pulse.

501
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,449
'I love you so much.
Don't leave me.'

502
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,219
Allison, it's imperative
that you hold perfectly still

503
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,788
alright?

504
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:50,524
This is the home stretch.
You're doing really well.

505
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,493
Alright, now.
I am going to ask you..

506
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,963
...to swallow for me
if you can.

507
00:19:56,997 --> 00:20:00,601
'Oh, good.
Now, can you say E?'

508
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,603
E.

509
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,305
That's okay. You just need
to clear the secretions.

510
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,440
Alright, good.
Let's try again.

511
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,542
You can do it, Allison.

512
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:13,547
E.

513
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,016
Dr. Kotlowitz, you're a genius.

514
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,619
'No, I'm just doing
my job, that's all.'

515
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,453
You did
good, kid.

516
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,722
Alright, let's
prepare to close her.

517
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,356
Thank you.

518
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,826
Shh! You have the rest
of your life to talk.

519
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:32,782
Let's get a CBC.

520
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:35,001
CHEM‐7, blood gas,
portable chest and 12 lead.

521
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,302
Pulse are weak and thready.

522
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,804
Start dopamine
at ten mics per kilo.

523
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,641
‐ Pulse ox 88.
‐ Call respiratory for a vent.

524
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:43,510
'BP 60 palp. Looks like
idioventricular rhythm at 50.'

525
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,811
'I lost her pulse.'

526
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,012
'She's cyanotic.'

527
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,914
‐ We should go.
‐ I'll get a blood gas.

528
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,883
Come on. Let's go.

529
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,787
Start dopamine.
Atropine!

530
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,567
John, what are
you doing here?

531
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,968
You asked me to help.
I'm here to help.

532
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,436
Uh..

533
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,074
...that's really decent of you,
man, but‐but I'm‐I'm fine.

534
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,511
You left messages for me
every half an hour

535
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:18,945
and now you're fine?

536
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:21,414
Well, I just, uh,
panicked, you know.

537
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,049
I mean, you know
how it is when you're sick.

538
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,486
You‐you‐you think
the world's gonna end.

539
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,823
‐ Invite me in.
‐ Yeah, sure. Come on in.

540
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,796
It smells like
a locker room in here.

541
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:37,731
When was the last time
the maid came by?

542
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,900
She, uh...quit.

543
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:48,108
So...since you're here,
did you bring any meds?

544
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,845
No. I brought a list
of drug treatment centers.

545
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,117
Come on, man. I'm not one
of those Betty Ford people.

546
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,885
I..

547
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,121
I mean, half my graduating class
from Westlane's in rehab.

548
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,390
I mean...I'd bump
into somebody I know

549
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:07,060
and then tongues would wag.

550
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,562
You should take a look
at yourself, Chase.

551
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:10,997
You're a mess.

552
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:12,733
Thank you,
Mr. Blackwell.

553
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:17,971
You know, I'd love to
hang out, but I got to..

554
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,741
‐ I was just gonna...head out.
‐ Why don't you give me a break?

555
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:31,552
You going to answer that?

556
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:37,524
Chase, buddy, what's up, dude?

557
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:39,593
I am sorry it took me
so long to get here.

558
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,595
I was in the middle
of a‐a wicked squash game

559
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:42,629
and I didn't feel
my pager vibrate, so..

560
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,164
It's alright.

561
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,833
Anyway, um, I got you
a couple of grams of the usual

562
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,602
and check this out.

563
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:51,738
A gram of this.
Dude, this is some superb‐‐

564
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,807
‐ I think you'd better go.
‐ Who the hell's this guy?

565
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,876
He's my cousin.

566
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:57,811
Your cousin needs
to learn some manners.

567
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,445
‐ Anyway, as I was saying‐‐
‐ I don't think you heard me.

568
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,947
‐ I said get out.
‐ Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

569
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:03,183
Last time I checked,
this was Chase's house, okay?

570
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,519
So, why don't you go make
yourself a‐a hot toddy

571
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:06,820
or something
and let us talk.

572
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,656
Chase, if you do this,
you are on your own.

573
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,858
Oh, you know what?
You know what?

574
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,695
What's it going to be, man?
D‐do you want this or not? Huh?

575
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,430
Yeah? Is that a yeah?
Yeah. Alright.

576
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,700
Gardner, you..

577
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,902
...better go.

578
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:23,737
Alright. Okay. Alright.

579
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,105
Well, you know where to find me
when mommy's gone.

580
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,473
Alright, you heard him.
Get out of here.

581
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:36,917
Oh!

582
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,558
Last epi?

583
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,992
'High dose,
three minutes ago.'

584
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:48,461
‐ Total time down?
‐ Thirty minutes.

585
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,464
Okay. Let's call it.

586
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,500
Time of death, 4:02 p. m.

587
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,774
Uh, Dr. Greene,
I'm Detective Gerald Leo

588
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:03,644
District 11, Violent Crimes,
and this is Detective Laibson.

589
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:04,978
I wondered,
could we have a minute?

590
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,246
What happened
to the other two cops?

591
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,114
Our suspect crossed
district lines.

592
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:09,883
This guy's going
all over Chicago?

593
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,718
Uh, this is an open
investigation.

594
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:13,520
We're not at liberty
to discuss the specifics.

595
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:15,021
Now, about Louise Dickinson‐‐

596
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:17,023
You know, I haven't heard
anything on the news about this.

597
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:19,025
A case like this has to be
handled carefully.

598
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,561
'We have suspects
we're looking at.'

599
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:23,163
And I have three victims
from some sick bastard.

600
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:24,798
For all I know,
there could be more

601
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,733
not that my local friendly
police department

602
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,702
is telling me
or anybody else anything.

603
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,671
You're gonna have
to calm down, doctor.

604
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:32,973
You're right. I'm going
to pull myself together

605
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,775
'cause I got to tell
Louise Dickinson's daughter

606
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,677
that her mother's
going to the morgue.

607
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,812
We need more
kerlix and saline.

608
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:44,084
Powell, are you okay?

609
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:46,186
You haven't said a word
since we left that apartment.

610
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,554
There's nothing to say.

611
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,124
Some things you never
get used to seeing.

612
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:55,696
When we got to that apartment,
you really froze.

613
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,063
I apologize.

614
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:59,966
No, it's not that.
I just..

615
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,702
If there's anything
you'd like to talk about..

616
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:04,270
Not really.

617
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,142
What's that?

618
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:16,249
It's her, alright.

619
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,584
Let me see.

620
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,857
Fifty five cents
off Meow Mix.

621
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,860
I didn't see a cat up there.
Did you?

622
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:27,994
Nope.

623
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,164
Someone should go
and see if it's okay.

624
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,069
Dr. Anspaugh,
how's Scott?

625
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,774
He's going to have to have
another round of chemotherapy.

626
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,979
How do you tell
a 12‐year‐old boy

627
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,014
that he's going to be in
and out of the hospital

628
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:51,151
for a painful,
debilitating treatments

629
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:52,919
for God knows how long?

630
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:55,088
It's not easy,
but you can imagine

631
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,890
how it is for Scott,
not knowing.

632
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,326
Well, frankly, he could..

633
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:03,930
We could use some help.

634
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:10,036
Scott responds to you.

635
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,038
So I was wondering if
you might be interested

636
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,675
in being a, uh..

637
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,711
...part‐time, private duty
caregiver for him.

638
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,316
What does Scott think
about this?

639
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,185
Well, we haven't discussed it
specifically

640
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:27,353
but I know he thinks
very highly of you..

641
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,058
...as do I.

642
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:37,898
If you need time
to think about it‐‐

643
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,365
No, no, no. Um..

644
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,701
No, I'm glad that you asked.

645
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:43,069
When do I start?

646
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,878
Can you turn
the heat up, please?

647
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:53,914
It's like a freaking
meat locker in here.

648
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:59,119
It's cranked
up to 80.

649
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:02,155
‐ I'll make some soup.
‐ I don't want soup!

650
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,625
I am sick!
I need something!

651
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,728
I'll make some tea.

652
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,195
I'm going to vomit.

653
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:12,065
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

654
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:20,173
It's okay. Next time you feel it
coming on, use the bowl.

655
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,975
I'll clean it up.
Don't worry about it.

656
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:25,178
‐ Want to take this shirt off?
‐ I can't do this anymore!

657
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,412
I got to get
out of here!

658
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:27,914
Hey, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

659
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:29,816
Get off of me!
You are not helping me!

660
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,351
You are not doing jack!

661
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:34,320
The only way you're gonna leave
through here is through me.

662
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:36,022
Fine. I'll call Gardner back.

663
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,328
‐ Sit down.
‐ I am sick!

664
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:45,431
I need something!
You got to help.

665
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:47,167
‐ I'm going to help you.
‐ You have to help me!

666
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,302
I'm going to help you.
I'm going to help you, Chase.

667
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,837
But you got to
stick with me.

668
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,207
Come on! Come on.

669
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,377
Alright?

670
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,979
Yeah.

671
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,286
'Peter.'

672
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,955
Hey. How did the
Beaumont surgery go?

673
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:11,024
Very well.
Dr. Kotlowitz is optimistic.

674
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,859
She'll have full use
of her voice in a week or two.

675
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,360
Oh. Congratulations.

676
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:16,262
How about the Anspaugh
boy's surgery?

677
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,932
Ah, you know.
Well, as well as we hoped.

678
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,835
It's been a long day.
I could use a drink.

679
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,871
‐ How about you?
‐ No. I don't drink.

680
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,907
Your body's made up
of 60% water, Peter.

681
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,474
You must drink
something.

682
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,110
Come on, Elizabeth.
You know what I mean.

683
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:33,914
Well, have a lemonade
or a yoo‐hoo for all I care.

684
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:36,750
I just think it'd be criminal
to let this day end so early.

685
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,051
Oh, unless of course
you were going to

686
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,352
spend time with your son
or something.

687
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:40,821
‐ I‐I wouldn't‐‐
‐ Oh, no, no, no, no.

688
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:42,823
He's with
his mother tonight.

689
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,124
So?

690
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,797
Yeah, well. Yeah, you know,
I like lemonade.

691
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:53,233
Splendid.

692
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,071
‐ Can I help you?
‐ Yeah.

693
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,974
We're the EMS Team with County.
Mrs. Dickinson had a cat.

694
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,075
You haven't seen it
around anywhere, have you?

695
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,243
Nope.

696
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:06,513
Anyone seen
a cat around here?

697
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:08,448
‐ Sorry.
‐ Is it okay if we look around?

698
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,116
Sure. We're almost
done here anyway.

699
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,484
‐ Thanks.
‐ Thanks.

700
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:18,091
Hey, sometimes they come running
if they hear a can opener.

701
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,264
Well, here's
some stairs.

702
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:25,799
Maybe it got
to the roof.

703
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,872
Come get your dinner.

704
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:36,276
I think it hissed at me.

705
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:38,979
It'll come out eventually.

706
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,915
Whew!

707
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:44,284
Pretty up here, huh?

708
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:46,252
I'm just glad to be out
of that apartment.

709
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,121
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

710
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,557
Hey, you were right.

711
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:53,560
What happened back there,
it, uh, it got to me.

712
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,329
It reminded me of my mom.

713
00:29:57,397 --> 00:29:58,431
Your mom?

714
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:02,268
When I was nine,
she hung herself.

715
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,174
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ Yeah.

716
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,976
Yeah, I was the one
that found her.

717
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:14,347
'Seeing that lady
with the ligature marks'

718
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,516
'and her head turned
like that'

719
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:16,817
cops all around..

720
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,485
I was pissed..

721
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,921
'...all over again.'

722
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,325
I'm sure she didn't mean
for you to find her.

723
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:26,359
But I did.

724
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:33,266
Then I started
feeling guilty

725
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,069
because I was thinking
about myself

726
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:37,604
instead of that old lady

727
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:39,573
just like my mom
was only thinking of herself.

728
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,076
What a sick boy I am, huh?

729
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:48,281
I thought about everybody but me
when I tried to kill myself.

730
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:56,056
‐ I'm sorry. I had no idea.
‐ Why would you?

731
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:57,658
It was a long time ago.

732
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,159
I just got wrapped up

733
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,094
in everyone else's
expectations of me.

734
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,395
I forgot who I was,
you know?

735
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:05,999
And now?

736
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,270
Now I'm okay.

737
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:13,507
I even tried to go to med school
but it just wasn't me.

738
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,043
You couldn't get the hang
of that nine iron, huh?

739
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:19,580
I don't know.

740
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:22,115
I opened up a clinic
in the ER this year.

741
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:24,384
'It's only open a couple
days a week, but..'

742
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:27,954
But nothin'.
That's...that's great.

743
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:30,390
‐ Yeah.
‐ You're super‐nurse.

744
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:34,360
But what about you?

745
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:37,463
Me?

746
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:38,665
What are you thinking
about right now?

747
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,405
I'm thinking that
it's freezing out here

748
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:47,307
and I wish that damn
cat would come out.

749
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:50,210
Yeah.
I know it's getting late.

750
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:51,545
If you got
somewhere to be..

751
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,113
Yeah.

752
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,086
No, I'm fine.

753
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:07,127
What are you
thinking about?

754
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,232
I'm thinking
I'm not feeling the cold.

755
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,167
‐ 'Yeah?'
‐ Yeah.

756
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,269
And I'm thinking
that cat will come out

757
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:17,504
when she's good and ready.

758
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:18,471
Probably.

759
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,309
And I'm thinking
if I look at you one more second

760
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,578
I'm gonna have
to kiss you.

761
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,376
Has anyone seen Carol?

762
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:57,678
Not since she went on
that ride‐along.

763
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:58,679
I haven't
seen her since then either.

764
00:32:58,712 --> 00:33:00,614
N‐no one's seen her.

765
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:04,284
Alright, I'll‐I'll do that.
Okay. Bye.

766
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,486
If anyone sees her,
tell her to call Doug.

767
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,621
He's getting kind of worried.

768
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,189
‐ Goodnight, everybody.
‐ Goodnight.

769
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,262
There you are.

770
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:17,397
You leaving?

771
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,099
Yeah.

772
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:21,702
I put together those figures
I promised you.

773
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:23,336
Thought we could
go out to dinner

774
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,138
have a glass of wine,
maybe talk it over

775
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:26,239
in a more
relaxed setting.

776
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,275
Yeah, I‐I think I should..

777
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,277
...think about this alone.

778
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:32,779
‐ Here, let me give you a hand.
‐ No, I don't..

779
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:34,715
I‐I'm fine, thanks.

780
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:37,050
Kerry, what can I do to make
you feel better about this?

781
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,820
Delay the board vote.

782
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,287
Come on, we've worked on this
for three months.

783
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:42,455
I'm perfectly
willing to give you

784
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:44,357
whatever information
you think you need

785
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,627
but delaying the vote at this
late date just isn't an option.

786
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,795
I can't support something
I don't believe in.

787
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:51,632
And it seems that SPG is putting
profits ahead of patient care.

788
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:54,735
Synergix provides the most care
for the most people.

789
00:33:54,768 --> 00:33:56,670
And if that means giving
them an Oldsmobile

790
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,271
instead of a Rolls,
then so be it.

791
00:33:58,304 --> 00:33:59,439
Decent health care
shouldn't be a luxury.

792
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,174
That's right. It shouldn't.

793
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,777
And that's what we give people,
decent health care.

794
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,112
‐ And nothing more?
‐ "More" bankrupts hospitals.

795
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:08,081
I can't be part
of an organization

796
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:10,717
that lowballs people's lives.

797
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:13,286
That's a cheap shot.

798
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:16,857
Oh, man.

799
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,161
I just need time alone
to think about this.

800
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:22,495
About Synergix or me?

801
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,503
Come on, let me
give you a ride home.

802
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:30,604
‐ We'll talk this out.
‐ I'll be fine, thanks.

803
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:35,676
Kerry, don't do this.

804
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:37,578
'I don't care if the computer
says it was processed.'

805
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:42,883
'Cause I phoned
the script in hours ago.

806
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,751
Well, if it was processed,
then I would have the meds

807
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:46,520
in my hand right now,
wouldn't I?

808
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:49,723
Yeah, I'll hold.

809
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:53,193
Want some of this?

810
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,764
Finally.

811
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,638
‐ Hey.
‐ Anna.

812
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:06,306
What are you
doing here?

813
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:09,442
You, uh, called in
a prescription for Compazine.

814
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:10,777
You're gonna need
more than that, trust me.

815
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:14,515
‐ Come on in.
‐ Thanks.

816
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:19,185
‐ Chase.
‐ Hey, Anna.

817
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,822
Sorry I‐I didn't tidy up.

818
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:24,457
Uh, no problem. You should see
my brother Hank's place.

819
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,192
It's a Superfund site.

820
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:31,197
I got, uh, Clonidine
and Propranolol.

821
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:32,933
Propranolol?

822
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,569
Yeah, I, uh, borrowed it
from the ER.

823
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:37,337
I also got
your saline

824
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,872
'and rectal Compazine.'

825
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,675
Rectal?

826
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,777
Do I get my choice
of doctors?

827
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,311
I think that's
the sort of procedure

828
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:46,647
you should keep
in the family, okay?

829
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,253
Okay, I'm going to
get this started.

830
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:55,556
'Okay. This will lower
your heart rate'

831
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:57,624
'and blood pressure and take
the edge off the jitters.'

832
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:02,262
You'll be okay.

833
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:10,637
Visualize the bull's‐eye,
lean into the throw and..

834
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:12,305
...release.

835
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,875
It's easier said than done.

836
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:16,476
Try it.

837
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:22,983
No, you're too stiff.

838
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,350
Wait a minute.

839
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:28,989
There you go.

840
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:31,992
Nice aerodynamic form.

841
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:35,195
Now a small movement
with the wrist and..

842
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:38,899
Well, that's not bad.

843
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:40,400
Can I get you folks
some refills?

844
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:41,968
Uh, yes, I'll have
another Newkie Brown.

845
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:43,737
‐ Uh, a Perrier.
‐ You got it.

846
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:48,509
‐ Are you an alcoholic?
‐ Excuse me?

847
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:49,876
'Is that why
you don't drink?'

848
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,979
Oh, no. No.

849
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:56,316
Are you a Muslim? I notice you
don't eat pork either.

850
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:57,784
Uh, no, I've got
nothing against liquor.

851
00:36:57,818 --> 00:36:59,252
I just..
I don't like the taste.

852
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:01,522
So, it's not
a control thing?

853
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:02,589
No, of course not.

854
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:05,959
You know what?
You should try a Pimm's.

855
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:08,629
It tastes just like, uh,
Ginger Ale and fruit.

856
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:09,930
No. No, thank you.

857
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:12,899
Oh, you're so resistant
to new things, Peter.

858
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,267
I tell you what,
we'll shoot for it.

859
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,335
Whoever gets closest
to the bull's‐eye

860
00:37:15,368 --> 00:37:16,937
picks the next round.

861
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,339
If you get it, I'll even drink
that frog water of yours.

862
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:20,641
‐ How's that?
‐ Oh, yeah, right, that's fair.

863
00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:21,708
I mean, you've done this
all your life.

864
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:23,577
I've never done this.

865
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,580
Okay. I'll throw mine backwards
with my eyes closed

866
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:28,381
and you can
shoot yours straight.

867
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:29,482
‐ Oh, yeah, you will?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

868
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:30,817
Alright. You got
yourself a deal.

869
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:32,853
Come on, watch this.

870
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:35,922
Look at this aerodynamic thing
that you were talking about.

871
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:37,524
See? Whoo‐whoo.

872
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:40,727
'Oh!'

873
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:43,964
‐ Okay, okay.
‐ Okay.

874
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,400
Here we go.

875
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,002
Alright.

876
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:54,508
♪ ...lasts forever
and everybody wants to.. ♪

877
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,042
Whoa!

878
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:02,348
‐ Hey, Jeanie.
‐ Hey.

879
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:03,850
What are you doing awake?
You need your sleep.

880
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:08,589
I kept my end of the
deal with surgery.

881
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:10,290
‐ What about you?
‐ What do you mean?

882
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,859
Blackhawks, Islanders.

883
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:15,662
Right.

884
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:24,905
Center ice.
That is so cool.

885
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:26,873
So we got a date?

886
00:38:26,907 --> 00:38:29,576
Yeah.
Thanks, Jeanie.

887
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,512
Sure.

888
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,980
‐ You have a good sleep, okay?
‐ Are you leaving?

889
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:38,585
Well, not if you
don't want me to.

890
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,555
It gets kind of creepy
in here at night, that's all.

891
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:47,393
Well, why don't I just sit here,
then, until you fall asleep?

892
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:49,362
Thanks, Jeanie.

893
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,039
Thanks.

894
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,941
Sure.

895
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:14,955
These are great photos.

896
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,626
Those are
Chase Carter originals.

897
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,728
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

898
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:25,398
Gritty stuff.
Not what I would have expected.

899
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,834
Well, he's got
a lot of talents.

900
00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:32,839
I guess that's why this is
all so hard to understand.

901
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,378
Yeah, well, this happens
to all kinds of people.

902
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:41,982
Yeah.

903
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:45,619
Um..

904
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:47,654
...before, when I said
that I had a friend on heroin

905
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,489
I wasn't being
completely honest.

906
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:52,425
No?
How so?

907
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:57,030
Um...it was my boyfriend.

908
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,768
I've done the detox dance
more times than I can count.

909
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,574
How come you didn't
cut him loose?

910
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,043
Mmm. It's not that easy
when you love someone.

911
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:13,547
No.
No, it's not.

912
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:16,817
Do you think this
is the worst of it?

913
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:19,886
I wish.

914
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,522
Well, you were right.

915
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:25,058
I don't know
what I'm doing.

916
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:27,460
No.
You're doing great.

917
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:31,898
Thanks for coming.

918
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:35,636

Oh, I guess
they're kicking us out.

931
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:21,247
Yeah.
That's life.

932
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,816
Yep, that's life.

933
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:31,057
Neither one of us is
in any shape to drive.

934
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,826
Listen, I didn't mean
to get you drunk.

935
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:35,061
It's just, uh,
I've never seen that happen

936
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:37,197
from two Pimm's before.

937
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,599
Thank you.

938
00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:46,540
I, um..
I should call us a cab.

939
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:50,877
I'd, uh..

940
00:41:50,911 --> 00:41:54,180
Uh, I'd invite you
back to my place but, um..

941
00:41:54,214 --> 00:41:56,617
...I fear
I'd be taking advantage.

942
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:06,527
My head is spinning.
I'm..

943
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:10,330
I should just get some sleep.

944
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,265
Mmm, mmm.
It's probably best.

945
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:15,969
Taxi!

946
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:21,241
Okay. Now,
when you get home

947
00:42:21,274 --> 00:42:23,076
I want you
to drink plenty of water

948
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:26,613
and if you have any aspirin
or B complex, all the better.

949
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:28,682
Okay. So, uh, where
can I drop you?

950
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,717
Oh, it's okay.
I'll get my own cab.

951
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:31,918
‐ You sure?
‐ Uh‐huh.

952
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:42,095
‐ Hey, Elizabeth.
‐ Mm‐hmm?

953
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:43,296
I had a really good time.

954
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:46,166
Yes, uh...it was delightful.

955
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:49,803
‐ Goodnight.
‐ Night.

956
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,286
I've been waiting
for you all night.

957
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,022
I'm sorry.
I got...I got wrapped up.

958
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,759
I called here,
but you weren't home.

959
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:14,595
I was on the corner
of Dearborn and Clark.

960
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:18,899
Right.

961
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,702
I called the hospital
and the firehouse

962
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:24,137
and they both said that
unit 57 came back on time.

963
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,675
Yeah, I was talking
to Greg Powell.

964
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,845
Um...he's the paramedic
on my ride‐along.

965
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:36,683
It was a really tough day
for both of us and, um..

966
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:38,351
'It was just one of those things
where you start talking'

967
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:40,687
to someone you hardly know and
you start telling them things.

968
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,759
Mm‐hmm.

969
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,093
Talking to him
all night?

970
00:43:50,096 --> 00:43:51,765
We got coffee,
and we talked

971
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,767
and since then
I've been walking.

972
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:55,936
In this cold?

973
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,174
‐ I needed to think.
‐ About what?

974
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,150
About you and me and..

975
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:14,955
...the engagement, and the vows
and the rings and, uh..

976
00:44:21,194 --> 00:44:22,328
I think we're
rushing into this.

977
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:23,730
I don't think
we're ready.

978
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,032
I'm ready.

979
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:29,202
'But you aren't?'

980
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:37,110
When I was...talking
to Greg Powell

981
00:44:37,143 --> 00:44:38,979
it got intense
and, um..

982
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:46,352
And I kissed him.

983
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:52,058
It didn't go
any further than that

984
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,727
'but it was one
of those moments, you know.'

985
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,096
‐ Uh‐huh. Uh‐huh.
‐ I didn't want it to..

986
00:44:56,129 --> 00:44:57,798
Okay, that's good. I just..
Was here.

987
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:00,266
I just wanted to make sure
you were safe and sound.

988
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,869
Doug...I am so sorry.

989
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:04,871
Yep. Me, too.
