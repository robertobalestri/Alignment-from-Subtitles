Uh, my dad died.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,544
What? Wh‐wh‐what happened?

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,245
I don't know.
Some car wreck or something.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,247
They weren't real clear
on the details.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,318
Um, but I got
to go...claim the body

7
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,220

A subcompact?

00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,527
It's all they had.

15
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,728
What is it,
110 degrees out here?

16
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,329
I asked for a mid‐sized.

17
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,566
They just didn't
have one, that's all.

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,634
Didn't they tell you that the
air conditioning didn't work?

19
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,705
It's November. Who asks
about air conditioning?

20
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,406
Next time,
you get the luggage.

Thanks.

42
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,468
You see the highway patrol
is down the road to the left.

43
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,771
We can't miss it.

44
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,540
What the hell was your
dad doing out here?

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,308
Oh, he was probably heading up
to Tahoe or Vegas or somewhere.

46
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,744
He liked to gamble?

47
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:24,911
Yeah, you might
say that. Yeah.

48
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,680

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,816
‐ Thanks.
‐ You okay?

50
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,585
I'm fine.

51
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,322
Listen, we don't have
to do this.

52
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,225
We could, uh,
find some air conditioning

53
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,895
get something to drink.
You know, we're in no hurry.

54
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,197
Come on. Let's get
this over with.

55
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,917
When his name
showed up in the paper..

56
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,451
...a woman called
from Barstow

57
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,588
told us he was
renting a room down there.

58
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,289
Found you
in his address book.

59
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,524
Barstow?

60
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,859
He was in a motel.

61
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,427
You weren't in touch?

62
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,296
No. No, no.

63
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,534
We got this stuff from the trunk
in the evidence locker.

64
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,236
I, uh, couldn't tell
what was his and what was hers.

65
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,708
‐ Hers?
‐ Yeah, a, uh...Sherry Fox.

66
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,243
'Having trouble locating
her next of kin too.'

67
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,813
'I was, uh, hoping
you could help me with that.'

68
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,414
Uh, no..

69
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,417
Um...was she killed?

70
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:40,854
Your father ran a stop sign
two nights ago doing 120.

71
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,823
Hit a pickup truck.

72
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,726
Killed himself, Miss Fox,
the driver of the pickup

73
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,494
a, uh, Pedro Lopez,
father of six.

74
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,766
'His blood alcohol
level was .33.'

75
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,835
Four times
the legal limit.

76
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,296
What a place to die?

77
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,903
He never drove
less than 70 miles an hour

78
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,739
his entire life.

79
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,043
He used to think it was funny
to drive with his knees..

80
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,414
...with his eyes closed,
like it was some sort of game.

81
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,482
Idiot.

82
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,818
Couldn't even
kill himself right.

83
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,788
He has to...
take other people with him.

84
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,658
Leave me
to clean up the mess.

85
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,561
I don't think your dad planned
on dying out here, Doug.

86
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,363
No, he never planned on doing
anything his entire life.

87
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,366
He never planned to lose
our TV in a poker game.

88
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,437
He never planned to be gone
for more than a couple of days.

89
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:41,975
He never planned to...
hurt anybody in his whole life.

90
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,111
Your dad lost
your television in a poker game?

91
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,950
I should have
killed him myself..

92
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,484
...saved everybody the trouble.

93
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,824
He was paid up
through thanksgiving

94
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,726
so I figured I should
leave everything

95
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,062
where it was
until the rent ran out

96
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,396
or somebody showed up.

97
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,631
Yeah.

98
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,104
'The bathroom's in here!'

99
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,440
‐ 'You're a doctor, aren't you?'
‐ Mm‐hmm.

100
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,711
'He talked about you
all the time.'

101
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,880
So, uh, he wasn't here
by himself?

102
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,815
Oh, no, honey.
He had his wife with him.

103
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,151
'You all gonna want
to stay in here tonight?'

104
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,754
'I can get some clean sheets
and towels from the‐‐'

105
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,091
No, thank you. But, uh, if you
have a couple of extra rooms..

106
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,526
‐ Adjoining?
‐ Fine.

107
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,694
Mm‐hmm.

108
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,630
Such a nice couple.

109
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,965
‐ Terrible what happened.
‐ Yeah.

110
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,537
‐ Wife?
‐ I doubt it.

111
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,405
Who's that?

112
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,508
I have no idea.

113
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,443
‐ Is that you?
‐ Where?

114
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,412
Yeah. That's, uh,
that's high school.

115
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,515
Look at that hair.
Played varsity?

116
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,949
Yeah, we went
to state that year.

117
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,119
Yeah. I played JV.
I was...wasn't very good.

118
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,989
Oh, man.

119
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,126
Your mom?

120
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,695
Yeah.

121
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,535
For a guy that didn't care..

122
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,837
...he sure had a lot
of photos of you guys around.

123
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,740
Yeah.

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,155
You hungry? You want to get
something to eat?

125
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,890
There's a taco stand
down the street.

126
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,525
Ah, no, that's okay.
I'm not hungry.

127
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,626
You go ahead
if you want to.

128
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,528
I found this
in the closet.

129
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,464
I think movies
or something.

130
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,901
I didn't find much
to tell us about the wife.

131
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,104
Just some clothes, cosmetics.

132
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,474
No letters or
mail or anything.

133
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,809
Uh, she was probably a hooker..

134
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,978
...or a cocktail waitress
or something.

135
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,212
Is there any money in here?

136
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,049
No, just a couple
of pawn tickets.

137
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,752
Well, there it is.
There's my inheritance.

138
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,854
Some women's clothes..

139
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,990
'...a couple of half‐empty
liquor bottles..'

140
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,992
...and, uh, two pawn tickets.

141
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,060
Sounds like my dad.

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,128
'Well, here you are.'

143
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,031
Whoo!

144
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,733
Thirteen.

145
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,569
Fourteen. Oh, honey!

146
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,906
Down on the corner,
away from the highway noise.

147
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,743
Oh, I forgot
to tell you earlier.

148
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,145
Your daddy's car
is parked around back.

149
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,914
Oh, he...he didn't wreck it?

150
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,782
No, it must have been her car.

151
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,784
'His car's still here.'

152
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,961
Son of a bitch...he kept it.

153
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,664
He was always out here,
polishing it.

154
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,634
Said he'd had it
for years.

155
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,269
Since the '70s.

156
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,270
'It's a beauty!'

157
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,876
Hey, maybe the keys are
with your dad's stuff.

158
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,311
That envelope's still
in the rental car.

159
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,681
Pull the garage door
shut and lock it, huh..

160
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,315
...when you're finished,
alright?

161
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,851
Yeah.

162
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,193
I learned to drive
in this car.

163
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,194
Yeah?

164
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,634
Yeah, my dad. We wouldn't see
him for months.

165
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,636
Then he'd just
show up, and he'd just..

166
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,070
He'd bring my mom a present.

167
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,906
He'd bring me a‐a signed
football from, uh..

168
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,076
...Joe Namath,
Bob Griese or somebody.

169
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,812
And, uh, then he'd
gather me up

170
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,648
and he'd tell my mom
we were going to a ball game

171
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,915
which she knew was a lie

172
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,116
and then, we would
just hit the road.

173
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:54,087
We'd...we'd
disappear for days.

174
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,289
We'd be driving to Vegas.

175
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,191
Sometimes, we'd drive
to Atlantic City.

176
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,393
It was..

177
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,097
It was back, uh,
it was before my mom remarried

178
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,033
so we were still living in
Kentucky at the time, so..

179
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,737
...I was maybe
13, 12, I think, maybe.

180
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,709
So, we'd be in...
Oklahoma or Indiana

181
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,177
middle of the night.

182
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,846
My dad would wake me up
and say, "Okay, you're driving."

183
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,918
So we'd get off
on some side road..

184
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,953
...and I'd slide in
behind the wheel.

185
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,957
Just floor it.

186
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,127
Just feel those..

187
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,029
...426 horses.

188
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,067
It just felt like..

189
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,803
...I was flying.

190
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,472
Sounds pretty great.

191
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,412
He had his moments.

192
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,385
‐ Gas?
‐ We got a quarter of a tank.

193
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,021
'Look.'

194
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,355
Oh!

195
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,292
'Hang on.'

196
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,963
Now what?

197
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,866
My dad used to keep
a gas can in the trunk.

198
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,838
Wow.

199
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,974
You usually don't see
that much baby stuff

200
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,475
all in one place.

201
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,283
No gas.

202
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,515
Hola.

203
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,984
Como esta?

204
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,451
I'm doing fine.

205
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,954
Looks like you had
a long night, though.

206
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,401
Sure this is the right place?

207
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,469
I don't know about
that last left.

208
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,277
Hello!

209
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,148
Maybe everybody's working.

210
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:39,019
Hello. Anybody here?

211
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,120
'Hey!'

212
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,023
Hey.

213
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,257
How you doing?

214
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,259
You're a Broncos fan, huh?

215
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,194
‐ Dallas.
‐ Dallas?

216
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,564
I'm looking
for the Lopez family.

217
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,332
Which one?
We got two of them.

218
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,900
Uh, Pedro Lopez.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,135
He got killed
in a car accident.

220
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,204
We're trying
to find his family.

221
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,372
Not here.

222
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,607
"Not here" like as in

223
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,576
he doesn't live here
or "not here"

224
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,245
like he's not here right now?

225
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,513
Who are you?

226
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,451
I'm Doug. Listen, can you,
will you do me a favor?

227
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:14,420
Would you stop kicking that
just for a second?

228
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,590
‐ Do you know where they are?
‐ Everybody's at the funeral.

229
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,324

Mr. Lopez today.

about a pocket watch.

Well, not for Rachel,
but for a son

279
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,359

00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,001
my great‐great‐grandfather's
pocket watch or something

284
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,368
that'd be cool.

285
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,037
The only heirloom
my family has

286
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,272
is my grandfather's
fraternity beer stein.

00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,576
This must be it. It's got
the right tag number.

‐ What is it?
‐ It's a movie projector.

289
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,213
Hope you didn't pay
too much money for it.

290
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,081
Ten bucks. I didn't
even want it.

291
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,151

of the stuff, what the hell?

you looking at?

Let's see,
that's, uh, 75 bucks.

298
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,202
‐ Cynthia.
‐ Yeah. I think she'd like it.

299
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,138
You buy that, and you're walking
back to the hotel.

300
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,206
Here we go.
We got a Rolex.

301
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,209
‐ Oh, that's nice.
‐ Yeah, my dad loved this.

302
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,711
He used to brush his teeth first

303
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:25,812
and then use the toothbrush

304
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,715
to clean the watch every night.

305
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:32,586
‐ Pinkie ring.
‐ Uh‐huh.

306
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,555
Wow. That is a big one.

307
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,823
Three‐and‐a‐half carats.

308
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,424
Yeah. She didn't
want to give it up.

309
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,060
But he talked her into it.

310
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,427
They kept
their wedding rings, though.

311
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,363
They wouldn't even
think about giving them up.

312

Hey, Carol, it's Doug.

313
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,706
Just hoping to catch you

We're here in Barstow still.

315
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,078

just...thinking about you

316
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,481
and...wishing you were here.

317
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,651

and I just wish you were here.

00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,454
So, I'll, uh, I'll
call you tomorrow.

319
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,591
‐ Okay, bye.
‐ Hey, who was that?

320
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,458
Yeah, it's just somebody
I've been seeing

321
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,827
the last couple of months.

322
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,562
Uh‐huh. Couple months?
That sounds serious.

323
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,330
You want any of these ties,
before I give them to Goodwill?

324
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,832
I only wear ties at work.

325
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,601
‐ So is it anybody I know?
‐ Got a nice suit here.

326
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,603
Got an Armani,
I believe it's double‐breasted.

327
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,137
You don't want to
tell me who it is?

328
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,372
Dad had a set
of clubs somewhere.

329
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,675
Why is it that you don't want
to tell me who it is?

330
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,676
'Because I don't.'

331
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,412
It's not my ex‐wife, is it?

332
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,447
No, it's not Jennifer.

333
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:35,849
Cynthia?
Say you're not, are you?

334
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,551
No, and neither should you.

335
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,319

336
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,454

the hospital?

338
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,858
She doesn't
work in the hospital?

339
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,392
It's Carol.

‐ Well, I'm relieved.

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,636
You two got back together?

344
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,137
She didn't want me
talking about it

345
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,172

want it out at work.

Now, you are sworn to secrecy.

00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:04,578
Whoa, she...she swore
she would never get back

348
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,246
together with you
after the last time.

349
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,149
‐ Things change.
‐ Wow!

350
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,518
You know, it's
not that amazing.

351
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,186
Wow!

352
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,321
You can stop saying "wow."

353
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,390
I...can't believe it.

354
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,725
Well...you've said that.

355
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,594
I'm happy for you.
That's great.

356
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,929
Good. Thanks, buddy.

357
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,299
It's just...after
what happened last time

358
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,400
I can't believe it.

359
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,637
Yeah, I, well, thanks.

360
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,373
Does she make you take a lie
detector test every week?

361
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,875
Have you tried the beer?
Because it feels really good.

362
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,243
No! Hey, don't!
Now, that's not fair.

363
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,747
‐ No, no, no, no.
‐ Whoa‐a‐a!

364
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,282
You son of a..!

365
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,553
Give me that!

366
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,223
Get off me!

367
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,827
Is there any more beer?

368
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,428
You could probably
squeeze something

369
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,863
out of the drapes or something.

370
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,766
'Smells like a brewery in here.'

371
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,234
You finding out anything

372
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,837
about the mystery
step‐mom in there?

373
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,607
She had a nice body. She liked
to wear kinky lingerie.

374
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,474
Oh, lucky dad.

375
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,777
Yeah, spent
a lot of time in..

376
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,246
...in Laughlin
and Flagstaff and Vegas.

377
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,848
My dad used to collect
these matchbooks.

378
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:18,284
That's how we'd keep
account of him. Matchbooks.

379
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,921
Look at this.

380
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:24,390
‐ That's her. Look at the ring.
‐ Ah, yeah.

381
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,861
I found this...
in the bottom of her suitcase.

382
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,763
It's a Christmas card,
and it's got a return address

383
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,264
in Long Beach.
I'll hang on to that.

384
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,466
Now, look at this.

385
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,336
She had a baby.

386
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,938
Almost every picture
it's her, the baby.

387
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:40,707
Look, there's my dad.

388
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:44,310
You think the baby was his?

389
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,479
I don't know. Maybe.

390
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,785
Wow. Kind of weird, huh?

391
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:53,720
Where you think
the baby is now?

392
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,657
I don't know,
maybe grandparents

393
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,793
friends, in a bassinet
outside a convent.

394
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,428
Knowing my dad, it could be..

395
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,969
The hard part is that..

396
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,308
I just, there's this power
that he held over us

397
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,310
this...yeah.

398
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,412
I would‐I would be so happy

399
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,347
when he would come home

400
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,850
and I would tell myself
that I‐I wouldn't be

401
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,952
and then, he would come home,
and he'd tell a story

402
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,888
he'd give you a present,
and there we would all be

403
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,356
just sitting there
like we were some kind of..

404
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,658
...like a normal family

405
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:36,296
and...I just..

406
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:40,400
I just..

407
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,670
...you know,
never told him. I just..

408
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,471
I just...guess I figured

409
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:48,041
that there
would be a right time.

410
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,344
The son of a bitch
even got control of that.

411
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,651
You want to watch this?

412
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:01,387
‐ Hmm? What's that?
‐ The movie.

413
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,689
‐ Come on.
‐ No.

414
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,324
It's my chance to
see you in diapers.

415
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,361
Again?

416
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:14,768
You know, my dad and I,
we‐we barely even speak.

417
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:17,904
'If‐if I call the house,
and he picks up the phone'

418
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,340
he just says, "Hang on,
let me get your mother."

419
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:25,045
He put in 30 years,
and for what?

420
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,749
He still retired
as a captain.

421
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,351
'He just kept
getting passed over.'

422
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,754
I mean, he did every
crappy assignment

423
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,989
that the Navy wanted him to do

424
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,858
and it didn't matter.

425
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,392
He never got the nod.

426
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:40,460
Why not?

427
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:42,495
Probably..

428
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,399
...because of his
winning personality.

429
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:55,509
Alright!

430
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:59,513
Now all we need is popcorn.

431
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,018
‐ 'You ready?'
‐ No!

432
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:09,990
Hit this, and hit that.

433
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,493
'Is that you?'

434
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:14,528
Yup.

435
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,923
Your mom.

436
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:48,829
Yeah.

437
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,075
'1877.'

438
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,911
Alma Rodriguez Ruiz.

439
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:08,615
1846 to 1849.

440
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,517
She was only
three years old.

441
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,588
What are you
thinking about, Doug?

442
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,958
Carol.

443
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,128
I'm in love with her.

444
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,868
I mean, I used to think
I knew...what love was.

445
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,235
I cared about
a lot of women.

446
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,137
I just don't think
I've ever really been..

447
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:32,238
...in love.

448
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,709
I think about her all the time.

449
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,512
I don't like it
when I'm not with her.

450
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:40,814
I don't want to be
with anybody else.

451
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:43,917
‐ That's love, isn't it?
‐ Yeah, that's love.

452
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:46,587
Yeah, yeah.

453
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,923
It's going
to be hot today, huh?

454
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:51,858
It's November.
Can you believe this?

455
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,028
That's what I liked
about living in California.

456
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:56,963
‐ You used to live here?
‐ San Diego.

457
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,665
My parents still live there.

458
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,602
Your parents
live in San Diego?

459
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:04,771
Yeah. Lot of retired
Navy down there.

460
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:05,972
That's four hours from here.

461
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,208
We could be there
in, like, lunch time.

462
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,010
No, thanks.

463
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,645
When was the last time
you saw your folks?

464
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:13,714
18 months.

465
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:15,616
18 months? Okay.
Come on, we're going.

466
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:18,084
No, no, no. We got to see that,
uh, that funeral director‐‐

467
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,786
That can wait!

468
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,722
Doug, I made an
appointment for today.

469
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:24,858
My dad's not going
anyplace, Mark. Come on!

470
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:27,994
Nice.

471
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:29,195
Let's go to the
movies instead.

472
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,997
Ah, be in and out
in a couple of hours.

473
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,298
Are you kidding?

474
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,700
There's no such thing
as a quick visit

475
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,168
with my mom.

476
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,871
She's definitely going to insist
that we stay for dinner.

477
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,106
‐ Probably something fried.
‐ Sounds great.

478
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,142
Don't drink her iced tea
unless you wanna risk

479
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:43,844
lapsing immediately
into insulin shock.

480
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:45,245
I like sugar in my tea.

481
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:46,613
Yeah, oh, you want to get
on her good side?

482
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:47,781
Admire her hummels.

483
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,049
‐ She collects the‐‐
‐ Hummels?

484
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:50,250
Oh, believe me,
you'll know what it is.

485
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,251
Mm‐hmm.

486
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:54,921
Still have time
for a clean getaway.

487
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,823
‐ Hey.
‐ That's Jake.

488
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:58,024
‐ He doesn't bite.
‐ Hi, Jake.

489
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,260
'Hush, hush, Jake, quiet.'

490
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,730
Oh, my God.

491
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,165
‐ Hi, mom.
‐ What are you doing here?

492
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:06,733
Oh, we were just in
the neighborhood.

493
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,334
Oh, you were not.

494
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,670
Come on. Come on in.

495
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,804
This is my friend,
Doug Ross.

496
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:11,838
‐ Hi.
‐ Hello, Doug.

497
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,106
‐ How you doing?
‐ Come on in.

498
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,340
I got it. Jake.

499
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,678
Oh, my God, look at you.
You're so skinny.

500
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:18,845
Oh, well, I'm running again.

501
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,146
‐ Every day.
‐ Oh.

502
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,248
‐ Well, what are you doing here?
‐ Well, Doug‐‐

503
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:24,785
Why didn't you call
and tell us you were coming?

504
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,753
Well, Doug's father
passed away suddenly

505
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,121
and so, I came
out with him.

506
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:30,624
Oh, you poor thing.

507
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:33,226
‐ I'm so sorry.
‐ Well, thank you.

508
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:35,996
‐ Well, sit. Sit.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

509
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,831
I was just going
through the mail.

510
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,299
All these catalogs.

511
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,668
I always promise myself
that I'm not gonna look at them

512
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:42,903
'but I always do.'

513
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,638
'You know, you get
on these lists'

514
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,306
'and no matter who you beg,
you just can't get off.'

515
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,643
Well, you two must be thirsty.

516
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:50,811
Can I get you
something to drink?

517
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:52,245
I was just having
an iced tea.

518
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,648
‐ Water for me, mom.
‐ I'd love iced tea.

519
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:56,116
'When did you get in?'

520
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:57,618
Uh, yesterday.

521
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:59,052
'Yesterday?'

522
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:01,354
'And you didn't
call right away?'

523
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,656
Where are you staying?

524
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,391
Uh, Barstow, in a motel.

525
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,027
Not tonight, you're not.

526
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,294
You're going
to stay right here.

527
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,830
Wow.

528
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,998
Thanks, well...
that sounds great.

529
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,900
If we're not
putting you out...at all.

530
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,368
'Oh, absolutely.'

531
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,938
We have two guest rooms,
and never any guests.

532
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,007
Too much sugar?

533
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,308
'Mark always kids me'

534
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:23,343
about adding too much sugar.

535
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,945
No, it‐it's perfect.

536
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,748
Oh..

537
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,917
...how is my lovely Rachel?

538
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,654
She's wonderful,
and she misses you.

539
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:34,988
You're a good liar.

540
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:37,658
I bet she barely remembers me.

541
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:39,192
You know,
my son always says

542
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:40,360
that they're going
to come and visit

543
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,128
but I know that if I want to see

544
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,897
'my one and only granddaughter'

545
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:44,931
'I've got to get on a plane'

546
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,067
and go all the way to Chicago.

547
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,869
What's with
the oxygen, mom?

548
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,106
Uh...it's your father.

549
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,742
He's still smoking, you know.

550
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,178
Doctor says he's got to stop,
but he just won't.

551
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,814
Maybe you can talk
some sense into him.

552
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:03,416
You know the military.
Everybody smokes.

553
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,952
'They used to give
cigarettes out in C‐rations'

554
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,020
'for God's sake.'

555
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,421
Is it emphysema, mom?

556
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,791
Uh, yeah, well,
the doctor, yes..

557
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,292
...says something like that.

558
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:15,295
But it hasn't
slowed him down an inch.

559
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:17,230
Let me get another one.
This is too sweet.

560
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,999
I'm gonna...I'm gonna run
a couple of errands.

561
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:20,901
‐ But I'll be back.
‐ You're leaving already?

562
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,169
Yes. I'll be back
uh, for dinner

563
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,370
if the‐if the offer
still stands.

564
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,106
‐ Oh, of course.
‐ You're going?

565
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,473
Yes. Thank you
for the iced tea.

566
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:30,210
And the‐the hummels,
by the way, are beautiful.

567
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,212
‐ Oh, thanks.
‐ 'Beautiful.'

568
00:28:32,312 --> 00:28:33,279
Okay, bye.

569
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:36,783
He's a lovely boy.

570
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:39,786
Where's dad?

571
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:53,934
Dad?

572
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:56,469
Hello, dad.

573
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,209
Mark.

574
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,022
What the hell
are you doing here?

575
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,323
Came by with a friend.

576
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:21,928
You look good.

577
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:23,196
Thank you.

578
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,000
House looks great.

579
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,802
Yeah.

580
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:30,103
Keeps me busy.

581
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:34,040
I repainted the trim
a couple of days ago.

582
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,408
Looks nice.

583
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,112
There's no wind.

584
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:42,382
What?

585
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:44,050
You're cupping
your hand around there.

586
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,352
There's no wind.

587
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,522
Too many years on deck.

588
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,891
Hard habit to break.

589
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,129
You should
quit smoking anyway.

590
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,098
That's another hard
habit to break.

591
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,301
‐ Emphysema?
‐ Yes.

592
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:02,368
'You've seen your mother
already?'

593
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,804
They got you on oxygen?

594
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:06,439
I need help
living my life, Mark.

595
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,109
You'll be
the first person I call.

596
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:20,186
‐ Woodworking?
‐ 'Yeah.'

597
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:21,955
I needed a hobby.

598
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:23,389
Tried gardening for a while..

599
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,325
...but it was too
slow, you know.

600
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:27,093
Waiting around
for things to grow.

601
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,963
So I decided
to try furniture.

602
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:30,997
Nice work.

603
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:32,132
I'm making a dining room set

604
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:35,969
for your mother...Christmas.

605
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:37,504
I'm sure she'll like it.

606
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,081
Rachel's great.

607
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,251
She's, uh,
she's gotten bigger.

608
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,890
She's smarter than me,
or at least, she thinks she is.

609
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:02,095
That's kids for you.

610
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,998
'Well.'

611
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:07,133
I better get back to this.

612
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,468
Yeah, right.

613
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:53,346
Dad doesn't look good.

614
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:55,549
Well, we're all
getting older.

615
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:57,984
When was he diagnosed
with emphysema?

616
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,319
Here, honey.

617
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,287
Make yourself useful.

618
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,657
He's got to start taking
better care of himself, mom.

619
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:06,560
Mm. You know
your father.

620
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,995
How high is his
blood pressure?

621
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,631
He doesn't have
high blood pressure.

622
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:14,134
Mom, I saw the medications
in the bathroom.

623
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,703
Those are my pills, Mr. Nosy.

624
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:18,438
Since when do you have
high blood pressure?

625
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,507
Last year. I'm fine now.

626
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,943
130/90.

627
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:24,578
I took it yesterday
at the commissary.

628
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:26,346
At the base?

629
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,982
Yeah, on one of those
little machines.

630
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:31,284
I check it every time
I go shopping.

631
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,153
Do you have
your potassium checked?

632
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:35,689
‐ Oh, I'm sure I do.
‐ Mom, it's very important.

633
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,624
And it's not something
that you can have checked

634
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:39,259
at the base supermarket.

635
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,394
I appreciate this, honey,
but I have a doctor.

636
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:43,429
Ah, has your doctor
talked to you

637
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,431
about controlling
your salt intake?

638
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:48,535
Your father
won't eat bland food.

639
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,204
Believe me, mom, dad can live
a lot longer without salt

640
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:53,039
than he can without you.

641
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,474
Mark, we are both fine.

642
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:56,009
'I take my walks.'

643
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,678
I watch what I eat.

644
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:01,114
Now, stop being a doctor
and finish shucking those peas.

645
00:33:01,214 --> 00:33:03,349
‐ Whoa. Mom, mom, mom.
‐ Not a word!

646
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:06,486
I'm sorry your friend
couldn't make it

647
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:08,121
back in time for dinner.

648
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:09,422
Uh, I don't
think he realized

649
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:11,091
we'd be eating in the middle
of the afternoon.

650
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,393
Mm. I'll put a plate
in the fridge for him.

651
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:18,031
Remember the Orcas?

652
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:20,433
Bruce and Christina?

653
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:22,135
They live here now.

654
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:25,438
They had two boys about your age
when we were in Pensacola.

655
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,040
I don't think so.

656
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,576
Bruce was in Intelligence,
wasn't he, David?

657
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:30,611
Communi..

658
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,278
...Communications.

659
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:37,017
Their oldest boy Carl
is a flyer now.

660
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:39,586
Lieutenant commander
stationed up at, uh, Whidbey.

661
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,356
Has three little girls
of his own.

662
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:45,058
Yeah, well, say hello
to them for me.

663
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,126
'Mm‐hmm.'

664
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,197
So you two busy tonight?

665
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:53,567
Was thinking, maybe we could
go buy some ice cream.

666
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,335
There used to be that place
down on Mission Bay.

667
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,203
‐ Is it still there?
‐ I don't know.

668
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,705
I haven't
been down there in years.

669
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:00,440
I have to go
to the club tonight.

670
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,477
'You could go tomorrow night.'

671
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:06,079
I'm meeting Frank and Harry.

672
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,380
You can call them.

673
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,752
It's Thursday. We always
meet on Thursdays.

674
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:15,288
Well, this week,
you'll meet on Friday.

675
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:17,290
It's no big deal, mom.
We'll do it another time.

676
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,593
You two go.

677
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,628
Have a good time.

678
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,530
Mark, why don't you go
to the club with your dad?

679
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,165
‐ Mom, I think dad‐‐
‐ Mark wouldn't be comfortable.

680
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:27,400
No, I think you should
spend some time together.

681
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,136
You'd really enjoy it.

682
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,105
‐ You need the inhaler?
‐ No. I'm fine.

683
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:33,206
Albuterol?
I know where it is.

684
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:35,075
I'll get it.

685
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:36,142
No!

686
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:47,854
Your father doesn't like
to be helped, you know that.

687
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:58,464
He'll be alright
in a few minutes.

688
00:34:58,565 --> 00:35:01,401
I'll make him some hot tea. That
always makes him feel better.

689
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:24,290
'Several other
North County fires.'

690
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,160
'The blaze near Lake Hodges
destroyed two homes'

691
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,695
'and 1,200 acres.'

692
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,230
'It is completely
out now tonight'

693
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,898
'but fire fighters
are still on the lines'

694
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:34,300
'to make sure hot spots
don't flare up.'

695
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,769
Meanwhile, fire officials say

696
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,370
they'd like to see
new homes built

697
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,740
without wood roofs
and without landscaping

698
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,608
'within 100 feet.'

699
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,210
'Arson investigators
hope the $10,000 reward'

700
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,445
'leaves them to the person..'

701
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,147
'I'm quitting tonight.'

702
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:48,214
'I promise.'

703
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,750
Good.

704
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,553
You used to smoke.

705
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:54,555
Yes.

706
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:58,458
Until someone I know
hounded me into giving it up.

707
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,460
You were, what,
seven or eight?

708
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:02,863
We were living down
in Kings Bay in Georgia.

709
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,733
Every time I'd come home
with a pack

710
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,469
you'd steal it
and flush it down the toilet.

711
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,371
I was doing you a favor.

712
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:14,174
You were ruthless.
You wouldn't even lie to me.

713
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:16,910
You'd just march right in,
and tell me you'd done it.

714
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,045
I could have killed you.

715
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:26,386
He's asleep in there
in front of the TV.

716
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,789
You'd better wake him if he's
gonna make it to his club.

717
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:33,359
Oh, well..

718
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:36,563
...he only makes it about
half the time anymore anyway.

719
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:38,799
And his friends are worse.

720
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:40,967
Usually, he goes down there
and he's back home

721
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:44,304
in less than an hour because..

722
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:47,440
...nobody he knows shows up.

723
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,343
You still like
living near the base?

724
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:51,812
It's convenient.

725
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:55,516
All our friends
live nearby.

726
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:59,419
Your father's
got the club.

727
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,921
It's a nice life.

728
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:04,691
I know you never
liked it, but we do.

729
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,532
He misses you.

730
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:14,500
He'd never say so,
but he does.

731
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:15,769
He'd like to see you
more often..

732
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,638
...you and Rachel.

733
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,506
I love you, mom.

734
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:22,676
And I know you feel like
you have to defend him.

735
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:25,278
But dad doesn't think
about me or Rachel.

736
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:31,484
Your father loves you
very much, Mark.

737
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:34,688
He may not show it
in the way

738
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:37,490
that you want him to,
but he does.

739
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:40,727
I've never seen him
show it at all.

740
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:42,428
He's just not
built that way.

741
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:43,664
You've got to work
harder with him.

742
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,365
‐ I have to work harder.
‐ Yes.

743
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,267
Of course, mom, dad doesn't
have to do anything.

744
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:54,307
You've got some
wonderful traits, Mark.

745
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:56,276
But you always assume
that you know

746
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:58,444
more about everybody
and everything

747
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:00,046
than you actually do.

748
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:11,558
I've got some vanilla
ice cream in the freezer

749
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:12,859
and some fresh strawberries

750
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,861
if you still feel
like dessert.

751
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:23,069
Hey!

752
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,006
You missed dinner.

753
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:27,373
Drove up to Long Beach.

754
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:29,042
Checked out
that return address.

755
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:30,343
Anything?

756
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,612
Oh, hey, you know..

757
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:33,346
...it's not
my dad's kid.

758
00:38:33,446 --> 00:38:34,781
He's living in, uh, Arizona

759
00:38:34,881 --> 00:38:35,982
with the ex‐husband.

760
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:41,755
How's, uh...how's family life?

761
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:44,525
Dad's got emphysema.

762
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,593
I thought he was going
to cough himself to death

763
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:48,729
over the fried chicken.

764
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,697
Is he okay?

765
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:53,534
He's on inhaler, oxygen.
Seemed alright.

766
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:55,068
Is he getting
decent care?

767
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:56,770
I'm sure it's fine.

768
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,008
So why don't you
stay here for a while?

769
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:04,645
I'll...go back up
to Barstow by myself

770
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:06,012
and you spend
some time with him.

771
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:10,416
Yeah. Why bother?

772
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:14,688
You really
didn't miss much

773
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:15,989
not having
your father around

774
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:18,391
when you were
growing up, Doug?

775
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:19,593
Believe me.

776
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,798
That's kind of a..

777
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:28,001
...a crappy thing
to say, isn't it?

778
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,136
It wasn't my idea
to come down here.

779
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:31,772
Don't stay.

780
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,774
Don't worry, I won't.

781
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,676
I'm confused now. Your father's
still alive, right?

782
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:37,711
He's still with your mother?

783
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,981
So that's the criteria
for a good father...longevity?

784
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:42,516
Did he smack you around a lot

785
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:43,917
he used to smack
your mom around?

786
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:46,019
‐ Poor Doug.
‐ Uh, wait. "Poor Doug?"

787
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:48,021
Did your father, did he‐did he
come into your room

788
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:49,489
in the middle of the night,
throw up on your bed

789
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,924
and pass out? Did he do that?

790
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:53,426
Did he leave you
in a hallway in Atlantic City

791
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,461
while he screwed
some hat‐check girl, Mark?

792
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,496
Did he do that?

793
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,064
Did he do that, Mark?

794
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,604
Your father was there
for you every night

795
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:05,572
you and your mother,
and that's love.

796
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,741
And whether it's the way,
you want it or not..

797
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:10,143
...it's love, Mark.

798
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:12,445
You grew up in
Ozzie‐and‐Harriet land.

799
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:14,748
Get your head out of your ass.

800
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:50,314
I wrote Carol a note
this afternoon.

801
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,216
It's a card I saw at the gas
station. Reminded me of her.

802
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,252
Will you give it
to her for me?

803
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,255
‐ You're not going back with me?
‐ No.

804
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,857
That woman in Long Beach
gave me an address in Flagstaff.

805
00:41:00,957 --> 00:41:04,328
I think I'm gonna...
head over there.

806
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,230
Look up
my dad's wife's relatives

807
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,864
let them know what happened.

808
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:09,266
And the kid.

809
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,273
We should have
stayed the night.

810
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,886
Because..

811
00:41:17,986 --> 00:41:19,054
...It wasn't right to leave

812
00:41:19,154 --> 00:41:21,657
the way we did.

813
00:41:21,757 --> 00:41:24,493
I had no right to just
lose it like that.

814
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:26,127
No.

815
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:29,798
You were right about me.

816
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:32,568
I have been acting like a victim

817
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:35,671
feeling sorry for myself.

818
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:38,239
Self‐pity isn't one
of my more attractive..

819
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:39,808
...personality traits.

820
00:41:39,908 --> 00:41:41,743
Don't sell yourself short.

821
00:41:41,843 --> 00:41:44,713

You want to grab

Maybe a few hours of sleep

00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:05,821
No.

858
00:44:11,827 --> 00:44:14,395
I hated the son of a bitch.

859
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:16,933
And I loved him.

860
00:44:27,048 --> 00:44:28,890

861
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:35,013

00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:36,235
Yup.
