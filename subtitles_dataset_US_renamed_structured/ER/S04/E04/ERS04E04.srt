1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,207
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,475
I'm confident that
you'll make things work.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,144
Thank you for your trust.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,346
My teacher told me
I had talent but..

5
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:15,215
...he was just trying
to get into my pants.

6
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,250
And you trust me?

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,685
‐ This time.
‐ Ooh!

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,522
Deep, penetrating,
poorly visualized cavities.

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,323
I think that
should be off limits.

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,159
We don't usually refer to
our senior surgeons that way.

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,161
Oh, so, I should
stop speaking my mind.

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,830
I don't think that
taxpayers are interested

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,765
in buying Doris
a tox screen.

14
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,767
You were out there working
with us and you got AIDS?

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,669
I've got to get by
like everybody else.

16
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,640
'Hold on, hold on.'

17
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,343
Hey, I got stuck
on call today

18
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,147
so I got to drop this stuff off
and then head back, alright?

19
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,087
I couldn't get
anybody to cover for me.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,156
I've already taken
off so much time.

21
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,558
I gotta get you
a key if you're gonna be

22
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,259
coming in and out this early.

23
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,162
Yeah, yeah, that's
not a bad idea.

24
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,496
What is that?

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,798
Oh. It's oxygen.

26
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,800
Peter, this is getting
a little morbid.

27
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,669
Do we really need
all this stuff?

28
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,771
Breathing monitor,
devibilator?

29
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,173
No, no, no. Defibrillator.

30
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,211
They wouldn't be sending him
home if he was in any danger.

31
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,146
Look, paramedics take
an average of six minutes

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,615
to respond to a call,
now, if something happens

33
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,883
you need to know how
to start a resuscitation.

34
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,317
Come here.

35
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,386
Now, the mask
attaches to the Ambu bag

36
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,388
the Ambu bag to the tank.

37
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,824
Now, if he stops
breathing, call 911

38
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,726
and make sure his
airway is clear.

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,529
Then turn the oxygen
to ten liters per minute

40
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,897
and then bag him.

41
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,799
One squeeze every three seconds.

42
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,334
Now, if you
don't get a pulse, yo‐‐

43
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,570
100 chest compressions
per minute.

44
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,740
‐ I know. I know.
‐ Well, good.

45
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,543
You know, something happens
you're gonna be glad you know.

46
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,711
Go to work, Peter.

47
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,151
Alright, um...I'll, um..

48
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,220
'I‐I'll meet you
at the nursery at 10.'

49
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,722
You got somebody
to pick you up, right?

50
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,224
‐ I'll call my mom.
‐ Okay.

51
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,660
Oh. Um, don't forget
about the car seat.

52
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,161
Peter?

53
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,463
‐ Huh?
‐ It's gonna be alright.

54
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,234
Yeah.

55
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,940
How's it going, Doug?

56
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,575
Need some duct tape?

57
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,577
So that's what this is?
Is this an ego check?

58
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,346
No, no, no. This is about
spending time together.

59
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,681
I can think of
better activities.

60
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,449
I like to keep you
a little off balance.

61
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,819
Well, well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, Carol, but..

62
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,855
‐ You underestimate me.
‐ I don't think so.

63
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,256
It's easy,
it's like ice skating.

64
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,658
Yeah, until you have to stop.

65
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,960
‐ That's what lampposts are for.
‐ Doug, your helmet.

66
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,362
‐ Oh, no. No helmet.
‐ Safety first.

67
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,830
No, no, no.
You're not wearing a helmet.

68
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,633
No, don't, you're going
to mess the do. Don't.

69
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,934
And you wear
that on purpose?

70
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,670
Just skate, Tonya.

71
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,605
Alright, Mr. Crash.

72
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,740
Crash? I'm not going to cr..

73
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,778
'Mark, are you there?'

74
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,950
'Mark?'

75
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,385
Who is it?

76
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,588
'It's me, Jen.'

77
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,657
Just a sec.

78
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,634
‐ 'Something wrong?'
‐ No, no. I got it.

79
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,868
Come on in.

80
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,742
‐ Sleep in your clothes?
‐ No.

81
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:33,379
‐ What's that?
‐ Uh, it's a infomercial thing.

82
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,881
Sorry, I wasn't
expecting visitors.

83
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,950
Uh, what's up?

84
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,419
Rachel fell asleep
in class Monday.

85
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,623
She said her daddy kept her up
watching movies all weekend.

86
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,891
You never went out,
you ordered pizza every night.

87
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,359
What, you came here
to tell me how to spend time

88
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,561
with my daughter?

89
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,262
It's getting to her.

90
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,932
She's nervous and her
stomach hurts all the time.

91
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,334
‐ She's worried about you.
‐ She is?

92
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,270
I am. Look at this place, Mark.

93
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,939
I mean, it's perfectly
normal to be frightened

94
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,406
after something
like that happens.

95
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,275
Oh, don't try
to fix me, Jen, okay?

96
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,544
It's not your job anymore.

97
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,612
Want to sit down?

98
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,446
Fine.

99
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,617
I'm not dropping
Rachel off this weekend.

100
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,653
Don't come to the house
expecting to pick her up.

101
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,888
You can't keep me
from seeing my daughter.

102
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,657
You need some time
to work this out

103
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,958
until you're more yourself.

104
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,393
Hey, Jen, look,
I am her father, okay?

105
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,263
And she loves you, but
you're hurting her right now.

106
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm doing you a favor, Mark.

107
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,470
Call me when you have
your life back together.

108
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,863
I feel happy.

109
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,565
I feel healthy.

110
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,637
‐ I feel terrific.
‐ I'm glad.

111
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,871
Nice pep talk.

112
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,472
Motivational tapes?

113
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,775
Success is 99% attitude.

114
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,044
Really? I guess that
makes me a miserable failure.

115
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,747
No, no. Failure is
a state of mind.

116
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,615
Tell me you didn't
pay for that advice.

117
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,951
I just figured I didn't get
off to a great start this year.

118
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,953
Unless I change
my approach..

119
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,421
...I'm gonna hate every
minute of my internship.

120
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,623
What are you doin'?

121
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,592
Oh, uh, somatic presentation.

122
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,126
Boring, but, uh,
they had a great buffet.

123
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,762
Free pen lights,
I snagged you a couple.

124
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:02,996
Hey.

125
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,799
See? It's working already.

126
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,934
‐ New pups are waiting outside.
‐ Excellent.

127
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,006
‐ Good morning.
‐ Good morning.

128
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,841
Hi. John Carter.

129
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,044
Welcome to what promises to be
your most exciting rotation.

130
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,146
‐ You are?
‐ James Sasic.

131
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,616
‐ Ivan Fu.
‐ Ivan, good to meet you. Jim.

132
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,985
‐ James.
‐ James.

133
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,654
Right, I assume you've
met, uh, Anna Del Amico.

134
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,756
Great, let's get
started, shall we?

135
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,091
Hey, Chuny, what have you got

136
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,193
for a couple
of eager new med students?

137
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,895
A four‐f with
abdominal pain, in three.

138
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,096
Four‐f?

139
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,164
Female, fertile, fat, and forty.

140
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,566
Add flighty
and flatulent to that.

141
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,767
Always nice
to start off the morning

142
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:41,968
with a round of gallstones.

143
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,670
Follow me, men.

144
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,038
We call him Sergeant Sunshine.

145
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,840
'That was a nasty bump.'

146
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,174
You're lucky I have a hard head.

147
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,644
‐ Ouch! What happened?
‐ Sports accident.

148
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,547
‐ He won't be specific.
‐ A testosterone injury?

149
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,749
Yeah, yeah. He who laughs
last, laughs hardest.

150
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,051
‐ I'll remember that.
‐ Hey, Mark, how you doing?

151
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,687
Nothing new here, I stay up
too late, don't go out enough

152
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,456
order pizza,
watch too much TV.

153
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,025
Huh, uh, what‐what is that?

154
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,492
I don't know,
he's a little cranky I guess.

155
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,694
What else is new?

156
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,130
‐ Turn it up.
‐ What?

157
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,566
Cops are chasing
some dude on a motorcycle.

158
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,734
Again?

159
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,637
That's so stupid.

160
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,839
At least he's wearing a helmet.

161
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,541
‐ Do you have a minute?
‐ Yeah.

162
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,042
‐ I'd like to compliment you.
‐ On what?

163
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,244
Your fellowship
pediatric proposal

164
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,847
and pediatric PCA,
it's very intriguing.

165
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,716
‐ Where'd you get that?
‐ Department of pediatrics.

166
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,252
Allowing children to control
their own pain medication

167
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,154
is very much
ahead of its time.

168
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,722
Thank you.

169
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,591
Yeah, of course,
it has been three years.

170
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,225
It's a shame you
never finished it.

171
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,496
UC, San Diego is actually
implementing the idea.

172
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,532
‐ Oh, I didn't know that.
‐ Yeah. Take a look.

173
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,734
Unfortunately, they've already
proven your original thesis

174
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:51,572
but you could use their data to
develop a smaller clinical study

175
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,540
say, PCA in
the emergency department.

176
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,543
Clinical studies were never
really my strong suit, Kerry.

177
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,746
Well, if you already have
something else, then go with it.

178
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,247
I've taken the liberty
of outlining a research

179
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,216
and grant application schedule.

180
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,052
And I would be happy to review
any material before submission.

181
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,754
Kerry, I appreciate it, I do.

182
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:11,024
But, um, I can
handle this on my own.

183
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,626
You know, if that were
true you would have been

184
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,027
done a long time ago.

185
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,762
I'm serious, Doug.

186
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,799
The ER cannot continue
to pay for a pediatric fellow.

187
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,101
You need to find research
grant to cover your salary

188
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:24,104
before the end of the year
or look toward private practice.

189
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:27,974
What's this?

190
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,912
This is my eviction notice. Ow!

191
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,279
So which student
do you want?

192
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,715
Oh, it doesn't matter.

193
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,182
Come on, you got
boned last time.

194
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,684
‐ I'll give you dibs.
‐ No, really, you choose.

195
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,185
Either one is
gonna be great.

196
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,288
Careful, doctor, blind optimism
will screw you every time.

197
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,857
Well, what have you got?

198
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,326
A 41‐year‐old female
with low‐grade fever.

199
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,130
Anxious, complains of gas,
and right upper quadrant pain.

200
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,832
And what do you wanna do?

201
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,802
Get a CBC and order an
ultrasound to confirm thickening

202
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:59,039
of gall bladder wall and/or
common bile duct dilation.

203
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:04,044
Hmm. And what are the other
two borders of Calot's triangle?

204
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,848
‐ Excuse me?
‐ The common duct and..

205
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,316
The cystic duct
in the liver.

206
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,785
Right.

207
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,119
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what have we got?

208
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,155
Jeremy Willis,
isolated right leg injury.

209
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,257
‐ 19 going on infinity.
‐ Say again?

210
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,659
He thinks he's an angel.

211
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,260
Flew into traffic.

212
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,862
Can you feel this, Jeremy?

213
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,063
He walked against the signal.

214
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,765
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

215
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,167
He can't see me,
but I'm always there.

216
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,102
Distal neuro's intact.

217
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,104
Bad hair day, huh?

218
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,973
Um, I'm trying
to grow it out.

219
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,108
Let's not
humor him, huh, Lily?

220
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,844
Let's get a right tib‐fib
and a knee series.

221
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,312
Yeah, looks like you've
got a fracture, Jeremy.

222
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,747
We're going to have
to get some X‐rays.

223
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,049
So much pain.

224
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,685
We'll get you some morphine.

225
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,352
Titrate it up to ten.

226
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:50,023
And let's get
a psych consult. Exam one.

227
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,193
'Carla, over here.'

228
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,928
Hey, I thought your mother
was picking you up.

229
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,730
She couldn't get off work.

230
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,765
Relax, Peter, Daphina is
just driving me home.

231
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,033
Hold on, does she still smoke?

232
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,401
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

233
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,103
'I got to get this,
okay, alright.'

234
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,838
Smile!

235
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,674
'Ha ha. That's great.'

236
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,877
Hey, daddy, you
must be so excited!

237
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,112
‐ Yeah.
‐ Peter?

238
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,883
Hold it, hold it. Hey.

239
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,952
Listen, um,
I get off at 7:00.

240
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,187
I'll be to your place
no later than 8:00, okay?

241
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,957
Don't you want
to kiss him goodbye?

242
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,258
Yes, I do.

243
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,865
Peter?

244
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,333
'Is this your baby?'

245
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,201
‐ Here, I got him.
‐ Uh, yeah.

246
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,703
He's being discharged today.

247
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,672
‐ Oh, a newborn.
‐ Easy. Easy!

248
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,274
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Careful, careful.

249
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,344
You certainly are the
secretive sort, I had no idea.

250
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,079
Oh, um, Dr. Corday
is new here.

251
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,683
Dr. Corday, this is Carla.
Carla, this is Dr. Corday.

252
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,185
‐ Don't you look fantastic.
‐ I had the baby in May.

253
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,453
He's been in the NICU.

254
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,021
Oh, but he's alright now?

255
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fine.

256
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,991
'Good.'

257
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,160
Well, I'll see you upstairs.

258
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,263
‐ Wonderful meeting you.
‐ Same here.

259
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,199
All set.

260
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,401
‐ You gotta go.
‐ Yeah, uh, I know.

261
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,236
Uh, Carla, I need to..

262
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,738
You gotta go.

263
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,840
‐ Yeah, Carla..
‐ I'll see you later.

264
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,209
Carla..

265
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,187
When did the asthma flare up?

266
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,222
He's bad since last night.

267
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,924
And he's been
using his puffer?

268
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,026
Yes, how much longer
for the doctor?

269
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,494
I am the doctor,
Mrs. Landeta.

270
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,197
Could you sit back
for me, Jaime, sweetie?

271
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,867
Okay. 2.5 milligrams
of albuterol.

272
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,504
‐ Is that sore?
‐ A little.

273
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,839
Has anyone ever
taken a stool sample?

274
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,108
Get Dr. Ross, he always
makes him feel better.

275
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,743
Dr. Ross isn't
available right now.

276
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,044
I saw him.

277
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,946
Yes, but I'm your
doctor today, ma'am.

278
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,025
'How's our fugitive doing?'

279
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:00,331
'He just got on
the Eisenhower.'

280
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:02,456
‐ Big mistake.
‐ They have him now.

281
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,990
Come on, people,
we're getting backed up.

282
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:05,892
You can watch it
on the 5 o'clock news.

283
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,461
‐ Dr. Ross.
‐ Yeah?

284
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,930
Dr. Ross, you have
to see my grandson.

285
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,365
‐ He's very sick.
‐ Okay, where is he?

286
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,966
‐ Come, come, I take you.
‐ Okay.

287
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,302
I asked this lady for you
but she don't let me see you.

288
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,603
‐ Uh..
‐ It's bad, huh?

289
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:17,971
Oh, no, I'm sure
he's gonna be fine.

290
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,773
Dr. Del Amico here
can handle it.

291
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,276
You're gonna help
him, huh, you are.

292
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,845
‐ You can?
‐ Uh, uh, okay.

293
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:28,282
No problema, doctor,
I'll take it from here.

294
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,450
Sure, no problema.

295
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,520
Acute asthma,
peak flow's 90.

296
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,056
Some generalized
abdominal tenderness.

297
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,757
Okay, I got it.

298
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,825
Jaime and I know
the drill, right, champ?

299
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,361
Yeah.

300
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:43,797
‐ See you, kiddo.
‐ We'll warm this up.

301
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,732
Al?

302
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,301
Hey, wh‐what are you doing here?

303
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,902
I'm getting
my stitches out.

304
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,638
Now?

305
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:55,909
I really didn't have
anything else to do.

306
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,812
What happened?

307
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,581
Well, I showed up
at the new site

308
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,050
and the foreman said
that there must have been

309
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,851
some kind of mix‐up.

310
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:09,623
Said he was maxed out,
didn't need any more guys.

311
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,858
Al, I'm sorry.

312
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,928
Hey, look,
the guy's a jerk.

313
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,963
You'll find something else.

314
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,899
Not in construction.

315
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,669
Every contractor in Chicago
will hear that I have AIDS.

316
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:26,540
Al, look, I know
this is hard for you.

317
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,409
It was hard for me
and I work in medicine

318
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:32,013
where people understand,
but it gets better.

319
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:35,982
No one wonders
how you got it.

320
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:38,519
I used to be
one of those guys.

321
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,554
We tell fag jokes.

322
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,425
Believe me.

323
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,462
It won't get any better.

324
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,868
Yeah, you want to pull
the skin a little bit tighter.

325
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,404
You don't want
the vein to roll on you.

326
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:58,739
Great. Okay, you're ready
to stick her.

327
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,007
This is gonna hurt, right?

328
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,942
Nah, she's gorked out,
she's not gonna feel..

329
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,877
Carter, you page me
for a consult?

330
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,679
Ah, Dr. Benton, I'd like
you to meet Ivan Fu

331
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,081
'my new med student.'

332
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,783
I was Dr. Benton's
medical student

333
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,852
and I'm proud to say
I lived to tell the tale.

334
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,587
‐ Carter..
‐ Uh, not here.

335
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,522
Curtain area three.
Acute cholecystitis.

336
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,924
Uh, temp's up to 102.
White count's 28,000.

337
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,926
‐ Positive Murphy's sign.
‐ Uh‐huh, ultrasound?

338
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,128
Still waiting.

339
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:22,663
But, Carter, you paged me.

340
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,665
Uh, yeah, well,
it's been over an hour.

341
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,133
We both know what
it's gonna look like.

342
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,602
She needs an ultrasound
to confirm

343
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,903
that she's
a surgical candidate.

344
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,038
Ah, I've seen
enough cases to know.

345
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:32,473
I thought you
might want this one.

346
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,475
I've got three
in‐patient consults waiting.

347
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,943
You get an ultrasound, page me.

348
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,681
The labs are in,
and I got the history on four.

349
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,483
‐ Great.
‐ Well, now what?

350
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:45,086
Lunch. I'll see you
in about half hour.

351
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,553
Yo, how'd you ever
go out with that guy?

352
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:47,754
‐ What guy?
‐ Ross.

353
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,190
Didn't you used to date him?

354
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,025
I mean, if he's that patronizing
to me, I can't imagine

355
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,626
what he's like to
the women he goes out with.

356
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,994
He's seen that patient before.

357
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:55,629
Mrs. Landeta's just
comfortable with him.

358
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:56,830
Yeah, because he's a man.

359
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,465
Well, some people
are old‐fashioned.

360
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,934
Doug has difficulty
dealing with strong women.

361
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,536
I don't know about that.

362
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,638
If he can't charm
or vilify you, he's lost.

363
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,773
‐ Now, that's not true.
‐ I'll talk to him.

364
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,575
No, no, that's okay. I will.

365
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,444
I don't feel good.

366
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,079
‐ What's the problem?
‐ I hurt.

367
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:13,514
Have you seen
the triage nurse?

368
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,616
The bitch
never came back!

369
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,584
‐ What's your name?
‐ Doris.

370
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:18,819
Doris, go take
a seat over there.

371
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,087
I'll be with you
as soon as I can.

372
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,156
I been sitting over there!

373
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,858
This is county
on one alpha, go ahead.

374
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,527
'County, this is rescue 56.'

375
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,562
'We're on the scene
of a multi‐victim accident.'

376
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,198
'High speed chase,
auto versus school bus.'

377
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:32,733
'How many can you handle?'

378
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,868
We can take three major,
ten minor. Over.

379
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,470
Oh, my God!

380
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,872
...have arrived at the scene..

381
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,907
Connie, grab the trauma
rooms and curtain two.

382
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,477
Set up the rapid infusers
with warm saline.

383
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,878
Mobilize the blood bank.

384
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,148
Carter, clear out all
noncritical patients.

385
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,649
‐ How many?
‐ I don't know yet.

386
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,085
Cynthia. Cynthia, call the OR.

387
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,853
Tell them we have
a mass casualty alert.

388
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,521
Has anyone seen Mark?

389
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:23,550
Second unit's in, DPL positive.
Probable ruptured spleen.

390
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,152
‐ Shall I take him?
‐ No, no. Anspaugh's on the way.

391
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:28,155
‐ Don't forget the films.
‐ Ah, X‐rays, X‐rays.

392
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:30,257
‐ Come on. Clear!
‐ What happened?

393
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,992
Cop chasing some guy
plowed into a bus

394
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:33,927
full of junior high kids
on a field trip.

395
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,629
Who was that and where
are they taking him?

396
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,798
‐ I don't know.
‐ Has anyone seen Matthew?

397
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,234
He wasn't in his seat.
He was showing Sal his gecko.

398
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,169
I told him to leave
the stupid lizard at home.

399
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:44,105
Ma'am, you should really sit
down until somebody can look..

400
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:45,706
I am their teacher.

401
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,941
I need to know where
every one of them is.

402
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,543
I‐I'm accountable.

403
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,844
Um, do you have
the parents' phone numbers?

404
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,179
‐ At the school.
‐ Okay.

405
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:53,214
Okay, maybe you should
call and get them.

406
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,648
Phone's right over there.

407
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,816
I said we could handle
three majors

408
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:56,850
you give us 10.

409
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,552
‐ Carol. Carol!
‐ Here, Chuny.

410
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,154
Make sure
no one else comes.

411
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,788
Pulseless and apneic
on our arrival.

412
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,025
Asystole. Head, chest,
abdominal trauma.

413
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:06,760
Angulated tib‐fib fracture.
Pupils midrange and sluggish.

414
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,595
Couldn't get a line, so we
intubated, scooped and ran.

415
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:09,796
What happened to him?

416
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,265
Ejected from
the emergency exit door.

417
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,234
No seat belts
on those buses.

418
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:16,303
Whoa, whoa.
Back up, Carter, back up.

419
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,172
He's stable, let's go.

420
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,041
How bad over there?

421
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:21,975
I'm fine, get this
kid behind me..

422
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,979
Kerry, 14‐year‐old male,
head trauma.

423
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:27,948
Multiple facial lacs.

424
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,150
Asking repetitive questions.

00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:32,186
BP 115/70, pulse 110,
resps 20.

426
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,787
‐ Wh‐what happened?
‐ Name?

427
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,222
Can you tell
me your name?

428
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:37,858
‐ Brian.
‐ Can you open your eyes, Brian?

429
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:40,761
Coming through!

430
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,163
She's got a near amputation
right above the left elbow

431
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,165
hanging on by
a two‐centimeter skin bridge.

432
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:47,201
BP's down 70/30.
Pulse is only 32.

433
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,870
Estimated blood loss
at the scene is 750cc's.

434
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,039
‐ I got 500cc's saline.
‐ Fu, grab the arm!

435
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,674
‐ It hurts!
‐ I know, honey.

436
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:56,710
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three.

437
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,814
CBC, type and cross for four.

438
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,616
Cath her and dip
a urine for blood.

439
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,651
Portable chest,
cross‐table C‐spine

440
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:06,120
pelvis and left
upper extremity.

441
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,322
Cap refill's poor.
Bolus another liter of saline.

442
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,723
Hey. Hey! I need that!

443
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,795
Let's get five migs
of epi down the tube.

444
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,163
‐ Got the line in.
‐ It's going.

445
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:17,731
Alright, give it IV.

446
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,234
Hang a unit of O‐neg
on the rapid infuser.

447
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,403
‐ Oh, man.
‐ What?

448
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,405
‐ A lizard.
‐ It's a gecko.

449
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,040
'Rachel wanted one.'

450
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,241
Anybody need a surgeon?

451
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,077
He will, if we bring him back.

452
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,678
Four by four and some saline.

453
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:34,748
Got a second line in.

454
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,683
BP's 80/50, pulse 112.

455
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:38,185

456
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,187
‐ Alright, what do we got?
‐ Isolated crush injury.

457
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:41,855
‐ Primary survey?
‐ In progress.

458
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,324
Ivan, A‐B‐C‐D‐E?

Airway, breathing, circulation,
disability, and expose.

460
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,361
Alright, can you
tell me your name?

461
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,763
My arm is falling off!

462
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,997
If she can talk,
she has an airway.

463
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:52,299
Can we save it?

464
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,101
‐ I'm gonna try.
‐ What are you doing?

465
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:56,003
We have to get your arm on ice
and control the bleeding.

466
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:59,040
‐ You're cutting my arm off!
‐ So we can reattach it.

467
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:02,109
‐ Pulse ox 98% on ten liters.
‐ Come on, come on, come on.

468
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:03,844
Move, move, move!
Here we go.

469
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,146
Come here, sweetheart.
Come here, come here, come here.

470
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,180
Just squeeze my hand, okay?

471
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,748
Come on, squeeze my hand.

472
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,216
Good. Squeeze.

473
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,817
Good, good.

474
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,019
Call neuro.

475
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:14,888
Draw a trauma panel.

476
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,423
Pupils are sluggish.

477
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:18,692
Let's intubate before
we ship him to CT.

478
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,328
‐ Responds to pain.
‐ 110/60. Pulse 95.

479
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:22,729
Come on. Rapid induction.

480
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,166
Versed three,
IV push. Let's go.

481
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,467
Hey, hey, I need some help here.

482
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,968
‐ He can't breathe.
‐ What happened?

483
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:29,236
Uh, we were installing
a satellite dish

484
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,704
and he fell off the roof.

485
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,106
Did he hit his head
and lose consciousness?

486
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:33,940
‐ I don't know.
‐ Okay, Versed's onboard.

487
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:35,242
Jeanie, take him
to curtain three.

488
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:36,743
I'll get there as soon as I can.

489
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:40,747
0.5 of Pavulon, 75 of sux.

490
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,284
‐ No pulse with compressions.
‐ Pupils are fixed and dilated.

491
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,219
‐ Get another blood gas.
‐ Check his chest.

492
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,388
We're not gonna get
anywhere with a blunt trauma.

493
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,490
We're not getting
anywhere with him now.

494
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,826
He's a kid, Mark.

495
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,362
‐ Alright.
‐ Thoracotomy tray.

496
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:57,931
‐ Can I have my X‐rays, please?
‐ Medicate that girl for pain?

497
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,200
‐ She's had morphine.
‐ Not enough.

498
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,435
‐ Initial crit's 28.
‐ Repeat it.

499
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,337
Stat‐page
the reimplantation team.

500
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,838
Somebody call the OR
and book a room.

501
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,040
Come on, Fu. Move, move, move!

502
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,009
Carter, corral your student.

503
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:09,510
Help me with this
pressure dressing.

504
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,945
‐ Oh, we got a pumper here.
‐ O2 stat's falling.

505
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,247
BP's 70/40.

506
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,216
Give her a unit of blood.

507
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,118
Carter. Carter,
get him out of here.

508
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:18,319
Call Weaver. Go.

509
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:21,322
Get him out of here,
Carter, now!

510
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:22,823
Come on.

511
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,761
Sit down, put your head between
your legs and don't move.

512
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,099
Carter, can you
help me with a crike?

513
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:34,135
‐ 'Yep.'
‐ I can't see the cords.

514
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,369
There's too much blood.

515
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,937
How about
a retrograde intubation?

516
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,540
‐ Have you ever done one?
‐ I've seen one.

517
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,042
Open up a central line kit.

518
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,310
Pulse ox 92, BP 100/70.

519
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:46,480
‐ Ricky, get your mother.
‐ Relax, dad.

520
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,515
‐ Everything's gonna be fine.
‐ Diminished breath sounds.

521
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,917
‐ Hyper resonant to percussion.
‐ Hey, what does that mean?

522
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,829
He could have a collapsed lung,
I need a portable chest.

523
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:57,458
‐ Any tamponade?
‐ Nope. Pericardium's dry.

524
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,093
Start internal massage.

525
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:00,327
Got it.

526
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,528
Pulse?

527
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,130
Barely.

528
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:04,798
‐ Cross clamp the aorta.
‐ Satinsky.

529
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,800
‐ Where's the Satinsky?
‐ I'll get another tray.

530
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,377
‐ Here, take this to trauma two.
‐ Wait. Where?

531
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,179
It's straight ahead.

532
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,417
Doris?

533
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,087
‐ Carol told me to bring this.
‐ Put it right there.

534
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,588
Push another mig of atropine.

535
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,391
‐ Suction. I can't see.
‐ 'I'll retract the lung.'

536
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:32,059
‐ 'There you go. It's clamped.'
‐ Pulse ox is falling.

537
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:34,295
‐ Dad? Dad!
‐ He's unresponsive.

538
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:35,996
‐ What's happening?
‐ Sir, you should wait outside.

539
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,198
It's a tension pneumo. Connie!

540
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:38,565
We need a doctor in here now.

541
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,134
Fortune gauge, I'll needle
decompress him.

542
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,003
Pulse weak and thready,
BP 60 palp.

543
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:43,970
‐ He needs a chest tube.
‐ Well, then give him one!

544
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,143
Dr. Greene, Jeanie needs you
in curtain three, right now.

545
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:51,512
In a minute.
Got a boy's heart in my hand.

546
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:58,985
Damn, it hurts!

547
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,388
Where does it hurt, Doris?
Where does it hurt?

548
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:03,057
My stomach!

549
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,159
‐ I have to dump.
‐ Doris, are you pregnant?

550
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:07,628
No!

551
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,163
Doris, you're having a baby!

552
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,865
‐ What?
‐ Don't push! Blow! You blow!

553
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,501
I don't have to blow!
I have to dump. Ow!

554
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:18,105
BOA in exam four!
I need a doctor! Now!

555
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:19,606
She's crowning!

556
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,044
Alright, just don't push!
Don't push, Doris. Don't push!

557
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,250
Oh, my God!

558
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:34,921
'I need some help in here!'

559
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:36,457
'My baby! I had a baby!'

560
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,492
‐ He's not breathing.
‐ Alright, sit back.

561
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,960
Sit back and relax, okay‐‐

562
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,662
She dropped it!
She dropped my baby!

563
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,297
Just relax.
Just relax, ma'am.

564
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,566
‐ Clamp.
‐ Ah! What's happening?

565
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,567
Ma'am, just sit back and relax.

566
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,102
'No respiratory effort.'

567
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,470
What's happening?
What's wrong with it?

568
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:53,307
Is it breathing? Is it dead?

569
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,641
No palpable pulse.

570
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,210
Alright, starting
compressions. Bag him.

571
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:57,678
What did you do to him?

572
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,613
‐ What happened?
‐ That bitch dropped my baby!

573
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:02,549
Grab a pediatric
intubation tray, 2.5.

574
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,685
Draw .02 migs of epi.

575
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:08,389
I'll tube him.
You start an umbilical line.

576
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:10,157
Come on, Peter, now. Let's go.

577
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:11,325
Scalpel.

578
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,627
Where the hell are the doctors?

579
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,928
Long Kelly.

580
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,565
Dammit.
I can't find the tract.

581
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,267
Chuny, come here, I need you
to put your finger in there

582
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:21,935
and make sure the lung's
away from the chest wall.

583
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,070
I've never done that.

584
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,471
Well, you do it.

585
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,041
What are you waiting for?
You do it!

586
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,678
Dammit!

587
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,547
Pulse ox isn't reading.

588
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,082
Okay, I'm in.

589
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:36,683
Another epi.
Double it. IV.

590
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:38,419
Ah! I'm having another one!

591
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:39,620
‐ Mark.
‐ You got it?

592
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:41,555
Yeah, go.

593
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,157
Don't drop this one!

594
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:46,527
You're not having
another baby.

595
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,296
You have to deliver a placenta.
I want you to push.

596
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,431
She said not to push!

597
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:52,433
I want you to push now!

598
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:55,502
Tube's in. Good breath sounds.
Nice trick, Carter.

599
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,104
‐ CT Ready?
‐ I'll check.

600
00:23:57,138 --> 00:23:59,206
Hey. Hey, you got
to help that woman.

601
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,507
I don't think she knows
what she's doing.

602
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,243
‐ What's wrong?
‐ Well, he's dying.

603
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,677
I'll be right there.

604
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,379
'Atropine on board.'

605
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:07,714
Alright, hold compressions.

606
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:08,749
Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,117
Just lie still.
Lie still.

608
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,353
Max the epi, .15 migs.

609
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,587
Blood sugar's only 20.

610
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,755
What's the glucose dose?

611
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,391
Uh, 10% DW, 20cc's.

612
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:18,725
I'll get it.

613
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,562
Carol, she's bleeding.
Get an IV in her.

614
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,530
Two liters, wide open.
Add ten of Pitocin.

615
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,199
Hey, what are you doing?

616
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:27,101
No. I don't want this nurse.
Get me a new nurse.

617
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,135
Any response?

618
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:30,037
No. Nothing.

619
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:32,506
Come on, man.
Come on.

620
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,208
I can't get it.

621
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:35,676
'He's breathing down
losing the pulse.'

622
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,078
Please, God.
Please, God.

623
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:42,083
‐ Got it.
‐ Where are we, Jeanie?

624
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:43,317
Chest tube.
Tension hemo‐pneumo.

625
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,519
I sent for a doctor.
No one came.

626
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,288
The tube's in.
Hook me up.

627
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,190
‐ Is he okay?
‐ Pulse is coming up.

628
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:51,592
You dissected this tract
with a Kelly clamp, right?

629
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:54,761
No. It wouldn't thread.
I had to use my finger.

630
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:56,397
Thank you, Jeanie.
I'll take it from here.

631
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,464
‐ Go triage.
‐ Kerry‐‐

632
00:24:57,498 --> 00:24:59,333
Now, Jeanie.

633
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,702
Thoraseal to suction,
0‐silk.

634
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:06,773
‐ 'Get 0‐4.'
‐ 'Got some four by fours.'

635
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:17,151
'You got extension tubing?'

636
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:22,789
How high can we go
with the epi?

637
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:25,359
‐ How many rounds of atropine?
‐ Two.

638
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:30,231
Forget it.

639
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:32,433
He's not responding to anything.
I'm calling it.

640
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:36,137
Peter.

641
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,172
That's it.
He never had a chance.

642
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,248
Time of death, 12:36.

643
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,818
Spin a crit.
Type and cross match for four.

644
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:54,388
'I'll be back.'

645
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,436
'Three fifty. Clear.'

646
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:15,409
Everything okay here, Kerry?

647
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:17,244
Yeah, we got it.

648
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:19,113
Dr. Weaver, neuro's
gonna meet us in PICU

649
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:21,148
after the head CT.

650
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:22,683
'Peter, are you coming?'

651
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:23,684
Peter!

652
00:26:33,527 --> 00:26:36,363
Hey, Carla, it's me.

653
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,699
How's the baby?

654
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,268
No, no, no.
Everything's fine.

655
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:42,336
How is he?

656
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:45,406
Tell me if you
feel one poke or two.

657
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,208
Two.

658
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,276
Two. One.

659
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,612
You shouldn't draw on
your body in a moving vehicle.

660
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:52,779
Now you tell me.

661
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:54,848
It's a good cartoon, though.

662
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:56,717
Okay, let's get a hand series,
a gram of Ancef

663
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,252
and a tetanus booster.

664
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,620
Aren't you gonna
pull it out?

665
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:01,322
Not just yet.

666
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:04,658
We want to get an X‐ray
and numb your hand first.

667
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:07,161
Think I could sue for this?

668
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,229
I'm serious.

669
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:10,231
I was gonna go to art school.

670
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:12,199
I should be able
to sue somebody.

671
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,368
Great technique back there,
Carter. Where did you learn it?

672
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,937
Oh, uh, Dr. Benton showed me.

673
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,739
Well, you were lucky
to have him as a teacher.

674
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:20,374
It's serving you well.

675
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,882
How's that new attitude
of yours holding up?

676
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:30,484
Oh, maybe
I'll start tomorrow.

677
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:31,852
What happened to Ivan?

678
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:35,222
He's in the lounge
re‐evaluating his career choice.

679
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:37,491
Teacher ID'd him
as, uh, Matthew Blevins.

680
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:39,660
Make sure that you get me as
soon as his parents get here.

681
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,762
‐ He‐he died, didn't he?
‐ Yeah, he did.

682
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:42,896
‐ Hi.
‐ Hey.

683
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:44,265
You wanna talk
to me about something?

684
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:45,966
‐ Nope. It can wait.
‐ Okay.

685
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,269
Listen, I'm sorry that
I barged in on the asthma kid.

686
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:49,703
His grandma knows me.

687
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:51,638
What asthma kid?

688
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:52,639
Yeah.

689
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:56,610
Wow. What happened?

690
00:27:56,643 --> 00:27:58,412
How was lunch?

691
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:00,247
You were lucky,
Officer Mulvahill.

692
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:02,683
Your cervical spine's normal.

693
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,251
Yeah.

694
00:28:04,285 --> 00:28:08,289
But your wrist
may require some surgery.

695
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:10,524
Orthopedic surgeon
will be down shortly.

696
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:11,892
Here you go.

697
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:17,364
Mr. Mulvahill.

698
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:18,899
How bad is it?

699
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:22,803
It might require
a couple of pins.

700
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,372
Not me.

701
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:27,874
The kids.

702
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:28,975
How bad are the kids?

703
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:33,614
Some are very serious

704
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:37,451
but we were able to save
just about everybody.

705
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:43,390
Just about?

706
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,594
Let me tie off
this bleeder.

707
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:54,401
Hmm. The marines have arrived.

708
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,537
Cut.

709
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,272
Are you with me, Peter?

710
00:28:58,305 --> 00:28:59,873
Oh. Yeah.

711
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:00,974
You know, you certainly managed

712
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:02,476
to surprise me this morning

713
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,311
and that doesn't happen
often, I can say.

714
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:05,712
What do you mean?

715
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,781
I like to think I can read
people rather well

716
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,351
but I certainly didn't
have you pegged as a family man.

717
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:11,418
Why not?

718
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:13,587
Most surgical residents aren't.

719
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,757
And you strike me
as ambitious, driven.

720
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:21,562
I wonder how you manage it.

721
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,530
Lovely wife, though.

722
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:26,067
Actually, she's not my wife.

723
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,501
Well, there you go.

724
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,770
You surprised me again.

725
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:35,076
This place is negative energy.
You're lost in negative energy.

726
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:36,777
'Dr. Greene,
can I talk to you?'

727
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,079
Sure.

728
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:39,713
Just stay where you are.
I'll be right back.

729
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,315
Don't give in to it.

730
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:44,951
Dr. Lowrey from psych
left a note in his chart

731
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,053
when things
were still crazy.

732
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:48,422
Yeah, yeah,
I saw it. Thanks.

733
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,857
I guess she's going to try to
find the poor guy's family.

734
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:54,628
‐ Yeah. You surviving all this?
‐ I'm trying.

735
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:57,064
That was pretty amazing
what you were doing in there.

736
00:29:57,098 --> 00:30:00,467
‐ Yeah, well‐‐
‐ Hey, doc? Doc?

737
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:03,104
‐ I'll let you get back.
‐ Okay.

738
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:05,706
I got a secret.
Wanna hear?

739
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:07,674
Not particularly.

740
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,043
She likes you.

741
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:13,614
Hey, you disappeared
on me in there, what happened?

742
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:14,915
You don't wanna know.

743
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,583
‐ The boy make it?
‐ No.

744
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:17,718
Oh, I was hoping
for some good news.

745
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:18,885
Did you talk to Anna yet?

746
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,022
‐ About what?
‐ About the asthma kid.

747
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,356
She's cool.

748
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:23,790
Oh, she wasn't cool
about it before.

749
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:24,958
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

750
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:26,427
You might want to talk
to her about it.

751
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,761
Why? She talked to you.

752
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:30,064
‐ Carol, you have a minute.
‐ Your turn.

753
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:32,066
I heard about your
unexpected delivery.

754
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,834
Oh. Whose version?

755
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,436
She's screaming
for a lawyer.

756
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:37,638
She's high on something,
crack probably.

757
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:38,805
You know what,
when she comes down

758
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,407
she might see things differently

759
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:42,076
but you should fill out
an incident report.

760
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,145
‐ Document your account.
‐ Carol, she's a crack addict.

761
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,380
That baby popped out.
I did not drop it.

762
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,515
Yes, but after
your suspension last year

763
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,551
her accusations might
carry more weight.

764
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:52,486
Can anyone back you up?

765
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,820
Mark Greene was there.

766
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:55,089
Good. Make sure you're
on the same page.

767
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:56,523
‐ Alright.
‐ What do we got?

768
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:57,691
'Motorcycle accident.'

769
00:30:57,724 --> 00:30:59,560
Multiple abrasions
on the right side

770
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:01,428
elbow and abdominal pain.

771
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:02,796
He was fleeing the police.

772
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,765
Slid 15 feet into
a chain‐link fence.

773
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,667
This the guy they were
chasing on the Eisenhower?

774
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,669
Damn straight.
We finally got the little punk.

775
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:11,505
Hey, man, I wasn't the jerk that
ran into a bus full of kids.

776
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:12,939
No, you were just the jerk
that caused it.

777
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:14,541
Oh, bite me, lady.

778
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:16,743
‐ Hey, shut up.
‐ Put him in suture. Carter!

779
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:18,045
Take our friend here.

780
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,780
I'm afraid I might stick
an IV pole up his ass.

781
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:21,548
Wouldn't want that.

782
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:24,151
Kerry, I checked with upstairs
and Mr. Melgato is satting well.

783
00:31:24,185 --> 00:31:26,153
No internal injuries
other than the rib fractures.

784
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:27,454
Good.

785
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,555
I waited as long as I could

786
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:29,756
to put in that chest tube.

787
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,924
I‐I didn't have a choice.

788
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,659
He had multiple rib fractures.

789
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:34,661
You could have cut your finger
and bled inside his chest.

790
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:35,796
But I didn't.

791
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:37,131
We agreed you wouldn't
put your hands

792
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:38,765
in any poorly
visualized cavities.

793
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,201
‐ What was I supposed to do?
‐ Walk away.

794
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:41,968
He would've died.

795
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,770
That's the risk
you assume for your patients

796
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:45,706
when you continue
to work here with HIV.

797
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:51,578
Did you black out at all?

798
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:53,080
No, I‐I don't think so.

799
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:54,948
You've any trouble breathing?

800
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,917
‐ Blurred vision?
‐ No.

801
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,686
BP is 132/88.

802
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,188
So you slid
on your right side, huh?

803
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:04,525
Yeah.

804
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,060
What's this from then?

805
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:07,761
Guess.

806
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:09,063
There was a piece
of fence sticking out.

807
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,698
He must've rolled into it.

808
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:14,168
‐ Straight into it?
‐ 'You tell him, doc.'

809
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:16,570
Ow!

810
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,906
Okay. Lily, let's get
a CBC type and screen

811
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,512
lateral C‐spine, chest, AP,
pelvis and an abdominal CT.

812
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:26,847
Call for a surgical consult?

813
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,783
Yeah. No.
No, no, he's stable.

814
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:32,153
Let's, uh, wait and get
the abdominal CT first.

815
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:38,859
‐ Remind me why I do this again?
‐ 'Cause you hate yourself?

816
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:41,695
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

817
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,231
Mark, you know I didn't
drop that baby, right?

818
00:32:44,265 --> 00:32:45,899
Sure.

819
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:47,968
Kerry thinks there
could be some trouble.

820
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,703
Well, don't worry.

821
00:32:49,736 --> 00:32:52,139
Crack addicts generally
lack credibility.

822
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:53,974
So I can count
on your support?

823
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:55,576
I didn't actually
see it, Carol.

824
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:56,843
What does that mean?

825
00:32:56,877 --> 00:32:58,745
It means I didn't see it.

826
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,247
Mark, I did not drop that baby.

827
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:02,783
I went to put the side rail
down. I told her not to push.

828
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,619
She pushed, I reached for it,
but I never touched it.

829
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:06,920
Sure. Whatever.

830
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:08,155
Mark, I did not drop the baby.

831
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:09,723
Carol, what do you
want me to say

832
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,692
that I saw something
that I didn't?

833
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:13,994
No. I would like you
to believe me.

834
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:19,233
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mrs. Landeta.

835
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:20,767
'We had a bit of a crisis here.'

836
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:22,636
Yes. I saw. Pretty bad, huh?

837
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,071
Yeah.

838
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:26,673
Well, he seems
to be breathing okay.

839
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:28,809
Um, the puffer alone
isn't working.

840
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,944
I'm gonna give him prednisone.
It's a steroid.

841
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:33,814
He's gonna take one tablet
two times a day.

842
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:37,251
Doctor, can you give him
something for his stomach?

843
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:38,319
His stomach
is still bothering him?

844
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:40,987
Yes. The diarrhea is back.

845
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:42,289
Diarrhea, is it?

846
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:44,525
Let me take a look.

847
00:33:46,927 --> 00:33:48,295
‐ Does that hurt?
‐ Uh‐huh.

848
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:50,264
You know, just to be safe,
let's get a stool sample.

849
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:53,234
Yes. The lady doctor
said he should have one.

850
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,802
The lady doctor?
You sure?

851
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:00,841
When do I get
out of here?

852
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:02,209
I have to examine you.

853
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:04,045
When do I get
out of here?

854
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:06,147
I see your high
is wearing off.

855
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,682
‐ What are you doing?
‐ I need to check your uterus.

856
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,117
‐ Lie still, please.
‐ No. Get somebody else.

857
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:13,187
‐ I want a doctor.
‐ You're stuck with me.

858
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,755
Come on, Doris, open up.

859
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:15,856
Doris.

860
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:20,261
I hear you asked for a lawyer.

861
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,831
It was a boy, wasn't it?

862
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:27,368
Yeah, Doris, it was a boy.

863
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:30,271
I didn't know I was
pregnant, I swear.

864
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:32,606
I was so wasted.

865
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,076
If someone would've told me,
I would've given up the crack.

866
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:36,977
You can still do that, Doris.

867
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:41,648
Where is he?

868
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:42,883
Where's my baby?

869
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,818
This is just gonna
take another minute.

870
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,688
What, did they cut
him up or something?

871
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:49,690
Doctor will be in later
to talk to you about it.

872
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:50,857
They never say nothing.

873
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:59,166
Kid would've got
messed up with me anyway.

874
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,307
I can have another one,
though, right?

875
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,975
I'm okay down there?

876
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,112
Yeah, Doris,
you're okay down there.

877
00:35:11,145 --> 00:35:12,713
I'm really sorry, Dr. Carter.

878
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:14,915
It's just.. I've never seen
that much blood before.

879
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,250
You get used to it.

880
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,185
This isn't gonna affect
my evaluation, is it?

881
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,887
‐ I have to get honors.
‐ Just get a good night's rest.

882
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:22,956
We'll start it with
a clean slate tomorrow.

883
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:25,192
No, no, listen,
I'm leaving right now, okay?

884
00:35:25,226 --> 00:35:27,928
You need anything?
Right, how's he doing?

885
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:28,995
Okay, yeah.
I'm coming. Bye.

886
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,231
You're going home early.

887
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,966
No. I'm leaving
on time for once.

888
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:35,202
'Hey, Dr. Benton.'

889
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:37,238
How did it go with that girl?
Did you save her arm?

890
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:39,840
Good, the team is still working
on it, but it looks good.

891
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:41,742
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

892
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,844
‐ So how's your baby doing?
‐ Oh, he's good.

893
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,212
Carter, we need
you in suture room now

894
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:46,847
the motorcycle
guy is crashing.

895
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,782
We were about to move him
and he passed out.

896
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,384
‐ What's the story?
‐ Motorcycle accident.

897
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,818
Left upper
quadrant contusion.

898
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:53,420
It's okay.
I can handle it.

899
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:57,924
‐ BP is 50 palp.
‐ Set me up for a‐a lavage.

900
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:00,294
Set me up for a lavage.

901
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,762
How many units did
you cross‐match?

902
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,297
None. I typed and screened.
He was stable.

903
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,200
Four units type‐specific.

904
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,968
And squeeze in
two liters of saline.

905
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,770
‐ Why didn't you page me?
‐ He needed a head CT First.

906
00:36:09,803 --> 00:36:11,205
That's a surgical call, Carter.

907
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,939
I was trying to save time,
you know. You did say‐‐

908
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:14,375
Carter, the patient is critical.

909
00:36:14,408 --> 00:36:15,942
'He's tachy at 120.'

910
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:17,711
‐ He wasn't hypertensive.
‐ Come on.

911
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:20,414
It was normal.
There was no sign of bleeding.

912
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,883
Dammit. Alright, lavage is
positive. Alright, people.

913
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:23,917
Let's get him up to
the OR, now! Let's move!

914
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,287
He was stable.

915
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:35,762
Pathology call about
the autopsy on that preemie?

916
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:38,265
Uh, no, but Dr. Lowrey
called and found

917
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,234
that crazy guy's family
in Indiana

918
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:41,868
and they think he went
off his medicine

919
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:44,171
when he went back to college,
so his mom's coming up

920
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:46,807
and Dr. Lowrey said go ahead
and give him some hadlaw.

921
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,375
You mean Haldol?

922
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:50,077
Oh, right, Haldol. Sorry.

923
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:52,146
Talk to Greene about it.
He's an attending.

924
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,980
Talk to Greene about what?

925
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:55,982
Nothing. Never‐never mind.
It's nothing‐‐

926
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:58,252
‐ Just confront Benton.
‐ Well, it's not that easy.

927
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,421
I haven't been able to get him
to talk to me for months.

928
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:02,156
Make him talk to you.

929
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:03,857
Look, you can sulk
or you can just let him

930
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,159
go on treating you like this.

931
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:06,927
No, I'm gonna..
I'm gonna talk to him.

932
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,395
‐ I'm gonna talk to him.
‐ Good.

933
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:10,064
Dr. Del Amico, guess what?

934
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,166
You know Jaime Landeta,
the, uh, asthma kid?

935
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,934
‐ Hmm.
‐ He doesn't have asthma.

936
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:15,869
He has Strongyloides.

937
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:18,372
Causes a bronchial irritation,
masks as asthma.

938
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:20,007
The prednisone that
I was about to give him

939
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,042
would have made it worse.

940
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,209
Good catch.

941
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:24,778
Yeah, one I almost
didn't make.

942
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,182
So why didn't you tell me
that you suspected a parasite?

943
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:29,350
Uh, it was only a hunch.

944
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:30,851
A hunch you should
have shared with me.

945
00:37:30,884 --> 00:37:32,453
I tried. You had it
covered, remember?

946
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:34,288
Yeah, no. We work
as team here.

947
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:35,522
‐ Right, Anna?
‐ Oh, come on, what team?

948
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:37,291
You could've come in, consulted

949
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:38,425
explained there were
other good doctors.

950
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:39,893
Instead, you took
the easy way out.

951
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,795
‐ Hijacked the patient.
‐ What?

952
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:43,964
Uh, I'm sorry.
Um, This is Mrs. Blevins.

953
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:47,401
You wanted to talk to her
about her son.

954
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,370
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Where is my son?

955
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:51,838
Mrs. Blevins, your son
was in an accident.

956
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:53,274
On the bus. I know.

957
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:55,109
Yes, on the bus.

958
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:59,013
Um, he suffered multiple
injuries, very grave injuries.

959
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:01,082
We, um, we gave him
blood transfusions

960
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,350
we gave him emergency surgery.

961
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:06,187
We exhausted all
of our capabilities, but..

962
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,025
...uh, despite our
best efforts, we were..

963
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:15,129
...unable to save him.

964
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:26,407
Mrs. Blevins, he died.

965
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:32,579
Miss..

966
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:33,847
Hey, you need some help?

967
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,217
No, I got it.

968
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,325
You have another surgery?

969
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:46,627
Yeah, emergency splenectomy,
just came in.

970
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,861
I thought you'd left.

971
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:49,563
I did.

972
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:51,898
Here, I'll do it.
You should go.

973
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:54,035
No, no, no. You know, I got it.

974
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:56,470
Don't be so stubborn.
It's your baby's first day home.

975
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,539
I, on the other hand,
have no life.

976
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:01,908
Look, I, uh, I appreciate it,
but it's okay.

977
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:03,510
You should take advantage
of my generosity

978
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:04,878
when it comes around.

979
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:07,248
Trust me,
you'll see it rarely.

980
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:11,552
Okay. Uh..

981
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:18,025
‐ Tell Hicks that I‐‐
‐ Yeah, yeah. Go.

982
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,193
Go.

983
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:24,598
I knew you'd come back.

984
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:25,999
What's that?

985
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,934
Something to make you
feel normal again.

986
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:29,303
I don't wanna feel normal.

987
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:30,337
Yeah.

988
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:31,972
No, don't run away from it.

989
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:33,507
Don't run away
from the fear.

990
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,142
I know how to deal with it.

991
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:38,512
You need to make
friends with the fear.

992
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,947
What do you mean?

993
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:42,683
Death is all around.

994
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,418
Stick to the light.

995
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,220
Embrace it.

996
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:48,589
The light will save you.

997
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,128
'Dr. Benton?'

998
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,362
Dr. Benton,
hang on a second.

999
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:58,099
‐ I want to talk to you.
‐ Not now, Carter.

1000
00:39:58,132 --> 00:39:59,200
No, wait.

1001
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,235
You know, for a long time

1002
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,370
I bought into your abuse
and your humiliation

1003
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:05,606
because I thought
I was learning something.

1004
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,041
‐ You were.
‐ No, but..

1005
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,210
Okay, even if there
was a point to it then

1006
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,545
there's no point to it now.

1007
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,080
Goodnight, Carter.

1008
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:15,416
You know, I'm really tired
of you blowing me off.

1009
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:17,184
You're gonna have
to talk to me.

1010
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:18,552
You wanna talk?

1011
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,055
‐ You wanna talk now?
‐ Right now!

1012
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,223
Carter..

1013
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,727
No.

1014
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,096
‐ Carter, move.
‐ No.

1015
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,731
‐ Carter, move.
‐ No.

1016
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:32,366
‐ Carter, get out of my way‐‐
‐ You're not going‐‐

1017
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,935
Get off of me!

1018
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:40,141
‐ You okay?
‐ What, you care?

1019
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:41,475
Carter, what the hell is your‐‐

1020
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:43,110
You know, I'm not
your student anymore.

1021
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:44,611
Then you can treat me
like any other colleague.

1022
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:46,313
You're not a colleague,
you're an intern.

1023
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:49,083
For three years I did everything
you asked of me and more.

1024
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,018
I deserve your respect
because I earned it.

1025
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:52,186
And you threw it away.

1026
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,520
Why, because I don't
wanna be like you?

1027
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:54,988
No, because you wasted my time.

1028
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:56,223
This isn't about your time.

1029
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:58,192
This is about your egotism.

1030
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,360
Yeah, yeah, right.
Yeah, Carter

1031
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:00,727
I'm‐I'm egotistical.
You know what?

1032
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:02,496
I got a lot of people
that work damn hard

1033
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:03,997
to make sure I am
where I am

1034
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:05,399
and for them I
gotta be self‐centered.

1035
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:08,535
I don't take time for
anything but you, man, man..

1036
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,771
I did for you, Carter.

1037
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:13,007
I did, man.

1038
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,475
You decide you don't
want to be a surgeon

1039
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:16,477
you don't come to me,
you go to Anspaugh.

1040
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,046
Well, I was afraid
you'd talk me out of it.

1041
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,616
I wish I had the chance to try.

1042
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:26,553
Well.. Hey, okay.

1043
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:29,123
You're right. I'm sorry.

1044
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:34,561
Can I go home now?

1045
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:35,729
Yeah.

1046
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,802
'You know what, Carter?'

1047
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,338
You don't wanna be
treated like my student

1048
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:46,707
stop seeking my approval.

1049
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,515
Doug, have you seen Carol?

1050
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:57,418
Yeah, about 5'6",
pretty, packs an attitude.

1051
00:41:57,451 --> 00:41:58,452
What are you reading?

1052
00:41:58,485 --> 00:42:00,154
‐ Some research.
‐ You?

1053
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:03,257
It's pain management
for kids, an idea I had once.

1054
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,692
Carol? Carol?

1055
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:08,095
I got that autopsy report
on the crack baby.

1056
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:10,197
He died in utero two days ago.

1057
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:11,498
Well, I guess we're
both off the hook.

1058
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,334
Carol, it wasn't a matter

1059
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,402
of me believing you
or not believing you.

1060
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:17,438
I would've been on your side.

1061
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,373
Well, maybe if you'd been
on the patient's side earlier

1062
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,541
'none of this
would've happened.'

1063
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:23,310
‐ What?
‐ I checked her chart.

1064
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:24,578
That woman had been in here

1065
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:26,347
four times in the
past seven months.

1066
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,449
You saw her twice and never
once did a pregnancy test.

1067
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:30,584
Was there reason to?

1068
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:32,519
Evidently, yes.

1069
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:34,321
So we're suppose to
give pregnancy tests

1070
00:42:34,355 --> 00:42:36,390
to every female crack head
who comes through the door?

1071
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:39,293
‐ That's not what I'm saying.
‐ Then what?

1072
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,162
God forbid this woman
ever finds out

1073
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:42,696
'what her real
malpractice suit is.'

1074
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,331
I would back you up

1075
00:42:44,365 --> 00:42:46,867
say there was no reason
for a pregnancy test.

1076
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,635
The fact is, we should
have done something.

1077
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,471
What?
What should we have done?

1078
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:53,374
We can't help people
who can't help themselves.

1079
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:57,144
No, Mark. Those are exactly
the people we should be helping.

1080
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:06,253
Good. I'm glad
you're still here.

1081
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:08,389
I'm surprised that you are.

1082
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,724
Jeanie, I had every
right to be angry.

1083
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,227
I went to the mat for you.
We had a deal.

1084
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,761
I couldn't just stand
there and watch him die.

1085
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:16,597
You don't know
that he would've.

1086
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,133
We were losing a pulse.
It was worth the risk, Kerry.

1087
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,401
Jeanie, you made a decision

1088
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:23,137
to continue working here
and I supported it

1089
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,273
but sometimes our decisions
affect more than just ourselves.

1090
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:28,375
And in this case,
a man is still alive.

1091
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,511
I appreciate that,
but we all agreed

1092
00:43:30,544 --> 00:43:32,346
you'd work
under specific guidelines.

1093
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:33,580
You have to stick to them.

1094
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,748
I know, I know.

1095
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:38,919
But if I had to do it again

1096
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:41,488
I can't say I wouldn't
do the same thing.

1097
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:51,165
Dr. Greene?

1098
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:54,668
Do you take the El?

1099
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:56,303
No, I drive. It's just, uh

1100
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:57,538
I park around the corner.

1101
00:43:57,571 --> 00:43:58,905
It's a little more convenient.

1102
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:00,541
Aren't you afraid that
your car's gonna get stolen

1103
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:01,842
or scratched up or something?

1104
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,644
Nothing's happened so far.

1105
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:06,613
Oh. Um, do you mind walking me
up to the platform?

1106
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,183
I just get kind of scared
out here at night.

1107
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:10,217
Where do you live?

1108
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:11,652
Near Humboldt Park,
for now.

1109
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:13,287
It's on my way.
I'll give you a lift.

1110
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:14,755
Oh, no, no, I don't
wanna be a bother.

1111
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:15,989
No bother.

1112
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:18,192
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Yeah, let's go.

1113
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:19,560
Great. Thanks.

1114
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,704
'Carla?'
