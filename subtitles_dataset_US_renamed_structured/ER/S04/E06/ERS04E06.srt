1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,340
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,175
‐ Want a bite?
‐ No, I'll just watch you eat.

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,210
‐ Where's that going?
‐ What do you mean?

4
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,244
You and the desk clerk?

5
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,312
'Would your grandmother'

6
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,647
consider this clinic idea?

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,781
She'd probably look at it.

8
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,416
After I pay my landlord

9
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,319
the med school bills,
my phone bill, the gas bill

10
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,521
that should leave me
about four bucks.

11
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,755
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

12
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,356
You've not worked
with Dr. Romano?

13
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,457
Rocket Romano?

14
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,792
Rocket's sponsoring my BTA.

15
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:29,362
‐ Damn you people!
‐ You son of a bitch!

16
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:30,531
That's enough!

17
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,799
Believe me,
it won't get any better.

18
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,367
You belong in jail.

19
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,736
I wish it was me
who kicked your white ass.

20
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,445
I hope I didn't wake you.

21
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,448
No. No.
I smelled the coffee.

22
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,184
Oh, well, uh,
let me get you a cup.

23
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,586
Okay.

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,722
You're cheerful
this morning.

25
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,159
Did you talk to
the foreman yet?

26
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,362
Yeah, yeah. He gave me
the same old, same old.

27
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,264
All crewed up.

28
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,866
But I talked
to Tommy Styles.

29
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,868
Tommy styles? I thought
he moved to Atlanta.

30
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,370
Yeah, he's a
general manager

31
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,873
of a construction
company down there

32
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,676
that got some contracts
during the Olympics

33
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,144
and, uh...

34
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,281
things just grew
from there, and..

35
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,416
...they can't get enough
guys to fill their gigs.

36
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:24,618
Good for him.

37
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,587
Yeah.
He said, uh..

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,756
He said a guy with
my skills could..

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,359
...make some real good
money the first year out.

40
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,561
In Atlanta?

41
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,229
Yeah.

42
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,332
I mean, it could be
a chance for a fresh start.

43
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,367
Better job
opportunities

44
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,136
better weather.

45
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,672
We already know Tommy,
my sister's down there..

46
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,874
...and it's a chocolate city

47
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:48,909
so socially‐‐

48
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,711
Sounds great.

49
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:51,745
But..?

50
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,313
But we're not kids anymore.

51
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,615
We can't just start over.

52
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,517
Why not? Hmm?
Why not?

53
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,284
Why can't we just
wipe the slate clean?

54
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,454
Because we have a mortgage
and I have a job.

55
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,356
But I don't.

56
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,893
You know, I'm being
frozen out up here

57
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,161
and after that
fight with Bill

58
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,396
I can't just hang out

59
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,867
and watch the football game
with the guys.

60
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,903
My life is over
up here.

61
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,405
In Atlanta..

62
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,841
...we wouldn't have
to tell anybody.

63
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,809
Nobody would know.

64
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,881
Hey. How many patients
do you think

65
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,550
we see in the hospital
every year?

66
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,351
Too many.

67
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,919
'Could you be a little
more specific?'

68
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,689
‐ It's for my grant proposal.
‐ Uh‐huh, that's right.

69
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,559
Tonight's the Carter family
foundation night. You nervous?

70
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,326
No, I figure the worse
she can say is no.

71
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,362
And then I'm back where I
started, clueless and penniless.

72
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,865
‐ Good morning, all.
‐ Hey. You in a good mood?

73
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,901
Well, the hospital settled
the Kenny Law malpractice suit.

74
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,971
No more process servers,
no more depositions

75
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,273
and after today,
no more work

76
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,777
because I've got three days
of vacation time before me.

77
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,811
Any plans?

78
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,980
Uh, sleep, sleep
and sleep.

79
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,447
Mark, how many patients
do you think

80
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,816
we see in the hospital
every year?

81
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,752
Oh, would that be real
patients or turkeys?

82
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,420
Forget I asked.

83
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,524
Look, your count will
be about 95 percent higher

84
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,458
if you count
all the wackos.

85
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,827
It's a little harsh.

86
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,228
Alright, Carol,
I'll make you a wager.

87
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,663
Uh‐huh. Uh.

88
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,799
A wager on
the turkey‐to‐patient ratio

89
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,866
over the next 12 hours.

90
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,234
‐ No, thanks.
‐ Come on.

91
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,268
I'll give you
two‐to‐one odds.

92
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,870
Can I get a doctor quickly?

93
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,339
Help, please? Anyone?

94
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,274
You see?
Here's a real patient now.

95
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,811
You're already
up by one.

96
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,414
Anna?

97
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,450
‐ 'Anna?'
‐ Hey, Carter.

98
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,952
I'm running late.
Sorry.

99
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,486
Oh, I must have read
your handwriting wrong.

100
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,822
I thought it says 4D.

101
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,390
It does. Here.
Come in.

102
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,426
Oh.

103
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,029
I had to get my shower in
before the guy in 4G.

104
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,931
He stands in there
for, like, an hour

105
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,633
listening to Howard Stern.

106
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,801
Hey, can you give me a ride
to journal club tonight?

107
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,836
Sure.

108
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,438
Thanks.

109
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,472
Make yourself comfortable.

110
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,007
I'm gonna go
get dressed.

111
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,417
This is a nice place.

112
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,287
Please. It's a dump, but you
get what you pay for, right?

113
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,556
What you gonna do?

114
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,390
Especially on what
we get paid?

115
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,359
'Right.'

116
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,727
If you want, there's uh, some

117
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,962
pop‐tarts on the counter.

118
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,572
Can I, uh...make you one?

119
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,874
No, it's okay.
I like them cold.

120
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:34,908
Me, too.

121
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,442
Really?

122
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,950
Oh!

123
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,421
Damn landlord won't
fumigate the place.

124
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,558
I...write letters,
call the management office.

125
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,026
You better believe
he doesn't have roaches

126
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,428
around his fat‐cat estate
in Evanston.

127
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,097
You know, you could report
him to the health department.

128
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,599
Cockroaches are
a health hazard.

129
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,967
Really? That really works?
You tried it?

130
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,068
Yeah.

131
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,837
Wow. I never would
have pegged you

132
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,639
for a guy who knew
slumlord politics.

133
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,841
You seem so milk‐fed
middle class.

134
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,044
Well, you know my family
always had enough to get by.

135
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,346
Uh, never went
hungry or anything.

136
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,615
Hey, what do you say
we go over this

137
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,382
journal stuff
at breakfast?

138
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,385
I know a place that's got
a $1.99 pancake special.

139
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,621
‐ You buying?
‐ My treat.

140
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,089
Alright. Thanks.

141
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,614
Get an AP lateral
on that knee.

142
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,415
What happened to this guy?

143
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,584
We were doing
a performance piece‐‐

144
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,718
I was doing "William Tell's."

145
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,419
An artist taking the risk

146
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,988
as the average Philistine
is not willing to take.

147
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,790
All this stupid idiot had to do

148
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,058
is shoot the apple out
from in between my legs.

149
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,594
You're lucky he
didn't aim higher.

150
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,161
In a way, it makes it
even edgier, sir.

151
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,196
You've shed blood
for your work.

152
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,898
Are you Max Prole? Are you?

153
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,166
No, no I'm sorry, it's just the
blood on the gallery wall

154
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,835
made a bold splatter
and I‐I‐‐

155
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,537
Do I look like
Jackson Pollock?

156
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,739
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
I just, I‐I think this can work.

157
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,473
Carol, let's give him
ten of morphine.

158
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,009
Wait, I have an idea.

159
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,011
The piece can go on and live
and breathe on its own.

160
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,879
I will be the canvas.
No morphine.

161
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,681
I want to experience
the sensations.

162
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:58,118
Mr. Prole, you've a bullet hole
in your leg, now take the drug.

163
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,452
Sorry, Carol.

164
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,754
Score one for me.

165
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:04,725
Hey, Shirley, do you know
where Dr. Hicks is

166
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,759
doing her 8:00 A.M.
gastroplasty?

167
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,893
‐ Did.
‐ Excuse me?

168
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,928
She pushed it up to 6: 00.

169
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,463
They should be done by now.

170
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,665
Hey, what's going on?

171
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,966
Just finishing
up my night.

172
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,601
Dr. Hicks changed
her surgery?

173
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,202
Yes, she had to make rounds
for Dr. Sloman.

174
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,672
‐ You weren't here yet. So..
‐ Why wasn't I called?

175
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,906
I didn't want
to disturb you.

176
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,708
That was my gastroplasty.

177
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,878
I know, but you have limited
time with your family, so..

178
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,613
Is that what you
told Dr. Hicks?

179
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,048
Peter, I thought I was
doing you a favor

180
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,983
but if you're thinking
I wanted this surgery..

181
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,752
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa, whoa. Did you?

182
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,120
Look, why don't you take my
ischemic bowel at 11:00

183
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,856
and we'll call it a trade.

184
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,591
Okay, yeah.
Why don't we do that?

185
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,860
Good. You smell
of talcum powder.

186
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,196
That's so sweet.

187
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,264
‐ Hey, Jeanie.
‐ Hey.

188
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,498
Your husband called.

189
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,533
Did he leave a message?

190
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,234
Yeah.
I wrote it down.

191
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,571
"Mint juleps,
night blooming jasmine

192
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,939
and warm southern breezes."

193
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,140
‐ Oh. That was it?
‐ Yeah.

194
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,208
I don't know what it means
but he sounds

195
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,276
like a real romantic.

196
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,578
Yeah, sometimes
I wish he wasn't

197
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:58,912
as much of a romantic.

198
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,681
Oh, you don't like being
swept off your feet?

199
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,215
Uh, it's the landing
that's a problem.

200
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,018
This Synergix group
has balanced budgets

201
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,587
much deeper in the red
than ours.

202
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,988
Yeah, I've made some
real progress.

203
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,690
Oh, that's very laudable,
but I still think

204
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:10,924
you should hear
what they have to say.

205
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,125
What if I don't
like what I hear?

206
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,727
I'd plan on liking it, Kerry.

207
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,896
Otherwise, you can talk
to the board of directors.

208
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,198
‐ Explain ER's massive deficit.
‐ I see.

209
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,934
But they're looking for
scapegoats. Don't be one.

210
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,536
It was a complete accident.
I promise.

211
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,937
Mr. Prole made me do it.
He wanted me to do it

212
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,205
‐ This is our guy.
‐ Dr. Greene.

213
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,640
Come on, buddy.
Couple of questions.

214
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,174
I told him I was a bad shot.

215
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,544
‐ 'He wouldn't listen!'
‐ Got to love the crackpots.

216
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,278
Could you cover me
for a few hours?

217
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,915
Anspaugh's sending me
to some dog and pony show

218
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,683
for these
ER management groups.

219
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:37,751
If I have to.

220
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,985
He just zeroed in
on every bit

221
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,086
of flab
in the budget.

222
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,187
Said we're overstaffed

223
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,288
or doing too many tests.

224
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,323
He wants the whole thing

225
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,758
turned around yesterday.

226
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,693
‐ Sounds bad.
‐ There's no money.

227
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,895
Resources are stretched
as it is

228
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,231
and he still wants me
to lose another 98,000.

229
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,666
Something's
got to give.

230
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,769
Yeah. It's just
I don't know what or who.

231
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,971
Let me know
when you're back.

232
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,039
What have you got?

233
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,807
Matthew Lindermulder.

234
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,776
His spotter at the gym
was asleep as the switch

235
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,210
dropped a free‐weight bar
on his head.

236
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,746
Ooh. I knew there
was a reason

237
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,213
I let my gym
membership lapse.

238
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,683
BP 120/80. Pulse 88.

239
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,251
Pupils equal,
round and reactive.

240
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,353
Uh, Babinski's
down going

241
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,855
and he withdraws
to pain.

242
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,157
Okay, let's get a CBC,
cross‐table c‐spine

243
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,292
and a non‐contrast
head CT.

244
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,326
Oh, man.

245
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,862
'What's that?'

246
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,129
It's a Klan tattoo.

247
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,001
Danny, can you hear me?
How long was he seizing?

248
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,270
His cellmate screamed
for us about an hour ago.

249
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,371
He seized all the way
here and it stopped

250
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,806
'just as we were pulling up.'

251
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,275
‐ BP's 100/70. Pulse 100.
‐ Hmm.

252
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,279
‐ Has he been here before?
‐ Don't know. I'm new.

253
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,014
Wet himself in the van
on the way over.

254
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,818
Okay. Look can you not use
those cuffs, please?

255
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,687
Whatever you say, doc,
but I got to stay with him.

256
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,122
He's waking up.

257
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,092
I hear it ringing.

258
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,928
Does he have any
history of epilepsy?

259
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,329
‐ 'Not that I know of.'
‐ Slower.

260
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,266
‐ How you feeling there, Danny?
‐ Oh, no. Oh, no.

261
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,035
Hang on. That's alright.
Hang on.

262
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,138
Alright, he's bit his tongue.

263
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,873
Let's get a head CT
and a tox screen.

264
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:07,908
Can I talk to you
outside, please?

265
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,943
Sure.

266
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,881
So what do you think?

267
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,316
Kid has textbook
seizure symptoms.

268
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,918
Yeah, maybe a little
too textbook.

269
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,385
Well, it's a pretty
convincing performance.

270
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,055
I've seen some Oscar winning
performances from prisoners

271
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,690
looking for a
"Get out of jail free" card.

272
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,959
Maybe Mark Greene's
rubbing off on us.

273
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,027
He's seizing again.

274
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,064
Labs are back on that
weird guy in one.

275
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,266
Anna, weird guy in one.

276
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,435
Okay. Thanks again
for breakfast, Carter.

277
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,070
‐ Sure.
‐ Carter.

278
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,204
Could you wrap up
a patient for me?

279
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,673
He's not stinky, is he?

280
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,374
No, straightforward
concussion most likely.

281
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,909
The guy just makes me
feel uncomfortable.

282
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,845
Hold on, hold on,
you're passing off a patient

283
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,212
because he makes
you feel uncomfortable?

284
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,883
Uh, Dr. Carter?
It's, uh, the lab.

285
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,284
He's a member of
the Ku Klux Klan.

286
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,019
Um‐hm.
Did he make any remarks?

287
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,889
No, he's unconscious,
but when I was working him up

288
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,457
I noticed he had
a KKK tattoo.

289
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,259
Alright, Jeanie,
if we all sat around

290
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,460
waiting for
the perfect patient

291
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,729
the lounge would be
standing room only.

292
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,297
So, if there's a problem,
call security.

293
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,767
Until then, try
and remember Hippocrates.

294
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,904
No pupil dilation.

295
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,006
Oral mucosa's intact.

296
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,810
Lucky landing.

297
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,779
I'm sorry, Officer Jeffrey
this doesn't look good.

298
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,715
Nurse Hathaway, will you prepare
the H20‐NA treatment, please.

299
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,416
Oh, but, doctor,
that's experimental.

300
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,785
What do you mean,
"It doesn't look good"?

301
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,920
Well, it's our only hope.

302
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,055
Um, officer,
do you have the name

303
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,891
of Mr. Scheibe's next of kin?

304
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,126
Either he's going to snap
out of this seizure

305
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,962
or he's going to be forced
into an irreversible coma.

306
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,998
‐ Coma?
‐ 'Give it a few seconds.'

307
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,300
'If it doesn't work,
we'll call the coma team.'

308
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,235
What? What? Who?

309
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,038
Amazing.

310
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,808
‐ Yeah, salt water.
‐ Where am I?

311
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,242
'Right now, you're
in a hospital'

312
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,410
but in five minutes,
you're going to be

313
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,046
on a bus headed
for prison

314
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,147
in very wet pants.

315
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,988
We got your gram stain back,
Mr. La Fontaine.

316
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,289
Please, for you..

317
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,490
Vinny.

318
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:07,327
Okay, Vinny,
you have gonorrhea.

319
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,762
From the looks
of your chart

320
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,330
you're familiar
with the protocol?

321
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,232
Occupational hazard.

322
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,334
It's the price
of being a player.

323
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,368
You sing?

324
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,870
No.

325
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,773
That's a damn shame
'cause, uh..

326
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,074
...I been in the, uh..

327
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,943
entertainment industry
for numerous years

328
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,246
and, uh,
with a face like yours..

329
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,181
...you could sell
a lot of platters.

330
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,184
This is a single dose
of Floxin and Zithromax.

331
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,086
They do the same thing
as the other antibiotics

332
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,320
you're used to.

333
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,822
I remember
when it used to be

334
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:39,092
an elephant gun
of, uh, penicillin in the ass.

335
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,163
Huh, have you been tested
recently for HIV or syphilis?

336
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,231
Oh, yeah, I get tested
down at South Side clinic.

337
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,768
I am clean and pristine.

338
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,838
‐ Is the coast clear?
‐ What do you mean?

339
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,173
Fake seizure kid from juvie.

340
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,541
I'd rather Dr. Greene
not see this one.

341
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:56,109
'Probably not a patient
I should bring up'

342
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,878
'to your grandmother,
right?'

343
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:01,481
Oh, jeez. Your clinic proposal,
that's tonight, isn't it?

344
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,817
Yeah, Oak Park, 7 o'clock.
I thought that's what we said.

345
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,886
Yeah, we did, we did.
I just spaced it.

346
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,321
I made plans with Anna,
but I can change them.

347
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,824
‐ Plans with Anna? Huh?
‐ Yeah. Journal club.

348
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,492
So it's a colleague
kind of thing?

349
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,595
So far. So you got all
your facts and figures?

350
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,329
Gamma loves
facts and figures.

351
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,431
Yeah, I'm just waiting
for some numbers on the census.

352
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,166
That's cool.
Nah, you'll do fine.

353
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,434
Just don't mention
politics or religion

354
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,003
and you'll stay
on her good side.

355
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,238
‐ Politics, religion. Right.
‐ Or baseball.

356
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,373
She's still pissed off
over that inter‐league play.

357
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,875
'Anything else?'

358
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,243
No, you're a natural.
You'll do fine.

359
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,444
How long has your wrist
been bothering you?

360
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,079
About two weeks ago.

361
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,515
‐ I think it might be a thing‐‐
‐ Let me take a look.

362
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:35,982
Yeah.
Can you hold this a second?

363
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,317
‐ Sure. I'll just sit it down.
‐ Dr. Greene.

364
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,219
‐ Consider yourself served.
‐ Excuse me?

365
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,854
If you have any questions,
there's an attorney's

366
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,488
name and number
on the inside.

367
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:45,258
Too late but this case
was settled this morning.

368
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,527
But you know
I have a suggestion

369
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,028
where you could stick
this summons.

370
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,462
Is that another
process server?

371
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,865
These guys are unbelievable.
He impersonated a patient.

372
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,366
That's gotta be illegal.

373
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,468
Yeah. They should really get
their story straight.

374
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,871
Mark, this isn't
a malpractice summons.

375
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,106
‐ It's a civil suit.
‐ What?

376
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,975
Yeah, Chris law's
claiming you violated

377
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,944
his brother's
civil rights.

378
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,378
He's not suing
the hospital.

379
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,913
He's suing you.

380
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:15,021
So I think the facts
speak for themselves.

381
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,524
'When you partner with
Synergix Physicians group'

382
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:21,494
we will increase revenues,
streamline management

383
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,631
and cut costs
making your department

384
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,568
a center of excellence.

385
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,270
Now, I'm sure that some of you
have questions, so..

386
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,938
‐ Yes, sir?
‐ I'm Eric Norris.

387
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,507
‐ Director of St. Joseph's ER.
‐ 'Oh, yes.'

388
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,609
'And the principal
author on thrombolytics'

389
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,011
'and pulmonary embolism
in the September annals.'

390
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,646
‐ 'Welcome, sir.'
‐ Yes.

391
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,648
What are your billing charges?

392
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:44,551
Ah, now that is the beauty
of the SPG system.

393
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:47,688
Collective billing of our
125 contracted facilities

394
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,656
enables us to keep
our billing costs

395
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,892
down below five percent.

396
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,596
‐ 'Yes.'
‐ Yeah, I have a few questions.

397
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,164
‐ The first of which‐‐
‐ 'I'm sorry. And you are?'

398
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,466
Uh, Kerry Weaver, acting chief
of emergency services

399
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,635
at County General.

400
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,269
Five percent
is an impressive number.

401
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,638
But what's
the actual percentage

402
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,640
that Synergix retains
in management fees?

403
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:10,977
Well, we retain the current
physicians' salaries

404
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,680
and we balance your budget
through maximizing reimbursement

405
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,181
and cutting costs.

406
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,416
I'm sure you've heard
of the Pentagon.

407
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,351
'And the $5,000 hammer,
Dr. Weaver?'

408
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,221
Yeah, I'm not talking
about hammers

409
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:26,259
and, um, you haven't answered
my question, Mr. West.

410
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:30,597
Well, it's Dr. West,
but please, call me Ellis.

411
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,198
'The number you're looking
for is dependent'

412
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,100
upon a multitude of factors:

413
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:38,104
Uh, payer mix, daily census,
physician reimbursement

414
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,440
just to name a few.

415
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,475
But we should talk
about this later.

416
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,977
'Uh, right now,
I'd like to answer'

417
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,411
'a few more questions,
if I may.'

418
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,047
'Yes? In the back?'

419
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,381
‐ 'Dr. Romano.'
‐ 'Lizzie!'

420
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,651
Just the person I wanted to see.
Check this out.

421
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,385
Someone's gonna be
limping for a while.

422
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,655
Uh‐hm. Some wacky artist
got shot during a performance.

423
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,222
Completely imploded
his cartilage.

424
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,658
Yeah, I see there's a
cylindrical defect

425
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,325
of the medial distal
femoral condyle.

426
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,328
You called it. A perfect
candidate for your research.

427
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,097
He's all yours
if you got the time.

428
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,566
Uh.
Well, actually, I have

429
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,201
but we'd need to get his consent
look for a donor femur.

430
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,636
The consent's already
been taken care of

431
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,171
and I took the liberty
of trolling the morgue.

432
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,673
Found a femur
that matches.

433
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,008
All you need to do is
start growing culture cells.

434
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,710
‐ An osteochondral allograph.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

435
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,579
Didn't think
I'd ever get to do one.

436
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:21,582
Well, I'll start the cultures
right away, uh..

437
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:22,783
Thank you so much.

438
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,119
Who looks out
for you, huh?

439
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,754
I was just talking to a guy
named Ivan Sheldon.

440
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:28,789
You remember him?

441
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,090
Uh, night court judge

442
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,491
from Evanston
with a six handicap?

443
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:32,659
Right.
I told him what was up.

444
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,227
He gave me the name
of a good attorney

445
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,663
the guy who defended
the civil rights case against

446
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,633
the Kallenback Meat Packing
Company, a few years back.

447
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,467
Now, you're discussing
my legal problems?

448
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:42,669
with your golfing buddies?

449
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:44,404
Just Sheldon.
He's a judge.

450
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,573
I didn't ask you to mind
my business or save my ass

451
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,274
or whatever it is
you're trying to do.

452
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,710
I thought I was
just being your friend

453
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,311
which is getting tougher
and tougher to do these days.

454
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,046
‐ Yeah?
‐ Mark.

455
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,414
That environmental allergy
woman is waiting for you.

456
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,549
And why is that?

457
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,183
You've been in
a bad mood for months.

458
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,085
And I don't know
how to talk to you anymore.

459
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,353
‐ Then don't.
‐ Okay.

460
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,491
What's the statute
of limitations

461
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,694
on post‐traumatic
stress?

462
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:09,129
Cut him some slack.

463
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,631
I think we've all
cut him plenty.

464
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:12,566
‐ He needs some help.
‐ He doesn't need a shrink.

465
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,568
He needs friends
who are supportive.

466
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,136
Uh, he's not going
to have any friends

467
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,704
supportive or otherwise,
if he keeps this up.

468
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,773
Your tattoo guy
is back from CT.

469
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,074
The grand wizard?

470
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,475
Yeah, he's regained
consciousness.

471
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,410
Needs his scalp
and shoulder sutured.

472
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,279
Great. We'll have him up
and cross burning in no time.

473
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,649
I hate to say it, but he's
actually very polite.

474
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:29,683
Uh‐huh.

475
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,454
Mr. Lindermulder,
you're gonna need sutures.

476
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,691
Are you gonna make me look like
Frankenstein's monster, uh?

477
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,794
First your shoulder.
Please lower your gown.

478
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,829
'Is there any way
the nurse could do them?'

479
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,831
'That little blond lady
who was in here before?'

480
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,132
It's not her job.

481
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,135
You're gonna have to
settle for me.

482
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:52,172
It's no offense,
it's just..

483
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:56,109
...go ahead.

484
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,346
I got to hand it
to you people.

485
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,682
"You people"?

486
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,216
Paramedics, nurses

487
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,318
'physician's assistants.'

488
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,621
Dumb ox like me gets
a barbell dropped on his head

489
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,123
and here I am, getting
the best care on Earth.

490
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,792
Well, we treat
everybody here.

491
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,829
Have you been
saved, miss?

492
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,398
Boulet.

493
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,167
Do you walk
with the Lord?

494
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,705
What does that tattoo
have to do with the Lord?

495
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,573
I'm sorry you had to see it.

496
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,441
'That's why I asked
for the nurse before.'

497
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,778
'It's a reminder
of what I left behind'

498
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,548
intolerance,
ignorance, hate.

499
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,383
I was reborn through
the love of Jesus Christ.

500
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,719
Uh‐huh.

501
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,821
I built a new life, Ms. Boulet.

502
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,725
You don't believe
that's possible, do you?

503
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,359
Sure, I do.

504
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,731
Listen, we didn't really get a
chance to finish our discussion.

505
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:53,466
Yeah, I think I heard everything
I need to hear, thank you.

506
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,468
Oh, but I haven't.

507
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,338
Listen, Kerry. I'm surrounded by
number crunchers all day long.

508
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,341
When a confident, intelligent
and attractive woman

509
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,543
walks through my door

510
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:03,777
I must at least
try to ask her to lunch.

511
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,912
Yeah, I have to
get back to work.

512
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,480
No, no, no.
I'll make some calls.

513
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,349
I'll tell Chicago
not to get sick for an hour.

514
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,917
We can go down to the oak room
and I will tell you

515
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,385
all my dirty
management secrets.

516
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,689
What do you say?
Come on.

517
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,490
Not to mention
the Japanese strain of staph

518
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:20,293
that's resistant to
the most powerful antibiotics.

519
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,728
Scary stuff.

520
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,530
Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.

521
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:24,865
Whoa.
What are you doing?

522
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,366
There are germs, doctor.

523
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,834
Uh‐ha. Well, you can
put that away now.

524
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,335
Dr. Greene is
very sanitary.

525
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,436
You don't have to worry.

526
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,772
I'll be the judge
of that.

527
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,540
Why don't we
take off the mask?

528
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,776
This is a charcoal
particle filter mask.

529
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,878
Twenty percent of people get
sicker in the hospital.

530
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:40,647
I don't want to become
another statistic.

531
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,585
So, you complain of fatigue,
dry mouth, shortness of breath.

532
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,687
Heart rate's 130.
Resps 32.

533
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,956
Ah, and you've been here before
for anxiety attacks.

534
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,558
This is not
an anxiety attack.

535
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:53,459
I'm allergic
to my apartment building.

536
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,428
Why don't you move?

537
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,331
Is that your medical
opinion, doctor?

538
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,000
I have environmentally
based allergies.

539
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,803
Or you're having some anxiety
and looking for attention.

540
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:04,304
Mark!

541
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,506
Why don't you
get a blood gas

542
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,475
and call me
with the results.

543
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,580
I see Dr. Corday handed you
off one nasty ileum.

544
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:14,648
I'm just helping her out.

545
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,850
Well, uh‐hm..

546
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,453
I'm glad that you two
have some camaraderie.

547
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,487
It'll come in handy

548
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,023
with Dr. Romano.

549
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,257
Excuse me?

550
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,291
He's looking for

551
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,326
another surgeon

552
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,695
for his team, and, uh...

553
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:29,963
I recommended you.

554
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,667
Well, thank you, but..
Stapler.

555
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,435
Thanks, but what?

556
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,403
Well, I'm more interested
in working with surgeons

557
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:38,539
who challenge my skills

558
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,407
than dazzle me
with technology.

559
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,409
Technology is
the new technique

560
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,812
and if you don't master it,
somebody else will.

561
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,752
When I saw how the flaws
in the system trickled down

562
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,787
and affected the
day‐to‐day operations

563
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,622
of an ER..

564
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,524
I just knew I would be more
effective in management.

565
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:58,925
And then you went back
and got your MBA?

566
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,326
Yeah‐yeah‐yeah,
and then up

567
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,895
the corporate ladder
and blah‐blah‐blah.

568
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,598
Look, I didn't kidnap
you out of that conference

569
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,467
to tell you my life story.

570
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,469
I want to find out
more about you.

571
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,639
Pick your brain
a little bit.

572
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,708
Grapevine says you're doing
great things at County.

573
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,510
I don't know about great.

574
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:19,613
Ah, my spies tell me about
your waste reduction program.

575
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,983
Yeah, well, saving a syringe
here and some gauze there

576
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,819
is not the kind of dent
my bosses are looking for.

577
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,353
Sounds serious.

578
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,655
You want to bend my ear?

579
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,056
Maybe I can help.

580
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,558
Long story short.

581
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:33,426
The board is convening
at the end of the week.

582
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,995
‐ That's tomorrow.
‐ Yeah, don't remind me.

583
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,430
And they need to cut ten percent
out of the budget immediately.

584
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,032
We're already down
to the bone as it is.

585
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,535
Are they making suggestions
or just handing you the axe?

586
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:43,369
Well, they figure
I can chop eight percent

587
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,539
by getting rid of half
of the physician's assistants.

588
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:47,040
That's not a bad idea.

589
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,009
On paper, maybe.

590
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,044
Not so great if
you have to fire a friend.

591
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:55,415
So this is about more
than just the bottom line.

592
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,954
Well, it's never easy
letting people go, Kerry.

593
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,090
But there are ways
to make it less painful..

594
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:05,859
'...and sometimes
less permanent.'

595
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,495
Shall we get some coffee?

596
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:14,400
Sure. With what
I have waiting for me?

597
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,970
I'm in no rush to get back.

598
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,039
Carol, do you think people
are capable of change?

599
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:21,007
Starting their lives over?

600
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,909
Yeah, sure. Why not?

601
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,979
I did. I used to have
nothing but deadbeat jobs

602
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,615
and go out with loser guys
and...now look at me.

603
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,817
Did a blood gas come up
on that germ lady?

604
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,419
Uh, yeah. In curtain two.
Actually, Dr. Greene

605
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,856
she seemed a little
upset when she left.

606
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:37,624
Wanted to get out of here.

607
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,092
So she left before
the test results?

608
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,161
Uh, yeah. She made
a quick phone call and sprayed

609
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,930
the entire receiver with
disinfectant and walked out.

610
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:46,633
‐ She left AMA.
‐ 'Why would she do that?'

611
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,034
I don't know.
Maybe because Mark was rude

612
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,069
dismissive and patronizing.

613
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,071
I'm sure
that's not true.

614
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,839
It's not my job
to be their best friend.

615
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,608
No, just their caregiver.

616
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,580
What's all the brouhaha?

617
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:01,181
Dr. Romano and
Dr. Corday are doing an

618
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,784
osteochondral allograft.

619
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,852
Well, hot damn.

620
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,088
That's the first ever
here at County.

621
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,923
Even had the Channel Five news
here covering it

622
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,892
for their sci‐tech segment.

623
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:15,562
See what I mean, Peter?

624
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,998
The future...is now.

625
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,939
Excuse me.

626
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:27,741
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Oh, sorry.

627
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,543
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Huh?

628
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:42,523
Vincent Scarletti, 82,
found down in his bathroom

629
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:44,157
He was in full arrest
on our arrival.

630
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,460
We shocked him twice,
got a rhythm and a pulse.

631
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,796
Mrs. Scarletti,
how long between the time

632
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,698
that you found your husband
and the paramedics arrived?

633
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:54,134
‐ W‐w‐what is that? What?
‐ She's hard of hearing.

634
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,236
Mrs. Scarletti, how long was
your husband unconscious

635
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,704
until the paramedics
showed up?

636
00:23:57,738 --> 00:24:00,707
Oh, I don't know.
Uh, ten minutes, 15 maybe.

637
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,043
He was here two weeks ago.
They said he was just fine.

638
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:04,244
We're going to do
everything we can.

639
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,880
'On my count.
One, two, three.'

640
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:11,818
‐ BP's 80/50.
‐ Pulse ox 90, pulse is 48.

641
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:15,922
Alright. Start dopamine.
Titrate to a systolic of 100.

642
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,491
Atropine 0.5 migs.

643
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,561
His pupils
are fixed and dilated.

644
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:23,597
No deep tendon reflexes.
Carol, get a CBC, chem‐7

645
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,799
EKG, blood gas
and a portable chest.

646
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:28,502
Lily, call respiratory.
Have them set up a vent.

647
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,937
What is it?
What's wrong with my Vincenzo?

648
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,739
It's okay, ma'am.
Please stand back.

649
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:36,543
He's a good man. We have six
children and 11 grandchildren‐‐

650
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,979
Mrs. Scarletti, you need
to wait outside.

651
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:41,014
‐ I need to what?
‐ Carol, could I get an assist?

652
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,916
Mrs. Scarletti, come on.
Let's go wait in the hall.

653
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,885
Help him...

654
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,622
‐ Carol?
‐ Mrs. Scarletti.

655
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,692
Come on, we need to let the
doctor do his job. Come on.

656
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:54,861
Come with me.

657
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,863
'Have you seen Anspaugh?
He's late for a hot appy.'

658
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:58,164
I think he's doing a AAA.

659
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:01,568
Oh, those can slog on.
You got something juicy?

660
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:04,037
‐ Yeah, hernia repair.
‐ Mine's a hot appendix.

661
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,106
Still, they can't all
be newsworthy, eh?

662
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:10,110
Unlike your osteochondral
allograph this afternoon, huh?

663
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:12,546
You intentionally sidelined
me for that, didn't you?

664
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,580
What?

665
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:14,615
'Handed me off to Anspaugh'

666
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,583
'so you could be with Romano.'

667
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:18,785
That's the silliest
thing I've ever heard.

668
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:22,055
He called me in to consult,
not the other way around.

669
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,924
Hmm.

670
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,592
If you say so.

671
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:28,995
No. It's not just what I say.
That's the way it was.

672
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,164
Do you know when Anspaugh
started the AAA?

673
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,966
An hour ago.

674
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,269
My patient's prepped.
I hate to get backed up.

675
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,772
Yeah, you are busy today.

676
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:41,942
Anspaugh wouldn't mind
if I just started, would he?

677
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,210
It's painting by numbers.

678
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:46,179
I haven't seen him mind yet.

679
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,753
So you're okay finding another
ride to journal club tonight?

680
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:53,820
Sure.

681
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:55,188
I can still give you
a ride home.

682
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,323
‐ No problem.
‐ I just totally spaced it.

683
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,893
I agreed to have dinner
with my grandmother tonight.

684
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:02,596
Hmm, so, uh, the hot dog's
just an appetizer?

685
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:03,897
Uh, cooking is not
exactly something you‐‐

686
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,299
Hey, Carter, Anna over here.

687
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:10,604
Breathe, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

688
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,905
Just relax. Hang on.
You're going to be okay.

689
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,106
I'm going to take
this off now.

690
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,941
‐ Okay?
‐ No, no! It's for my allergies.

691
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:16,777
I already told
the other doctor.

692
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,878
What other doctor?

693
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,012
Come on, let's get a gurney.

694
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,914
‐ Is that Mr. Scarletti?
‐ Yup.

695
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,283
‐ Pretty advanced lung cancer.
‐ Did you pull up his records?

696
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:24,985
Yeah, he was in two weeks ago.

697
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:27,353
They told him the cancer had
spread and was now inoperable.

698
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:30,023
‐ He never told his wife?
‐ Apparently not.

699
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,092
‐ What's her name again?
‐ Margaret Scarletti.

700
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,060
She's sitting over in chairs.
You want me to talk to her?

701
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,295
I'll do it.

702
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:38,198
Mark. Mark, I apologize
for being late.

703
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,000
I had lunch
with a rep from Synergix

704
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,201
and he had
some interesting ideas.

705
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:43,003
We're slammed here.
So you're‐‐

706
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,070
Mark, that crack‐head in three
is screaming his head off.

707
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,171
He'll have to wait.

708
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:46,406
I thought we could discuss

709
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,208
the staffing situation
over at some point.

710
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,976
Since it...
affects us both.

711
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,778
Kerry, I don't really know what
the hell you're talking about.

712
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,413
So why don't you write it down
in a memo and I 'll sign it?

713
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,015
Dr. Greene, this woman
collapsed outside.

714
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:56,783
‐ She said she saw you earlier.
‐ Yeah.

715
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,351
It's probably anaphylactic
shock. I'll be right there.

716
00:26:58,384 --> 00:26:59,753
I'll get her.

717
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,021
The back pain in two
wants more Demerol.

718
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,322
‐ Yeah, in a minute.
‐ 'Hey, Mark..'

719
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:03,690
Could you sign off
on this for me?

720
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,025
‐ No. Not now.
‐ We could use the beds.

721
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,693
What should I do
about the back pain?

722
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,094
Well, why don't you
get Doyle to check him out.

723
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,096
Dr. Greene, it's the hospital's
insurance attorney?

724
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,331
Take a message.

725
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,002
Mrs. Scarletti, could you
come with me, please?

726
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:19,706
My husband, will he be okay?
Will he live? H‐how is he?

727
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,008
I don't think we should
discuss this right here.

728
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,977
What did you say?
Is he going to live?

729
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,146
I said, we need
to find a place to talk.

730
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:29,349
I'm so worried about Vincenzo.
Please, can I go see him?

731
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:32,185
‐ No. No, no, no. Not‐not now.
‐ I just want to see how he is.

732
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:35,088
Look, Mrs. Scarletti,
your husband has no chance

733
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,356
for a meaningful recovery.

734
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:39,726
He will recover okay?
Oh, thank you so much.

735
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,227
No, no, no, no, no.

736
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:43,129
I said, your husband
has no chance

737
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,231
for a meaningful recovery.

738
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:47,400
I‐I don't understand.
What are you saying?

739
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,270
I'm saying that your
husband lied to you

740
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:53,707
about his condition.
He's going to die.

741
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:02,916
Jeanie, can you
explain‐explain it to her?

742
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,985
Come on, come on.
Let's talk this one out.

743
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:08,789
Come on.

744
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,960
Shouldn't somebody go
after him?

745
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,171
‐ Dr. Corday.
‐ 'Oh.'

746
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:29,009
Heard you were elbow deep
in a rather dicey AAA.

747
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,244
'Oh...I heard
you were doing the appy.'

748
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:35,248
All finished.
20 minutes and done.

749
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:38,018
You performed an operation
without an attending present?

750
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,854
Just an appendicectomy.
There weren't any complications.

751
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:44,525
The complication is...that you
disregarded hospital policy.

752
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,261
'With something as basic as this
I assumed there was leeway.'

753
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,996
You've been here
several months.

754
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:54,400
Have you seen any surgery
performed without an attending?

755
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:57,303
No.
I apologize.

756
00:28:57,337 --> 00:28:58,438
In Britain,
we do minor surgery

757
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,340
all the time
without supervision.

758
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:02,075
I was led to believe..

759
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,476
...the same standards
applied here.

760
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,846
By whom?

761
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:08,081
I was mistaken,
that's all.

762
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,883
It won't happen again.

763
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:14,555
Is it true
he just walked out?

764
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,289
Cynthia hot
on his heels.

765
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,024
He always seemed like
such a sensitive guy.

766
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,325
He is a sensitive guy.

767
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,161
Doesn't everybody have
some work to do?

768
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,830
You can't do anything until he
does something for himself.

769
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:27,534
Ah, man, I'm not going
to make it home to change.

770
00:29:27,568 --> 00:29:29,269
Big plans?

771
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:31,938
Yeah, I'm gonna hit up this
foundation for a lot of money

772
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:33,273
and I don't have
anything to wear.

773
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:35,576
I have a, uh, jacket
in my locker you can borrow.

774
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,511
It's, uh, from the goodwill,
but it looks decent.

775
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:39,279
‐ Aw, thanks, that'd be great.
‐ Sure.

776
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:40,480
From what Carter tells me

777
00:29:40,514 --> 00:29:42,315
his grandmother's
a real piece of work.

778
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:43,416
Carter meaning,
uh, John Carter?

779
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,285
Oh, yeah.
Even though it's called

780
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:47,588
The Carter Family Foundation,
I get the feeling

781
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:50,423
the grandmother holds the purse
strings with an iron claw.

782
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,860
‐ The Carter Family Foundation?
‐ Yeah. They're loaded.

783
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:55,295
Carter's real blue blood.

784
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,598
I figure it's this whole
upstairs, downstairs thing.

785
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:00,400
Yeah. Uh, you know, it
might help you to take

786
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,335
a doctor along with you
to make your case.

787
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:04,470
I wrote some pedes
clinic grants at CHOP.

788
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:05,906
‐ You sure?
‐ Yep.

789
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:08,341
‐ I'd love to come along.
‐ Okay.

790
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,176
It's like I can't breathe.

791
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,912
I‐it's like there's something
inside of my head

792
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:15,115
that's, like, pushing,
trying to get out, and then..

793
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,350
Every time I think
I have things under control

794
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:20,320
it just goes south.
I‐I'm babbling.

795
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:23,289
No, if you don't want
to talk about it..

796
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:26,359
Oh, no. It's‐it's..

797
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:29,896
A few months ago, I was attacked
in the men's room in the ER.

798
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,497
By this gangbanger

799
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:34,868
who blamed me because his
brother died of a gunshot wound.

800
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:35,969
Oh, my God.

801
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,504
That's the creep
who's suing you?

802
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:40,974
They settled the malpractice
suit for three million dollars.

803
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,343
And now,
the bastard's suing me

804
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:45,378
for violating his
brother's civil rights.

805
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,581
I mean,
figure that one out.

806
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:50,183
I can't believe it.

807
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:53,086
He attacked me
from behind.

808
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,287
I tried to fight back,
but I‐‐

809
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,022
But he‐he could
have had a..

810
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,891
...a gun
or been on drugs or‐‐

811
00:30:57,924 --> 00:30:59,425
I didn't even
think about that.

812
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,896
My adrenaline
was pumping so hard, but I..

813
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,431
You're right, I mean, people
on PCP, they..

814
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:06,600
He could have killed you.

815
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:19,179
Mark..

816
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:22,983
...you're so used to handling
everyone else's problems that

817
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,350
you're not used
to asking for help.

818
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,076
‐ Jeanie.
‐ Hi.

819
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,311
I always save these
horse pills till the end.

820
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,579
They're the hardest to swallow.

821
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:55,215
‐ We should talk.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

822
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,518
I know. Today has been insane.
Any word from Mark?

823
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,985
I've been in talks
with Dr. Anspaugh

824
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,286
about the ER budget.

825
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,288
He's very concerned
about our deficit.

826
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:03,456
Uh‐huh.

827
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,058
I‐I think
the overages can be

828
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,627
contained with
structural changes

829
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,229
if we aggressively pursue
industrial contracts.

830
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:12,365
Kerry, wait.
What are you saying?

831
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,202
I have to lay off some of the
staff including two PA's.

832
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:18,438
The fairest way to do that
is to give preference

833
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:20,406
to those with seniority.

834
00:32:22,543 --> 00:32:23,944
Are you firing me?

835
00:32:27,347 --> 00:32:29,149
Jeanie, I'm sorry.

836
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:32,218
I don't have a choice.
You were the last one hired.

837
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,387
Uh, listen. You can work
through the end of month.

838
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,422
Cobra Insurance will
cover your meds.

839
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,759
I've talked to the people
in physical therapy.

840
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,326
They think they're gonna
have an opening

841
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,628
coming up in the next
couple of months.

842
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:43,096
That's great.
Except it pays not a third less

843
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,264
than what I'm making here.

844
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,099
I want this to be
short‐term.

845
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,568
We're pursuing
outside contracts

846
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,069
and when the new system
is up and running

847
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:50,103
I'm hoping we can
bring you back.

848
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,171
Guess I'm just
supposed to wait

849
00:32:51,204 --> 00:32:52,405
by the phone
until that happens?

850
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:53,774
Jeanie..

851
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,709
You know I value
you professionally

852
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:57,511
and as a friend.

853
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:59,513
And I 'm gonna do everything
I can to work this out.

854
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:01,481
I don't care. Please don't
go to any more trouble.

855
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,506
‐ Do I look okay?
‐ You look great.

856
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,208
Whoo!

857
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:29,610
Ms. Hathaway and, uh..

858
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:31,377
I'm Dr. Del Amico, Anna.

859
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,680
Yes. Uh, Mrs. Carter
will be a few moments

860
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:35,348
but she insists
you have a cocktail.

861
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,450
So what may I bring you?

862
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:39,553
Uh...spring water
would be fine.

863
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:41,287
Yes.
And you, ma'am?

864
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,323
Uh, what kind of
beer do you have?

865
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,125
Heineken, Grolsch,
Amstel lite‐‐

866
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,326
Oh, actually,
you know what can you just

867
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,794
make that another
spring water?

868
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:51,765
Certainly. Will you
follow me to the music room?

869
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:53,133
Please.

870
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:02,809
Oh, my God.

871
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:06,146
Ah, that's Mr. Carter in 1985.

872
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,481
He and Marigold took home
a number of blue ribbons

873
00:34:08,515 --> 00:34:09,850
at Tempel Farms that year.

874
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,118
Mar‐marigold?

875
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,419
His thoroughbred.

876
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:15,689
Please, make yourselves
comfortable.

877
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:24,130
'Hey, Carol, did you
find the place okay?'

878
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:25,666
Hey, Carter.

879
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,267
Nice place you have here.

880
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:31,638
‐ ER..
‐ Any word from Mark?

881
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:34,841
No, but everybody else
keeps calling.

882
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,342
Doug, could you sign off
on this for me?

883
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:37,578
‐ Sure.
‐ Mark never got around to it.

884
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:40,346
‐ Some day, huh?
‐ Yeah, some day.

885
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,615
This is a horrible job.

886
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:43,584
When is the temp clerk
getting here?

887
00:34:43,617 --> 00:34:46,419
‐ ER. What do you want?
‐ Alright. I am out of here.

888
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:49,255
‐ Oh, uh, Doug, it's for you.
‐ Tell them I already left.

889
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,224
Uh, it's long distance, collect.

890
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,464
Hello.
This is Doug Ross.

891
00:34:58,498 --> 00:34:59,833
Yep. Okay.

892
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:05,772
Yeah.

893
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,642
Uh..

894
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:11,477
When?

895
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:14,280
Mm‐hmm.
Okay. Are you sure?

896
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:17,250
Okay. Uh, yeah. Hang on.
Do you have a pen?

897
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,295
Okay.

898
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,597
Thank you.

899
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,335
‐ 'Is everything okay?'
‐ Everything's fine.

900
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,212
No, I mean, I've seen it.

901
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:48,381
I've seen the kind of thing
nurse Hathaway's talking about.

902
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:51,618
An ER is about emergent cases.
It's about speed.

903
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,486
Patients that need
continuity of care

904
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,523
tend to, um,
fall through the cracks.

905
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:58,224
You know, I had a teenage
diabetic the other day‐‐

906
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:00,426
John, I 'm sure
your diabetic is fascinating

907
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,796
but I 'd like to speak to the
young lady with the proposal.

908
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,966
Sure.
Of course. I'm sorry.

909
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,568
Alone.

910
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:08,869
Ah!

911
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:10,971
‐ Right.
‐ Me, too?

912
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:14,675
Why don't you give Dr. Del Amico
a tour of the grounds?

913
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,643
Okay.

914
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:20,346
Excuse me.

915
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:27,220
Dr. Corday,
I'm‐I'm changing.

916
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,623
Shedding your old
skin, Dr. Snake?

917
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:30,891
I beg your pardon?

918
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:32,258
You knew full well
I wasn't permitted

919
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:33,627
to perform
that appendicectomy

920
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,362
but you let me walk
right in there anyway.

921
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:37,831
Like you knew full well
I should have been notified

922
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,700
about that gastroplasty
this morning, right?

923
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:40,934
You were home, Peter.

924
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,002
Hicks wanted to
go straight away.

925
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:43,670
Somebody needed to step in.

926
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,539
Like you needed someone
to step into the ischemic bowel

927
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:47,741
so you can end up
with Romano.

928
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:50,410
How dare you accuse me of
trying to manipulate you.

929
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:51,912
I deserve better than that.

930
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:54,414
Besides, if I 'd
really wanted to

931
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:56,683
you wouldn't even
have been aware of it.

932
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:04,691
Alright, alright.
I suppose I could've called you

933
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,926
but between your
being at home and

934
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,260
my not having done
a gastroplasty‐‐

935
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,762
Look, Dr. Corday,
you are not

936
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:10,430
the only one
who likes to cut.

937
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:11,832
No, but if I 'm
the only one here

938
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:14,000
then I won't be
a‐ashamed of doing it.

939
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:15,435
Well, then I 'll have
to make sure you're not

940
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,903
in that position again.

941
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:18,672
Why, thank you, Dr. Benton.

942
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:19,973
‐ Ah, Dr. Romano.
‐ Yeah?

943
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:21,007
I'm sorry.
Do you have a minute?

944
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,676
Absolutely.

945
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:26,613
I was, uh, wondering if
you were still looking for, uh

946
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:28,949
an extra set of hands.

947
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:31,585
Would those
be Benton hands?

948
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:34,387
‐ Yes.
‐ So!

949
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,455
You think you're going
to like the looks

950
00:37:35,488 --> 00:37:37,457
of the 21st century,
is that it?

951
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,326
He simply wants
to keep an eye on me.

952
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,528
Don't you, Dr. Benton?

953
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,298
Someone needs to.

954
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,267
Well, I'll give it some thought.
We'll talk more.

955
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,008
You remember Weebles?

956
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,611
Those little
egg‐looking things?

957
00:37:57,644 --> 00:38:00,346
"Weebles wobble
but they don't fall down"?

958
00:38:01,648 --> 00:38:02,949
Gamma used to hate it.

959
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:04,651
But I would take
the Faberge eggs

960
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,953
and I'd put them with my
little Weeble family.

961
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:08,088
As pets.

962
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:15,328
Alright, I 'm sorry. You know,
I should have said something.

963
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:17,998
But you were
so anti‐rich people.

964
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:20,333
I'm even more anti‐liars.

965
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,039
Well, I wanted you
to get to know me first.

966
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:28,474
Okay...and, uh, meanwhile

967
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,410
I take you to my
favorite thrift store

968
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:32,112
give you a tour of
roach manor this morning

969
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:35,616
'and...you must have been
laughing your head off.'

970
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:38,484
No. Not at all.
I loved that stuff.

971
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,688
A little slumming,
is that it?

972
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,356
You know, before you knew
about all of this

973
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:45,592
you saw me for what I am,
a regular guy.

974
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:48,061
A regular guy
doesn't patronize people.

975
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:51,998
You went out of your way
to make me look like an idiot.

976
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:53,767
Anna, I'm sorry.

977
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:57,470
Forget it, Carter.

978
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,808
So, that's it?

979
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:04,010
My family has a few bucks
and everything changes.

980
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,812
A few bucks?
Is that what this is to you?

981
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,047
It's a figure of speech.

982
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,153
That's exactly what
I'm talkin' about.

983
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:16,022
To you, this is all
a figure of speech.

984
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:18,992
To me..

985
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:22,095
I'm just going to go wait
outside until Carol gets done.

986
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,107
Mark?

987
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,776
It's Doug.

988
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:41,181
‐ Hi.
‐ Huh.

989
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:42,448
Cynthia.

990
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:43,950
Uh, I'm looking for Mark.

991
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:46,587
Um, I think he might be asleep
already but I 'll check.

992
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,888
‐ I‐oh..
‐ Who is it?

993
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:48,922
Come on in.

994
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:50,657
‐ Hey.
‐ Hi.

995
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:52,092
What's going on?

996
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,060
Uh..

997
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:57,430
Might be a bad time, huh?

998
00:39:57,463 --> 00:39:59,399
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, kind of.

999
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:10,176
You okay?

1000
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:13,847
Hey, um..

1001
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,182
Well, I just...wanted to make
sure you were okay.

1002
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,619
I'm fine.

1003
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:20,053
I know you've been going
through a rough time.

1004
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:21,087
We're all worried
about you.

1005
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:22,488
I'm okay.

1006
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:27,694
Okay.
Alright.

1007
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:28,929
I'm taking a few days off.

1008
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:30,463
I got a call from California.

1009
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:31,965
Uh, my dad died.

1010
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:34,835
‐ What? W‐w‐what happened?
‐ Nothing, I don't know.

1011
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:36,036
Some car wreck or something.

1012
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:38,071
They weren't real clear
on the details.

1013
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:40,507
Um, but I got to go...

1014
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:44,044
claim the body
and stuff like that. So..

1015
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:45,078
I'm sorry.

1016
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:48,549
Yeah.
I...uh, know.

1017
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,986
Alright, I'll talk,
I'll talk to you later.

1018
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:54,821
‐ 'No, no. Hey, come on in.'
‐ No, it's okay. No, no.

1019
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:57,023
‐ I'll talk to you later.
‐ Come on in. I'll make coffee.

1020
00:40:57,057 --> 00:40:59,192
‐ Come on.
‐ Alright.

1021
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:06,066
I looked him dead in the eye
and I said, "That might fly

1022
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,169
"with your Hollywood
chippies, Mr. President.

1023
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:10,737
But I am a lady."

1024
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,238
So, what did he do?

1025
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:14,941
He took his hand off
my rear and apologized.

1026
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:16,242
And that was it?

1027
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:17,678
Then I slept with him.

1028
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:21,648
May I freshen you up?

1029
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:23,517
No, thank you.
I have to drive.

1030
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,818
And it's getting late.

1031
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:27,220
Time for the fat lady
to sing.

1032
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:28,889
I like you, Carol.

1033
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:32,158
‐ You remind me of me.
‐ Thank you.

1034
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:35,929
I think you might
just possess the..

1035
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:40,266
...extreme bullheaded
stubbornness..

1036
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,537
...to make this
clinic thing work.

1037
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,906
How would you like some seed
money to start you off?

1038
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:51,177
Seventy‐five thousand dollars?

1039
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:53,614
Uh, you haven't even
read my proposal.

1040
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:58,251
It's my foundation.
Just don't tell my grandson.

1041
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:01,722
I have a stern,
unapproachable image to keep up.

1042
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,123
Oh, well, as far as
I'm concerned

1043
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:04,791
this meeting was hell
from beginning to end.

1044
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:07,293
‐ Exactly.
‐ Thank you so much.

1045
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:10,964
Wow.

1046
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:32,786
Good, good. Ha‐ha.
You're not too late.

1047
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,955
I wanted to get
this celebration rolling.

1048
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:37,257
Celebration?

1049
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,026
I got a supersaver ticket
to Atlanta.

1050
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,895
Tommy's gonna introduce
me to some people

1051
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:45,231
and his sister‐in‐law
is a realtor.

1052
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:48,268
‐ So, you had a good day.
‐ No, not just me.

1053
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:51,071
Tommy‐Tommy knows some doctors
at the County hospital.

1054
00:42:51,104 --> 00:42:53,674
Oh.
Sounds too good to be true.

1055
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:56,309
We can make this happen.
We can make this work.

1056
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,114
Hey.

1057
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:04,751
What's wrong?

1058
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:09,890
Hi, Kerry.

1059
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:12,693
Ellis.

1060
00:43:12,726 --> 00:43:15,295
I know this is strange.
We‐we just met and, uh

1061
00:43:15,328 --> 00:43:17,898
here I am calling you up
to come have a drink.

1062
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,166
I‐I hope you don't
misunderstand.

1063
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,935
Oh, no, please.
You saved me

1064
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:24,705
from having to watch
the local news.

1065
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:26,206
I don't usually do
this kind of thing.

1066
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,675
Sure.
That's what they all say.

1067
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:33,814
What's on your mind?

1068
00:43:35,882 --> 00:43:39,319
I had to lay off a pretty close
friend this afternoon

1069
00:43:39,352 --> 00:43:42,155
and she didn't seem
to appreciate my suggestions

1070
00:43:42,188 --> 00:43:43,690
for getting through this.

1071
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:47,761
She just felt fired.

1072
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:49,696
Which is exactly
what she was.

1073
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,832
That's right.

1074
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:54,034
When you work your ass off
to try to get her job back

1075
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,302
she's not gonna
appreciate that either.

1076
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:00,741
Welcome to the wonderful
world of management.

1077
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:08,048
Can I get you
another drink?

1078
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:09,916
That would be great.
Thanks.

1079
00:44:15,388 --> 00:44:17,190
I wish you'd wait
and leave tomorrow.

1080
00:44:17,223 --> 00:44:19,159
Nah, I just want
to get on with it.

1081
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:29,803
At least let me give you
a ride to the airport.

1082
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,805
Nah, I'm just gonna
leave the car in parking..

1083
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:32,906
...pick Mark up on the way.

1084
00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:35,175
I'm glad
he's going with you.

1085
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,342
Yeah, it's probably
a good idea for him

1086
00:44:36,376 --> 00:44:38,278
to get out of town
for a while.

1087
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,752
I'm gonna miss you.

1088
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,674
I love you, Carol.

1089
00:44:59,851 --> 00:45:01,219
I love you, too.
