1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,641
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,242
Son of a bitch!

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,612
I can be a competent surgeon.

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,780
I can learn the techniques,
the mechanics..

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,718
...but I'll never
be a great surgeon.

6
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,485
Mark, I'm not gonna write
you that prescription

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,655
for the Percodan. I think
you've gotta get some help.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,123
I'm fine.

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,491
Your baby was deprived
of oxygen in the womb.

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,827
'So there's always
the possibility'

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,294
'that there could
be brain damage.'

12
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,133
Back off!

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,702
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,641
‐ 'Can we get this tonight?'
‐ 'We have to.'

15
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,609
'Change out the batteries
in those lavaliers.'

16
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,410
'He's getting
more nine‐volts.'

17
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,280
‐ 'It's got the smell, huh?'
‐ 'Rob, white‐balance that.'

18
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,250
'Tony already did it.
He laid down bars and tones.'

19
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,619
'How come hospitals
have this smell?'

20
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,621
'Pork buns?
Who went for food?'

21
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,823
‐ 'I brought it myself.'
‐ 'Thanks a hell of a lot.'

22
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,825
'Camera mount in the trauma
room's key‐stoning.'

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,528
‐ 'Hasn't been leveled yet.'
‐ 'Alright, guys.'

24
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,364
'Let's get ready to shoot.
Everybody on the same page?'

25
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,132
‐ 'You worried about that?'
‐ 'No, it's working fine.'

26
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,568
'Hey, hey!
Those tapes are numbered!'

27
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,435
'Stuart and I will stick
with the doctor.'

28
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,539
'Luis and Rob,
follow our lead.'

29
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,708
'This is still breaking up.'

30
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,643
'Remember our deadline. We don't
get a second chance here.'

31
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,112
‐ 'I hate hospitals.'
‐ 'Is Dr. Greene here yet?'

32
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,347
‐ 'I haven't seen him.'
‐ 'We'll catch up.'

33
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,183
‐ 'Are you set in the lounge?'
‐ 'Just need tapes.'

34
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,751
'Where do we put
the battery charger?'

35
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,352
'It's plugged in
in the x‐ray room.'

36
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,589
'Trim RF six,
it's too hot.'

37
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,830
'What is that?'

38
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,899
'Oh, you know,
it's back‐up footage.'

39
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,467
'Workplace stuff.'

40
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,736
Cubbies still losing?

41
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,505
I don't know.
I haven't been watching.

42
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:47,307
We put up stationary cameras,
one at your main desk

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,675
one in that yellow
operating room.

44
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,443
‐ Trauma one?
‐ Yeah, high‐traffic areas.

45
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,913
Get some wide angles to cut with
what the hand‐held guys shoot

46
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,180
for pace, variety, you know.

47
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,516
Right.

48
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,352
And we just leave them running.
Get what we get.

49
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,821
It's on?

50
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,824
By the end of the day
you'll forget we're here.

51
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,726
See you.

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,727
Excuse me.

53
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,735
Oh!

54
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:24,410
...in 1983 and again in 1986.

55
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,381
Philadelphia in '83,
the New York Mets in '86.

56
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,383
We'll see another
one right here.

57
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,189
'I thought we were gonna start
with him coming on shift.'

58
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,624
Too late.
He's already in trauma.

59
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,725
Careful!

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,261
He's the one
with the little glasses.

61
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,596
'I remember.'

62
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,264
Open fracture,
distal tibia.

63
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,366
We gave four milligrams of
morphine in the field.

64
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,801
How bad did
the goalpost look?

65
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,969
Hey, I scored.

66
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,737
Nurse Marquez,
let's order pre‐op labs

67
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,507
CBC, type and screen, and
left lower extremity films.

68
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,541
Ancef?

69
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,242
One gram IV piggyback

70
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,544
and 100 of gentamicin.

71
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,945
I really broke it, huh?

72
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,480
You won't be playing
varsity this fall.

73
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,448
Varsity?
I'm 24 years old.

74
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,417
‐ Twenty‐four?
‐ Guess, I don't need you.

75
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,320
Man, you are going
to get carded until you're 40.

76
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,955
‐ Can you stay for a moment?
‐ You need me?

77
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,457
Yeah, I want to get Dr. Greene
discussing the orders.

78
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,695
‐ You need the back of my head?
‐ Yeah. That will be great.

79
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,730
Uh, Dr. Greene,
how's that pulse?

80
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,464
Distal pulses are
two plus and equal.

81
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,233
No arterial injury.

82
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,602
'Good evening.'

83
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,403
Dr. Carter,
you're early.

84
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,470
Open fracture?

85
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,973
‐ Yup.
‐ Need me?

86
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,777
Yes, uh, actually I'm sick of
assisting Dr. Welby here.

87
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,546
Listen, why don't you
finish the history?

88
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,948
Do you have pain anywhere
besides your leg, Mr. Chang?

89
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,250
Justin.
I kind of jammed my stomach.

90
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,619
Have you got
any allergies?

91
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,020
Just hay fever.

92
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,322
‐ Anything for me?
‐ Oh, this is today?

93
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,590
'Please don't look
into the lens.'

94
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,358
‐ Yeah, right.
‐ Possible surgical‐‐

95
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,694
‐ You're still here?
‐ Yep. 36 hours.

96
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,395
We're short a surgeon.

97
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,699
Alright,
Belly's benign. Call ortho.

98
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,401
How's it going?

99
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,770
Is he pissed off
about losing you?

100
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,038
We haven't talked.

101
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,305
When was your
last meal?

102
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,575
I ate lunch around one.

103
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,277
‐ Cimetidine, 300 milligrams IV.
‐ You got it.

104
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,379
That will cut down on the
acidity in your stomach.

105
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,683
If you vomit in the OR,
you could aspirate your stomach

106
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,618
contents into your lungs
and develop pneumonia.

107
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,354
That's probably more
than Mr. Chang needed to hear.

108
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,756
Whoa, whoa.
We've got a problem.

109
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,457
‐ What.
‐ Sorry to interrupt.

110
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,359
One of the docs says she wasn't
informed about our shoot.

111
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,428
Alright. I'll be right there.
Stuart, are you okay?

112
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,065
'Dr. Carter, uh, our mic will
pick you up at normal volume'

113
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,767
'you can relax and
speak naturally.'

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,403
Okay, Carter wasn't acting.
He's really like that.

115
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,640
They're focusing on Dr. Greene
but their goal is to get a sense

116
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,009
of what all of us do
in the emergency department

117
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,011
and portray it
in a positive light.

118
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,013
It says nothing there
about a "Positive light."

119
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,582
'It only talks
about their rights'

120
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,016
'to use my name and
image in perpetuity.'

121
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,585
Why not take this
in the lounge?

122
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,553
You know, doctors Anspaugh
and Morgenstern

123
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,722
think this documentary will
increase public awareness

124
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,923
of the health care
issues we face.

125
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,792
Okay, I understand.
That's fine.

126
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,059
I'm sorry,
what's your name?

127
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,328
‐ 'Luis.'
‐ Luis. No offence, Luis.

128
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,564
I'm not saying you're
ambush us or do any expose

129
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,800
but there's nothing on
this form to stop them

130
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,735
and if I don't sign this
you're wasting film right now.

131
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,369
'It's tape.
It's cheap.'

132
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,606
Hi. I'm Agi Orton. My husband
and I are the directors.

133
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,807
Hi.
Anna Del Amico.

134
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,542
'Do you have
some questions?'

135
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,611
If we could speak in the lounge,
it will all straighten out.

136
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,912
Okay, sure.
I'll catch you later.

137
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,980
You know, Dr. Del Amico
is new here..

138
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,482
It's fine if she doesn't wanna
sign, we can shoot around her.

139
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,784
Luis, if you're
finished setting up

140
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,019
Stuart needs you.

141
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,486
Hey, miss, is this
gonna be on TV?

142
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,355
Uh, pre‐sold to PBS.

143
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,057
PBS? Not Network?

144
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,792
No. Luis.

145
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,796
That's not the point,
it's something Mark agreed

146
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,497
and he's excited about it.

147
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,501
‐ 'You think he's up to it?'
‐ Yeah, sure. Why not?

148
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,069
Cameras all over the place.
It makes me uptight.

149
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,039
I know. We'll all be hiding out
here by the end of the night.

150
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,842
I don't know Mark the way you do
but he seems a little shaky.

151
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,810
Oh, he's going
to be fine.

152
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,412
Yeah, I'd be shaky, too if I had
the crap beaten out of me.

153
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,149
'Mark wanted to do this.
I think that's a good sign.'

154
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,384
‐ 'Maybe he's back on his game.'
‐ Maybe.

155
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,953
In any case, they're here,
they're shooting.

156
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,522
There's nothing we can do about
it except stick up for Mark

157
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,991
which is what I'm doing.

158
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,726
Buddy, you look like
a star out there.

159
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,795
Well, I'm enjoying
all the attention.

160
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,030
Don't get too used to everybody
taking orders from you.

161
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,666
Yeah, I was hoping
for a sequel.

162
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,033
Yeah, well some of us
are working stiffs.

163
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,535
I've got measles
in four.

164
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,003
Later.

165
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,777
Oh!

166
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,778
Phew!

167
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,187
Mr. Schoenberger
is in sinus rhythm.

168
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,958
BP's 110/70,
pulse is 72, reps are 16..

169
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,094
...resps, uh, sorry.
Should I start over?

170
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,529
'Sure.'

171
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,864
Next time you can
just keep going.

172
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,900
Oh, well, Mr. Schoenberger's
cardiogram is normal.

173
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,001
His shortness of
breath was resolved

174
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,836
with two liters
of oxygen.

175
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,738
And he may have had slight
indigestion a couple hours ago.

176
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,439
Today was
all‐you‐can‐eat burritos

177
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,174
at my favorite
Mexican place.

178
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,210
Do you have any family
history of heart disease?

179
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,113
No. My relatives
generally prefer cancer.

180
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,848
‐ Do you smoke?
‐ Not cigarettes.

181
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,083
Mr. Schoenberger
recently took up cigars.

182
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,151
I don't inhale.

183
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,653
I started a cardiac work‐up

184
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,154
ordered a CBC, chem seven.

185
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,156
Cardiac enzymes,
serum myoglobin.

186
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,758
Whoa, Jeanie,
that's a little gung‐ho

187
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,527
for a guy who ate
too many burritos.

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,629
Well, he was concerned enough to
come in, and he has insurance.

189
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,864
That's no reason
to order a million tests.

190
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,733
You can lie back now.

191
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,668
You know where I can get
a hold of any Havana's?

192
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,805
Whoa! My tastes are
a little more pedestrian.

193
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,641
I'm happy puffing
on one of these.

194
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,509
No wonder you're
short of breath.

195
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,778
Seriously? You think
it's the cigars?

196
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,780
Those aren't fit
to be called cigars.

197
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,782
You should lay off
the cheapos for a few days

198
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,250
and I think
you're gonna feel fine.

199
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,852
Give up the stogies?

200
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,787
At least treat yourself
to something decent.

201
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,924
Hey, you think
this'll be in the movie?

202
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,664
I just dropped by
to thank you again, Mark

203
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,832
and to see how
things are going.

204
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,171
Y‐you don't
have to film this.

205
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,506
Everything
under control?

206
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,207
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

207
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,042
Seems like a pretty
busy night.

208
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,546
Not that too busy...for
a weeknight.

209
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,647
Right.

210
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,082
It's pretty slow
for a weeknight.

211
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,750
I'm sure it'll
pick up later.

212
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,051
Yeah. Later.

213
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,186
It should pick up.

214
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,954
You'll get good stuff.

215
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,524
I just wanted to make sure
things were copasetic

216
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,192
and thank you again
for taking this on.

217
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,860
Sure.

218
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,264
Stuart,
come grab this.

219
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,299
Excuse me, who do
I give this to?

220
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,967
Oh, you
decided to sign?

221
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,169
Yeah, just keep my face
off hard copy, okay?

222
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:27,874
The nurses are cooking,
they're mic'd to channel three.

223
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,676
The best one was the guy
with the transistor radio.

224
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,077
‐ Remember?
‐ Right.

225
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,613
He said he was
getting out of the shower

226
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,648
he slipped and he
sat down on it.

227
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,716
‐ Ouch.
‐ While it was still playing?

228
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,284
Whoop, there it is.

229
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,554
So I asked Mark,
Dr. Greene..

230
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,255
...if he was going to
extract the foreign body

231
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,291
and he said, "No, but I'll
tune it to the ball game!"

232
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,294
Head lac for Carter,
has anybody seen him?

233
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,297
'Is there's a camaraderie
between doctors and nurses?'

234
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,199
‐ 'What about dating?'
‐ Who, Mark?

235
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,334
'You tell me.'

236
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,838
Oh...um..
Oh, I'm sorry..

237
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,272
'Let me get that,
I got that.'

238
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,142
Actually, we do socialize
but more as a group.

239
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,011
And Dr. Greene comes...but he,
well, he used to come‐‐

240
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,880
Well, he's been taking
it kind of slow.

241
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,215
Yeah, since he got beat
down I mean, beat up.

242
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,951
You know about
that, right?

243
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,853
Mm.

244
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,621
Well, you know what,
actually, it's a myth

245
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,222
about doctors and
nurses dating so much.

246
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,292
I mean, I know more nurses who
date cops, firemen, paramedics.

247
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,194
Now, that cliche is true.

248
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,863
Oh, especially cops.

249
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,598
Especially young cops.

250
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,003
'Getting back to Dr. Greene,
he does seem a little..'

251
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,772
I need a nurse in three.

252
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,641
'Oh, okay, everybody,
that was great.'

253
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,910
'Lucy, you got
some explaining to do.'

254
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,278
'What?'

255
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,146
'What's all this
about cops and firemen?'

256
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,214
Stay with them.
They're mic'd.

257
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,315
'Jealous?'

258
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,918
'Jealous.'

259
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,019
I don't know what
you're doing for them

260
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,654
you're not doing for me.

261
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,955
I'll tell you later
if you bring the cuffs.

262
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,390
I thought I was gonna
get some sleep tonight.

263
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,192
Oh, don't count on that.

264
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,627
Look at that.

265
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,862
He wishes he
could read lips.

266
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,631
Hi, there, dumb ass.

267
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,066
Doug, he's waving.

268
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,303
You got a mic on?

269
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,038
Oh, my God! Do you think
he could he hear me?

270
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,073
Turn it off.

271
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,243
But that's the thing
about the ER, you know

272
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,878
You got to stay on your toes.

273
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,214
‐ Hey, Lily's looking for you.
‐ I'm on my way.

274
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,348
You're also more on
your own down here.

275
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,883
When I was up in surgery

276
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,352
there was always someone
looking over my shoulder

277
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,821
critiquing every move.

278
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:21,888
Here the residents
are responsible‐‐

279
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,825
Carter! Help me.

280
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,793
Get me a basin,
I can't get him rolled.

281
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,428
I think I'm
gonna puke again!

282
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,096
'I know..'

283
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,275
‐ I feel much better.
‐ 'Oh, good. Good.'

284
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,309
Oh, yeah.

285
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,945
I'm going to change.

286
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,780
Compazine for
our friend, please.

287
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,115
Twenty‐five milligrams PR.

288
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,350
Excuse me.

289
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,052
'What's that mean, "PR"?'

290
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,854
"Per rectum."

291
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,421
'Do you have
to clean this up?'

292
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,990
Oh, no.

293
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,392
Housekeeping
to suture room.

294
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,462
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for.

295
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,230
We're just gonna keep it
really conversational.

296
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,232
Everybody, come and go
as you normally would.

297
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,001
Don't be afraid
to interrupt.

298
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,371
Just talk right to me.
I'll be next to the camera.

299
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,740
'First, explain how long
you've been here'

300
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:14,808
'what an attending does.'

301
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,209
My name's Mark Greene.

302
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,944
And I've been working here
at County General

303
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,781
since I finished med school
six years ago.

304
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,116
I got the GI bleed in curtain
two admitted to medicine.

305
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,085
Okay, great.
Thanks, Kerry.

306
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,920
'Describe how an emergency
room serves the public.'

307
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,022
Oh, well for a lot of people
we're the only access‐‐

308
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,124
Mark, paramedics are pulling
in a 37‐year‐old male

309
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,358
under respiratory distress.

310
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,994
Neighbor called, he says
he's got cancer.

311
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,229
Alright, prep trauma
one and find Carter.

312
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,799
Oh, Mark, sorry, labs are
back on Schoenberger.

313
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,200
‐ You'd better take a look.
‐ The cigar smoker?

314
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,367
CKMBs are pretty high.

315
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,468
I'll say.
Did he go home?

316
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,304
He's getting
ready to go.

317
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,972
‐ Dr. Del Amico?
‐ Yeah.

318
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,908
Stick around, we have a
respiratory distress pulling up.

319
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,510
I'm on it.

320
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,745
Mr. Schoenberger,
we got your tests back

321
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,248
with a result we didn't expect,
indicating a possible problem.

322
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,850
What do you mean?

323
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,484
You ought to stick around
for one more test.

324
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,820
Troponin‐t.

325
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,387
It's just for clarification.

326
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,089
We can do it on the blood
we've already drawn.

327
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,290
Better safe
than sorry.

328
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,892
Exactly. And while
you're waiting

329
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,293
we're gonna stick you
back on a monitor.

330
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,134
An elevated CKMB

331
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,036
indicates heart
muscle damage.

332
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,871
‐ 'A heart attack?'
‐ That's right.

333
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,874
‐ I'll get another EKG.
‐ 'Can it mean something else?'

334
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,209
It's probably an MI. But the
other test will confirm it.

335
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,878
'And then what?'

336
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,380
Actually, regardless
of the other results

337
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,416
an elevated CKMB,
means he's had an MI.

338
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,153
So, I'm actually just
giving him a little time

339
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,155
to adjust to that possibility.

340
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,323
And, of course,
since I missed it

341
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,993
I'm buying some time
to cover my ass.

342
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,165
37‐year‐old man
in respiratory distress.

343
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,466
Neighbor here says
he was diagnosed

344
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,268
with esophageal cancer
six months ago.

345
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,303
I was watching him
while Krista went to the store.

346
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,972
He hasn't been
breathing that good‐‐

347
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,940
‐ Out of the way!
‐ He started, like, choking..

348
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,843
He's tachy at 120.
Pressure's 130/100.

349
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,179
Resps are increased at 30.
He's got a lot of secretions.

350
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,247
Alright, let's get him
on high‐flow O‐2

351
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,482
and prep
an intubation tray.

352
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,318
On my count,
one, two, three.

353
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,188
Help him, he can't breathe.
Hang in there, Boz.

354
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,156
Chuny, suction
these secretions.

355
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,492
Hang two liters of saline,
this guy is bone dry.

356
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,595
‐ Pulse ox is 89.
‐ Should I intubate?

357
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,097
With the mass in his throat,
we'd have to crike him.

358
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,498
But I don't want to use
extraordinary measures

359
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,934
if he has a DNR.

360
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,468
Do you know anything about
your best friend's wishes?

361
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,871
He's the best bass
player I ever met.

362
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,973
Yo, man, you can't light
that thing up in here.

363
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,074
Keep suctioning.

364
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,275
Anna, grab a blood gas.

365
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,011
Pulse ox down to 87.

366
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:35,148
Alright, prep a crike tray.
Give him 600 of clindamycin IV..

367
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,150
‐ Carol, get the slate.
‐ Excuse me.

368
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,885
‐ What's his name?
‐ Boz.

369
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,954
Boz, can you hear me?

370
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,455
I know you're having
trouble breathing.

371
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,057
Do you want us
to help you out?

372
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,359
‐ Antibiotics are up.
‐ I got to get in here.

373
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,495
Sir, I'm gonna hold up this
slate, and you can write on it.

374
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,033
Boz, do you want a
crichothyroidectomy?

375
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,468
I can cut a hole in your
neck to help you breathe.

376
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,504
Do you want that?

377
00:13:57,538 --> 00:14:00,273
If you can't write your answer
I'll have to put the tube in.

378
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,976
Do you want
to be criked?

379
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,310
Come on, don't let him die!
Give him the crike thing!

380
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:08,148
Damn. I can't get this.

381
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,350
‐ Okay, crike tray.
‐ Yeah, do it. Do it!

382
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:18,358
No, no, no!
You do not want to know.

383
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,093
'I wouldn't ask
if I didn't want to know.'

384
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,563
I have done this
too long not to know.

385
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,465
This job, people don't
want to hear about it.

386
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,000
'Why? Because of what
you clean up?'

387
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,903
This is nothing.

388
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:33,540
Believe me, this here
is just a little...picnic.

389
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,242
You ought to see
what some of them do.

390
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,479
A body is only so big, but..

391
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:42,315
...you can hardly believe
all that comes out of it.

392
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,053
You get used to it though,
like every mama and daddy

393
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,624
get used to changing
a baby's diaper.

394
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:54,561
But the blood and the gore..

395
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:57,564
You know what
the gore is, right?

396
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:01,201
That's the part
you don't talk about

397
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,271
when you go home and they
ask you how your day was.

398
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,007
No, no.

399
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,676
It doesn't bother me.

400
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,346
You see, I'm a religious person

401
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,582
and I believe human beings

402
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:19,219
were created in God's image.

403
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:23,957
So, whatever I'm cleaning up
must be just fine.

404
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,128
Do you believe?

405
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,362
'I don't know.'

406
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,496
'You mean,
believe in God.'

407
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,032
Uh‐huh.

408
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,367
You couldn't do my job
if you didn't.

409
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,102
You could maybe be a doctor

410
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,640
or a nurse or make a movie.

411
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,342
Not my job.

412
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,410
Hey, I'll tell you
something else, too.

413
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,212
Luis, we need you
in the trauma room.

414
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,014
‐ A guy stopped breathing.
‐ I'm on my way.

415
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,417
'I'll catch you later.'

416
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,054
Sure, you will.

417
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,999
Most of the ones I can remember
are from my first year.

418
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,134
After a while,
you get protective

419
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,036
and you don't let
them get to you.

420
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,273
'What does it take these days to
break through your armor?'

421
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,041
It doesn't happen.

422
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,243
But there was this one
girl my first year.

423
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,479
I guess I'd gotten used to
this being a County facility.

424
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,047
I'd treated a lot
of homeless people

425
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,049
a lot of people
from the projects.

426
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,086
One day, this girl came in,
traffic accident

427
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,690
in a coma, brain dead,
and I realized I knew her.

428
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,126
She was the kid sister of a guy
I'd gone to med school with.

429
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,162
One night, she'd tried to show
me how to slam dance

430
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:39,733
you know, just fooling around.
That's when I realized

431
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,669
that trauma isn't something
that happens to other people.

432
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:43,804
'It could happen
to you.'

433
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,639
That's right.

434
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,641
'Does it change things
when it is you?'

435
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,375
What do you mean?

436
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,277
'When you yourself
are traumatized..'

437
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,179
'...as a doctor.'

438
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,248
'I see you have a splint
on your wrist.'

439
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,818
'I heard you had an incident
recently here at the hospital.'

440
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,419
Is that what
you're doing here?

441
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,121
‐ I don't wanna talk about that.
‐ 'I'm sorry.'

442
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,723
But safety is something
everybody worries about.

443
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,525
Is that why you picked me?
To get into all that?

444
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,527
Dr. Green, we're not here to
make you uncomfortable.

445
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,394
'You don't have to talk about
something if you don't want to.'

446
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,463
‐ Good, because I'm not.
‐ 'But we are here.'

447
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,265
And we are committed
to making this film.

448
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,466
'And we want you
to have an opportunity'

449
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,701
'to say what's
on your mind.'

450
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:16,436
Yeah, well I have
nothing to say.

451
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,171
I agreed to let
you follow me around

452
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,574
you can do that, but no more
comments, no interview.

453
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,242
Dr. Greene,
we are professionals.

454
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,343
We're not here
to attack you.

455
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,845
'Agi?'

456
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,513
Damn.

457
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,585
‐ 'Is that his daughter?'
‐ 'No, it's his wife.'

458
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,420
'Esophageal cancer,
it's a horrible death.'

459
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,656
Dr. Greene criked him.

460
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,323
He's running
into surgical options

461
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,725
and none of them are going
to buy him much time.

462
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,160
Are you sure you want
to speak to the wife?

463
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,795
She looks like
she's a teenager.

464
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:45,231
It may be difficult to get her
to understand the situation.

465
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,467
No, I'd like to try.

466
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,202
Normally, we wouldn't
have an intern take on

467
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,872
something like this,
but Carter's been around.

468
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,875
And technically, I'm not an
intern. I'm second year.

469
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,778
‐ Uh, no, you're an intern.
‐ I am?

470
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,547
You can't switch your specialty
here without starting over.

471
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,382
‐ I've already done a year.
‐ In surgery.

472
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,384
This is emergency medicine.
I thought you understood that.

473
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,786
Uh..

474
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,821
You know, let's, we'll
discuss this later

475
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,090
when we're not in the
middle of all this.

476
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,160
‐ 'Where do you start?'
‐ Huh?

477
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,295
'When you have
to counsel family'

478
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,630
'about something
like this.'

479
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,498
Oh, yeah, well,
it's tricky, you know.

480
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,666
People are upset,
and they're hearing

481
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,535
a lot of complex information.

482
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,469
An emergency resident..

483
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:26,472
...or intern, has to establish
an instant rapport with the‐‐

484
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,642
‐ Excuse me, doctor.
‐ No, not at all.

485
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,711
I was just coming in
to see you.

486
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,213
Um, your husband
is going to be admitted.

487
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,447
Yeah, well, you'd
better call transport.

488
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,149
They can take forever.

489
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,384
Okay. Well, we should talk about
your husband's condition.

490
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,886
Excuse me
for one second.

491
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,590
Chuny, can I see that
chart for a second? Thanks.

492
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,792
'If I go too fast for you or
if you have any questions'

493
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,628
'just please stop me.'

494
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,596
'Now I know your husband's
had some laser treatments.'

495
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,198
'That's a procedure to enlarge
the opening of the esophagus.'

496
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,934
'Yeah, for all
the good it did.'

497
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,836
'Well, a feeding tube can be
inserted through that opening.'

498
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,738
Cancer eats right through it.

499
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,272
Right. Well, there's
an option called the j‐tube.

500
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,641
We're not screwing
around with that.

501
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,876
The sucker's on his aorta,
he's a dead man.

502
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,680
If you feel that way,
you might want to consider

503
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,249
having your husband
sign a DNR.

504
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,851
That's a do‐not‐resuscitate
order, which‐‐

505
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,554
Yeah, got it.

506
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,322
There was one by his bed,
too but Rog sort of freaked.

507
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,627
I'm sorry.

508
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,328
I'm sorry.
We tried to ask him.

509
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,265
I was just out buying garlic
and herbs...

510
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,234
Boz' food.

511
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,371
But all he can do now
is smell it anyways.

512
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,740
I hold it under his nose,
and he smells.

513
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,948
Want to hear
about our sex life?

514
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:43,917
If there's anything
that I can answer

515
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,353
or if there's anything
that you need..

516
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,489
Yeah.
I'm on Librium.

517
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,391
Can you write me
a refill?

518
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,496
The mother wants
to call animal control.

519
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,231
Well, this
ought to be fun.

520
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,636
I've had Jojo
for nine years.

521
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,671
‐ He's a vicious dog.
‐ He only sounds that way.

522
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:05,772
He's never bitten
anyone before.

523
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,340
He hadn't been
around children.

524
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,742
Can you give it a
rest over there!

525
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,511
You see who's laying here
behaving herself?

526
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,813
‐ Did you call animal control?
‐ Please, take a breath.

527
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:17,350
This is our daughter who was
bitten! I can't believe you!

528
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,019
You're supposed to call
animal control with bites.

529
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,687
‐ Isn't that the law?
‐ Yes, it is.

530
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,388
Anna, can you pull that
light over here?

531
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,390
Hang on, sweetheart.
Hang on.

532
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,426
Did you see how
the bite happened?

533
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,460
My son did.

534
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,829
I'd run out
to get the phone

535
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,396
and apparently the dog
just went for her.

536
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,265
How bad does it look?

537
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,535
Uh, it's deep. She's going to
need intravenous antibiotics.

538
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,469
‐ Intravenous?
‐ Yeah.

539
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,705
‐ That's not a canine bite.
‐ What?

540
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,575
That's a bite from an
immature homo‐sapien

541
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,511
that's one who still
has primary incisors.

542
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:45,912
Todd?

543
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:49,783
‐ Did you bite your sister?
‐ It's okay.

544
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,818
Why would you do
such a thing?

545
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:54,788
‐ You know you love your sister.
‐ He gets a hug for this?

546
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,356
Okay, why don't you
guys wait here?

547
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,559
If you and I can speak
out in the hallway?

548
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,827
'How'd you get these burns on
your hands and your lip?'

549
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:02,362
I already told her.

550
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,966
She was making popcorn
when it exploded.

551
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,835
Her resting pulse is 120,
and she's tremulous.

552
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,637
You should lay
off the crack.

553
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,039
‐ I don't do that stuff.
‐ Uh‐huh.

554
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:14,508
You want me
to get a tox screen?

555
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,376
You want to stop
doing crack?

556
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,044
Go away, man.

557
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,413
I don't think the taxpayers
are interested

558
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,482
in buying Doris
a tox screen.

559
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,785
So, let's update her tetanus,
dress the burns

560
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:27,954
and have her checked in
the surgical clinic in two days.

561
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:29,690
She also complained
of an upset stomach.

562
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,992
‐ What have you eaten today?
‐ Nothing.

563
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,861
Nothing?
Not even popcorn?

564
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:37,397
You got to eat right
and stop the drugs.

565
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,900
‐ None of your business!
‐ See you next time.

566
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,668
'You didn't see any reason
to confirm her drug use?'

567
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,069
That's right.

568
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,038
‐ 'Dr. Greene's a busy man.'
‐ Yes, he is.

569
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,740
He has a lot of responsibility,
a lot of pressure.

570
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,108
Dr. Del Amica,
that's the chart.

571
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,376
‐ Okay. Thanks.
‐ How's he handle it?

572
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,012
Ah, you're going to have
to ask him that.

573
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,818
Sir, we have a
bed for you now.

574
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:00,821
No, I know, I know, we'll get
you in as soon as possible.

575
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:09,730
Nurse, did you see my doctor?
Where's the doctor?

576
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,632
It's okay, dear.
The doctor will see you soon.

577
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,534
I need a doctor!

578
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:18,739
Peter.

579
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:20,106
Hey, Peter!

580
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,908
Peter, wake up!

581
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,577
We've got a double
trauma coming in.

582
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,712
Teenager, a victim
of a gang beating

583
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:28,048
and a bystander who tried
to stop the attack.

584
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:29,883
They're both critical.
Have you seen Mark?

585
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,118
No, I'll meet him
in trauma two.

586
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,422
So, how'd
they find out?

587
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,124
I don't know.
Police report, gossip.

588
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:39,893
It doesn't matter.

589
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,062
‐ I'm not talking about it.
‐ That's good policy, man.

590
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,797
‐ Hey, how you doing?
‐ Hey, what's the score?

591
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,001
It's 8‐1, Cubs behind,
bottom of the seventh.

592
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,704
Listen, what you can't do is you
can't get mad at them on camera.

593
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:51,738
'Cause they go for
that stuff like sharks.

594
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,006
They're not sharks.

595
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,641
They just want to
make a tearjerker

596
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:57,077
with me as the poor pathetic
victimized doctor.

597
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,444
I don't know.
That's not what I mean.

598
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,080
I was watching
that director.

599
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,648
‐ She was looking at you.
‐ Agi?

600
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:02,983
Yeah, she was watching.

601
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:04,918
She's trying to get
personal and stuff.

602
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,588
You go for that, too, the
intense, kind of brainy type.

603
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,956
Doug, she's married
to the guy behind the camera.

604
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,893
‐ The old guy?
‐ Yeah, they're a pair.

605
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:14,961
May‐Decembers
never hold up.

606
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,462
Are you guys talking
about the filmmakers?

607
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,198
‐ Yep.
‐ We don't trust them.

608
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,066
Yeah, they're bloodsuckers.

609
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,706
You think you should be doing
that in front of their camera?

610
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,007
Is that on?

611
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,775
Doug, Mark, we've got
a double trauma.

612
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,848
Help my brother.

613
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,917
14‐year‐old with blunt
trauma from baseball bats.

614
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,184
Bats?

615
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:41,454
Pulse 130,
BP 100/60.

616
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,889
We tubed him
to protect his airway.

617
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,491
We got a 30‐year‐old victim
of a 15‐foot fall.

618
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:47,994
He got pushed over a railing
onto a concrete surface.

619
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:50,597
Brief loss of consciousness
at scene, cleared en route.

620
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:53,099
Now alert and oriented.
Occipital hematoma.

621
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,502
'BP 60 palp,
pulse 120.'

622
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,103
'Flaccid paralysis in
all four extremities'

623
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:58,672
'with loss
of sensation.'

624
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:01,708
Call neurology
and get x‐ray down here.

625
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:05,912
On my count,
one, two, three.

626
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,214
CBC, type and cross,
four units.

627
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:11,518
Lateral c‐spine,
chest and pelvis. Let's move!

628
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:13,119
Can you feel anything
anywhere?

629
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:16,222
No, not a bit.
Is that okay?

630
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,224
He's got good breath sounds
but diminished tidal volume.

631
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:19,626
BP's 60 palp.

632
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,027
I need a path
here, guys.

633
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:22,896
Could be spinal shock.

634
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,931
Alright, let's rule out
intra‐abdominal bleed.

635
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,199
Let's set up.

636
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:27,768
Let's get a lap.
Let's go. Move.

637
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,803
What else should we
order, Dr. Del Amico?

638
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,905
‐ 'High‐dose steroids.'
‐ And why?

639
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,007
To improve motor
function and sensation

640
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,208
after a spinal cord injury.

641
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,610
Spinal cord?

642
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,012
Would somebody
shut that guy up!

643
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,181
We're just trying to
assess your injuries, sir.

644
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:42,649
How much do you weigh?

645
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:48,154
Um, call me Theo,
alright? Uh, 165.

646
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:50,156
'It's negative. I'm going
to go check on the kid.'

647
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,659
Alright. Start dopamine
at ten mics.

648
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:54,160
We're out of the woods.

649
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:56,697
Listen, Theo, we need to check
your motor response.

650
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,032
Okay, Dr. Del Amico?

651
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:02,168
Sir, can you squeeze
my hand?

652
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:03,904
What's wrong with me, huh?

653
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:06,206
Mr. Williams, can you shrug
your shoulders, please?

654
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,210
Hey, we just want
to talk to him.

655
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:11,545
That's it, see if he's okay.

656
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:12,913
You have to sit in chairs.

657
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:17,918
These guys tailgated me
all the way here.

658
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,086
Where's Chico, huh?

659
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,122
No, no, no, no, no!

660
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,189
I'll go see
if your friend's okay.

661
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:24,625
Just wait here, okay?

662
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:26,893
Elle sigue, por favor.
Por favor?

663
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:29,896
‐ 'Is my brother gonna be okay?'
‐ Mannitol, 75 grams.

664
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,698
Blown left pupil.
Let's hyperventilate him.

665
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:33,567
Intracranial hemorrhage.

666
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,201
Call for a stat head CT.

667
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:38,672
Decorticate posturing
GCS, eight.

668
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,240
Randi's got a situation
at the desk.

669
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,608
She's got security,
but don't bring

670
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:42,909
that kid down to CT
right now.

671
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:44,310
‐ Why not?
‐ His homeys are out there.

672
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:46,613
They came here?

673
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:48,048
Those bastards.

674
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,157
You stay away
from him, okay?

675
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,191
Come on, you guys,
take it outside!

676
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,726
Stay away!

677
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,127
You know what?
Your brother's a ranker.

678
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:05,131
You almost killed him!
What more do you want!

679
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:07,701
You call the cops!

680
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,103
Shut up, bitch!
It wasn't us!

681
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:11,204
You pushed that guy
right over the rail!

682
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,673
You didn't even
know that man!

683
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:14,074
Hey, who are
you, huh?

684
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:17,711
He was just trying to help,
and you pushed him over!

685
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,993
At the moment, the gentleman's
C‐4 nerve, that's the nerve

686
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:35,261
between the fourth
and fifth cervical vertebrae

687
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:36,697
is still functioning.

688
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,398
It means he can move
the diaphragm

689
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,100
and shrug his shoulders

690
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:43,336
but if the swelling continues
and he becomes a C‐3

691
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:47,207
he will lose the ability
to breathe on his own.

692
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,676
So how's the shooting
going so far?

693
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,011
Are you getting
everything you need?

694
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,145
'Yeah, I think so.'

695
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,246
‐ 'It's been good.'
‐ Good.

696
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,015
Yeah, one of the
things I noticed

697
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:58,785
that you might be missing is
the importance of women..

698
00:26:58,819 --> 00:26:59,886
'Excuse me.'

699
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,657
Women working in the ER's.

700
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,159
That's changed dramatically
over the last few years.

701
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:09,129
All kinds of diversity
among medical workers.

702
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:10,964
It's crucial
to the understanding

703
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,033
of how emergency medicine
has evolved.

704
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,935
'Yeah, I'll mention that
to Agi and Stuart.'

705
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,971
'Um, what was that
you were pointing to?'

706
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,740
‐ Uh, here?
‐ 'Yeah.'

707
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:24,277
This is a fracture of the fourth
and fifth cervical vertebrae.

708
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,012
'What does that mean?'

709
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:29,082
It means that Mr. Williams,
who tried to be a Good Samaritan

710
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,151
and stop a young man
he didn't even know

711
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:32,686
from being beaten to death

712
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,055
is now paralyzed
from the neck down.

713
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,422
‐ 'Kerry.'
‐ David.

714
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:38,191
‐ May I interrupt?
‐ Come on in. Come in.

715
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,827
‐ No, I'd rather talk out‐‐
‐ This is, uh, Dr. Morgenstern.

716
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:44,430
Our too‐modest chief
of emergency services.

717
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:47,801
If you heard about our little
altercation it's all settled.

718
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,936
‐ The police subdued the perp‐‐
‐ Police?

719
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,004
I thought..

720
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,940
David,
you're diaphoretic.

721
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,311
‐ 'Is something wrong?'
‐ Chest pain.

722
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,445
Radiating?

723
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,481
To the jaw.
Started 20 minutes ago.

724
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,950
Oh, my God.
Lie down.

725
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,953
Lie down. Let's get you on a
monitor. Here you go. Gently.

726
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:08,989
You get out.
Out!

727
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,424
Get out! Out!
Lydia!

728
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:15,328
Lydia! Grab me some atropine,
nitro and a 12‐lead EKG.

729
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,963
Oh, my God.

730
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:20,734
Pulse ox monitor
and start a line.

731
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,035
There you go, David.

732
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:24,237
We're going to take
good care of you.

733
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,408
'How about there?'

734
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:30,410
'No, nothing.'

735
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:34,515
Anything at all?

736
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,150
No, ma'am.

737
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,519
The feeling will
come back, won't it?

738
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:41,487
That's what the doctors
are trying to find out.

739
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:43,524
Ouch!
Oh, I felt that.

740
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,325
Good.
Good. Mark it.

741
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:47,761
Sir, we're going to
watch you very closely.

742
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,230
If the swelling in your
spinal cord continues

743
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,398
we may have to put you on a
ventilator to help you breathe.

744
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:55,268
I got a hold of a baby‐sitter
at your house, Mr. Williams.

745
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,537
She said your wife
was at school.

746
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,839
Oh, that's right,
it's, um, it's Thursday.

747
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:00,941
She won't get in
until midnight.

748
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:03,009
Okay, we'll get
a message to her.

749
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:05,045
Get that baby‐sitter
on the phone, now.

750
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,046
Okay.

751
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,014
Malik.

752
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:10,016
Malik, hold on!
Damn it!

753
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,853
‐ I'll bring it back.
‐ 'I need it now!'

754
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,088
‐ Kerry, I was about to do‐‐
‐ Jeanie it's Morgenstern.

755
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,790
Oh, my God.

756
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,536
'What you got, Carter?'

757
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,004
The kid who got
beat up earlier.

758
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:32,372
He crashed before
we could get a CT.

759
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,541
Lavage was positive.
It may be his spleen.

760
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:36,109
Is it the kid with
the head trauma?

761
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,344
Yeah, you've to get in line.
I need a CT.

762
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:40,280
No time, you'll have to drill
the burr holes up in OR.

763
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:41,848
Let's move.
Carter, where are you going?

764
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:43,517
Up. I'm bagging him.
Not anymore. Go move.

765
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,151
‐ Dr. Benton.
‐ Thank you.

766
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:50,390
Somebody's disappointed
I left surgery, isn't he?

767
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:51,858
Excuse me, I'm Ms. Corday.

768
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:54,194
Could you point me
towards casualty?

769
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,862
Sorry, trauma.
I mean trauma.

770
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,031
‐ Trauma is that way.
‐ Do you need any help?

771
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,933
No, I'll call out
if I get lost.

772
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,367
You okay?

773
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:03,469
Kid was trying
to get out of a gang.

774
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:05,271
You're in the
ER, Carter.

775
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,107
Get them on the elevator alive,
you've done your job.

776
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,408
How do you think
he's gonna do?

777
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:09,976
He's got a blown
left pupil

778
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,912
probably means
a chronic vegetative state

779
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:13,514
if he doesn't
bleed to death first.

780
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:16,550
How bad does he look?

781
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,853
His STs are sky high
in two, three, and F.

782
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,589
His father had an MI at 40.
Yeah, I'll hold.

783
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:24,625
Hey, Dr. Weaver, I wonder
if we could talk now..

784
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:27,160
‐ Later.
‐ He's throwing PVC's.

785
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,129
‐ Should we give him lidocaine?
‐ Yes. Great.

786
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:31,131
Cath lab's ready for us.
Let's get him up.

787
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,102
Dr. Greene, I wonder if you're
aware of my situation..

788
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:37,370
'I got the baby‐sitter.'

789
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:38,972
Later, Carter.

790
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,273
Excuse me.

791
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:43,476
Is this
the Williams' sitter?

792
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,211
Hello, this is Dr. Greene

793
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:48,014
from the emergency room
at County General Hospital.

794
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:50,316
Do you understand me?

795
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,588
How far away are you from where
Mrs. Williams goes to school?

796
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:57,190
Good, get a neighbor
to watch the baby

797
00:30:57,223 --> 00:31:00,260
and run there as fast
as you can and get her.

798
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:03,229
Tell her it's an emergency
and that every minute counts.

799
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:04,364
Put her in a cab.

800
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:07,367
We're about
a ten‐minute ride away.

801
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,135
You got all that?

802
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:10,537
Any questions?

803
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:12,906
Good. Go.

804
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,508
'Is he losing his
ability to breathe?'

805
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,976
At the rate his
pulse ox is falling

806
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,111
I'll be forced
to intubate him soon.

807
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,914
'So, you need the wife here to
sign a consent or something?'

808
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,448
Mr. Williams is paralyzed

809
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:23,984
probably for the rest
of his life.

810
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:25,318
Right now,
he can still speak.

811
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,087
It would be nice
if he and his wife

812
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,390
could talk to each other for a
few minutes while he still can.

813
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:32,926
Theo, can you take
a deep breath for me?

814
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,562
Good.

815
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:36,930
I'll see if Dr. Greene
can join us.

816
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,298
Good idea.

817
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,966
Excuse me, nurse.
I'm Ms. Corday.

818
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,501
I was beeped down
for a consult.

819
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:45,071
You're a doctor?
Oh, don't mind them.

820
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:47,407
These gentlemen are
making a movie.

821
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,343
Yes, I'm a surgical lecturer
in orthopedics and trauma.

822
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,513
They said there was
an adolescent who decompensated.

823
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,247
Oh, Dr. Benton took him up.

824
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,616
Ah, Dr. Benton.

825
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:56,983
You call your
surgeons "Doctor."

826
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,218
Well, I suppose "Ms. Corday"

827
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:59,319
won't get me very
far around here.

828
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:00,987
Just to the waiting room.

829
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:03,524
‐ I'm Carol Hathaway.
‐ 'Pleasure meeting you.'

830
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:04,991
'So, how did the
patient look?'

831
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,560
'The boy with the
positive lavage?'

832
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,595
Not good,
blown pupil, deep coma.

833
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:12,165
‐ This the kid I saved?
‐ Yeah.

834
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:13,667
We're keeping
our fingers crossed.

835
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,638
David, are you still
experiencing

836
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:20,106
the same amount
of pain? Okay.

837
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,443
On a scale of one to ten how
would you rate that pain?

838
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:25,078
'Uh, ei‐eight.'

839
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,312
‐ Pardon? Eight.
‐ Eight.

840
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:28,715
Okay, let's get him
on very gently

841
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:30,016
and they're all
set up for us.

842
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,351
'They know we're coming.'

843
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:32,519
‐ 'Here we go.'
‐ What the hell..?

844
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:33,587
Hey, what are you doing?

845
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,388
No. No. I asked
you not to.

846
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,558
‐ 'You going to the cath lab?'
‐ Yes. Turn it off.

847
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,392
'Isn't there an another patient
who's been waiting for hours?'

848
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,394
What? What do you mean?

849
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:42,629
'Do some patients get
preferential treatment'

850
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:44,731
'in the ER?'

851
00:32:44,765 --> 00:32:46,667
Look at me.
I'm talking to you.

852
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,334
‐ Is this recording?
‐ 'Yes.'

853
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:50,036
Good, because I want to know.
Are you a doctor?

854
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,138
Do you have experience
with myocardial infarctions?

855
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:53,173
‐ 'No.'
‐ How's he doing?

856
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:54,374
Sinus rhythm 60,
pulse ox 96.

857
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,476
Look at me, then
how can you make

858
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,344
an accusation about
patient treatment?

859
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:00,714
Just because your camera sees
a picture of one man going

860
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:03,449
to the cath lab, you assume
preferential treatment!

861
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,418
Do you know what acute
ST elevations are?

862
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,588
Is there another patient in the
ER who had a run of V‐tach?

863
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:09,222
'I don't know.'

864
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:10,724
‐ How's the ectopy?
‐ 'Under five per minute.'

865
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:12,125
So, what do you want
to know?

866
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:16,462
‐ What can we tell you?
‐ 'I'm sorry.'

867
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,264
'I got carried away.'

868
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:19,299
You did.

869
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:26,106
What have you got?

870
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,273
82‐year‐old male

871
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,809
found down
at his nursing home.

872
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,244
Went in fib en route,
shocked twice without success.

873
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:32,579
‐ 'Shall I defibrillate?'
‐ 'Be my guest.'

874
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:34,447
‐ Charge to 360.
‐ 'You got it.'

875
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,216
‐ Has he had EPI?
‐ Yup. Three minutes ago.

876
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:39,452
‐ 'Go ahead.'
‐ Lube it up.

877
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,622
‐ Three‐sixty? Clear.
‐ Yeah.

878
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:43,489
'Agi, I need a battery.'

879
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,326
'Another 50 of lidocaine.
Do it again, 360.'

880
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,661
'Agi, my camera
battery's dying!'

881
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,597
'Keep shooting, Stuart.

882
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:52,398
‐ 'Got a rhythm.'
‐ Pulse?

883
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:55,135
'Faint, but it's there.'

884
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,369
Alright, everybody,
we got him back!

885
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,604
‐ Good work.
‐ 'I'm losing power.'

886
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:59,339
'How's that feel, doctor?'

887
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:00,607
To bring somebody back?

888
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:02,576
Oh, that's the, uh,
that's the, um..

889
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,618
‐ Dr. Benton?
‐ Yeah?

890
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:13,186
Elizabeth Corday.

891
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,188
Visiting surgical lecturer
and your savior.

892
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,623
Excuse me.

893
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,692
You've been on call forever.
You're free to go.

894
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:22,162
‐ I'm on now.
‐ Oh, I'm sorry.

895
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,530
Excuse me,
are you the doctor

896
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:24,698
who was taking care
of my brother?

897
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,099
Yeah.
You're still down here?

898
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:27,634
Yeah, I had to talk
to the cops.

899
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,103
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh, sorry.

900
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,605
How is he?

901
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:33,574
Well, they removed his spleen
to stop the bleeding

902
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,275
and the neurosurgeons
are still working on him.

903
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:36,843
Does he have brain damage?

904
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:39,279
Let's call upstairs and see
if there's any news, okay?

905
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:42,415
‐ Here we go.
‐ I thought I was a goner.

906
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,250
Yeah? Me, too.

907
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:45,652
You'll be getting
a lot of "Thank‐you's"

908
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:49,122
from the female population
over at Riverview.

909
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:50,490
I don't want to brag
too much, but‐‐

910
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:52,626
Yeah. You a pretty popular
guy over there?

911
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,730
Well, I seem to be.

912
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,633
I never was much of
a Casanova in my day.

913
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:04,170
I didn't go in for all the wild
positions and so forth.

914
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:06,540
But the ladies need that,
you know, all the positions.

915
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:08,341
So I've heard.

916
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:09,776
And the sweet talk.

917
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,812
I never was much
for that either.

918
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:15,415
You know, I was mostly
meat and potatoes.

919
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:19,352
But now, I'm 82,
I'm a man, I'm breathing

920
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,388
the odds are 12‐1
in my favor.

921
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,658
I'm getting it
anytime I want.

922
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:27,861
Not too bad, old age.

923
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:29,896
I'm glad to hear it.

924
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,832
Tell you, it feels good
to save the life of a man

925
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:35,669
who's performing
such a service to society.

926
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:38,271
Stud service.

927
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,606
Get that in.

928
00:35:41,908 --> 00:35:43,844
He was found down outside
the Stones concert.

929
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,311
He looked like he fell through

930
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:47,380
a sheet of plate
glass or something.

931
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,650
‐ Easy. Easy.
‐ No, no, no, no.

932
00:35:49,683 --> 00:35:51,552
Leave me alone.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

933
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:53,386
‐ Get away! Don't touch me!
‐ Call security.

934
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:54,788
Security!

935
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,257
Alright, alright, alright.
Everything's okay.

936
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,592
It's alright.
Just relax.

937
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,928
No, stay away.
Stay away!

938
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:03,730
I‐m‐I'm sick.
Okay. Just stay away from me.

939
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:05,866
‐ Okay. It's okay.
‐ No, it's not okay.

940
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,367
‐ It's alright.
‐ I'm sick.

941
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,936
I'm HIV‐positive, okay.
I've got aids.

942
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,773
Stay away from me.

943
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:16,376
‐ Please. No, no.
‐ Stop.

944
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:18,378
Shh.
It's okay.

945
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:21,381
Alright? Just lay back.

946
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:22,415
Let us help you.

947
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:23,884
‐ Don't..
‐ It's okay.

948
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:26,452
‐ It itches.
‐ I know it itches.

949
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,188
Just take it away.

950
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:30,957
I'll take it away, okay?

951
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:35,261
Lay back. It's okay.
Shh. Come on.

952
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:36,630
We'll make it better, okay.

953
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:39,633
‐ Help me.
‐ I'll do what I can.

954
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:48,542
'So when did you decide
to become a surgeon?'

955
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:51,545
Oh, well, uh, that gets
into pleasing my father

956
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:54,748
rattling my mother and all sorts
of boring family secrets.

957
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:56,950
But the short answer is
my father is a surgeon

958
00:36:56,983 --> 00:37:00,754
as was his father
and my father had no sons.

959
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:03,524
'Are you a resident
in the UK?'

960
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,491
Well, I'm afraid it's a
different system altogether.

961
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:07,694
Um, I'm an FRCS which is

962
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:10,597
a Fellow of the Royal College
of Surgeons and a lecturer.

963
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:13,934
That's roughly the equivalent of
your senior surgical residents

964
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,837
but not really,
because I have six..

965
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,806
I'm sorry. You can't possibly
be interested in this.

966
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,542
Dr. Benton?

967
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:24,277
Please rescue me from
these well‐intentioned people.

968
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,680
'We're just talking about
the surgical service.'

969
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:28,582
Listen, have you seen that young
lady I was talking to earlier?

970
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:29,983
The sister of the
boy up in surgery?

971
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,685
Yeah, I got some news
and I can't find her.

972
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:33,720
‐ I'll keep my eyes open.
‐ Alright, thank you.

973
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,693
Paralyzed?

974
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:41,361
For good?

975
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:42,863
It's too early to say
if your husband's

976
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:46,900
going to have any
recovery of function.

977
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,769
What did he think
he was doing?

978
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:51,371
He was trying to
save a boy's life.

979
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:52,739
I know.

980
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,340
Your husband is very
eager to talk to you.

981
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,309
I'm afraid it'll
have to be brief.

982
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,081
I wouldn't want to
be in those shoes.

983
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,816
Whose shoes,
Mark's or the wife's?

984
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:03,984
Neither.

985
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,824
Sometimes I hesitate with a
family before I give the news.

986
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:12,325
I know I'm going
to say something

987
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:13,760
that will change
their lives forever.

988
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,328
You just think that
if you don't say it

989
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,963
it'll be okay for
a little while longer.

990
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:20,066
I told this one mother
that her son had been killed

991
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,469
and she said, "Is it broken?"

992
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,939
I'm looking at her and I didn't
know what she was saying.

993
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:29,743
So she said,
"His arm, is it broken?

994
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:31,344
'cause he's
pitching tomorrow."

995
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,046
Then she just walked away.

996
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,081
'Did you just let
her leave like that?'

997
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:37,884
No, no, I called Carol,
I had her take care of it.

998
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:40,921
That's a true story.

999
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:44,525
At least...at least we..

1000
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:45,992
...shot those videos of us

1001
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:49,029
on the playground,
me and him, huh?

1002
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:50,864
‐ Theo..
‐ It's a good thing.

1003
00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:53,767
I mean, TJ will be
able to see

1004
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,770
what his daddy...look like,
used to be like.

1005
00:38:56,803 --> 00:38:59,573
You're gonna be that way again.
You hear me, Theo?

1006
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:02,475
We are not giving
up that easy.

1007
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:06,479
His blood gas showed PO‐2,
65 and PCO‐2 50.

1008
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,515
We're standing by
with Versed.

1009
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,016
Dr. Greene, look,
Dr. Carter needs you now!

1010
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,618
I'll be there in a minute.

1011
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:13,687
I'm afraid we have
to interrupt.

1012
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,021
Just another minute,
please?

1013
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:17,090
Can you get somebody to
drive her home, please?

1014
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:20,126
Theo, stop bossing me around.
I'm staying right here.

1015
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,828
Pulse ox is down to 89.

1016
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:22,929
He's getting dusky.

1017
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:25,666
Two of Versed.

1018
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,668
We can't wait any longer.

1019
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:31,404
Once this sedative takes effect,
I'll intubate your husband.

1020
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:32,939
Theo, when you wake up

1021
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:34,841
you're gonna have a tube
helping you to breathe.

1022
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,643
Mark, you mind
if we interrupt?

1023
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:38,879
Ms. Cruz wanted to let you know
her brother came out of surgery.

1024
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:40,647
The head CT showed no
bleeding in the brain.

1025
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:43,917
That is really good news.
Thank you.

1026
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,519
The boy's gonna be okay?

1027
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,754
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

1028
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,022
You saved my
brother's life.

1029
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,791
That's good.

1030
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,127
Can you feel that, honey?

1031
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,962
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Okay.

1032
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:09,743
'I'm in.'

1033
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:13,580
Is he breathing?

1034
00:40:13,614 --> 00:40:15,616
'We're breathing
for him now.'

1035
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:17,818
'Dr. Greene, look,
you need to come now!'

1036
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:20,020
'Excuse me.'

1037
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:31,665
‐ What happened?
‐ He went into fib. Clear!

1038
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:33,567
I've shocked him five times.
He went into asystole.

1039
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,768
I've given high dose
EPI and atropine.

1040
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:36,036
Charge it again,
Malik to 360!

1041
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,470
‐ 'Why didn't you call me?'
‐ I did.

1042
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:38,805
‐ 'Yeah, two minutes ago.'
‐ Clear!

1043
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,508
Charge it again, Malik.

1044
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:42,643
I was following
the ACLS algorithms.

1045
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:44,144
I thought I could handle it.

1046
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,712
‐ Charge it again, Malik!
‐ Go ahead and call it.

1047
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,047
Clear!

1048
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,882
‐ Call it, Dr. Carter!
‐ Charge it again.

1049
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:50,617
No rhythm.

1050
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:55,889
Time of death is 9:56.

1051
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:57,624
Call an attending when
there's a full arrest.

1052
00:40:57,658 --> 00:40:59,626
You get help.
You don't try and play the hero.

1053
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,828
‐ I've run them before.
‐ That was up in surgery.

1054
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:03,530
You work here now.

1055
00:41:12,038 --> 00:41:13,940
Did I miss anything?

1056
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,743
Not that I can see.

1057
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:22,649
I'm sorry, I didn't think
I was gonna lose him.

1058
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,853
I'll sign the code sheet.

1059
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:28,088
I'll do it.

1060
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,605
'Do you want that interview?'

1061
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:46,172
‐ 'Yes.'
‐ 'Do you?'

1062
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:47,708
'You willing to answer
our questions?'

1063
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:49,776
As long as you don't use
what you just shot.

1064
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,944
'The walk‐away?'

1065
00:41:50,977 --> 00:41:53,079
The whole thing,
him losing the patient

1066
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:54,147
me chewing him out.

1067
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,582
It wasn't bad,
you know‐‐

1068
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:57,050
‐ Do you want the interview?
‐ Yes.

1069
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,852
Okay.

1070
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:01,588
Look, I need a death
kit in here.

1071
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:18,138
Probably the best
part of my job

1072
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:20,841
is that sometimes,
working here

1073
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:23,677
you can repair
some of the violence.

1074
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,913
Some of the bad things
that happen to people.

1075
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,715
Not always.

1076
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:31,952
We couldn't do much for
that guy who was paralyzed

1077
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:35,321
probably on a vent
for the rest of his life.

1078
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:39,726
I guess we did save the kid
that he was trying to help.

1079
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,864
So, his sacrifice
wasn't for nothing.

1080
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:47,133
And, yes...
I was attacked myself

1081
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,170
right here in this hospital.

1082
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:52,372
They haven't been able
to catch the guy who did it

1083
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:56,610
or at least they haven't been
able to charge anyone.

1084
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:04,184
The worst thing about it
isn't what it did to me.

1085
00:43:04,217 --> 00:43:06,720
The worst thing is
that it meant that some

1086
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:10,824
of the world's violence
has leaked into our own ER.

1087
00:43:10,857 --> 00:43:14,227
This is meant to be a safe
place for fixing people.

1088
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,998
Now it's vulnerable.

1089
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:22,936
And as an ER doctor,
that's hard to accept.

1090
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,806
'Sounds frightening.'

1091
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,908
'Are you scared?'

1092
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,676
Sure.

1093
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,046
Of, uh, losing control.

1094
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,081
'Control of what's outside?'

1095
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:38,985
And what's in me.

1096
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:44,024
Is that enough?

1097
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:45,892
'Yes.'

1098
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:47,794
Then turn it off.
