1
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,540
Previously on ER.

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,474
‐ Good morning.
‐ Good morning.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,077
You were involved in a very
serious automobile accident

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,779
10 days ago.
Do you understand?

5
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:16,617
And I think it would be great
if she were to marry me.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,685
‐ Oh, God!
‐ What?

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,154
I don't have to defend
my wasted life in medicine.

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,256
‐ Do you have a son?
‐ Yeah.

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,392
When the SPG attendings start
backing you up next week

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,328
we'll make your job
a lot easier.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,796
You are preaching
to the choir, okay?

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,565
Less work is fine with me.

13
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,735
If you're reinstated,
you'll let the matter drop?

14
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,736
Yes.

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,644
I'll be back by six.
Have you seen my gloves?

16
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,379
I got an idea.
Why don't we set a date?

17
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:48,181
Doug, I gotta be
at the clinic at nine.

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,483
‐ You wanna quit joking with me.
‐ I'm not joking.

19
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,152
I'm halfway out the door
and you wanna talk

20
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,720
about setting a date now?

21
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,689
You're right. We got all the
time in the world to do..

22
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,091
Oh! Oh, what are these?

23
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,562
What is up with you?
What is that? Doug?

24
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,632
See, I just wanted to get
a, get a quick size. Here.

25
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,367
I'll get you a rock that'll
knock your eye out.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,271
‐ Doug, I don't need a ring.
‐ Sure you do, to make it real.

27
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,739
A ring doesn't make it real.

28
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,241
It's real because
we say it's real.

29
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,877
Now, what.. You do wanna
marry me, don't you?

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,112
Of course I wanna marry you.

31
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,647
but I've already done
the whole ring

32
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,150
and the setting the date,
blah‐blah‐blah‐blah‐blah..

33
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,721
That's not what I want.
I am so happy right now.

34
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,389
This is so perfect
right now.

35
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,557
Why can't we just
be two people

36
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,493
who are going
to get married?

37
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,461
‐ Cheap date.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

38
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,598
'Talk about prepared
for anything.'

39
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,800
I've been wanting
to use these on you.

40
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,267
Hey!

41
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,368
You haven't already?

42
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:47,674
‐ I got this, Kerry. Go inside.
‐ No. I'm fine.

43
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,343
Boy, I hope this isn't
an omen for the rest of my day.

44
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,713
Look, when Anspaugh sees
those first‐month's figures

45
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,815
he is going to want
to bear your children.

46
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,818
It's not the first‐month figures
I'm worried about.

47
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,253
Seriously, go inside.
It's freezing.

48
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,723
Synergix taking over
the ER makes good sense.

49
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,425
If you don't think you can
convince Don Anspaugh of that

50
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,793
I'm telling you I can.

51
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,262
Or we could just disappear,
go back to St. Barth's

52
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,831
let 'em all freeze to death.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,902
Go in the car.

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,638
Think hot thoughts.

55
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,806
Mmm. Okay.

56
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,523
Yeah?

57
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,801
That is the filthiest thing
I have ever heard.

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,236
With the possible exception
of this..

59
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:57,243
Mmm...Kerry Weaver, you are
a bad, bad girl.

60
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,249
Lizzie, is this your Mustang?

61
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,819
Yes. I'm leasing it.

62
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,555
There's nothing like a good,
American‐made muscle car

63
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,456
is there?

64
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,526
If I'd known this was your car,
I'd have sniffed the tailpipe.

65
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,528
Excuse me?

66
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,530
Oh, I thought we were
talking about sex.

67
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,332
Uh, is Allison Beaumont
ready to go back into the OR?

68
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,934
You thought we were
talking about sex?

69
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,536
Lizzie, the Beaumont girl,
does she know

70
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,970
what's happening
this afternoon?

71
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,239
I'll get her consent
for the revision surgery.

72
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,674
Allison's ready
for whatever we throw at her.

73
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,510
Good attitude.

74
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,312
Yes, but she's been rather down
about her vocal cord paralysis.

75
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,815
Well, remind me and I'll talk
to her about collagen injection.

76
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,483
Actually, I've told her about
medialization therapy.

77
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,852
She'd like us
to explore that option.

78
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,987
My head‐and‐neck consult
doesn't do that procedure.

79
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,989
I know, but David Kotlowitz
is right across town

80
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,691
at Northwestern.

81
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,261
Insurance won't cover it.
Collagen injection is standard.

82
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,596
Couldn't something
be worked out?

83
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,431
Selastic medialization
is permanent.

84
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,433
Lizzie, I'll explain
it to Allison.

85
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,736
You stay focused on
the fibular transfer.

86
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,859
Damn it!

87
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,796
Somebody do something
about this crazy‐ass cracker!

88
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,764
Give us all a break,
Carlene, please.

89
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,033
Hey, I'm in pain,
for your information.

90
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,768
You know what, you need to put
a sign on this damn thing.

91
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,469
It just took my money.

92
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,806
If I give your money back will
you sit down and be quiet?

93
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,340
I'm thirsty.

94
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,109
There's a water fountain's
down the hall.

95
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:14,981
Forget it. You know, I do want
my 75 cents back, though.

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,851
Hey, I put some
money in there, too.

97
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,586
Nice try, Carlene.

98
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,054
Look, I've been sitting here
for 45 minutes!

99
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,422
Ain't no nurse ask me
even come over here

100
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,757
and ask me what's wrong!

101
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,058
‐ Got any more gum?
‐ Aw, nicotine gum.

102
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,359
You quitting smoking?

103
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,493
Yeah. I never
should have started.

104
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,395
Yeah. You shouldn't have.

105
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,496
Dr. Swift.

106
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,965
Mark Greene,
how are you doing?

107
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,534
You're the SPG Attending?

108
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,768
Yeah. I'm here
to lighten your load.

109
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,102
Hey, I saw you
in that documentary.

110
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,639
‐ Ah‐huh.
‐ You got a lot of face time.

111
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,706
Don't take this wrong, Mark

112
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,974
but you looked
a little haggard.

113
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,442
Are you letting this job
get to you?

114
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,744
'Help me!'

115
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,812
Help me!

116
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,781
‐ Oh, look at that idiot.
‐ Oh, boy.

117
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,818
‐ Dr. Greene, help me!
‐ We need some help in here!

118
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm alright.
I'm not hurt.

119
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,922
‐ I'm tired of your mouth.
‐ Hey, take it easy.

120
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,691
Just take it easy, alright?

121
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,761
'So looking ahead
to your third year'

122
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,829
'you stand at the crossroads.'

123
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,398
'You have an opportunity to make
a selection in clerkships'

124
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,736
'that will be both challenging
and inspiring to you.'

125
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,838
I hope I've done justice
in presenting what I think

126
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,440
is rewarding
about emergency medicine.

127
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,176
Now, with the, uh..

128
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,612
...the time we have left,
anybody have any questions?

129
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,013
And please don't, don't
ask about the heat.

130
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,983
I have no idea why
this room is freezing.

131
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,118
Do people really
come into the ER

132
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,087
with foreign objects
stuck in their rectums?

133
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,593
I don't think that's the kind of
information people are here for.

134
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:36,563
‐ I wouldn't mind hearing.
‐ Come on.

135
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,465
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes.
Sometimes it happens.

136
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,003
What's the weirdest thing you
ever took

137
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,605
out of somebody's rectum?

138
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,175
Um..

139
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,144
Bowling trophy.

140
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,548
Now, let's, let's move on to
something more substantive.

141
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,583
‐ Yeah?
‐ Did you ever kill anybody?

142
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,919
Okay. That's substantive.

143
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,987
Ah! The answer is yes.

144
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,589
Um..

145
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,627
An elderly man.
I‐I‐I was a surgical intern.

146
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,830
And uh, while tapping
his chest I accidentally

147
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,966
lacerated his liver
and he died in surgery.

148
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,468
You left Surgery
for Emergency Medicine?

149
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,971
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ 'How come?'

150
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,140
Well, in the emergency
department..

151
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,942
...you're seeing a lot of
different people.

152
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,477
You're doing a lot
of different things.

153
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,013
You're making a difference,
you know, right on the spot.

154
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,849
But can you make a career
out of that?

155
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,217
Do you see yourself
still in ER..

156
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,519
...10, 15 years from now?

157
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,021
Fifteen years? Fifteen years.

158
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,623
Uh..

159
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,760
Yeah. Hey, sure. Why not?
Next question.

160
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,094
If we can have
this kind of impact

161
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,829
in a limited role,
I'd like to suggest

162
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,931
the idea of overall
contract management.

163
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,935
You can take off
your tap shoes, Dr. West.

164
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,105
From the time we met I assumed
your long‐range goal

165
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,240
was to take over the ER.

166
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,043
'I'm surprised
only by your timing.'

167
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,112
Can I have a moment with Kerry?

168
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,915
Certainly. Let me just say
that it's part of my nature

169
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,618
to move quickly
when something feels right.

170
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:15,128
I gotta say, Don, I've been just
blown away by these numbers.

171
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,063
What are they saying
about SPG in the trenches?

172
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,765
I haven't heard
any complaints.

173
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,134
Mark Greene would support
their taking over?

174
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,136
It would change the way
you do business down there.

175
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,906
We haven't discussed it.

176
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,874
Well, the feelings
of the rest of the staff

177
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,544
are something
I would need to find out

178
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,245
before raising it
with the board.

179
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,116
Yeah, I thought it was
a Ponzi scheme

180
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,718
when I first
heard about them.

181
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,920
But I've been with SPG now
a year and a half

182
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,222
and I'm having
the time of my life.

183
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,125
Twelve shifts a month,
18 days off.

184
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,993
‐ No kidding?
‐ Beats my schedule.

185
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,930
Let's see the other leg.
Yeah. Regular working hours.

186
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,732
And when 6 PM comes..

187
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,300
...and that door
hits me in the butt

188
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,837
I live a real life.

189
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,072
‐ Your knees are fine.
‐ Okay, what about my ankle?

190
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,874
‐ Want a portable?
‐ Yeah, call Radiology.

191
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,576
No. Hold on a second.

192
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,683
Do me a favor.
Walk for me.

193
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,885
Take a few steps.

194
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,855
SPG uses practice guidelines.

195
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,724
And here I've been skating by
on medical judgment.

196
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,726
You know how much money
is wasted on X‐rays?

197
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,061
Mark, If you're going
to quit smoking

198
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,863
you have
to detoxify your body.

199
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,297
Colon irrigations.

200
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:30,136
Hello, Allison.
Your laptop coming in useful?

201
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,239
'Looking for love
on the Internet.'

202
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,242
Now, there's a form of new
technology where I'm way behind.

203
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,245
And there are plenty of folk in
England I could be e‐mailing.

204
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,815
For me correspondence will
always mean..

205
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,985
...lovely stationery
and writing on it by hand.

206
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,023
'I'm a blabbermouth.
Two‐hour phone calls.'

207
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,027
Let me explain what we're
going to be doing to you today.

208
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,897
I have a consent form
for you to sign.

209
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,899
Yes, we're going to take you
back to the OR

210
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,967
to revise
your fibular transfer.

211
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,769
Why?

212
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,705
Ah‐ah. Type it out, Allison.

213
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,911
'Vocal‐cord surgery?'

214
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,413
Yes. Dr. Romano
would like to talk to you

215
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,381
about various options.

216
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,951
But right now our main concern
is with your leg.

217
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,988
I'll come back again
this afternoon, okay?

218
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,830
'I want my voice back,
Dr. Corday.'

219
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,400
I would have no kind of outside
life for the next six years.

220
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,169
Well, surgery demands
that type of commitment.

221
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,039
But not everybody's willing
to make that sacrifice.

222
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:42,008
‐ Got some hard thinking to do.
‐ Yeah.

223
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,877
You were on the PBS documentary.

224
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,847
Yes. I am. I was.
I'm Dr. Carter.

225
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,849
Laura Brown. You know, that
show's really got me thinking

226
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,250
about Emergency Medicine.

227
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,918
Yeah, you should come
to one of my sessions.

228
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,120
Actually, it's next on my list.

229
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,757
Dr. Benton, great presentation.

230
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,324
‐ Thanks. Take care.
‐ Thanks.

231
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,327
She's gonna be something.

232
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,929
So, we both got stuck
with it, huh?

233
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,230
Yeah, Romano Shanghaied me.

234
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,999
This thing's
a total waste of time.

235
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,934
You can't tell these kids what
it's gonna be like.

236
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,736
They won't know about it
until they're in it

237
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,138
And then by that time most of
them have made the wrong choice.

238
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,075
Yeah, I got a bunch of stiffs
in my session this morning.

239
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,943
All they want to know about
is if you killed anybody.

240
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,179
‐ What do you tell them?
‐ Just med students.

241
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,984
Mark, can I sound you out
about something?

242
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,385
Sure. We're a little
swamped down here.

243
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,921
‐ Can you see some patients?
‐ Absolutely.

244
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,991
You should know the board may
consider granting SPG

245
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,358
an overall
management contract.

246
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,828
‐ That's happening pretty fast.
‐ You think so?

247
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,196
Yeah, well, attending coverage
is one thing

248
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,732
but should we be hoppin'
into bed with them?

249
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,133
Well, it might
make life easier.

250
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,735
Shorter hours..

251
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,737
I want to maintain
decision‐making authority

252
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,971
when it comes to patient care.

253
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,940
No, you won't have
to give that up.

254
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,876
This is about Synergix taking
over administrative functions

255
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,244
like billing, collections‐‐

256
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,813
What's Anspaugh's take on it?

257
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,147
He's for it.

258
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,016
Well, it's something
to think about.

259
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,483
'Christmas cookies!'

260
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,319
Freshly baked.
Enough for everybody.

261
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,887
‐ Yeah? No, thanks.
‐ Homemade?

262
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,823
I'm not ready for the holiday
to be over.

263
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,791
Oh, I know what you mean,
it's the best part of winter

264
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:05,892
and now it's finished.

265
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,794
Not if you don't
want it to be.

266
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,830
Isn't he nice?
He is so nice.

267
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:10,997
These are so good!

268
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,199
Hello! I need
some medical attention.

269
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,334
Now, how long
am I supposed to wait?

270
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,002
I told you, Carlene,
it's a busy day.

271
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,270
Be patient, alright?

272
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,139
You don't look too busy,
Miss Chiquita Banana

273
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,807
over here
eating them cookies.

274
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,342
Listen, nobody minds
if you're in here

275
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,878
where it's warm, but
why can't you just be quiet!

276
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,446
I don't even understand
what you say.

277
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,515
Why don't you talk slow
and in English?

278
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,250
Yeah?

279
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:34,487
Can you believe me walking outta
here after that fell on me?

280
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,191
Look, I'm sorry
I gave you a hard time

281
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,492
over a lousy 75 cents.

282
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,828
I got over it.

283
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,363
My name's John.

284
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,999
Think I can give you
a call sometime?

285
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,500
I got to tell you something
up front, though

286
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,402
because I believe in that.

287
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,071
And, if it makes
a difference

288
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,973
then so be it.

289
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,910
I spent time in prison.

290
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,345
It's one mistake.

291
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,914
Had nothing to do
with violence.

292
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,116
But I got
a good job now

293
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,119
moving furniture and, um..

294
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,388
...I think maybe you and me
could have some fun together.

295
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,424
‐ Prison, huh?
‐ Yeah.

296
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,860
‐ I'm Randi.
‐ Randi.

297
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,431
Your fasting blood glucose
is 110. That's excellent.

298
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,434
‐ You watching your diet?
‐ And exercising, too.

299
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,003
I wish everybody was
that good about

300
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,138
controlling their diabetes,
Mr. Roussakoff.

301
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,406
Whoa!

302
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,374
Oh, that's just Mikey.

303
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,143
Don't be scared of him.

304
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,112
He likes it in there.

305
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,479
It's warm.

306
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,982
Okay. Bye‐bye,
Mr. Roussakoff.

307
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,190
Ma, what are you
doing here?

308
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,859
Doug Ross came to
see me this morning.

309
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,060
What?

310
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,595
To ask for your hand
in marriage.

311
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:49,996
What?

312
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,598
He said he wanted
my permission.

313
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:53,399
He was very polite.

314
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,168
Tell me
this is a joke.

315
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,537
It's not a joke, ma.

316
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,004
How long have you
been seeing him?

317
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,272
Eight months.

318
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,907
Oh, were you planning
on telling me?

319
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,142
When the time
was right.

320
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,310
Oh. So you intend
to marry him.

321
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,479
‐ At some point, yes.
‐ "At some point."

322
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,649
See? Even you know
this will never happen.

323
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,316
Look, ma, we'll talk
about this later, okay?

324
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,585
I got to get back
to the clinic.

325
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,219
I was there
to take care of you

326
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,655
the last time
he broke your heart.

327
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,322
He's not going
to break my heart.

328
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,991
Men like him
don't change.

329
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,060
Ma, what did
you say to him?

330
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,029
I told him nothing.
I came to see you.

331
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,631
You know where
Mark Greene is?

332
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:28,068
Yeah, he's right here. I've been
talking to him about SPG.

333
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,270
This concerns another matter.
Excuse me, Kerry.

334
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,907
Not a good idea to put the space
heater in the bed with you.

335
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,676
Dr. Greene,
may I have a moment?

336
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,078
Uh, yeah, sure.
Excuse me.

337
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,379
What's up?

338
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,014
Mark,
I haven't wanted it

339
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,448
too widely known
around the hospital

340
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,553
but, uh...my son Scott was
treated for B‐cell lymphoma

341
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,054
ten months ago.

342
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,423
‐ Oh, no. I'm sorry.
‐ Oh, he's fine.

343
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,292
The, uh...chemo
was successful.

344
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,195
But I just received
a phone call from his school

345
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,464
and apparently he's
complaining of abdominal pain

346
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,433
and I instructed them
to send him here by taxicab.

347
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,235
Yeah, it's better
to be safe.

348
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,506
'He didn't get along with his
previous doctor and, uh..'

349
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:09,475
I'd like you to look after his
care personally when he arrives.

350
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,978
'I'm sorry to hear
he's been sick.'

351
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,980
‐ How old is Scott?
‐ He's almost 13.

352
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,082
He's handled it
all quite well.

353
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,417
I'll stay out
of your way.

354
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,619
Oh, don't worry about that.

355
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,020
'Page me when he arrives.'

356
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,688
Mark.

357
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,690
Can you..

358
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,059
Was Anspaugh talking
to you about SPG?

359
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,394
‐ No. His son is coming in.
‐ Really?

360
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,697
Yeah. I knew his wife died but I
didn't know he had any kids.

361
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,432
Yeah, he has a daughter,
as well.

362
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,967
I can clear curtain three.

363
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,201
Do they need a trauma room?

364
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,538
I think he just
wants me to see him.

365
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,172
Right.

366
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,507
Of course.

367
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,475
‐ Let me know if I can help.
‐ Sure.

368
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,217
Hey, Jeanie,
can you hang with me?

369
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,753
Yeah. What's up?

370
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,522
Dr. Anspaugh's son is coming in
with abdominal pain.

371
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,691
I doubt Anspaugh would want me
anywhere near his son.

372
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,693
Listen, the boy
was treated last year

373
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,228
for B‐cell lymphoma so he's
probably not too happy

374
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,698
to come to the hospital.
Here he is.

375
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,432
Just another
friendly face.

376
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,672
Hey, Scott.
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

377
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,106
How are you feeling?

378
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,608
I just have
an upset stomach.

379
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,442
Yeah? Listen,
why don't you come in

380
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,478
let us check you out. This is
my friend Jeanie Boulet.

381
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,547
‐ Hey, Scott.
‐ There's nothing wrong with me.

382
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,584
Right. Well, we just want
to be absolutely sure, okay?

383
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,552
So, listen,
it's no big deal.

384
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,487
Tell my dad
it's not a big deal

385
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,089
'cause the whole school
was looking at me

386
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,791
when I got in
this damn cab.

387
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,293
Listen, Scott, we're freezing
our butts off out here

388
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,128
so, uh, why don't
you just come in

389
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,197
and just talk
to your dad, okay?

390
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,200
I can walk. I don't need
that wheelchair.

391
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,635
Alright.

392
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,570
Doug, pick up.

393
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,472
Doug, it's me. Hello?

394
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,308
Okay, listen, I don't know
where the hell you are

395
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,442
but when you get this

396
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,777
you call me right away,
alright?

397
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:53,013
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

398
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,683
We just go into this last room
on the left.

399
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:59,319
‐ You doing okay?
‐ I just have a stomachache.

400
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,554
Alright.

401
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,055
'Scott?'

402
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,090
Scott, I'm here, son.
Where's the wheelchair?

403
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,159
He wanted to walk,
which is fine.

404
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,161
Dr. Greene's one
of our best doctors.

405
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,463
He's going to take
good care of you.

406
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,099
Why can't I have
a stomachache sometimes?

407
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,635
You been vomiting?

408
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:17,137
Just once. Crappy seafood
restaurant

409
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,639
you took me to
last night, dad.

410
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,373
'That's why I'm sick.'

411
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,208
Gone to the bathroom today?

412
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,077
My bowel's not obstructed.

413
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,478
Been able to pass gas?

414
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,747
Yes, I said.

415
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,750
Alright.
Let me feel your belly.

416
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,785
‐ Ow.
‐ Oh, a little tender there?

417
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,121
Okay. Let's get a CBC
chem 20, an abdominal series.

418
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,690
No, damn it! No needles!

419
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,726
You people better not even try
to stick me with another needle.

420
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,295
‐ Hear me?
‐ Alright!

421
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,597
Alright.

422
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,199
No needles.

423
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,834
Not right now.

424
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:53,507
Excuse me. I'm trying
to locate Dr. Kotlowitz.

425
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,375
I'm Dr. Corday
from County General.

426
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,611
‐ Dr. Corday, hi.
‐ Yes.

427
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,113
I just wrote you a note.
I'm sorry you came all this way.

428
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,615
I've been called away
on a consult.

429
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,117
‐ David Kotlowitz, hi.
‐ Elizabeth Corday.

430
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,752
If I could just
have one minute

431
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:07,353
I can do quite a bit
of persuading.

432
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,789
I'll give you two. Why don't
you walk with me?

433
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:13,359
Oh, that's terrific.

434
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,562
As I said on the phone my heart
goes out to Miss Beaumont.

435
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,797
It was a devastating
accident.

436
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,632
Yes. Allison's
quite lucky to be alive

437
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,634
but she has
an extraordinary spirit

438
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:24,404
which is why I ask you simply
to see her, examine her..

439
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,840
And agree to do a medialization
thyroplasty for free.

440
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,442
Well, her insurance
won't cover it apparently

441
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,478
so, uh...yes, I suppose
that is what I'm asking.

442
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:35,281
And...why would I do that?

443
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,583
Believe me,
if you meet Allison

444
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,653
you will want to do
the procedure.

445
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,556
Well, I'm headed to your
part of town right now.

446
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,825
You know that I don't have
privileges at County General.

447
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,426
Yes, but any
bureaucratic matters

448
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,162
I'm sure that Dr. Romano
can help straighten out.

449
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,431
And you're speaking on
Robert Romano's behalf?

450
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,834
No. I'm speaking
on Allison Beaumont's behalf.

451
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,170
Well, it's not frostbite

452
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,572
but we should put it
in some warm water.

453
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,511
What is that?

454
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,312
Sounds like
a Tamagotchi.

455
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,447
A what?

456
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,852
Ah, some kid must
have dropped it.

457
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,654
Oh, man, a white one!

458
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,455
‐ I collect them.
‐ What is it?

459
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,723
It's like a pretend pet.

460
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:17,891
You have to
take care of it.

461
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,527
‐ What?
‐ It's probably hungry.

462
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:23,429
Whoever left it behind
must not care too much.

463
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,931
Can I have it?

464
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:26,900
No. I got to take it
to lost and found.

465
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,503
By the time the kid gets back,
it'll be dead.

466
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,271
What do you
mean, "dead"?

467
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,806
I'll give you 20 bucks
for it.

468
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,308
No! Wait, wait.

469
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,710
Can you tell
what's wrong with it?

470
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,812
No. I just saw
a report on TV. I don't know.

471
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,413
Thirty bucks.

472
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,315
Look, if someone
comes by looking

473
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,784
just say you
never saw it.

474
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:44,951
Forty bucks.

475
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,454
‐ Hey, Scott.
‐ What?

476
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,323
Look, I can understand

477
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,424
you not wanting
to be stuck anymore

478
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,959
but I made a bet
with your dad.

479
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:54,995
I bet him ten bucks I could
stick you with a needle

480
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,597
you'd never feel it.

481
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,931
So?

482
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,000
So, I'll cut you
in on the deal.

483
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,668
You tell me
what you want

484
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,537
to let me draw
some blood and you got it.

485
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,572
Stop talking to me
like I'm a kid.

486
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,340
I've had so much chemo

487
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,576
that my veins
have been sclerosed.

488
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,378
So, you just get
the hell out of here.

489
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,381
Hey, we got to find out

490
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,850
what's causing
your stomachaches.

491
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,585
Now, if you don't let me
draw some blood the easy way

492
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,554
they'll get every nurse in here
to hold you down

493
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:23,690
while you yell and scream and
they'll draw it the hard way.

494
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,526
Sit down,
turn your head.

495
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,493
I promise you
won't feel it.

496
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,462
How about I stick you?

497
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,504
The smell..

498
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:38,972
...it makes me sick.

499
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,648
It's in.

500
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,351
How'd you do that?

501
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,654
'Cause I'm the best.
Now you know.

502
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,994
‐ 'Hey, Cynthia.'
‐ Yeah.

503
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:03,530
‐ You know about these things?
‐ Oh, yeah. It's a virtual pet.

504
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,431
Mark got one for his daughter
for Christmas.

505
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,467
Wait. Someone left
it in exam one.

506
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,702
Did anyone call
about it or anything?

507
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,936
Mm‐mm.

508
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,572
It won't stop.

509
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:15,075
I think it pooped.

510
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,745
‐ What?
‐ Yeah. You see that pile there?

511
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,781
You're supposed to clean
it up or it'll get sick.

512
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:22,549
‐ How? How clean it up?
‐ I don't know.

513
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,917
Do you want me
to call Mark?

514
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,554
No. I can figure it out.
Wait..

515
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:29,656
You know what? I liked
the toys when we were kids.

516
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,057
My barbie van
was awesome.

517
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,793
Oh, my God, look!

518
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,460
It stopped.

519
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,796
‐ Good.
‐ He's so happy.

520
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:37,531
Yeah. Well,
if somebody calls

521
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:39,399
I'll tell him
it's in lost and found.

522
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:42,002
Actually, why don't I just take
care of it for a while?

523
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:47,774
'Anne Reilly?'

524
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:50,777
This is
Mrs. Reilly.

525
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,714
I'm her Meals on Wheels person
or one of them, at least.

526
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:56,049
‐ What's your name?
‐ Susan McFarlan.

527
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,851
Some days,
she's pretty confused

528
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,554
but, this mornin', she was
definitely more out of it

529
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,455
and she usually
has her hair combed.

530
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,124
Has she complained
of anything specific?

531
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,426
No, but I took
a peek inside.

532
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,128
I don't think
she's been eating.

533
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,996
There were plates
of food left untouched.

534
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,365
At least a couple
of day's worth.

535
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,867
Do you think she's had
a stroke or somethin'?

536
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,969
Well, we'll check
her out.

537
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,538
'Hi.'

538
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:19,940
‐ 'I'm Carol Hathaway.'
‐ Hello.

539
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,407
What's your name?

540
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,043
Anne Reilly.

541
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,612
You look
so pretty today.

542
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,514
Well, thank you.

543
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,683
How are you feeling
today, Mrs. Reilly?

544
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:30,851
Fine.

545
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:32,519
Do you know
what month it is?

546
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,855
Well, it's August.

547
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:37,691
Okay, we're gonna have
to wait a lil' while

548
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,859
before we can get
her into a room.

549
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:41,795
‐ Can you stick around?
‐ Sure.

550
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,964
Mrs. Reilly,
we're gonna talk again soon

551
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:45,131
in a few minutes, okay?

552
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,035
You look just the same.

553
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,605
Oh, just like when
you were a baby.

554
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:54,908
Okay.

555
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,913
Maybe ten more of those
would make a difference.

556
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,982
Alright, I had a hard enough
time getting the janitor

557
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:04,551
to part with this one.

558
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,953
I'm one of those people
that's always early.

559
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:09,623
What other presentations did
you hear besides Dr. Benton's?

560
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,425
None, I mean,
what, dermatology?

561
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,660
Can't exactly see myself

562
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:14,828
sitting in an office all day

563
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,930
popping pimples.

564
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:19,132
No, for me,
it's either surgery

565
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,767
or emergency medicine

566
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,135
or possibly
internal medicine

567
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,837
because that's where
the sickest people are

568
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,574
but, I doubt, it's for me.
Think you can sell me on the ER?

569
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,210
I don't know, I haven't
been selling too well so far.

570
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,678
It's never boring,
it's that I mean

571
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:32,813
there's always
something happening.

572
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,447
No, no,
sometimes it's slow

573
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,783
but, uh, you're usually
thankful for the break.

574
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,019
I can't wait.

575
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:43,624
Hey, Mark. Judy said she was
going to wait up in radiology

576
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,125
with Dr. Anspaugh's son
if that's okay.

577
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:46,993
Yeah, she should
stay with him.

578
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:48,629
‐ Did you lose something?
‐ Uh, I thought

579
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:50,130
I'd brought
an extra pack of gum.

580
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:53,567
Hmm‐hmm, you're going
through 'em pretty quickly.

581
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,237
I brought you an extra pack,
in here, somewhere..

582
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,939
...in the Bermuda Triangle.

583
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:00,807
You‐you know, it's not
like I need this stuff

584
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:03,677
you know, nicotine,
it's just, uh..

585
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,812
Hey, do you think Dr. Anspaugh's
son's going to be okay?

586
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:07,681
The nurses said
that he already had cancer once.

587
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:09,449
You have to worry
about recurrence.

588
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,886
God, I never saw him
as much as a family man.

589
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,056
'I mean, his wife
was only 42.'

590
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:18,759
‐ What're you doing?
‐ Uh, there's just a few.

591
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,026
Uh, few pills missing.

592
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,195
‐ I, uh...
‐ Yeah?

593
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:25,599
Well, I mean, uh, shouldn't
there be some more? It's been‐‐

594
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,768
Mark, my pills are in your
bathroom, in your bag.

595
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,035
I mean, this is an old pack.

596
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:31,237
‐ Oh, okay, okay.
‐ Wow!

597
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:33,106
‐ What are you thinking?
‐ Well, I‐I don't know.

598
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,609
You‐I mean, you know,
just, uh...

599
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,110
Mark, I don't want
to get pregnant.

600
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,045
No, I‐I know, you know,
we want to be careful.

601
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,214
‐ Yeah, oh, bingo.
‐ Hmm‐hmm.

602
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,916
Ah, you are great, thanks.

603
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,754
You're so grown‐up now.

604
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:49,055
She's tachy at 108.

605
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:50,891
BP's low, 90/70.

606
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:52,893
‐ And there's skin tenting.
‐ Tenting?

607
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:56,563
She's dehydrated, when I pinch
her skin, it stays pinched.

608
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,699
Yosh, let's get her
into a gown, start an IV

609
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:00,701
and send off
for a CBC, Chem 20.

610
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:03,670
‐ Want to count the urine?
‐ Yeah and get a chest film.

611
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,939
Mrs. Reilly, we're going to
change you into a gown, okay?

612
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,974
So we can do
some more tests.

613
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,743
Do you know if she has
any family members?

614
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:10,811
She's mentioned
a daughter

615
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:11,978
but I don't know
where she lives.

616
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,313
Carol, Doug Ross on two.

617
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,681
I'll get this.

618
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:16,750
Okay.

619
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,322
Doug?

620
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,890
Guess who stopped by?

621
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,058
My mom.

622
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:27,928
'Yeah.'

623
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:30,263
What are you on, drugs?

624
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,899
No, I just would have liked
to have told her myself.

625
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,637
How do you think
she's reacting?

626
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:42,876
Doug, I‐I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

627
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,712
Yosh, I'll take it
from here, could you, uh

628
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:46,980
escort Susan to chairs

629
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,281
and please find
Mark Greene for me?

630
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,817
Okay.

631
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:53,153
Um, if it's okay, can you
stay a little while longer?

632
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:55,922
Yeah, that's fine. I don't have
any classes today anyway.

633
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:57,090
Great.

634
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:01,762
Mrs. Reilly?

635
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:05,799
Did someone hurt you?

636
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:10,971
‐ Detective Weller.
‐ Dr. Greene.

637
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,873
‐ This is Carol Hathaway.
‐ Hi.

638
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,374
I'm still waiting
for detective Muncie

639
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,743
but I‐I'd like to go ahead
and talk to the victim.

640
00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:18,278
‐ What's her name?
‐ Anne Reilly.

641
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,881
‐ Uh, let's talk in here.
‐ Her mental status is altered.

642
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,349
She's not responding
to questions right now.

643
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:25,752
‐ Could that be from the trauma?
‐ Conceivably.

644
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:27,220
Or she could
have Alzheimer's.

645
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,656
She's also dehydrated,
which could be the cause.

646
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,124
We need to fluid
resuscitate her first.

647
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,293
And also still
do a rape kit.

648
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:35,195
Were her hands bound?

649
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:36,830
Well, there is some signs
of bruising

650
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:39,132
but no signs of duct tape
like the other one.

651
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,134
She also had
a lower left rib fracture

652
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,003
and multiple contusions

653
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,871
one to the back
of her head.

654
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:46,372
You're assuming this
is the same rapist, right?

655
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:48,208
I don't want two of 'em
out there like this.

656
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,843
So, you're making
some announcements

657
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:51,177
puttin' the public
on notice?

658
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,846
It's a departmental
decision.

659
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,915
You guys gotta
stop this...person.

660
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,382
That's what
we intend to do.

661
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,384
I'll start with
the Meals on Wheels girl.

662
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,386
She's very, very fond
of Mrs. Reilly

663
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,689
so she doesn't know
about the rape yet.

664
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:03,890
Alright, thanks.

665
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:06,993
I'll show you.

666
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,029
Carol, um, Yosh told me
to tell you

667
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,797
that he moved Mrs. Reilly
into curtain three

668
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,232
so he could see
clinic patients.

669
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:13,867
He can't handle
them all by himself.

670
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,135
Oh, Dr. Ross came in.

671
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:16,703
He's helping him.

672
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:18,672
I, um, I think he thinks
you're mad at him.

673
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,709
Is this
the abdominal series?

674
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,210
This is
Scott Anspaugh.

675
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:26,312
‐ Any relation?
‐ I'm his son.

676
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:29,049
Okay, we're going to take
some pictures of your belly.

677
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,217
KUB or upright first?

678
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,955
We'll start
with the KUB.

679
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,164
‐ Tumor's back.
‐ What'd you say?

680
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,132
I don't need X‐rays
to know it's back.

681
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,436
Don't move.

682
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:57,077
Hey, listen, if it's bad news
you can worry about it then.

683
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,946
Why don't you think
about somethin' else right now?

684
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,981
Like what?

685
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,416
Rainbows and dandelions?

686
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,085
What's some of the stuff
you like?

687
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,721
‐ What's your favorite thing?
‐ John Woo movies.

688
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:10,724
Oh yeah, his Hollywood movies
or the Hong Kong stuff?

689
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,392
What do you know
about John Woo?

690
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,160
How much time do you have?

691
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,733
Hey, you're still around?

692
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,367
I sat in on
a PEDS introduction

693
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:22,736
just for the heck of it.

694
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,905
Peds, a very rewarding field.

695
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:26,940
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you before you left.

696
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:28,909
‐ Uh, about a favor.
‐ Sure.

697
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:30,176
Sometime, when you're on duty

698
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,978
could I come by
the ER and hang out?

699
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:34,247
My words weren't enough
to determine your career path?

700
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,249
You're good,
you're not that good.

701
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,884
I actually have
a shift tonight.

702
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:39,052
Oh, that would be great.

703
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:40,954
And if you'd like,
I was, uh..

704
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,823
I have a feeling, we could
get some dinner first.

705
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,257
Yeah, I'd like

706
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,426
but on one condition,
I buy.

707
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,895
The ER is your treat
dinner will be mine.

708
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:50,330
Do you like Thai food?

709
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:51,497
Yes, I do.

710
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,101
Hey, how'd it go
with those second‐years?

711
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:56,770
‐ Well, I didn't sugarcoat it.
‐ I didn't expect you to.

712
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,304
We want to weed out
the losers early.

713
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:00,473
Thanks for taking
care of it, Pete.

714
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:02,275
‐ Dr. Romano.
‐ Hmm.

715
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,911
It's Peter.
You called me Pete.

716
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:06,279
Well, nobody in your whole life
has ever called you Pete?

717
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:07,981
‐ No.
‐ Pete Benton.

718
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,382
It sounds so natural.
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

719
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,884
Peter, just Peter.

720
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,819
Huh, Wow!

721
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:15,021
Petey?

722
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:16,389
Peter.

723
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,490
Ah.

724
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:21,027
Hey, Kotlowitz!

725
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,362
Ah, Dr. Romano,
Perfect timing.

726
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:23,463
Robert Romano!

727
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:24,565
What are you doing here?

728
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:25,999
You know each other?

729
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:27,433
You've got quite
a protege here.

730
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,402
She's convinced me
to waive my fee and perform

731
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,237
a silastic medialization
on this young woman.

732
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:32,939
Well, there are still a few
matters to be ironed out.

733
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,240
You want to operate
on my patient?

734
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,142
Oh, she's ideal
for the procedure, yeah, yeah

735
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:38,512
un‐un‐unless, of course
there's a problem with that.

736
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,982
Great, it'll be
a chance for us

737
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:43,349
to put our heads together.

738
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:45,185
Well, I've got
to get back across town.

739
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:46,953
‐ So you'll be in touch with me.
‐ Oh, let me walk you out.

740
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:49,055
Dr. Corday, uh, if‐if
you have a moment, uh.

741
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,091
‐ Come stay with me, yeah.
‐ 'Alright, good to see ya.'

742
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,125
‐ Take care.
‐ Bye.

743
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,293
'Bye.'

744
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,797
What's the matter?

745
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,267
Shut the door.

746
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:06,540
Was I not clear this morning?

747
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:08,308
What did I say
about that procedure?

748
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,475
Well, if the doctor's fee
is the barrier, I thought‐‐

749
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,144
That is not the only barrier.

750
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,613
Kotlowitz can't operate here,
he doesn't have privileges

751
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,414
and we are sure as hell
not going

752
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:16,149
to move that girl
to Northwestern

753
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:18,619
for vocal cord surgery with her
leg as fragile as it is.

754
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:21,054
Dr. Anspaugh's willing to grant
him temporary privileges.

755
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23,389
It so happens, he's a great fan
of Dr. Kotlowitz.

756
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:26,026
Oh, so, now, you are planning
my patient's

757
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,561
course of treatment
with the chief of staff?

758
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:28,929
We ran into him
in the hallway.

759
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,163
This is great news
for Allison.

760
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,632
Allison is my patient

761
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,567
I will decide
what is in her best interest.

762
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,068
This surgery is
in her best interest.

763
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,371
It is an unnecessary trip
to the OR!

764
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:41,474
No, it's not. Now, I don't know
what's going on between you

765
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:45,011
and Dr. Kotlowitz and quite
frankly, I couldn't give a...

766
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:47,313
Allison wants her voice back
and it's incumbent upon us

767
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,282
to find the best way
of bringing that about.

768
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,090
Are you questioning
my commitment

769
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,260
to this patient's
best interests?

770
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:02,295
‐ No.
‐ Good.

771
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,065
'Cause that is not something
you want to be doing.

772
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:09,023
Lizzie.

773
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:13,907
Okay, now, this time,
just make sure

774
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,409
that he takes
all of the antibiotics

775
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,444
all of the medicine
till it's gone.

776
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:21,915
Okay, all the medicine,
until it's gone.

777
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,384
Even if he's feeling better.

778
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:27,954
Okay, Hi,
I'm Dr. Ross.

779
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:29,089
I'm Sherry.

780
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:30,924
Alright, Sherry, now..

781
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,392
...I see you've been
to the clinic before.

782
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:34,695
You're still going
to the, uh, prenatal clinic?

783
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,697
Yes, I going
to have a baby.

784
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,231
Okay, what can
I do for you?

785
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,700
They cut my food stamps.

786
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,668
It was $65.

787
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:43,504
Now, it's 49.

788
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:47,173
‐ Forty nine is 16 less than 65.
‐ Mm‐hmm, yes, it is.

789
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:49,142
So, what, do I stop buying?

790
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:54,147
Well, let's, um,
milk is $1.79

791
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,683
eggs is $1.69,
peanut butter,

792
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,218
the cheapest one,
who wrote this for you?

793
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,654
Nurse Hathaway helped me
make my food chart.

794
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:05,291
Uh, did they say
why they cut your food stamps?

795
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:06,993
No, okay,
well, Sherry

796
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:09,495
there are a lot of agencies
that can..

797
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,731
...that can help you out.

798
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,298
I'm gonna, uh, um..

799
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,000
...I'm gonna get the..

800
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:16,436
...I'm gonna get some numbers,
I'll call you, okay?

801
00:32:16,469 --> 00:32:19,105
I'll be right back.

802
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,741
Three‐centimeter laceration

803
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,643
to the vaginal wall
at 2 o'clock.

804
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:26,647
Oh..

805
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,281
Am I going
to be alright?

806
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:31,284
Yes, Mrs. Reilly.
Don't worry.

807
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:33,353
Is the baby
going to be okay?

808
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,157
Baby will be fine.

809
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,360
Contusions to the labia majora
bilaterally.

810
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,195
Scant purulent discharge.

811
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,229
Do you want cultures?

812
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,365
Yeah, GC and chlamydia.

813
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,367
'How about HIV?'

814
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,771
Well, we need to find out
who has legal consent.

815
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:52,072
Any word on family?

816
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:53,273
Haven't heard yet.

817
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,675
Oh..

818
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:58,311
I didn't have nearly
as hard a time with you.

819
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,445
I don't think I did.

820
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,414
You're doing very well,
Mrs. Reilly.

821
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,283
Won't be much longer.

822
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,218
Let's give her
a gram of ceftriaxone

823
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:07,020
to cover for STDs.

824
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,090
Oh, wait, wait.

825
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:12,793
I'm not going
to have a baby, am I?

826
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:15,395
No, Mrs. Reilly,
but you are in a hospital

827
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:17,097
and we're going to take
very good care of you.

828
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,732
Oh, I know you will, darling.

829
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:22,368
Mrs. Reilly?

830
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,438
Do you know
why you're here?

831
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:29,810
Do you remember anyone
coming into your apartment

832
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:32,378
in the past
few days?

833
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:35,348
People don't stop by much
anymore, do they?

834
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:44,424
Okay, Mrs. Reilly, you can
just relax now, right here.

835
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,062
Let's give her
another 500cc's

836
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:50,330
and let the detectives know

837
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,332
that she'll be
a little while longer.

838
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,499
She's not going
to be any help.

839
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,235
She doesn't
remember anything.

840
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:56,703
It's probably
a blessing.

841
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:02,475
Dr. Del Amico, a woman
just came in with her daughter

842
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,578
looking for her Tamagotchi,
so I told her that you found it.

843
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:07,480
Oh, okay, good, I had
to steal time away all day

844
00:34:07,514 --> 00:34:10,416
to feed it
and play with it.

845
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,152
Hey, why does it
have wings now?

846
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:13,186
Hmm?

847
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:17,824
Oh, my God.

848
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:19,760
He's dead.

849
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:21,528
Oh, like
a little angel!

850
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,096
Wai‐wai‐wait,
how can he be dead?

851
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,566
Everytime he bleeped,
I took care of him.

852
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,334
I‐I guess
they just die sometimes.

853
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:29,536
But if he was sick,
why didn't he bleep?

854
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,071
I would have
done something.

855
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,108
You did
the best you could.

856
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,619
I'm really sorry,
but, um...

857
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,865
Hello, Jeanie.

858
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:01,835
Dr. Anspaugh. How are you?

859
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:04,304
I'm well.

860
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:06,773
I want to thank you
for your help today.

861
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:10,143
Well, I can imagine
what Scott's been through.

862
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:12,613
Can I ask
about the abdominal films?

863
00:35:12,646 --> 00:35:14,715
There's a partial obstruction.

864
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:16,783
We've admitted him.

865
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:21,487
'Could possibly be adhesions
from the...previous surgery.'

866
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,590
We're gonna wait and see.

867
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:30,564
Scott's faced a lot
of adversity already in life..

868
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:32,699
...and whatever comes

869
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,568
he can handle it.

870
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:35,736
I like him.

871
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,473
Well..

872
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:42,843
...I just wanted
to say, thank you.

873
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:57,257
We can get a cab
over on Michigan.

874
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,559
Or we can walk off
the Mi Krob

875
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,260
and coconut crab curry.

876
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:01,728
Are you crazy?
It's ten degrees.

877
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:04,731
Come on, John.
It's, like, three blocks.

878
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:06,867
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

879
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,635
Look, I don't want
you to think

880
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,270
that I'm cursed
with indecision.

881
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:12,806
It's just, I need to be
excited about what I do.

882
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,975
‐ Hey, I understand.
‐ Are you like that?

883
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:18,478
Am I like that?
Ah, well, you know..

884
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,681
'Hey, hey, hey,
wait, wait, wait, hey!'

885
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:22,583
‐ What's goin' on over there?
‐ Oh, wait, hey!

886
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:26,386
Wait, hey, hey, hey,
wait, wait, wait!

887
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:27,420
What's going on?
I'm a doctor.

888
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:28,822
Uh‐we saw
this guy over here.

889
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:30,657
I don't know
if he's dead or what.

890
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,492
'I sent my buddy
to get help.'

891
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:36,396
I'm barely
getting a pulse.

892
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,698
His heel's frozen.
What should we do?

893
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:39,399
Go, get a cab. Hurry up,
I'll stay with him.

894
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:40,534
Come on, let's go.

895
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,903
‐ Taxi, taxi!
‐ Wait up!

896
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:49,876
Lizzie.

897
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,444
Dr. Romano.

898
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:01,922
You should go ahead and schedule
the silastic medialization.

899
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:03,456
Really?

900
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,759
I'll work out the details
with Anspaugh.

901
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:07,794
‐ Can I tell Allison?
‐ Yeah, sure.

902
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:09,996
I'll do it right now,
it'll lift her spirits.

903
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:14,668
I, um..

904
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,436
I shouldn't have let personal
feelings get in the way.

905
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,404
You were right, it was good
that you stayed focused

906
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:19,573
on the patient.

907
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:22,308
Thanks.

908
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:24,545
I‐I'm no good at apologizing,
so, let's let‐let that be

909
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:27,714
the last thing said
about it, alright?

910
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,415
And you and I.

911
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,951
We're alright?

912
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:32,953
Lizzie, you and I

913
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,621
are a match made in heaven.

914
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:41,595
Hey, Chuny, I got a homeless guy
here, with hypothermia.

915
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:42,863
Can you get me
some warming blankets?

916
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,531
You want heated
humidified O2?

917
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:46,600
Yeah, and can you pop
a couple of liters

918
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,368
into the microwave, too?

919
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:49,970
Is the ER always
this exciting?

920
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:51,505
Pretty much.

921
00:37:51,538 --> 00:37:52,539
Dr. Carter.

922
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:53,840
Hey, I found this guy

923
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:56,409
unconscious over
by the medical school.

924
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,044
Okay, let's be very careful
on the transfer.

925
00:37:58,078 --> 00:37:59,379
I don't want to give
him an arrhythmia.

926
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:02,048
One, two, three.

927
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:03,550
Good.

928
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:06,486
‐ You are?
‐ I'm Laura Brown.

929
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,488
Um, I'm observing
Dr. Carter.

930
00:38:08,522 --> 00:38:09,723
'Second‐year
med student.'

931
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:10,824
Wants to see
what it's all about.

932
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:12,526
BP's 80‐palp,
pulse is 52.

933
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,629
Okay, let's get a core temp,
CBC and a 12 lead.

934
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:17,898
Alright, everybody,
let's prep for a pleural lavage.

935
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:20,066
Come on,
every second counts.

936
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,501
‐ Pleural lavage?
‐ Yeah.

937
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:23,469
I'm thinkin'
active core rewarming.

938
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,338
It's ten degrees outside.
This guy's a popsicle.

939
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:27,107
Mark, it's quittin' time.
You still on for dinner?

940
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,042
Oh, sure, I just want
to finish this up.

941
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:30,644
Get the next attending
on shift to cover.

942
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:32,112
Uh, uh,
I‐I'd really feel

943
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:33,714
more comfortable
by seeing this through.

944
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:35,716
Alright, I'm headin' over
to Greek Islands.

945
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:37,117
You finish in an hour,
you join me.

946
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,351
Got the warm saline.

947
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:39,586
Make sure it's not too hot

948
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,887
and then run in
another liter bolus.

949
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:42,523
Are you worried about
rewarming shock?

950
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:44,925
No, not if we provide
circulatory support

951
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,627
with a cardiopulmonary
bypass.

952
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,361
You're going to do
a bypass in the ER?

953
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,631
Sure, it's an excellent way
of warming the blood

954
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,966
or we could, uh, do dialysis.

955
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,035
Whoa.

956
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:02,475
I‐I just wanted to check on her.
I've got to leave.

957
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:04,077
Well, she was awake
a little while ago.

958
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,612
'She seemed a lot
more coherent'

959
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:07,413
which means the
fluids are working.

960
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:09,516
But she still doesn't know
why she's in the hospital.

961
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,451
I wanted to say
goodbye to her.

962
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:14,420
It's inconceivable
what the police were sayin'.

963
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:16,156
I don't know if..

964
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,959
...I don't know if I can
go back to that buildin'.

965
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:20,961
Am I a horrible person?

966
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:23,396
I truly consider
Mrs. Reilly, my friend.

967
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,165
I want to be a friend
to her, but..

968
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:26,600
You are a good friend.

969
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:28,034
You brought her here,
didn't you?

970
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,504
But I'm afraid to bring
meals to her anymore.

971
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,172
They're gonna catch
this man.

972
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:34,841
You just need to go home
and get some rest.

973
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:38,044
Tell her I'll...tell her
I'll call her, alright?

974
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:39,513
Sure.

975
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:46,186
Man, it's cold!

976
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,888
Did I miss Swift?

977
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:50,123
Uh, his shift ended
'bout 15 minutes ago.

978
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:52,058
Aw, shoot.

979
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:53,727
So, are you ready
to celebrate?

980
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,529
I've got reservations
at "Rosebud."

981
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,730
Hmm.

982
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:59,465
Or we could stay in,
that's fine.

983
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:00,834
Sounds better to me.

984
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:03,136
‐ Okay, you tired?
‐ No, uh‐uh.

985
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:05,872
Anspaugh say something
about the proposal?

986
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,674
His son came in today.

987
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:10,476
He's, uh, got a partial
bowel obstruction history

988
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:14,180
of B‐cell lymphoma, and..

989
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:17,083
...Anspaugh went to Mark Greene
to take care of him.

990
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:19,786
Well, he knows
how busy you are.

991
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,155
Maybe he's forgotten
I'm a doctor.

992
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:24,925
Sometimes, I almost forget.

993
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:28,061
That's the best reason yet
to let SPG take the load.

994
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:30,496
‐ Hmm?
‐ Yes.

995
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:32,633
What will it be,
your place or mine?

996
00:40:34,668 --> 00:40:37,604
q‐ Your place has room service.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

997
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:45,879
Damn it, presented like a
classic case of hypothermia.

998
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:47,180
Except for his
temperature

999
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:49,716
which was three degrees
below normal.

1000
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,217
What's wrong with him?

1001
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:53,920
Well, he's drunk.

1002
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,222
That's it?
So, no bypass?

1003
00:40:56,256 --> 00:40:58,058
No, not a
total wash, though.

1004
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:00,160
I can teach you how to
administer a banana bag.

1005
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:02,495
We give these to everybody
who comes in drunk.

1006
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:03,797
Every patient
that comes in drunk

1007
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,832
to prevent Wernicke's
encephalopathy.

1008
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:08,134
The, uh, yellow color
is a result

1009
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:12,005
of putting a multi‐vitamin
in there with the IV‐IV fluid.

1010
00:41:12,038 --> 00:41:13,840
‐ No bananas in the..
‐ 'Dr. Benton.'

1011
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:15,075
Remember me?
I'm Laura Brown.

1012
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:17,077
I sat in on your
lecture today.

1013
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,178
Uh, right.

1014
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:19,713
I was observing
Dr. Carter

1015
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:22,215
but this looks
a lot more interesting.

1016
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:24,017
'Hmm, we're putting a
chest tube in the patient'

1017
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,586
'before we send him
up to surgery.'

1018
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:26,887
'He has a hemopneumothorax'

1019
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,156
'which is a...bleeding
collapsed lung.'

1020
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,058
What kind of animal
goes after the weak like that?

1021
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:33,660
At least she's feelin' better.

1022
00:41:33,694 --> 00:41:35,729
Oh, it makes me wonder
about the whole human species.

1023
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:37,731
And I'd personally volunteer
to castrate this guy.

1024
00:41:37,764 --> 00:41:39,633
Yosh, can you make
me a copy

1025
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,635
of these wound care
instructions?

1026
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:42,836
We're about ready
to wrap this up.

1027
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,505
You bet.

1028
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:53,246
Thanks for coming in today.

1029
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:55,015
My pleasure.

1030
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:00,654
It's amazing
what you've done here.

1031
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,889
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

1032
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:05,559
Five shifts a week,
the clinic...

1033
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:09,129
It makes a difference.

1034
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:11,898
I'm sorry, I yelled
at you over the phone.

1035
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:14,935
I'm actually glad you spoke
to my mom, it's a relief.

1036
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:17,871
I don't know
what I was waiting for.

1037
00:42:17,904 --> 00:42:20,907
The other shoe to drop.

1038
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,142
Dumb, huh?

1039
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:26,880
Are you off?

1040
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:28,915
I've to wait
on a psyche consult.

1041
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:31,217
It might take a while.

1042
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:32,285
I'll wait.

1043
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:38,224
Finally got an ID
on our...ice man.

1044
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:40,026
Lives in a shelter
over on price street.

1045
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,862
They're going to send
a van to pick him up.

1046
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,063
What happened
to your student?

1047
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:44,698
I thought she was going
to stick around.

1048
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,133
She went up to go
watch Benton operate.

1049
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,869
I think she got bored.

1050
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:51,304
Well, we're not here
to entertain, Carter.

1051
00:42:51,337 --> 00:42:54,074
You know, she seemed
so interested.

1052
00:42:54,107 --> 00:42:55,942
I was supposed
to inspire those students

1053
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:57,243
but I don't think
I did a very good job.

1054
00:42:57,277 --> 00:42:58,879
Uh‐huh, inspire 'em, how?

1055
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:02,182
Through our...
our, uh, passion..

1056
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:03,850
...for what we do.

1057
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:04,951
‐ Passion?
‐ Yeah.

1058
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,920
You know what I mean.

1059
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:08,689
Carter, you come
here everyday.

1060
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:10,123
Sometimes, you're
really cookin'

1061
00:43:10,156 --> 00:43:12,125
and sometimes,
you're not.

1062
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:15,195
But you're here everyday,
doing your work.

1063
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:16,997
One day, you'll look up

1064
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,300
and...maybe, uh,
ten years will have passed.

1065
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:24,838
It'll be the sum total..

1066
00:43:24,871 --> 00:43:26,940
...of what you've done
that counts

1067
00:43:26,973 --> 00:43:28,642
not the passion.

1068
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:33,947
You want to review
some of these charts?

1069
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,048
Yeah.

1070
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:44,390
She's an awfully sweet girl,
Susan, isn't she?

1071
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:45,926
She was very
worried about you.

1072
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,696
Hmm, she reminds me
of my daughter.

1073
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,131
I feel so silly.

1074
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:53,299
Made such a nuisance
having to bring me up here

1075
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,135
for a little bump
on the head.

1076
00:43:57,203 --> 00:43:58,805
Oh, ow, ow!

1077
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:01,708
‐ This darn thing's caught.
‐ Let me help you.

1078
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:04,444
You'll feel so useless
when you get to be my age.

1079
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:07,247
I've already gotten
a bit forgetful.

1080
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,850
The other night,
I came home

1081
00:44:09,883 --> 00:44:12,318
and I left my keys hangin'
in the front door.

1082
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:13,453
Oh, I don't think
that has anything

1083
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:14,888
to do with age, Mrs. Reilly.

1084
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,122
'I do the same thing.'

1085
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,993
I left my keys
in the door.

1086
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:29,269
I left my keys...in the door..

1087
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:32,038
'...and a man walked
into my apartment.'

1088
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:33,473
Mrs. Reilly?

1089
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:36,242
And he put his hand
up over my mouth...

1090
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:41,181
then he made me get down,
on the gr‐ground..

1091
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:46,019
Oh, God!

1092
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:49,155
‐ Mrs. Reilly?
‐ Oh, my God, oh.

1093
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,157
Shh, it's okay.
You're going to be okay, now.

1094
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:54,194
I left th‐the k‐keys
in the door.

1095
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:57,430
I know, I know.
It's okay.

1096
00:44:57,463 --> 00:44:58,965
Oh, my God!

1097
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:04,871
It's okay.

1098
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:06,439
It's okay, shh.
