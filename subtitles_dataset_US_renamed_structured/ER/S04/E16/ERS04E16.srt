1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,674
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,275
John, what are
you doing here?

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,677
You asked me to help.
I'm here to help.

4
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,245
Oh, 'cause you don't
want your mom and dad

5
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,279
to find out that
you've been shooting heroin.

6
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,347
I'm‐I'm not.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,782
You need to find
a research grant

8
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,184
to cover your salary
before the end of the year

9
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,620
or look toward
private practice.

10
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,054
I'm going to
talk to her.

11
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,155
I know that I make him happy.

12
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,657
I know I do, I can tell

13
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,660
but he just keeps giving
me these mixed signals.

14
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,395
I'm like a magnet
for needy people.

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,766
‐ They find me wherever I go.
‐ Like I did?

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,234
You really
don't need to leave.

17
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,569
Yeah, I really do.

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,775
'You've been up all night?'

19
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,510
Just finishing.

20
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,245
Thanks, buddy. You saved me.

21
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,581
How many pots of coffee
did you burn through?

22
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,216
You should update your software.
This word processor's archaic.

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,519
Yeah, well, there's nothing like
waiting till the last minute.

24
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,287
‐ Nice patch.
‐ Yeah.

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,189
Well, gum
wasn't working.

26
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,324
Don't laugh.

27
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,392
I haven't
had a cigarette

28
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,161
for 56 hours.

29
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,164
So when is this thing?

30
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,866
‐ What thing?
‐ Your presentation.

31
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,268
‐ Are you going somewhere?
‐ Yeah. I'm going to work.

32
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,671
‐ What about the luggage?
‐ Oh, that's, uh, Cynthia's.

33
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,506
Airline screwed up.
San Diego.

34
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,808
‐ Does she know you have it?
‐ Well, she must.

35
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,844
Oh, and why are
you hangin' onto it?

36
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,681
Well, you know, she
quit before I got back.

37
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,115
Mark, look, if you
don't wanna see her

38
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,617
you take it to work,
you leave it there.

39
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,151
She picks it up
when you're not around.

40
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,287
'You don't force
her to come here'

41
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,823
unless of course
you do wanna see her.

42
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,892
You're right.

43
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,394
I just didn't know she
was gonna take it so hard.

44
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,279
Cynthia?

45
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,349
Cynthia, it's Mark.

46
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,419
Hello.

47
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,522
You..

48
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:45,892
‐ Moving on, Leason.
‐ Uh, yeah, that's me.

49
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,327
Forty six‐year‐old female

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,962
acute onset
urticaria and wheezing.

51
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,764
Possible allergic
reaction to the Naprosyn

52
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,498
she takes for
rheumatoid arthritis.

53
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,835
‐ Did you check her platelets?
‐ Yeah, no evidence..

54
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,837
Jerry, a guy from Kinko's

55
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,639
is gonna drop some
stuff off for me.

56
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,373
‐ You want a July issue of‐‐
‐ No, thanks.

57
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,975
‐ Does that sound right, Ross?
‐ Sounds good to me.

58
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,711
Did you get my memo regarding
reinstating formal rounds?

59
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,979
Yeah, you can't
have too many rounds.

60
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,413
Would you like to join us?

61
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,481
It's sort of
an attending thing.

62
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,750
Watch her with that Naprosyn.

63
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:10,984
‐ It's got a long half‐life.
‐ Okay.

64
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,452
Can anyone take
a transfer call?

65
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,920
‐ Sure. I got it.
‐ Okay. Meyer.

66
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,922
A 68‐year‐old male,
got kicked off a plane

67
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,624
because he smelled
too bad, he had a cough

68
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,392
and nowhere to go,
so they shipped him here.

69
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,894
‐ Sorry, Carter.
‐ Uh‐huh.

70
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,996
‐ Keep going.
‐ Matthews, little old lady..

71
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,334
‐ You nervous?
‐ Huh?

72
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,837
'Well, don't you present
your PCA research today?'

73
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,606
‐ Yes, I do.
‐ I read the study.

74
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,074
You make some
persuasive arguments.

75
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,308
Thanks, Kerry.

76
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,342
I did have a few questions

77
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,410
about your methodology.

78
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,812
You could run into trouble.

79
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:39,846
Too late, isn't it?

80
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,582
'You could always postpone.'

81
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,949
I thought you said
I was persuasive.

82
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,519
You were. You
convinced me PCA works.

83
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,420
‐ 'But you need to prove it.'
‐ I did.

84
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,923
‐ Sorry I'm late.
‐ 'Your control group has a‐‐'

85
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,792
What took you so long?
I got here before you did.

86
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,994
‐ Construction on South Shore.
‐ What construction?

87
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,629
‐ Did I miss rounds?
‐ Yeah, in progress.

88
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,497
Could‐could you take over?
I got a meeting.

89
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,366
‐ Sure. Anything interesting?
‐ Oh, Doug, good, you're here.

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,002
We got a seizing
five‐year‐old coming in.

91
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,103
'Code three,
suspected poisoning.'

92
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,538
‐ ETA?
‐ 'Right now.'

93
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,439
We can talk more
about this later.

94
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,841
Sorry, you made
your point, Kerry.

95
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,677
I was worried when you
were gone all night.

96
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:11,978
It took me longer
than I thought it would.

97
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,446
‐ Did you finish?
‐ Yeah, here we go.

98
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,781
Adrian Reynolds,
six years old

99
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,917
was found seizing by
mom near basement sink.

100
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,385
We witnessed two grand mal
seizures, three minutes long.

101
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,555
‐ Total of five‐‐
‐ Trauma two!

102
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,657
‐ 'Hey, Doug, you need a hand?'
‐ 'Yeah.'

103
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,091
Yeah, alright, send him over.

104
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,460
‐ No. Dr. Del Amico.
‐ I can get this.

105
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,962
No, no, that's okay. I'm fine.

106
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,632
Uh, uh, yeah, well,
we're here to serve.

107
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,066
‐ Okay, where are we?
‐ Done.

108
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,701
Guy needs a fleet's
enema in three

109
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,102
and I'm out of here.
I'll see you in 12 hours.

110
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,638
I'll be sure to have
something for you.

111
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,740
‐ Yeah, I bet.
‐ That was easy.

112
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,976
Mr. Kyle's back. End‐stage
lung cancer, exam two.

113
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,878
Carol told me
to give him to you.

114
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,014
Oh, no. Haven't you heard?
Dr. Greene kicked the habit.

115
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,983
Be right there, Lily.

116
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,952
You're still
smoke‐free, aren't you?

117
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,520
You got a lot of
charts there, Carter.

118
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,488
Guess I'd better
get started.

119
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,690
Jerry, what is all this?

120
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,725
Uh, just a little
spring cleaning.

121
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,460
Yeah, well,
it's still winter.

122
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,629
Did Cynthia leave
a forwarding address?

123
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,531
Uh, not that
I know of. Why?

124
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,100
Uh, I just got, you
know, some of her stuff..

125
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,670
Hmm. That's always
kind of awkward, isn't it?

126
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,437
What's the extension
for personnel?

127
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,039
Um, oh, they wouldn't know.

128
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,008
She came in and picked
up her check personally.

129
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,778
‐ When?
‐ A couple of days ago.

130
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,947
Ah, look at that, Twinkies.

131
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,182
‐ You're not gonna eat that?
‐ Why not?

132
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,117
They have a shelf
life of seven years.

133
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,887
1993, I'm in the zone.

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,589
Jerry, call
poison control.

135
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,591
Patch it through to
trauma two now. Okay?

136
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:31,958
Sure.

137
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,628
‐ Pupils are dilated.
‐ He's bradycardic.

138
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,830
‐ Pulse ox, 90.
‐ He's hot.

139
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,599
‐ Temp's 103.
‐ Any vomiting?

140
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,866
‐ Yeah.
‐ BP's 70 palp.

141
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,768
‐ Doesn't make sense.
‐ Glucose 110.

142
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,069
He doesn't have any
history of epilepsy?

143
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,605
‐ I didn't ask.
‐ He's seizing.

144
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,139
Hang on..

145
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,008
Alright, let's give
him one mig of ativan.

146
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,576
You've no idea
what he took?

147
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,044
Whatever it was, it
was in this soda can.

148
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,180
Let's see that.
It ain't soda.

149
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:58,552
CBC, lytes, tox screen, give
me a blood gas, blood alcohol.

150
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,053
Let's get that
can to the lab.

151
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,522
‐ Where's his parents?
‐ They were right behind us.

152
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,789
I told them to bring anything

153
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,157
that could be toxic
they have in the house.

154
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,092
‐ Pulse 45.
‐ 0.5 of atropine.

155
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,694
‐ Bring back..
‐ Lavage?

156
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,731
Not if it's alkali,
acid or petroleum.

157
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,800
What did he take?

158
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,969
Trust me, I took anthropology
as an undergraduate.

159
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,538
Cro‐Magnon man is considered

160
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,773
a modern homosapien
just like you.

161
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,174
Thank you very much.

162
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,044
Well, I didn't say
he was as good‐looking.

163
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,780
Fine, let's bet on it.
Loser buys lunch.

164
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,148
Look, if you wanna
take me to lunch, just‐‐

165
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,050
‐ If it isn't Lucy and Ricky.
‐ Pardon?

166
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,618
Did you read today's
"Sun Times," Peter?

167
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,620
There's a feature on
our little Lizzie here.

00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,527
in the twisted rubble"
blah, blah, blah.

172
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,895
"The doctor's
and the patient's fate

173
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,496
were now one."
Well, not exactly.

174
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,965
You're not walking around
with a prosthetic, are ya?

175
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,800
‐ I read the article, thank you.
‐ Yeah, I bet you did.

176
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,234
You probably bought
out the newsstand.

177
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,803
Not a very good
picture of you though.

178
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,971
Well, we can't
all have your

179
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,039
devastating good
looks now, can we?

180
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,209
"Despite Dr. Corday's heroic
efforts, County General surgeons

181
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,144
were unable to save
Leipzinger's arm."

182
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,614
Well, at least they
didn't mention me by name.

183
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,516
It's an oversight,
I'm sure.

184
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,586
Be sure you tell Larry King
you only fly first‐class.

185
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,054
Oh, almost forgot.

186
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,690
Your six‐month review.

187
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,892
I wish it could be as
glowing as the article.

188
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,898
‐ How is he? Is it poison?
‐ Is this from the house?

189
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,165
‐ Yeah.
‐ We got a soda can.

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,233
‐ What do you keep in it?
‐ Nothing.

191
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,768
‐ Soda.
‐ 'Oh, boy.'

192
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,705
BP's 70/40.
Resps, 32 and shallow.

193
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,607
‐ What is all this?
‐ Photography supplies.

194
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,908
Uh, uh, thinners,
paint solvents.

195
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,676
I‐I don't know how he‐‐

196
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,712
We need to know what he
swallowed so we can treat him.

197
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,279
‐ Can't you tell?
‐ He has conflicting symptoms.

198
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,181
It could be more than
one of these poisons.

199
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,316
Treat him
for everything.

200
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,751
The wrong treatment
could kill him.

201
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,085
Anna, did you approve a transfer

202
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,121
from Bellarmin Memorial?
A motorcycle accident?

203
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,123
Uh, yeah, head injury.
John Doe, no. ID.

204
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,626
Can the poison
kill him?

205
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,794
‐ 'Can the poison kill him?'
‐ 'Yes, it can.'

206
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,995
BP's 85/50.

207
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,631
Pulse 50, resps 12.

208
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,066
‐ What's wrong?
‐ He's unresponsive, GCS seven.

209
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,701
Did he decompensate
en route?

210
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,703
No. We picked him up this way.

211
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,138
They told me it was
concussion syndrome‐‐

212
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,206
Brief LOC, stable vitals.

213
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,142
‐ No CT?
‐ They said it was down.

214
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,811
He's uninsured,
just needed observation?

215
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,780
‐ What? They lied to me?
‐ Let's get our own CT.

216
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,315
‐ Pulse ox is falling.
‐ I can't believe they did this.

217
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,284
Should we control
an airway first?

218
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,353
I knew it was a dump,
but this is gross negligence.

219
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,722
‐ Anna?
‐ Yeah. Sorry.

220
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:19,025
Uh, 2 of versed,
150 sux and 10 of Pavulon.

221
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,361
‐ 7.5 ET tube.
‐ Got it.

222
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,363
I am sure once we
get you cleaned up

223
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,665
they'll let
you back on.

224
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,699
It's not right.

225
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,867
I sold all my stuff

226
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,234
to buy that ticket.

227
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,369
Yeah?

228
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,237
‐ Where were you going?
‐ Am going.

229
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,606
I am going.

230
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,676
San Francisco.

231
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,744
That sounds urgent.

232
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:38,945
You know, I'm gonna
get a chest x‐ray.

233
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,914
Check out that cough.

234
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,749
My daughter's there.

235
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,686
I was hoping I could
live with her for a while.

236
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,821
Yeah, maybe she can
wire you some money.

237
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,190
Well, I don't have
her phone number.

238
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,291
Do you know
where she lives?

239
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,959
In San Francisco.

240
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,095
No. I mean, do you
have an address?

241
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,663
Why do you care?

242
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,164
I don't want you
stranded in San Francisco.

243
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,700
What are you gonna do
when you get there?

244
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,001
That's my problem.

245
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,135
I'll meet you in CT.

246
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,670
Call me when
neurosurgery gets there.

247
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,171
I just wanna check on this.

248
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,907
Adrian, come on,
Adrian, can you hear me?

249
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,341
‐ Come on, buddy.
‐ What happened?

250
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,076
‐ He's waking up.
‐ Come on, Adrian. Come on.

251
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,912
‐ Did you find the poison?
‐ No, not yet.

252
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,681
Listen to me, I'm Dr. Ross.
You're in a hospital. Alright?

253
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,683
'Now we'll make you better. You
gotta tell us what you took.'

254
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,185
Adrian, it's dad. You need
to tell 'em what you drank.

255
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,354
‐ I don't know.
‐ 'Listen, buddy.'

256
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,324
Adrian? Hey. No, no, no.
Hey, stay with us. Come on.

257
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,192
What's in the can?
What was in the can?

258
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,730
‐ Eric gave it to me.
‐ Eric? Who's Eric?

259
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,331
Eric!

260
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,933
Here we go again.
Another seizure.

261
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,167
‐ How many is that?
‐ 'It's his fourth.'

262
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,201
We're gonna have to stop these

263
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,336
or they'll fry his brain.

264
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,004
‐ Phenobarb..
‐ 'Pulse ox 88.'

265
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,773
‐ Doug?
‐ Tube him.

266
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,742
‐ Keith, no!
‐ What did you give him?

267
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,876
‐ Hey!
‐ Keith, no.

268
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,244
Chuny, get security.

269
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,179
‐ Tell me what you said to him!
‐ Keith, stop it!

270
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,148
Tell me what you gave him

271
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,182
or I'll make you
sorry you were born!

272
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
‐ Put him down.
‐ I promise!

273
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:51,785
‐ He poisoned my son!
‐ I understand that.

274
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,853
This doesn't help. Alright?

275
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,721
He's right, Keith. Come on.

276
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,824
‐ Get back here, Eric!
‐ I got him. I got him.

277
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,926
Eric?

278
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,027
Eric, hey.

279
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,463
Eric, hey. Hey.

280
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,300
Hey, buddy. Hey. Eric? Hey.

281
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,169
'Go away.'

282
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,972
‐ Listen, I'm Dr. Ross.
‐ 'So?'

283
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,841
So‐so you and I have to talk
and we don't have a lot of time.

284
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,777
‐ I'm not afraid of you.
‐ It's just you and me here.

285
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,245
Okay? Your dad isn't here.

286
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,847
'He's not my dad.'

287
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:21,948
Okay.

288
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,418
Your..

289
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,087
Your brother is very sick.

290
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,454
‐ 'Half brother.'
‐ Your half brother.

291
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,489
And he could die if you don't

292
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,924
tell us what you gave him.

293
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,126
'Now, is that what
you want, Eric?'

294
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,394
'Hey, come on.'

295
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,096
‐ I don't care.
‐ 'I think you do.'

296
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,130
'I think you care.'

297
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,099
Eric, come on, buddy.

298
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,867
Come on out.

299
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,236
Buddy, come on out. I gotta
talk to you. Come on out.

300
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,773
There you go. Hey, there,
come here. Come here.

301
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,108
Listen to me.

302
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,812
What is it?

303
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,916
Your step‐father
did that to you?

304
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,283
‐ He's gonna kill me.
‐ No, he's not.

305
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,451
No. He's not.

306
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,886
This black bottle.

307
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,921
‐ Is this print developer?
‐ Yeah.

308
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:01,955
The kid mixed print developer

309
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,089
with insecticide.

310
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,290
‐ Cyanide.
‐ I'll get a kit.

311
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,526
‐ Where's Eric?
‐ He's gonna be alright.

312
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,760
We're gonna start
with inhalation.

313
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,294
Amyl nitrate pearl

314
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,831
then sodium nitrate, 5cc's
of three‐percent solution.

315
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,432
‐ Is he gonna be alright?
‐ 'Wait 15 minutes.'

316
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,901
30cc's 25% sodium thiosulfate.

317
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,037
What is wrong with him?
Why won't you tell us?

318
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,972
Don't worry, ma'am. We're gonna
take care of both of your kids.

319
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,213
No way, I already washed
him when he came in.

320
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,850
‐ What, with soap?
‐ Look, I don't lather.

321
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,451
I gave him the bar.
The rest was his business.

322
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,554
Could you also try
adjoining cities?

323
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:37,090
It's supposed to be on
Bellflower Avenue. Yeah.

324
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,424
Listen, if I don't
get him cleaned up

325
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,160
he's not getting
on the plane.

326
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,461
You know where
the showers are.

327
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,796
Dr. Greene?

328
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,931
‐ Carol.
‐ Malik.

329
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,100
See if you can get him
some clean clothes too.

330
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,335
‐ Don't push it.
‐ 'Hey, Dr. Greene.'

331
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,137
‐ Hmm.
‐ It's not due to trauma.

332
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,573
He's got a subarachnoid bleed.

333
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,307
They should have
never transferred him.

334
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,577
‐ What did neurosurgery say?
‐ I'm still waiting.

335
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,912
Well, grab them and get 'em
down here if you have to.

336
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,113
Find out what
happened up there.

337
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,414
I'm already on it.

338
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,852
How are you feelin',
Mr. Kyle? Better?

339
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,420
Steroids always
seem to help.

340
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,390
Can you lean forward?
Take a breath.

341
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,895
Again.

342
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:18,064
I think I need
a little more theophylline.

343
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,934
I'll check the level.

344
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,169
I think we're gonna need
to get a repeat chest film.

345
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:26,006
What for? To see
the same ugly spots?

346
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,173
'I think the effusion'

347
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,076
secondary to your
cancer is, is back.

348
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,211
And if that's the case

349
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,613
we'll need to tap you.

350
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,415
You mean stick a needle
in my chest again?

351
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,050
'It‐it'll make you feel better.'

352
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,985
No. No, thanks.

353
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,321
I think we're gonna have
to admit you this time.

354
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,223
If you were dying,
would you wanna

355
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,891
spend the rest
of your life here?

356
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:48,128
You could go into
respiratory failure.

357
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,896
Take me home, Rose.

358
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,397
'I don't know, honey.'

359
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,166
Maybe we should
listen to him.

360
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,336
Rose, take me
home. Please.

361
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,905
Your blood oxygen
level is very low.

362
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,375
I'd like to put you
on a monitor for a while.

363
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,044
Trust me, doc.

364
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,547
This is as good as I get.

365
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,251
There you are.

366
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,887
All ready for this
carotid endarterectomy?

367
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,557
Apparently, you
don't think so.

368
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,425
Ah, you've had a chance
to review your evaluation.

369
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,129
I actually thought
I was quite generous.

370
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,364
I'd hate to catch you on

371
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,232
one of your more
parsimonious days.

372
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,201
Let me make something clear.

373
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,603
'I'm your biggest fan.'

374
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,337
If I didn't think you
showed great potential

375
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,973
I never would have sponsored
you in the first place.

376
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,608
'Then what's the problem?'

377
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,209
Frankly, you're distracted.

378
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,377
‐ Distracted?
‐ 'Yes.'

379
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,112
You came here
to study trauma surgery

380
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,380
and lately, you
seem more interested

381
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,483
in, uh, vocal cords
and paramedics.

382
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,620
I see, so I suppose I
should refocus my energies.

383
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,488
Exactly, and speaking
of which, I'm starting

384
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,356
a new study on
the use of HemoAid

385
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,125
in vascular procedures.
Have you heard of it?

386
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,293
It's the artificial blood.

387
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,460
Thought you might like in on it.

388
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,698
We could do a paper together.

389
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:01,535
The ER at Bellarmin as much
as admitted he was a dump.

390
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,204
Couldn't get the prima donna
neurosurgeon to come in.

391
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,371
What's his name?

392
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,574
Zaccarria. You know him?

393
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,543
He has
privileges here.

394
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,078
It's a blown
aneurysm, alright.

395
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,714
Yeah.

396
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,082
Jerk probably heard
"uninsured John Doe"

397
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,151
and went right back to his
country club without a second‐‐

398
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,419
He doesn't want
to open himself up

399
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,954
to malpractice
without at least

400
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,422
the possibility
of getting paid.

401
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,025
So? It's against the law
never mind the Hippocratic oath.

402
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,693
Won't help much now.

403
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:29,129
He's got bifrontal
intraparenchymal edema.

404
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,564
I'll put in
an ICP monitor

405
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,732
and manage
him expectantly.

406
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,033
And that's it?

407
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,267
Well, continue
the mannitol

408
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,536
keep his head elevated

409
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,071
maintain hyperventilation
and wait.

410
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,706
For him to die.

411
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,041
Basically.

412
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:45,378
Hey, would his chances have
been better before the transfer?

413
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,647
It's hard to say.

414
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,214
You don't know when
the aneurysm blew, so..

415
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,250
So there's no
surgical option? Nothing?

416
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,752
The only thing
you could try is

417
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,354
a partial frontal lobectomy,
but the chances that

418
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,289
that would affect outcome
are extremely remote.

419
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,659
‐ So do it.
‐ I can't make that call.

420
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,160
Who can?

421
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,228
Dr. Mack,
and she's in surgery.

422
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,429
Excuse me.

423
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:11,071
‐ Hey. Time to reset the clock.
‐ What?

424
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,239
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ At least take off the patch.

425
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,675
I did.

426
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,342
What are you doing?

427
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,211
The copy place swears

428
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,647
that they sent
the order over here.

429
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,148
‐ Your presentation?
‐ Yeah.

430
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,517
And Jerry said
he never saw it.

431
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,286
Wait, Jerry was throwing
a bunch of stuff out.

432
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,588
I knew it.

433
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,756
‐ You kept the original?
‐ No.

434
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,058
Can you help me out or are
you a little out of breath?

435
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,296
How's that poisoned
kid been doing?

436
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,464
He's gonna make it.
Medically, he's fine.

437
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,500
You know, sometimes
working with kids is great

438
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,202
and sometimes
it really sucks.

439
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,404
Yeah. Hold it,
under that crate.

440
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,273
Under that crate,
what's that?

441
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,675
Look at that.
What is that?

442
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,577
They don't throw biohazard
out here, do they?

443
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,646
No, it's probably
just somebody's pudding.

444
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,081
Ugh! And why were you
so late this morning?

445
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,150
I stopped by
to check on Cynthia

446
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,619
see if she's alright.

447
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,353
Yeah? Is she?

448
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,355
I don't know.
She wasn't there. She moved.

449
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,791
Victoria's Secret
catalogue, huh?

450
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,828
Look at the label. Lily.

451
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,197
‐ Lily.
‐ I‐I‐I feel bad.

452
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,835
You know, I don't think it
was fair. I was pretty selfish.

453
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,070
Hey, listen, I know
all about being selfish.

454
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,505
But what was really
wrong with her?

455
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,407
She was, you know,
funny, supportive‐‐

456
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,645
‐ Good‐looking.
‐ Yeah. Great in bed. I..

457
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:27,080
I...you know, she
was actually nice to me

458
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,181
which was a bit
of a departure

459
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,415
from most of
the women in my life.

460
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,151
‐ Give her a call. Call her up.
‐ I tried.

461
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,553
‐ She's unlisted.
‐ There it is.

462
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:33,687
I'm gonna kill him.

463
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,355
Hold on to that.

464
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,160
Jerry!

465
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,340
'Think he'll make
chief of staff?'

466
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,375
No, it's just something

467
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,877
to get him closer to Carrie.

468
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,513
Yeah. Then she'll
console him.

469
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,647
And then
they'll get it on.

470
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:01,682
I don't know about that.

471
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:03,283
She's in love with Austin.

472
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,151
‐ Huh. This month..
‐ Can't reach.

473
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,253
Here, it's back on.

474
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,655
'See, now, this is what I hate.'

475
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,456
'Here's Marlena
again in the hospital.'

476
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,526
'She's all made up, high heels.'

477
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,861
Nobody's that
gorgeous all the time.

478
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,630
You're prettier
than she is.

479
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,334
That's probably the nicest thing
anybody's said to me all year.

480
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,203
Don't get a big head.
I'm just saying.

481
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,739
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, you're all done.

482
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,508
Last round of
chemo. Congrats.

483
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,275
Maybe next week,
we can go to a movie

484
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,377
instead of coming here
and filling me with nuke juice.

485
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,614
‐ That sounds like fun.
‐ What do you wanna see?

486
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,184
‐ What movie?
‐ Well, um..

487
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,153
I don't know what my
schedule is next week.

488
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,622
I'm working
back in the ER.

489
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,323
‐ 'I'm done‐‐'
‐ Working for my dad.

490
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,926
You're done with your treatment.
You won't need me anymore.

491
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,427
Don't need you now.

492
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:49,896
You do your thing.

493
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,698
I'll go get your meds.

494
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,637
Dr. Ross,
Mary Jo Reynolds.

495
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,205
‐ Thank you for saving my son.
‐ You're welcome.

496
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,807
But you need to talk
to the people upstairs.

497
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:01,842
They won't let Keith
in to see Adrian‐‐

498
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:02,943
We are concerned

499
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,745
for the children's safety.

500
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,179
So are we. That's why
Keith wants to see him‐‐

501
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,347
So now both your
boys are gonna be

502
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,182
placed in protective custody

503
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,817
until Department of
Children and Family Services

504
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,553
can investigate. Okay?

505
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,288
It was an accident. Eric
didn't mean to hurt Adrian.

506
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,759
This is Eric's way
of‐of hitting back.

507
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,827
Hitting back?

508
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:22,395
Nobody hits Eric.

509
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,330
Well, that's for
the DCFS to determine.

510
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,600
No‐no one needs to
determine it, it's the truth.

511
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,234
‐ Okay. Excuse me‐‐
‐ No, you don't understand.

512
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,670
Eric is out of control.

513
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,905
He has terrible tantrums,
and he throws things

514
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,373
and he kicks things.

515
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,475
He lies, he kicks
his teachers.

516
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,477
Keith has to be strict to
keep him in line. That's all‐‐

517
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,946
Strict? Okay, now, burning
cigarettes into his arm.

518
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,215
That's strict?

519
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,450
‐ Eric did that to himself.
‐ Okay.

520
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,452
You can't keep
our boys from us.

521
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,621
Keith's not
gonna like this!

522
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:48,655
He's not gonna
like it at all!

523
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,856
Yeah, he'll get over it.

524
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,224
I'd avoid the men's bathroom

525
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,626
for a while if I were you.

526
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,227
Who's got the kidney
stone in one?

527
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,429
I do. You listen, my guy
doesn't have a lot of money.

528
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,398
And I'm also worried
about his mental health.

529
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,701
‐ 'Alright, syncope in three?'
‐ Yeah, yeah.

530
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,402
Can't, well, can't you
stick your head in the OR

531
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,970
and find out how
much longer she'll be?

532
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,772
No, the resident
already checked him.

533
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,808
Six OD's coming in,
five minutes out.

534
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,610
Paramedics said the site
looked like Jonestown.

535
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:10,944
‐ Some kind of party.
‐ Alright.

536
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,646
Call Kerry. Tell him
we'll meet them outside.

537
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,980
It's unlisted.
I know it's unlisted.

538
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,649
But listen, she's
his only daughter.

539
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,818
I just wanna make sure
he's got some place to go.

540
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,786
Your guy
passed his stone.

541
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,456
Thank you.
I got it. Thanks.

542
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,792
Don't go far. We got
multi OD's comin' in.

543
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,396
Yeah, this is Dr. Mark Greene

544
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,365
from the emergency room
at County General.

545
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,335
I have an older gentleman
here who has no place to go.

546
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,270
He says his daughter
is in the area

547
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,905
but he doesn't
have a number on her.

548
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:41,608
At least he says
it's unlisted.

549
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,944
I was wondering
if you could help me.

550
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,680
Hooper. Cynthia Hooper.

551
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:50,651
Okay, I've got your..

552
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,856
Scotty.

553
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,602
Excuse me. Do you know
where Scott Anspaugh went?

554
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,303
He went home about
ten minutes ago.

555
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,740
‐ I thought you were with him.
‐ Thanks.

556
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,509
Respiratory arrest.
We intubated.

557
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,411
‐ Pulse 126. BP's 30/60.
‐ What happened?

558
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,946
‐ Bad heroin.
‐ Six OD's.

559
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,716
‐ Three in respiratory arrest.
‐ Roommate found 'em.

560
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,618
Said they couldn't wait
to try this new mix

561
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,386
after they heard it killed
some guys in Detroit.

562
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,054
‐ Talk about a death wish.
‐ Not today.

563
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,389
Another two of narcan.

564
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:30,524
Prep a dopamine drip.

565
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,694
On my count. One, two, three.

566
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,461
'John? John!'

567
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,930
‐ Yeah?
‐ 'Come here!'

568
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,332
‐ Go ahead, I got it.
‐ What is it?

569
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,602
It's Chase.

570
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,069
‐ 'You know him?'
'‐ It's his cousin.'

571
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,871
How long's
he been down?

572
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:46,072
'I found him in
respiratory arrest'

573
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:47,541
'over 20 minutes ago.'

574
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:48,642
Asystole!

575
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,010
I got it. Where are we?

576
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:52,012
Epi times two, two migs atropine

577
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,814
two of narcan, an amp of D50.

578
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:56,382
Unresponsive to all.

579
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,119
Accu‐Chek the glucose.
Let's get a blood gas.

580
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,688
CBC, lytes, tox screen
and a chest film.

581
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:03,389
‐ I'll get the gas.
‐ Don't do this, Chase.

582
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,358
Damn you, don't do this.

583
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,835
'It looks like he aspirated.'

584
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,937
Amp of bicarb, high dose epi,
seven milligrams.

585
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,439
‐ Seven?
‐ Yes, seven, now.

586
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,874
Anna, take over for me.

587
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,543
Get the transthoracic pacemaker.

588
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:26,913
Blood gas, PO2 50,
PCO2 65, pH 6.9.

589
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:28,515
Alright, come on, let's go.
Let's hurry it up.

590
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,450
With that pH,
he's been down a long time.

591
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,818
Let's roll him.

592
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:39,726
It's not capturing.
Turn up the gain.

593
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,927
It's severe hypoxia.

594
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:42,663
‐ Crank it all the way!
‐ It is cranked.

595
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,497
Carter, he's
probably brain‐dead.

596
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,167
Come on, come on.

597
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,569
It might be PEA.

598
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:50,036
No, no, it's capturing.

599
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,505
There's a carotid pulse.

600
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,539
Alright, start a dopamine drip

601
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:53,807
ten mikes per kilo.

602
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,442
‐ Where's the vent?
‐ 'I got a BP, 40 palp.'

603
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,178
‐ How long was that?
‐ I'm calling respiratory.

604
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,881
‐ How long was that?
‐ Told you, about 40 minutes.

605
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:03,984
I don't know how long he
was down before I got there.

606
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,952
Okay, call the MICU.
Tell them we're on our way.

607
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:08,021
We need an EEG and a brain scan.

608
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:15,996
So, where are
you taking me?

609
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,464
Uh, somewhere cheap. You know
you won on a technicality.

610
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,200
That statue looked
like a caveman to me.

611
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,803
Hah, really?
He reminded me of Romano.

612
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:26,206
That super orbital torus,
that prognathic jaw.

613
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,941
Yeah. So much for evolution.

614
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,743
Retrogression, actually.

615
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:30,977
Don't let him
get to you.

616
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:32,045
That's easy
for you to say.

617
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,647
You're not a kept woman.

618
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,982
I need his sponsorship
to stay in the US.

619
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,884
You know, he's just
trying to rattle you.

620
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,086
Okay, if he, if he gives you
some criticism that's valid

621
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,988
then compensate,
overcompensate.

622
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:44,157
‐ And the study?
‐ Well, do you have a choice?

623
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,526
‐ I mean, you do all the work‐‐
‐ 'Peter.'

624
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,160
You know, his name
is gonna come first.

625
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,930
Hey, Jackie.
What are you doing here?

626
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:52,833
Oh, arranging a natural history
exhibit for Humboldt Park.

627
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,067
What are you doing here?

628
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,203
Oh, um...uh...
settling a bet.

629
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:59,105
Uh, this is my colleague
Elizabeth Corday.

630
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:00,774
Elizabeth, this is
my sister, Jackie.

631
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,843
‐ Oh!
‐ How do you do?

632
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,645
‐ Very well, and you?
‐ Great.

633
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:07,914
Elizabeth's from England.
I was just showing her around.

634
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:09,616
Oh, lucky you.

635
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,819
Peter's not usually so
generous with his time.

636
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,621
Yeah, well, um..

637
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:15,822
...you know..

638
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,924
...it's important that we..

639
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,526
...support our colleagues.

640
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,061
Of course.

641
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:23,463
Yes. Uh, we support
each other quite often.

642
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,640
'Hi. You've reached
the Hooper residence.'

643
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:35,041
'We can't take
your call right now'

644
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:37,010
'but please leave
a message. Thanks.'

645
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,015
Hey, you wanted to see me?

646
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:45,552
Yeah, a four‐year‐old
came in wheezing.

647
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,830
Did you get the EEG?

648
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:59,566
Slow diffuse activity.

649
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,001
You think I pushed too far?

650
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:04,838
No. I would have
done the same thing.

651
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,840
I should have
gotten him into detox.

652
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,108
If he didn't wanna go

653
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:09,910
it wouldn't have
worked. Believe me.

654
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,245
'You helped him the only way
he'd let himself be helped.'

655
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:15,716
Yeah, and a lot of good it did.

656
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:18,619
‐ 'Did you call your family?'
‐ No.

657
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,687
His folks are in Singapore.

658
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,558
My grandparents
are on their way.

659
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,832
It's probably my neurosurgeon.

660
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:37,003
Are you gonna be okay?

661
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,273
Yeah. Sure.

662
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:57,958
Impending respiratory failure.

663
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:01,161
BP's 90 palp. Resps 40.
O2's at 10 liters.

664
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:03,797
‐ He fought us all the way in.
‐ 'Alright, trauma one.'

665
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,066
He didn't wanna come back, but
I've never seen him this bad.

666
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,834
‐ I had to call.
‐ Yeah, you did the right thing.

667
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,335
His pulse ox
is down to 88.

668
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,705
We started an IV, but he
wouldn't let us intubate.

669
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:15,075
Okay, Mr. Kyle, we're
gonna take care of you.

670
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:17,243
Just gonna get
a chest x‐ray

671
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:20,013
and we'll probably
have to do that tap.

672
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,648
Is he gonna be here long?

673
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:23,383
I promised he
wouldn't have to stay.

674
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:26,052
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to admit him this time.

675
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,854
Alright, everybody,
on my count.

676
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:30,957
Excuse me. Can I help you?

677
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:33,093
‐ Are you his doctor?
‐ Yes. Do you know this man?

678
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:34,260
I'm his son. What happened?

679
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:35,996
How did he get here?

680
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,131
Oh...we're not
exactly sure.

681
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,833
Uh, we don't
even know his name.

682
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,802
Uh, Tom. Tom Dibble.

683
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,036
‐ How‐how did you find‐‐
‐ The cops called.

684
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,871
They, uh, picked
up his motorcycle.

685
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:45,972
I would have been here
sooner, but they sent me

686
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:47,407
to the wrong hospital.

687
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,375
Yeah, the other
hospital sent him here.

688
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,344
Why? What's
wrong with him?

689
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:55,415
Uh, your father had
a brain hemorrhage.

690
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:56,650
He wasn't
wearing his helmet?

691
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:57,984
No, not from
the trauma.

692
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,019
He had an aneurysm.

693
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,053
A blood vessel ruptured

694
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,221
inside of his head.

695
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:03,757
It probably
caused the crash.

696
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,358
What do you
do to fix it?

697
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,327
We're trying to relieve
the intracranial pressure

698
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,229
with medication.

699
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:10,964
But it's not working?

700
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,298
I'm waiting for
the chief of neurosurgery

701
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:13,399
to take a look.

702
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:14,935
They can operate?

703
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,837
There is a slim
chance that a partial

704
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,438
frontal lobectomy
might work.

705
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,173
And if it doesn't?

706
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,308
He'll die?

707
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:24,711
He might.

708
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:27,247
That's a mess, huh? Ooh.

709
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,782
End‐stage lung cancer.

710
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,984
‐ Guy still alive?
‐ If you call it living.

711
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,119
‐ He's a smoker, right?
‐ Yeah.

712
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,888
Shouldn't you be
at a podium by now?

713
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,690
‐ Wait, you do present today?
‐ Yeah.

714
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,792
‐ Come on, Doug, let's go.
‐ Wait a second. She's going?

715
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,426
You use my computer all night,
you don't tell me what it is

716
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,962
but the girlfriend
gets to go?

717
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,063
Well, someone has
to hold his cue cards.

718
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,798
Can somebody see
this Colicky baby?

719
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,466
‐ The mother's driving me nuts.
‐ Ooh, hey, I'll take that.

720
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,934
No, no, no, I'll take it.

721
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,435
I wouldn't want
you to be late.

722
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:51,071
Alright, you call me if
you need a second opinion.

723
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,138
Yeah, I think I can handle it.

724
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,875
Hi, Luisa. Is Scott upstairs?

725
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:55,976
He's in the bathroom.

726
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,911
Jeanie! Jeanie! Come look!

727
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,913
I made a fort in my room.

728
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:02,182
In a minute, Evette.
I wanna check on your brother.

729
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:04,785
‐ He said to leave him alone.
‐ I know.

730
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:06,352
Why don't you get your sticker
book and I'll meet you there.

731
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,154
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

732
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:14,961
Scott?

733
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,431
Scotty.

734
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:24,738
You forgot your Zofran.

735
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:29,743
Where's your IV?

736
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,344
It was empty. I took it out.

737
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,779
'By yourself?'

738
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:35,481
I saw you do it
a hundred times.

739
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:37,217
You took off on me.

740
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,419
Ask my dad. He'll
pay your cab fare.

741
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:43,023
Scott...I don't
know what to tell you.

742
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,158
Your dad paid me to help
you through your chemo

743
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,426
but that doesn't
mean we have to stop

744
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,961
being friends
now that you're done.

745
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:50,964
I have friends.
I don't need any more.

746
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:53,166
Well, that sucks.

747
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,901
Why?

748
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:58,171
'Cause I need all
the friends I can get.

749
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:00,140
So, how about Saturday?

750
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,175
How about it?

751
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,477
I can't go to the movies next
Friday, but I can go Saturday

752
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,446
unless you're too cool
to hang out with me.

753
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:09,415
You are pretty sorry.

754
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,384
Speak for yourself,
Captain Baldy.

755
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:14,821
Next month, my
hair will grow back

756
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,056
and you'll still be sorry.

757
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,157
Yeah, well, just for that

758
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,192
I get to pick the movie.

759
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:20,293
No way.

760
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,828
No chick flicks.

761
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:23,463
Oh, right,
Mr. "Days‐Of‐Our‐Lives."

762
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,935
I can't believe it.
Now she's quiet.

763
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:31,104
Well, I'll give you
a fact sheet on colic.

764
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,973
No, please.
I've read everything.

765
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:34,240
Let me just stay
until her next feeding

766
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,209
so you can see
how bad she gets.

767
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:39,112
No problem. I'll, uh,
check her in a little while.

768
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,280
Chuny, we're slowing down.

769
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:41,548
So tell Mark I'm going over

770
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,083
to the med school
for half an hour.

771
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,918
Sure.

772
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,219
Hey, who called
the Grim Reaper?

773
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,253
Hmm?

774
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,192
Hey...what are
you doing down here?

775
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,594
I heard John Doe's
family came in.

776
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:54,995
Yeah, but we're
not ready to have

777
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:56,530
a conversation
about organ donation.

778
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,832
Okay, I just came down
to do an apnea test

779
00:29:58,865 --> 00:29:59,900
see how close he was.

780
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:01,968
Well, he's not
brain‐dead yet.

781
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:04,204
Neurosurgery said it was
only a matter of time.

782
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,372
I‐I don't care
what they said. I‐‐

783
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:08,074
‐ Dr. Del Amico
‐ Yeah, hold on.

784
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:10,210
I haven't given
up on him yet.

785
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,512
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

786
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:12,946
What was that, uh,
what was that thing

787
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,080
that you said
that they could try?

788
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:15,849
A partial
frontal lobectomy.

789
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,518
No. I'm sorry.

790
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:19,219
There's really
nothing more we can do.

791
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:20,921
Uh, your resident said
it was a possibility.

792
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:23,389
‐ He shouldn't have.
‐ It's worth a shot, isn't it?

793
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:25,058
I mean, he's a teamster.

794
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:26,527
He's got great insurance,
if money is a problem.

795
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,561
No, that isn't it.

796
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:28,595
It's just that surgery

797
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,263
isn't warranted in this case.

798
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,998
She said he might die
if you don't operate.

799
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:34,300
I'm afraid he will die,
no matter what.

800
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,505
I want a second opinion.

801
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:40,006
You say one thing,
she says another thing‐‐

802
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,075
I understand. I'm
the chief neurosurgeon here.

803
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:43,944
You'll have to get it
from another hospital.

804
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:45,178
I want all of his records.

805
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:48,048
Sure. I'm really
very sorry.

806
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:49,516
I wish I could help.

807
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:54,555
Excuse me for a second.

808
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:57,290
Hey, uh, pardon me, Dr. Mack..

809
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,892
I‐I don't understand.
He's right.

810
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,293
If the patient's
gonna die anyway

811
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,995
why not at least try?

812
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,463
There's no indication
for a lobectomy.

813
00:31:03,496 --> 00:31:05,198
Isn't it worth
the effort though?

814
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,967
We don't perform
invasive brain surgery

815
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,268
for the heck
of it, doctor.

816
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:09,903
I understand that

817
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:11,304
but someone needs
to take a risk

818
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,206
and try to help this man.

819
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,642
Bellarmin dumped him,
we wanna harvest his organs.

820
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:17,511
He deserves a chance,
not matter how remote.

821
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:20,013
There is no chance.

822
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:22,415
I appreciate that you
wanna do something

823
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:24,150
but know what the hell
you're talking about

824
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:26,052
before you play
on someone's hope.

825
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,455
That kid's already
lost his father.

826
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:37,297
The heroin depressed
his respiratory center

827
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,399
which led
to cardiac arrest.

828
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:43,203
We got his heart going again,
but...everything indicates

829
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,371
that his brain was
deprived of oxygen

830
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,440
for a significant
period of time.

831
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,510
But you don't
know for sure.

832
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:51,244
No, his pupils
are reactive

833
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:54,247
and he withdraws
from painful stimuli

834
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,017
but his brain‐wave activity
is slow and diffuse.

835
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,351
Speak English, son.

836
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:00,253
He has probable
brain damage.

837
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,355
What's "probable?"

838
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,958
Can't be quantified.

839
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:07,093
It could run from..

840
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:10,330
...memory impairment to
a chronic vegetative state.

841
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,634
We‐we ju...I don't..

842
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,135
Did you know
about this?

843
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,572
‐ The drug use?
‐ Yes, drug use!

844
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,073
'Oh, John.'

845
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,643
Did you think to do
anything about it?

846
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:24,144
Yeah, I helped him detox.

847
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,379
Where? Here?

848
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:28,014
No. His apartment.

849
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:30,283
"His apartment?"

850
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:33,119
What kind of medicine
do you practice?

851
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:34,254
'You know, there are
centers that take care of'

852
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,522
'this sort of thing.'

853
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,691
He didn't want it that way.

854
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:39,693
It was not your decision, John.

855
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:42,128
No, no. It was his.

856
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,597
It should've been ours!

857
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,331
'He's on heroin, for God sake.'

858
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:47,300
'He had no ability
to apply good judgment'

859
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,602
'but you should
have had some sense'

860
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,504
called your family!

861
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:52,138
We could have handled it!

862
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:54,207
‐ Sorry.
‐ I'm calling, Dr. Levy.

863
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,176
We're gonna get him out of here.

864
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:08,205
And only one child in the study
reached the lockout dose.

865
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,508
Yeah, but for example, with
your sickle‐cell patient

866
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:13,177
'with the infarcted spleen,
you advocate letting'

867
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,580
'them blunt their own pain
and possibly mask symptoms?'

868
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:17,114
'I‐if he had a surgical belly'

869
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:18,382
'then there would still
be guarding and rebound'

870
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,617
'and other peritoneal signs.'

871
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,651
'It'd just be
more comfortable.'

872
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:22,487
Still, pain is an important

873
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,688
diagnostic indicator.

874
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:25,155
We're talking about kids here.

875
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:26,423
So now you're gonna
just say, "Suck it up?"

876
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:28,358
I guess I'm just
from the old school.

877
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:30,060
I think that's probably true.

878
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:32,630
Well, thank you, Dr. Ross.

879
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:34,765
It was all quite
thought‐provoking.

880
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,502
Excellent work.
That's it, everybody.

881
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:40,104
Actually, Don, I had a question

882
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:42,172
for Dr. Ross regarding

883
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:44,509
the randomization
of his control group.

884
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,211
Sure, Kerry.

885
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:50,347
Dr. Greene, do
you have a minute?

886
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,481
You've been
here six months.

887
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:52,683
You can call me Mark.

888
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:54,184
Alright, uh, Mark.

889
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:55,586
I know this sounds
rather morbid

890
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,488
uh, but as you say,
I've been here six months

891
00:33:57,522 --> 00:33:59,590
and I haven't had as
much trauma experience

892
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:01,058
as I had hoped.

893
00:34:01,091 --> 00:34:03,293
So, uh, I was wondering
if you might be able

894
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:05,496
to advise me on
the times that a surgeon

895
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,164
might sign up
for ER coverage.

896
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:09,534
Well, I hope you don't
mind nights and weekends.

897
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,102
No. That's, uh, what
I'd presumed, actually.

898
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:14,304
Listen, the gunshot wounds
and the knife wounds

899
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:16,073
kind of taper off
in the winter

900
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:18,576
but spring's just
around the corner.

901
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:20,177
Dr. Greene, we need you!

902
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,812
‐ Trauma one, now.
‐ What is it?

903
00:34:21,846 --> 00:34:23,648
Lung cancer patient's coding.

904
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:25,082
‐ What happened?
‐ I don't know.

905
00:34:25,115 --> 00:34:26,383
‐ I found him like this.
‐ No pulse.

906
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:27,451
Alright, let's get
him on the gurney.

907
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:29,687
One, two, three.

908
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,358
What was he doing out of bed?

909
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:35,493
Where's this blood coming from?

910
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:36,794
He probably
hit his head.

911
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:37,862
Bag him.

912
00:34:37,895 --> 00:34:39,096
Asystole.

913
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,698
Mig of atropine,
amp of epi.

914
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:43,333
‐ This looks like an exit wound.
‐ What?

915
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,503
Yeah. Here's the entrance.
This is a gunshot wound.

916
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:47,337
Somebody shot him?

917
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:48,806
‐ Where's the wife?
‐ Call security!

918
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,475
Wait, wait. Hold on.

919
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:52,577
Dude capped himself.

920
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:56,413
‐ Why?
‐ End‐stage lung cancer.

921
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:58,182
It's pretty awful.

922
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:00,150
Does suicide count as a DNR?

923
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,423
Time of death, 17:05.

924
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:07,858
I'll try and find his wife.

925
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:14,464
Where's gramps?

926
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:16,534
You called him away
from a union negotiation.

927
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:18,368
He'll have a strike
on his hands

928
00:35:18,402 --> 00:35:20,705
starting at midnight
if he doesn't settle it

929
00:35:20,738 --> 00:35:22,339
and I'm heading uptown

930
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,308
to this Kenner
Neurology Institute.

931
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:27,377
Alright, but Chase needs to be
stable before he can be moved.

932
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:29,213
Right now his blood
pressure is being supported

933
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:30,515
by intravenous medications

934
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:32,482
and he's having
occasional heart arrhythmia.

935
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:34,619
Thank you, John, I've
spoken to the internist.

936
00:35:34,652 --> 00:35:36,320
I don't need you
to explain it.

937
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:37,421
Grandma, I'm sorry.

938
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:38,455
If I could go back
and change this

939
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:39,657
I would.

940
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:44,361
I assumed if he really
needed help, he'd ask.

941
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:46,163
He did. He asked me.

942
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:52,903
Did he tell you
what made him start?

943
00:35:54,772 --> 00:35:56,473
I don't know.

944
00:35:56,507 --> 00:35:58,442
Maybe he just
felt overwhelmed.

945
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:01,311
That's something
I've never understood

946
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:02,713
about your generation

947
00:36:02,747 --> 00:36:05,382
or your parents',
for that matter.

948
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,785
In our day, we embraced
our responsibilities.

949
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:09,520
They defined us.

950
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:15,493
I don't blame you for this,
John, but I know you blame us.

951
00:36:17,728 --> 00:36:20,698
‐ No, I don't.
‐ Yes, you do.

952
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:23,267
All your lives,
you've been indulged

953
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,269
and considered
it oppression.

954
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:34,344
You look after him tonight.

955
00:36:35,646 --> 00:36:36,947
Good.

956
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:38,516
I'll be back
in the morning.

957
00:36:54,264 --> 00:36:55,766
This may be difficult for you
to understand, but there are

958
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,568
areas of expertise
where my knowledge

959
00:36:57,602 --> 00:36:58,703
and my experience
exceed yours.

960
00:36:58,736 --> 00:36:59,770
I don't deny that

961
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:00,838
but you should
have consulted me.

962
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,939
You should have consulted me!

963
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:03,508
Whoa! What's going on?

964
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:04,809
Nothing, Kerry was
about to release

965
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:06,511
a‐a two‐week‐old
baby with sepsis.

966
00:37:06,544 --> 00:37:08,312
Her temperature was only
slightly below normal‐‐

967
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:09,780
You made a mistake, right?
You made a mistake.

968
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:11,248
Yeah, I made a mistake.

969
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:12,349
But that's not
what this is about.

970
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:13,718
No, it's not about you, Kerry.

971
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:15,019
It's only about me.
I'm the screw‐up here.

972
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:16,621
Well, guys, what's the problem?

973
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:18,623
He's angry because he has
to redo part of his study

974
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:20,491
after I pointed out
a flaw in his research.

975
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:22,292
First of all, there was no flaw.
Second of all, you ambushed me‐‐

976
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:25,295
Oh! I tried to talk to you this
morning and you blew me off.

977
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,731
So you left
a sick kid here

978
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:28,866
to go over there
a‐a‐and undercut me

979
00:37:28,899 --> 00:37:30,601
in front of all the pediatric
staff. Was that the idea?

980
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:33,270
I cannot allow you to push
the use of pediatric PCA

981
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:35,640
in situations where the research
simply doesn't support it.

982
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:37,274
So, you are the self‐appointed
authority? Is that right?

983
00:37:37,307 --> 00:37:38,676
Yeah, if I have to be.

984
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:40,010
Well, today, you
didn't help any kids.

985
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:41,411
In fact today, you
almost killed one kid.

986
00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:42,613
You know,
screw you, Doug‐‐

987
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:44,582
'Okay, both of you, calm down.'

988
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:48,653
Is the baby gonna be alright?

989
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:50,621
She's gonna be fine.
I gave her antibiotics.

990
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:52,356
Okay. Well, that's
what's important.

991
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:54,525
From this point on,
a pediatrician is consulted

992
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,760
'in all pedes cases.'

993
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:57,762
I am capable of
treating children.

994
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:59,329
‐ Apparently not.
‐ 'Look, Doug.'

995
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:01,431
I know you're angry,
okay? But she's right.

996
00:38:01,465 --> 00:38:03,367
Emergency physicians
are fully qualified

997
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,569
to handle pedes emergencies.

998
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:06,036
Hey, hey, hey, guys.

999
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,572
Hey, what are you doing?

1000
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:09,574
‐ What is it?
‐ Can you just wait over there?

1001
00:38:09,607 --> 00:38:10,775
What is it? What are you doing?

1002
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:12,943
‐ Transferring him to Evanston.
‐ 'Why?'

1003
00:38:12,977 --> 00:38:14,679
'Because he's too
much to handle here.'

1004
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:15,713
He cannot
control his rage.

1005
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:16,981
He‐he was abused.

1006
00:38:17,014 --> 00:38:18,382
Didn't you see
the burns on his arms?

1007
00:38:18,415 --> 00:38:21,318
Look, they may have
been self‐inflicted.

1008
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:22,687
So, you're
committing him?

1009
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,689
Look, he tried
to kill his brother

1010
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:26,356
'and he has no
signs of remorse.'

1011
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,358
I mean, did he
show any to you?

1012
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,362
No. I..

1013
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:34,431
Look, you might
need to testify.

1014
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:35,866
I'll let you know.

1015
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:40,538
Hey. You okay?

1016
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,575
How'd it go today?

1017
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:46,443
Oh, fun, fun, fun.

1018
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,579
Are we gonna
do rounds?

1019
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:49,814
Beats me.

1020
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:05,591
I called the organ
donation coordinator.

1021
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:07,826
She's coming down
to talk to you.

1022
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,427
Forget it.

1023
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:10,962
He's getting the operation.

1024
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,399
Uh, listen, Alex.

1025
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:17,536
When your, uh..

1026
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:19,404
...when your father
first came in

1027
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:21,807
I was frustrated,
you know.

1028
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,878
I...I wanted to help,
and I pushed really hard

1029
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:29,447
to find anything that
might save his life.

1030
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:33,018
Unfortunately, I was...
I was overly optimistic

1031
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:35,020
about his chances
for survival.

1032
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:39,925
There‐there is no operation.

1033
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:44,095
That was one doctor's opinion.

1034
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:45,897
I got a surgeon over
at Bellarmin to look at him.

1035
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:47,098
'He's agreed to
do the lobectomy.'

1036
00:39:47,132 --> 00:39:49,000
Bellarmin?

1037
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,101
All set.

1038
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:51,402
I booked an OR.

1039
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:52,671
Who are you?

1040
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:54,005
David Zaccarria.

1041
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,742
Is this the, uh, ER intern?

1042
00:39:56,775 --> 00:39:58,877
I'm the doctor who
treated this patient

1043
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,479
after you dumped him.

1044
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,080
I didn't dump
Mr. Dibble.

1045
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:06,117
No! You dumped a John Doe.
Bellarmin paged you.

1046
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:08,654
Aneurysm, no insurance,
no interest from you.

1047
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,155
I'm sorry. We don't
have time for this.

1048
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:11,490
I have to get
this man to the OR.

1049
00:40:11,523 --> 00:40:13,559
Hey! He's still
my patient.

1050
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:15,727
Not anymore.

1051
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,963
D‐d‐does Dr. Mack
know about this?

1052
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:19,531
He has privileges.

1053
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:30,772
Sorry.

1054
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:39,668
Hello?

1055
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:44,573
Hello? Mark.

1056
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:46,976
Hi. Is this, uh,
is this a bad time?

1057
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,045
'Uh, what are you doing here?'

1058
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:51,981
‐ I got your luggage.
‐ Oh, right. Sure. Hold on.

1059
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:58,254
How did, how
did you find me?

1060
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:01,624
‐ Can I come in?
‐ Oh, um, sure. Of course.

1061
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:05,161
Um, you can put
'em right there.

1062
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:08,464
Thank you. I was,
uh, wondering

1063
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:10,733
how I was gonna
get those back.

1064
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:13,536
So...how are you?

1065
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:17,106
I'm, uh, you know, good.
Same, same old stuff.

1066
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,142
What about your mom?

1067
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:20,609
Better, some days.

1068
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:22,478
Good.

1069
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:24,981
How about you?

1070
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:26,082
I'm okay.

1071
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:30,119
It's a nice place.

1072
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,055
Oh, yeah.
I‐I got a new job.

1073
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:35,458
Uh, administrative assistant
for a law firm, so..

1074
00:41:35,491 --> 00:41:37,326
That's great.

1075
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,461
Yeah.

1076
00:41:40,129 --> 00:41:41,430
I was so surprised
when I came back

1077
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:43,599
and you weren't
working at the ER.

1078
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:45,201
Well, I..

1079
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:47,503
...I thought I needed to..

1080
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,605
...I needed a fresh start
and couldn't really do that

1081
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:51,507
with you there, could I?

1082
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,309
Uh...guess not.

1083
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:57,013
'Mom?'

1084
00:41:57,046 --> 00:41:58,781
Oh, Jason, honey,
w‐w‐what are you

1085
00:41:58,814 --> 00:42:00,283
what are you doing up?

1086
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,551
'I'm thirsty.'

1087
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:04,153
Okay, I'll get you
a glass of water

1088
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:06,155
but then you've got
to go back to bed, okay?

1089
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,259
Jason, this is my
friend, Dr. Greene.

1090
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:12,261
Hi, Jason.

1091
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:14,230
Here you go.

1092
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:23,539
Jump in there, sweetie.

1093
00:42:23,572 --> 00:42:25,074
Sleep well.

1094
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,611
You got him back.

1095
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:30,213
Yeah.

1096
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:31,414
Good for you.

1097
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:32,581
Thanks.

1098
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:37,753
Oh, I, uh, I didn't
just come here

1099
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:39,755
to give you your
luggage back.

1100
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:41,757
Oh, well..

1101
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,192
I made a big mistake‐‐

1102
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,827
Mark, you don't
need to apologize.

1103
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,097
‐ No. No‐‐
‐ I, uh, went after you.

1104
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:50,166
I was a big girl, and I
knew what I was doing.

1105
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,636
No, no. I think I
made a big mistake.

1106
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:57,373
I mean, we were,
we were great together.

1107
00:42:57,406 --> 00:43:00,606
Mark, you don't love me.
I deserve better.

1108
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:03,459
You do.

1109
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:05,428
‐ I could, uh‐‐
‐ No.

1110
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:07,430
You can't.

1111
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:21,410
Uh..

1112
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:26,249
I'll miss you.

1113
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:27,851
Me too.

1114
00:43:29,252 --> 00:43:31,087
Goodbye, Mark.

1115
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:53,576
Hey, I'll do that.
