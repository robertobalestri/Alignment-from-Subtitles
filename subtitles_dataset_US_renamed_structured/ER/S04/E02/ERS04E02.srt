1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,107
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,809
What's your
son's name, Dr. Benton?

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,443
He doesn't have one.

4
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,178
You got a full arrest,
you call on attending.

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,214
You don't play
the hero. You get help.

6
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,782
‐ Let's have a beer.
‐ Okay.

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,651
‐ Dr. Benton?
‐ Yeah.

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,152
Elizabeth Corday..

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,522
...visiting surgical lecturer
and your savior.

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,691
You take Dr. Del Amico back.
I'm intimidated enough already.

11
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,359
‐ Anna, please.
‐ Alright, Anna.

12
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,394
If Dr. Minz calls, let
him know I'm on my way out.

13
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,396
‐ Okey‐dokey.
‐ Goodnight.

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,232
I have nothing to say, okay.

15
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,801
I agreed to have you follow
me on the job, we can do that

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,136
but no more interviews.

17
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:59,860
'WMAQ 670 news. Good morning,
Chicago. I'm Pat Cassidy.'

18
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,397
'It's hot, too hot. Temperatures
expected to press 100 degrees..'

19
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,737
Son of a bitch! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

20
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,206
Dr. Greene?

21
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,875
I'm sorry.
I thought, that's alright.

22
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,543
You don't have to stop.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

23
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,445
‐ I'm not stopping, I'm parking.
‐ Where, on the street?

24
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,447
Yeah. I don't park
in the garage anymore.

25
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,117
I don't blame you.
Place gives me the creeps too.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,219
Nah, it's alright. It's alright.
It's not even a dent.

27
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,588
It's a nice car.
Good color.

28
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,455
You should use
the crosswalk, Carter.

29
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,158
‐ Right.
‐ You're in early?

30
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,860
Yeah. I wanted to be here
before my med student.

31
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,596
Ah, you're very own scutpuppy.

32
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:39,265
Somebody to pick up my labs.
Someone to do a patient history.

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,401
The occasional
obligatory rectal exam.

34
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,570
‐ And someone to abuse.
‐ No‐no, this is about teaching.

35
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,205
This is completely
about teaching.

36
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,774
‐ The way Benton taught you?
‐ Or even better.

37
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,610
Threat to
parents with children

38
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,545
'who will get sick
this school year.'

39
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,147
'And with more than a 100
viruses floating around..'

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,683
Hello?
Dr. Morgenstern?

41
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,151
Come here. Come here, you.

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,856
David.

43
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,592
Little guy has a tendency
to get away from you.

44
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,193
‐ Whoop.
‐ Here, let me.

45
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,194
There you go.

46
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,164
Kerry Weaver.

47
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,767
Katie Couric.

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,602
Katie Couric, Kerry Weaver.

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,706
So, David,
how are you feeling?

50
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,609
Morphine, damn fine stuff.

51
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,545
I talked to Dr. Weintraub today.

52
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,279
She said they're
tapering your lidocaine

53
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,249
echo showed very little damage
to your myocardium.

54
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:35,221
Uh, I put the nitro patch here.
Just as effective.

55
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,724
Most doc put it
on the patient's chest.

56
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:42,629
I say, why tear out these little
hairs, if you don't have to?

57
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:47,400
Uh, you know, I have some
forms that billing sent down

58
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,470
for you to sign the CPT codes

59
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,972
for the attending's
for last month.

60
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,608
They're always
sending me this junk

61
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,678
forms, paper work, duplicates.

62
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,848
Little perforated lines.
"Tear here."

63
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,784
They must not have heard
about your heart attack.

64
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,719
Now, if you want to look
them over, I can send them‐‐

65
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,453
I never look them over.

66
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,256
You just sign them for me
and send them back.

67
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,259
‐ You want me to sign them?
‐ I want you to sign everything.

68
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,428
Send everything back.

69
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,598
You don't mind if I step in
and take over a little bit?

70
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,766
Praise Allah, no.

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,502
I don't mind telling you

72
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,838
sometimes I have felt
like a sheriff with no posse.

73
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,275
Like a general with no
...grunts in the field.

74
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:34,414
Like a lone shepherd,
high up on a hill, no sheep dog.

75
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,784
I completely
understand how you feel.

76
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,319
You know, I'd like to take‐‐

77
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,722
Everywhere you look
there's sheep, sheep, sheep.

78
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,926
Maybe it would be best
if I stepped in and took over

79
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,361
some of
the administrative duties

80
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,763
while you're recuperating.

81
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,434
God bless you, Kerry Weaver.

82
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,769
God bless you.

83
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,711
Doug?

84
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,554
Ketchup or Tabasco
...in your scrambled eggs?

85
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,422
You want, uh, something
some people consider a vegetable

86
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,391
or do you wanna go with
something a little more daring?

87
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,459
You thought I left, didn't you?

88
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,594
‐ No, I didn't.
‐ Yes, you did.

89
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,395
No, really, I didn't.

90
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,065
Okay, yeah, I did. But you, you
kind of did leave, technically.

91
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, that doesn't count.

92
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,569
If you'd gotten up
a little bit earlier

93
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,705
you would have seen
me here, sound asleep.

94
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,275
‐ Some habits die hard.
‐ Yeah, like you sleeping in.

95
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,978
Like you not being
there in the morning.

96
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,546
Ah, that's an old habit.

97
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,685
‐ Wow. Thank you.
‐ Mm.

98
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,721
Okay, I got to talk
to you about something.

99
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,056
Oh, Doug, not another
serious conversation.

100
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,558
You used to say we
didn't communicate, so‐‐

101
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,759
I know, but now
you're communicating

102
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,994
a little bit too much.

103
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,329
This is important.
Can I have a drawer?

104
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,598
‐ What?
‐ A drawer.

105
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,399
Something you keep
your clothes in.

106
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,702
Something that
I would keep my clothes in.

107
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,805
You never wanted
a drawer before.

108
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:05,839
Well..

109
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,011
That's 'cause
I always got up and left.

110
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,780
Now, that I'm staying here..

111
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,716
Hmm?

112
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,919
If I could maybe
just have, um...someplace to..

113
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,689
...well, keep a new shirt.

114
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,725
‐ Yeah?
‐ And a nice pair of socks.

115
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,026
Mm‐hmm.

116
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,429
I'd settle for underwear.

117
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,034
You know..

118
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,537
...you can always just wash
your boxers out in the sink.

119
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,605
They'll be dry by the morning.

120
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,543
‐ Come here.
‐ Mm.

121
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,110
Oh, my.

122
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,065
'So, Morgenstern
asked you to stop by?'

123
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,801
Well, I had some forms
for him to sign

124
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,202
and next thing you know,
he's making me acting chief

125
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,838
of emergency services
while he recuperates.

126
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,740
I think‐I think he's
been under a lot more stress

127
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,174
than any of us realize.

128
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,611
Oh, Mark, can I give Mrs. Crane
another 50 of Demerol?

129
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,812
She is extremely touchy.

130
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,213
Yes, I know and yes, you can.

131
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,216
‐ Convention?
‐ Tour bus.

132
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,584
They're waiting
for their driver.

133
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,620
He ate bad eggs at Pulipski's

134
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,723
and now, he's puking up
his guts in exam room four.

135
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,025
So, maybe we should talk
to Morgenstern's doctor.

136
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,793
‐ Who's taking care of him?
‐ Emma Weintraub.

137
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,729
And actually,
I already talked to her.

138
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,164
No more PVC's,
but intermittent chest pain.

139
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,733
They scheduled angioplasty.

140
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,234
So, in the meantime,
you'll be filling in?

141
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,036
Well, David asked me
to do what I can

142
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,671
to fill in with some
administrative duties

143
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,239
as long as you don't have
a problem with that.

144
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,808
The only problem I'd have,
would be, if I had to do it.

145
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,176
‐ Excellent point
‐ Good morning, everyone.

146
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,778
‐ What is that, a convention?
‐ Tour bus.

147
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,880
‐ No kids, I hope.
‐ It's your lucky day.

148
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,016
Jerry, pull the QA and QI data
for the past three months.

149
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,251
‐ You're kidding?
‐ Now!

150
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,986
‐ Morning.
‐ Good morning, Carol.

151
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,255
‐ Did you sleep well?
‐ I did, yes. Thank you, Doug.

152
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,023
‐ Tour bus?
‐ Bingo.

153
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,093
Mark, I need to attend
the executive committee meeting

154
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,530
for JCAHO's next visit,
and I‐I wanted to know

155
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,732
if you and Carol could
interview the candidates

156
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,233
for the new desk
clerk position.

157
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,602
They should be here
around noon.

158
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,970
‐ It'd be a pleasure.
‐ Great.

159
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,238
Just clear
your selection through me

160
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,940
before you make a final one.

161
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,176
‐ Hey, you going somewhere?
‐ Not that I know of.

162
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,277
'Dr. Mark Greene?'

163
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,646
‐ Yeah.
‐ This is for you.

164
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,281
Wait a minute. Who are you?

165
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,617
Uh, there's a name and number
of an attorney on the inside

166
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,018
if you want to call
for information.

167
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,653
What is this, a subpoena?

168
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,658
Oh, man.

169
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,661
You coming into the clinic
at 4:00, right? Al?

170
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,563
Al! Al.

171
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,999
Yeah. Don't worry.
I'll be there.

172
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,034
As long as I can
come up with another excuse

173
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,302
to leave work early.

174
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,705
I wish you could
just tell Roswell the truth.

175
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,206
That I have AIDS? Come on.

176
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,542
Take him only five
seconds to fire me.

177
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,177
Okay, uh, how about
you have to pick your mother up

178
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,679
from the airport?

179
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,180
I used that one.

180
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,882
One of our kids is sick?

181
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,784
Well, all four
have already had

182
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,120
every childhood
disease known to man.

183
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,088
How about your
grandmother was sick.

184
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,857
You have to swing by
to see how she's doing.

185
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,959
Yeah, well,
poor grandma had a stroke.

186
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,894
Went to her funeral last month.

187
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,062
Al, that's horrible.

188
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,031
I know,
I know, but it worked.

189
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,934
Got me the afternoon off.
I'd better get going.

190
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,769
Yeah, well, just make sure
you get this afternoon off.

191
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,003
'Cause if you miss
your clinic appointment

192
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,705
you could lose your meds.

193
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:02,275
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay?

194
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,578
Don't worry.

195
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,680
'He's ready
to come off, of the vent'

196
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,849
You wanna extubate him today?

197
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,151
It's been three weeks.
I think he's ready.

198
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,786
What about a trial of C.PAP?

199
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,155
Well, he's almost
at room air, setting at 99.

200
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,757
He says that's good.

201
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,760
No, uh, I know it's good,
Carla, but, uh..

202
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,596
...he‐he could end up
back on a‐a ventilator.

203
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,798
That's very unlikely.

204
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,600
I'll extubate him
this afternoon.

205
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,170
What's wrong with you, Peter?

206
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,873
Why are you so against
hearing good news?

207
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,741
Carla, I just want to be sure.

208
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,176
You haven't even wanted
to give him a name

209
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,344
fix the birth certificate. What?

210
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,714
It's going to be
baby boy Reese forever?

211
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,249
Look, we weren't even sure
if he was going to make it.

212
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,085
But now we are.

213
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,754
But the next ultrasound of
his brain could show bleeding.

214
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,323
And the sky
could be falling, too, Peter.

215
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,693
We need to get on with his life.

216
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,634
The first thing I'm doing
is taking down those bunks.

217
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,236
Don't you even think
about arguing with me.

218
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,039
Alright. He's too smart for
that, aren't you, Skyler?

219
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,142
It was my husband's bright idea.
He had bunks when he was a boy.

220
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,678
Seven brothers, we had bunks all
over the house when I was a kid.

221
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,313
‐ You never fell out?
‐ Uh, no.

222
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,148
But I was pushed
a number of times.

223
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,217
Anna, you got a minute?

224
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,719
Uh, the nurse will be in

225
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,854
with your ortho
referral, Mrs. McClay.

226
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,156
And Skyler, uh, take the bottom
bunk for a while, okay?

227
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,858
Thank you.

228
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,292
‐ Looking over the charts‐‐
‐ Hey, you know what?

229
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,761
In front of the patients
I'd appreciate

230
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,396
if you called me
Dr. Del Amico.

231
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,232
‐ I didn't?
‐ Nope. You called me Anna.

232
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,134
Alright. I didn't mean
anything by it.

233
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,401
I've probably
called Mark Greene

234
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,003
"Mark" in front of his patients.

235
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,438
‐ That would be wrong too.
‐ Okay, I'm sorry.

236
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,841
It's okay.
Um, what about the charts?

237
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,676
Now, you've worked mostly peds
since you started, right?

238
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,144
Hang on.

239
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,813
Did you disagree with my
handling of any of those cases?

240
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:50,416
No. It's, um, do you want to
talk about this someplace else?

241
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,652
No.

242
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,189
Sometimes it's easier
to go with what we know.

243
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,825
Now, uh, you've done
a peds residency

244
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,761
but you were here
on an emergency residency

245
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,396
and I think you would benefit
by working with more adults.

246
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,198
Well, I appreciate your concern

247
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,467
but I think I can
balance my own caseload.

248
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,836
Well, I don't,
I don't know, you, you‐‐

249
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,306
A‐and y‐you're not
supervising my residency here.

250
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,375
‐ Well, pediatrics, I am.
‐ Okay.

251
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,011
Anna, adults you run
by Dr. Doyle first

252
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,380
then either myself
or Dr. Weaver, okay?

253
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,282
‐ You, too, Carter.
‐ What?

254
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,751
‐ Run my cases by Maggie?
‐ That's right.

255
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,220
Dr. Greene, excuse me,
but I've actually done

256
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,089
quite a few more
ER procedures than she has.

257
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,157
Uh‐huh, and you are what year?

258
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,227
Technically, I'm an intern,
first year and she's second year

259
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,430
but I spent half my surgical
internship teaching her.

260
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,865
‐ No, you didn't.
‐ I taught you!

261
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,366
I taught you how
to tie one‐handed knots.

262
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,368
‐ Big deal.
‐ Okay, look, that's enough.

263
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,438
Is everybody clear about
who runs what by whom?

264
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,708
Yeah?

265
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,177
‐ Where are the students?
‐ Cafeteria.

266
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,885
Doug, Anna was gonna take
these barfing twins in five.

267
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,290
'Peter, you've met
Elizabeth Corday, haven't you?'

268
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,193
‐ Oh, yes, we've met.
‐ Uh, yeah. Hi.

269
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,429
I was wondering if you'd assist
her today, show her the ropes.

270
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,797
Well, I don't know
my surgical schedule.

271
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,232
No, just in trauma.

272
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,900
Penetrating trauma,
gunshot wounds.

273
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,368
‐ That sort of thing.
‐ Yeah, sure. No problem.

274
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,203
I was scheduled to
tag along with Mr. Campbell

275
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,372
but apparently he's
in hospital with a kidney stone.

276
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,974
And seeing as Dr. Carter

277
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,776
isn't taking up any
more of your time..

278
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,178
No problem. You know what, this
is the ER right now, so, uh..

279
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,446
‐ Oh, lovely.
‐ Good.

280
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,823
Ah, which one do you want?

281
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,324
I don't really want
either of them.

282
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,894
I had plenty of students
back at CHOP. You choose.

283
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,264
Let's just go along
gender lines. I'll take the guy.

284
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,867
Hi. I'm John Carter.
This is Anna Del Amico.

285
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,969
‐ Hi. Chasity Lee.
‐ Chastity?

286
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,404
Uh, no, that would be
as in Bono.

287
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,039
No middle "T." Just Chasity.

288
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,208
‐ And I'm George Henry.
‐ Uh, okay.

289
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,877
Uh, you'll be with me.

290
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,079
Looking forward to
finally doing my ER rotation.

291
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,514
My dad's a trauma surgeon.

292
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,182
I know there's gonna be
a lot of scut work

293
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,852
but I'm glad to finally
start seeing some patients.

294
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,321
Oh, uh, uh, John,
I should probably mention

295
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,890
that I'm not actually
all that interested

296
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,224
in working with patients.

297
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,030
‐ Excuse me?
‐ I'm getting my M. D. PhD.

298
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,899
I finished my first
two years of med school.

299
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,535
I've been doing bench research
for the past four years.

300
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,370
Uh, patients just aren't
all that helpful to my research.

301
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:28,008
Yeah, but you haven't had any
medical training in four years?

302
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,477
You remember anything? About the
path of physiology of disease?

303
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,847
‐ How to do a physical exam?
‐ No, no, not really.

304
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,449
No, I‐I've been doing
brain research.

305
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,153
Studying genetic
markers for Angelman's Syndrome.

306
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,255
Well, you may know it
as "happy puppet's disease."

307
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,158
It, um, causes the afflicted
to laugh inappropriately

308
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:50,196
and to flap their hands
like a‐a puppet...on a string.

309
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,865
Wow.

310
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,399
'Okay, get x‐ray in here.'

311
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,068
Please, it hurts.

312
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,603
Caught a good one there,
didn't you, Ernesto?

313
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,271
Oh, man.

314
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,507
This is Elizabeth Corday,
new surgical resident.

315
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,942
It's a pleasure. How do you do?

316
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,644
Alright, people,
what do we have?

317
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,213
Uh, GSW to the right chest,
sixth intercostal space.

318
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,551
Got two liters of saline
in the field. BP is 100 over 60.

319
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:13,587
‐ He's tachy at 120.
‐ Pulse ox 95 on 10 liters.

320
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,956
Alright, this is Dr. Corday's
first gunshot trauma.

321
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,658
So, people, let's run it
by the numbers.

322
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,661
‐ I'm Miss Corday, and you are?
‐ Ernesto Ruiz.

323
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,263
You've a rather nasty hole
right near your nipple, Ernesto.

324
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,332
‐ Somebody call my mom, please.
‐ Forget about it.

325
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,268
You can tell her yourself
what you've been doing.

326
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,003
Alright, primary survey.

327
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,038
Assess the airway
and the respiratory effort.

328
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,108
No sign of tension pneumo
or cardiac tamponade.

329
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,644
Next, auscultation of the heart
and lungs while palpating

330
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,145
the carotid pulse.

331
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,914
Do you by any chance know,
what sort of bullet

332
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,516
you were shot with?

333
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,586
Palpable carotid indicates
a systolic BP of at least 60

334
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,320
no muffled heart sounds.

335
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,089
But we've got diminished
breath sounds on the right.

336
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,691
‐ This guy needs a chest tube.
‐ Alright, 32 French.

337
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,093
‐ Let's move.
‐ Nine millimeter.

338
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,528
I think he was shot
with a nine millimeter.

339
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,196
Is that's one
of the semiautomatics?

340
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,131
'Uh, right, the entrance wound
is pretty typical'

341
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,566
but the exit wound
is a little bigger

342
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,002
because the bullet yards
through 90 degrees.

343
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,704
'Cavity's a little
larger than a 38 special.'

344
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,039
‐ Is that temporary cavitation?
‐ 'Oh, God, no.'

345
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,708
'You need an Ak‐47 for that.'

346
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,644
Nine millimeter's low velocity.
Only 1200 feet per second.

347
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:20,186
Listen, when we get in there,
just stand back, observe.

348
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,254
Don't do anything.

349
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,689
I don't know how
to do anything.

350
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,058
‐ So you've said.
‐ Wait. W‐why are we going here?

351
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,660
‐ They didn't page us.
‐ Henry.

352
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,462
When you hear there's a good
case you show up, try to help.

353
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,232
They always let you stay.
Just follow my lead, okay?

354
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,167
Horizontal mattress
with "O" silk.

355
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,368
Xeroform here.

356
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,270
And the velocity
with a 45 automatic is?

357
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,039
Oh, about 900
feet per second.

358
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,340
Doesn't deform or yaw.

359
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,342
How do you do?
I'm Miss Corday.

360
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,244
How do you do?
I'm John Carter.

361
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,713
This is my student,
George Henry.

362
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,615
What've we got?

363
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,317
Ah. You can see they just
put in a chest tube.

364
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,587
Probably a hemopneumothorax.

365
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,621
Carter, what are you
doing here?

366
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:57,323
Just wanted to help out.

367
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,760
'Less than 500cc's of blood.'

368
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,596
That means they won't have to do
an exploratory thoracotomy.

369
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,430
‐ We don't need you.
‐ Didn't page you.

370
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,699
Well, as long as I'm here
if there's something

371
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,500
that you do need‐‐

372
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,503
Carter, take a look around.
There are four doctors here.

373
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,705
‐ Well, yeah, I realize that‐‐
‐ We got it, John.

374
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:15,108
Why don't you check
with Dr. Greene.

375
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,309
Right.

376
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,248
Okay, Henry, I think
Dr. Greene probably needs us.

377
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,217
Your feet, ma'am.
Let me have your feet.

378
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,418
How much
did you drink, Ethyl?

379
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:30,223
I don't drink.
I had a good job.

380
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,759
Right. Oh, good timing, Carter.
Who's this?

381
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,360
This is Henry,
my med student.

382
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,429
Well, you get to start
with a good one, Henry.

383
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,365
Cops dropped off Ethyl Hayes,
found down in the park

384
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,768
but of course, she didn't have
a drop to drink.

385
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:45,438
‐ Have you, Ethyl?
‐ I don't drink.

386
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,041
Henry, teaching point,
she looks like a drunk

387
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,243
she smells like a drunk,
she is a drunk.

388
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,346
Connie, get a CBC,
chem seven, blood alcohol level

389
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,681
and a tox screen.

390
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:57,317
‐ W‐what do you want us to do?
‐ Carter?

391
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,552
Hydrate her with a banana bag

392
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,453
add folate,
mag sulfate and thiamine

393
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,656
and give her 50 of Librium
for her pending DT's.

394
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,124
Right.

395
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,759
Oh, and, uh, carter,
she's febrile

396
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,361
so, a gram
of Tylenol, rectally.

397
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,498
‐ R‐rectally?
‐ You heard him.

398
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,402
Glove up and dig in.

399
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,511
Why is it so hot in here?

400
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,312
Because it's so hot outside.

401
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,782
Isn't the
air conditioning working?

402
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,384
These new desk clerk candidates
are sweating like lil' piggies.

403
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,086
'Only two left.'

404
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,588
'Yeah, not counting the one
they're in with, now.'

405
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,690
‐ How were the others?
‐ Not a big hit.

406
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,825
Yeah, well, I didn't
put my money on you

407
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,460
when you were
interviewing for desk clerk.

408
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,262
‐ You bet on us?
‐ Sure.

409
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,230
‐ But you didn't bet on me?
‐ Nope.

410
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,568
'Mrs. Styman, you worked
at several other'

411
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,270
uh, Chicago area hospitals?

412
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:53,507
‐ Nine other hospitals.
‐ If that's what it says.

413
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,809
Why did you move
around so much? Just curious.

414
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,343
Did you ask them why?

415
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,412
No. We just
received your resume now.

416
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,582
Precision, that's why.

417
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,483
Their extraordinary
lack of precision.

418
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,185
‐ Precision?
‐ For example.

419
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,854
This interview
was scheduled for 12:15.

420
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:10,557
I arrived promptly at 12:10.

421
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,427
However, the interview didn't
actually start until 12:26.

422
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,230
11 minutes late.
Very imprecise.

423
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,566
Well, um, we've
been a little backed up.

424
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,634
I thought so.

425
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,403
Next question?

426
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,772
Estelle Webb, 79.
Fell down her stairs.

427
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:29,475
I didn't fall down.
Please, please, help me.

428
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,845
‐ What's open, Jerry?
‐ Uh, not much. Try curtain two.

429
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,880
Don't worry, Mrs. Webb I'm going
to take good care of you.

430
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,683
Well, thank you, dear.
Thank you.

431
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:41,321
Vitals are stable. BP's 130 over
70, pulse 88 regular, resps 16.

432
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,790
‐ Nice and easy.
‐ Oh, please don't!

433
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,159
‐ Oh, it hurts.
‐ Where does it hurt?

434
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,728
Please, don't let
her do it again.

435
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,596
‐ See you later.
‐ Okay, thanks.

436
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,164
Please, don't let
who do what?

437
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,367
My sister, she pushed
me down the stairs.

438
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,537
You just rest. We're going
to check everything out, okay?

439
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,542
‐ Ah, Dr. Corday.
‐ Dr. Benton.

440
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:04,344
We're going to be operating
today with Dr. Sam Breedlove.

441
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,780
Breedlove, invented the
Breedlove Retractor 1948?

442
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,683
Mm‐hmm. And he's getting
on someone in years.

443
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,251
Quite ancient by now,
I should think.

444
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,786
So I'll be doing
most of the teaching.

445
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,655
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

446
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,857
Listen, you might want
to pay a little more attention

447
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,692
in here than you did in
the trauma room, okay?

448
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,461
Well, I'll certainly bear
that in mind, Dr. Benton.

449
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,730
‐ Sam Breedlove.
‐ 'Elizabeth Corday.'

450
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,566
‐ 'How do you do?'
‐ Come again?

451
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,334
I said Elizabeth Corday.

452
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,604
I knew he was old, but I didn't
realize he was so short.

453
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,805
What did you say?

454
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,507
I said, "I knew you were old

455
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,941
but I didn't know
you were so short."

456
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,844
Yes, yes. Always have been.

457
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,483
Salmon Sperm, you say?

458
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,587
Yes. That's what I use
in my research as a carrier.

459
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,489
Obviously because
it's so easy to collect.

460
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,757
Obviously.

461
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,694
Is your student hell
as special as mine?

462
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,596
I drew the blood
of the chest pain down at four

463
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,397
and now, I'm just taking these
urine samples to the lab.

464
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,399
‐ Great.
‐ I guess not.

465
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,868
Carter, I've got
an LOL in curtain two

466
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:03,637
claims her sister pushed
her down the stairs.

467
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,439
I want to get a social worker
on it. She needs a full H and P.

468
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,774
Meet my student Henry.

469
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,710
No, no, I'm really not
very, uh, capable.

470
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,411
Take her history.

471
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,914
She doesn't have any
orifice‐type needs, does she?

472
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,916
Carter, the labs
on that lady they found

473
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,551
down in the park are back.

474
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,452
Uh, yeah, there's puking
in the air today.

475
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,921
I'm already on
my third scrub top.

476
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,723
Need to move some
patients here, doctors.

477
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:24,324
‐ We got a 70‐year‐old ALOC.
‐ Sure.

478
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,259
And a seven year old
in respiratory distress.

479
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,961
‐ 'Who do you want?'
‐ I'll take the 70. Thanks.

480
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,495
I guess I'll take the seven.

481
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:32,833
We don't really
need your resume.

482
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,735
We've got your
job application form.

483
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,704
Really. I know I have it here.
I just, I know I do.

484
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,742
If you want, you can bring it
back in a day or so.

485
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,043
Oh, no, please.
I know what that means.

486
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,978
I'd like to interview now.

487
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:49,349
Um, my name is Cynthia Hooper
and I'm originally from Joliet.

488
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,851
My whole family's there,
actually although

489
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,519
my parents have both passed on.

490
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,054
Oh, so you have
brothers and sisters?

491
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,822
No. I don't have
any brothers and sisters.

492
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,395
Why don't you tell us
about your job experience.

493
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:08,034
I mean, something that might
apply to, the job here.

494
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,804
Uh..

495
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,839
...well, I've always been
really good with people.

496
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,808
Uh, everyone's always
said that about me.

497
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,010
When I was the cashier
at the Ford Dealership

498
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:20,446
Service and Parts, I used to
talk to all the customers

499
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,516
while I was
processing their bills.

500
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,652
Is that what I'd be doing
here is handling the bills?

501
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:28,421
Uh, we have a separate
department for that.

502
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,756
Oh, okay.

503
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,660
‐ Um, well, I have other skills.
‐ Telemarketing?

504
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,897
Yes. I used to sell
vitamins over the phone.

505
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,065
Tha‐that's kind of in
the health field isn't it?

506
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,470
No, I guess
it's not really, is it?

507
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,942
Well, they didn't
even like me there.

508
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,111
I‐I, uh..

509
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:55,015
...well, I got fired because I
wouldn't sell the combo vitapak

510
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,950
to the old people that
we were supposed to call.

511
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,387
They didn't need
vitamins, I mean

512
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,756
it was just too late for them.

513
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,872
‐ How long has he been coughing?
‐ No entendemos.

514
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,842
‐ Just a slight fever, 100.3.
‐ I need a translator in here.

515
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,744
‐ I've called twice.
‐ Ayudelo, por favor, eh?

516
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:26,680
Probably bronchitis
but it might be pneumonia.

517
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,582
Get a CBC and a chest film.

518
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,416
Uh, how long?

519
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,085
Uh...uh..

520
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,587
...uh, cuantos dias?

521
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,657
Oh, casi...casi dos semanas.

522
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,424
Has he had his shots?

523
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:42,863
‐ Uh, shot, um, injecciones?
‐ 'Oh, si.'

524
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,577
Get me that translator.

525
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,680
Oh, the second
guy wasn't so bad.

526
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,515
No, except he
lied about his age

527
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,550
previous job experience and
where he went to high school.

528
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:04,785
He can do the job.

529
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,152
Mark, we need
to see more people.

530
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:07,688
None of the people
we've seen seem to fit in.

531
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,989
They don't
have to fit in.

532
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:10,456
All they have to do
is answer phones‐‐

533
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,192
Mark, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

534
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,694
Mark?

535
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,128
‐ Heather.
‐ Hi.

536
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,797
What happened?
Another water polo accident?

537
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,732
Yeah, but it's
just a bad sprain.

538
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,567
Looks like we're
twins, let me guess.

539
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,736
‐ Racquetball? Rollerblading?
‐ I wish.

540
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,470
You should have asked
for me when you came in.

541
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,707
I thought about it.
I have occasionally missed you.

542
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,975
So, um, how's your
busy social calendar?

543
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,777
Well, it's not as busy anymore.

544
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:33,213
‐ Yeah? Mine, too.
‐ Should I just go on?

545
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,181
Uh, I can see
you're busy now, so..

546
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,917
Well, I'm busy
with patients, but..

547
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,753
‐ I'll see ya.
‐ Right. Right.

548
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,722
So...who's my patient?

549
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,690
Laura Quentin,
fainted at the car wash.

550
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,058
‐ I don't want to stay here.
‐ Dr. Greene‐‐

551
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,060
Just a minute, Carter.

552
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,829
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

553
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,831
‐ You fainted?
‐ Yeah.

554
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,899
I think it was
probably just the heat.

555
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,768
Has it happened to you before?

556
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,770
No, never.

557
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:59,039
Um, you don't have to call
my parents or anything, do you?

558
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:00,941
‐ How old are you?
‐ I'm 18.

559
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:03,143
Nope, we don't have
to call your parents

560
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,178
but we do have
to run a few tests.

561
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,212
Okay.

562
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:08,081
Dr. Greene..

563
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,583
Ethyl Hayes is‐‐

564
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,786
Get a CBC, chem 20,
a serum glucose

565
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:16,489
orthostatics
and a pregnancy test.

566
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,791
Dr. Greene, Ethyl Hayes'
labs are back.

567
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,025
The tox screen was negative

568
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:21,695
blood alcohol level
was low, .05.

569
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:22,896
Buff her up.
Let her sleep it off.

570
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,197
Yeah, she's still
slurring a lot

571
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,032
especially for
that low of a BA level.

572
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,534
Well, maybe she
wants a free meal.

573
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:28,769
I'd like to run
a few more tests.

574
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,971
Carter, we get six
or seven of these a day.

575
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:32,973
We can't save
them all, okay?

576
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,808
So give her some jell‐o,
let her sleep it off

577
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:35,909
and move her out.

578
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,148
What if the cords are swollen
from prolonged intubation?

579
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:44,551
We're standing by
with vaponefrin.

580
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,687
What about apnea
from brain damage?

581
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,254
His ultrasound
was normal.

582
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,857
He's doing really
well, Dr. Benton.

583
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:54,961
And already up
to four pounds, 10 ounces.

584
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,598
You can hold him if you want.

585
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,735
Yeah, sure.

586
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,069
Go ahead, grab him.

587
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,707
Oh, here we go.

588
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:11,578
Oh, that's my little one.

589
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,580
You doing better now?

590
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:14,648
Huh?

591
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,750
Look, he's smiling.

592
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,228
How can you not know where
he is? He's your student.

593
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,963
‐ He keeps disappearing.
‐ I can't believe he did this.

594
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,665
I mean, he said he wasn't
very capable, but please.

595
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,600
I've come to take
him at his word.

596
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:35,201
Jerry, has that social worker
called back yet on Mrs. Webb?

597
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:36,603
Mrs. Who?

598
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:37,804
The woman who was pushed
down her stairs.

599
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:38,939
Nope, not yet.

600
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,574
Henry.

601
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:49,349
My, uh, throat's
a little scratchy.

602
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,051
This is the history
you took on Mrs. Webb?

603
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:52,853
‐ Yes, I wrote everything down.
‐ That's the problem.

604
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,621
You documented
almost 20 complaints.

605
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,322
Back pain,
earache, constipation

606
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:58,358
bumpiness in her head, I don't
even know what that means.

607
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,993
‐ No, neither did I.
‐ Listen..

608
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,327
You can, you can listen
to multiple complaints

609
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:02,729
without having
to chart them all.

610
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:04,064
Yeah, well, now
that you wrote them down

611
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:05,231
we have to check
them all out.

612
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:06,767
Just a moment, Mrs. Webb.

613
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,368
Good rule of thumb, if a
patients lists more than

614
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,371
three complaints, odds are that
there's nothing wrong with them.

615
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,674
‐ No, but I wrote them all down.
‐ I'll be right there.

616
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,075
This poor woman will
be stuck here the whole night

617
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:16,710
having tests she
probably doesn't need.

618
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,011
Th‐th‐this doesn't mean
that I have

619
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,813
to stay here the whole
night, does it?

620
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,983
‐ Very thorough.
‐ Yes, he is very thorough.

621
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,851
Social worker
will be here soon.

622
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,720
Oh, I can't come
back to my sister.

623
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,021
No, they're gonna
try very hard to find

624
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,657
a new place
for you to stay, okay?

625
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:33,627
You want to smother me
with that pillow, don't you?

626
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,996
She tried that once before, too.

627
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,130
Oh, Mrs. Webb.

628
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,304
How are you doing?

629
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:45,371
I'm okay.

630
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:47,107
Your labs came back.

631
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,709
You're dehydrated.

632
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:51,011
Have you had the flu
or been vomiting?

633
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,112
Uh‐uh.

634
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,081
Is there something
else going on

635
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,851
that you haven't
mentioned to us?

636
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:58,952
Uh‐uh.

637
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:08,795
I'm just going to take
one more quick look, okay?

638
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,130
Can you open up for me?

639
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,771
Laura, has your
dentist mentioned

640
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,773
the enamel on your teeth?

641
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,241
I hate dentist.

642
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:24,044
Yeah, me too.

643
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,846
I don't think
he's bipolar or schizophrenic

644
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:27,080
but I can't figure him out.

645
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:29,082
‐ Hmm.
‐ Sure never seen this in a kid.

646
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,151
I'm waiting on the CT, but I
thought you could take a look.

647
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:32,252
Sure.

648
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:33,419
This guy thinks
I'm Sidney Poitier

649
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,255
in "Lilies Of The Field."

650
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:37,057
'See, see, see.'

651
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,291
If you're wearing
a white coat

652
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,961
then you must be
the, uh, butcher.

653
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:43,196
No, that's not right,
not if you're the pharmacist.

654
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,431
‐ Am I here to pick something..
‐ Um, 70 years old.

655
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:46,900
Picked up
wandering the street.

656
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,935
‐ BA, and tox screen?
‐ 'Negative.'

657
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:52,072
He's confabulating and has
complete short‐term memory loss.

658
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:54,708
Has no idea who I am every
time I walk in the room.

659
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,142
I wore it to a wedding.

660
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,212
Oh, cook! Ooh, I hope
they have lima beans.

661
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:02,015
Hey, Oliver,
I'm Dr. Del Amico remember?

662
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,350
And this is
Dr. Carter and Mr. Henry

663
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:05,752
'and you're here
in the hospital.'

664
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,487
I'm in a hospital?

665
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,355
Well, okay, if you say so.

666
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:11,191
Like Jimmy Stewart
was in "Harvey," huh?

667
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:12,325
You feeling okay, Oliver?

668
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,194
Sure, sure. I feel fine.

669
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:16,162
Hey, we'll be back in
a little bit okay, Oliver?

670
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,398
Okay, okay.
Lima beans.

671
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:24,004
I think you're right
about the psych consult..

672
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:25,806
...but I would
call them down anyway.

673
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,140
Yeah, I thought
I'd wait on the CT.

674
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,174
See if it reveals anything.

675
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,409
‐ It will.
‐ Henry.

676
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:30,844
Probably show
a small lesion in

677
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,312
the area
of the mammillary bodies

678
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:34,748
and the dorsal medial
nucleus of the thalamus

679
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:37,383
otherwise known as
the mammillothalamic tract.

680
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,419
It's generally associated
with Korsakoff's Syndrome

681
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:42,155
which causes retrograde
and anterograde amnesia

682
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:43,924
thus accounting for
the short‐term memory loss

683
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:46,259
and the confabulation.

684
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,961
Thank God you showed up,
I could have gone

685
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:49,129
a lifetime without a translator.

686
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,463
Can I put in
for extra pay?

687
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:53,233
Yeah. Just run it
by Kerry Weaver.

688
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:55,001
Buenos tardes.
Soy Chuny Marquez.

689
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:57,003
Estoy aqui para ayudarle
a ustedes y al doctor.

690
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,505
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Trujillo

691
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,208
uh, Jesus' x‐rays didn't
show anything specific..

692
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,077
los rayos x no
indican nada specifico.

693
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,947
‐ Probably has bronchitis.
‐ Tal vez sea bronquitis.

694
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,552
‐ Is he gonna be okay?
‐ Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

695
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,986
Uh, we're just giving
him some antibiotics.

696
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,888
and we're gonna
check up on him..

697
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,860
‐ Gracias.
‐ Okay?

698
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:21,394
Mrs. Webb,
this is Thomas Anders.

699
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,464
‐ Department of social services.
‐ Oh. Where is he taking me?

700
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:26,800
'Thought we could talk a little
on your way to radiology.'

701
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,903
‐ Back to x‐ray?
‐ No. Ultrasound this time.

702
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:33,006
Ooh, wait. My glasses. Ah.

703
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,340
‐ Here you go.
‐ Thank you.

704
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:37,377
And we've been trying to
track down your sister.

705
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,579
Ooh, no, please.

706
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:40,280
It's going
to be okay, Mrs. Webb.

707
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,983
Jeanie, my slippers,
those slippers you gave me.

708
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:44,217
Well, I don't see them.

709
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,087
Maybe they're
under the bed.

710
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,823
Jeanie, please don't let
them send me back there again.

711
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,925
‐ Okay, I know. I know.
‐ Please, don't let them.

712
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,193
They can't do it.

713
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:56,229
Let's just get these
slippers on here, okay?

714
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,463
There we go, one more.

715
00:29:57,497 --> 00:29:58,999
Jeanie, please..

716
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:01,334
Okay, go ahead.

717
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:04,237
Carol Hathaway filled me in
on the desk clerk interviews.

718
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,206
Yeah, a bunch of crackpots
but we'll break one in.

719
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:08,308
Well, she felt maybe you
should see some more candidates.

720
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,843
I don't.
Carter.

721
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,244
As long as you feel
confident with that.

722
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:13,479
‐ Where are you taking her?
‐ Uh, MRI.

723
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,315
‐ She's a drunk.
‐ Yeah, I just want to be sure.

724
00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:17,884
I already did an LP,
And I just think I need an MRI..

725
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:20,153
‐ Carter‐‐
‐ I ran everything by Dr. Doyle.

726
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,455
She agreed.

727
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,558
Well, at least, let your
student handle the transport.

728
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:26,292
Henry is collecting
stool samples

729
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,961
on three abdominal pains.

730
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,462
Jerry, could you do me
a favor page Henry again?

731
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,431
‐ I already did twice.
‐ Again.

732
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,601
Mark.

733
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,336
I just checked in
on Laura Quentin.

734
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:37,638
Yeah, I saw her labs.

735
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,439
Urine specific gravity's low

736
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:41,975
she's mildly hypokalemic.
She probably got the flu.

737
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,009
Actually, she's bulimic.

738
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:44,611
I checked her teeth.

739
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:46,980
The enamel's eroded which is
consistent with the vomiting

740
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,915
and she hasn't had
her period in six months.

741
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:51,217
Took a lot to get it out of her
but she finally admitted to it.

742
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,919
Let's re‐hydrate her.

743
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:55,488
Two liters of normal
saline and turf her to psych.

744
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:56,990
She doesn't want
to go to psych.

745
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,892
She doesn't want
her parents to know.

746
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,961
I called the eating disorders
clinic, but

747
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:02,328
the next available appointment's
not for seven weeks.

748
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,030
Well, there's not
a lot we can do.

749
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:05,566
Well, I thought maybe
you could talk to her.

750
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,333
Doesn't sound like
it's going to do much good.

751
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,535
Well, can't hurt to try.

752
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:11,037
Look, I got a lot
of patients, Carol.

753
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:12,372
Come on, Mark.

754
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:14,274
‐ She might listen to you.
‐ We're an ER.

755
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:15,942
We don't manage
chronic problems.

756
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:18,344
Her condition
is chronic, not acute.

757
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:19,580
Oh, if you have concerns

758
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:21,381
about other
desk clerk candidates.

759
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:24,017
Run them by me first
before you go to Kerry Weaver.

760
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,023
Henry was right.

761
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,358
‐ There it is.
‐ That's the lesion?

762
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,394
‐ It's large.
‐ Yeah.

763
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:36,229
Come on, Chasity, you're
about to get your first taste

764
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:37,964
of giving the bad news.

765
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:44,137
Oh, hi. Well you see, uh,
I don't need a haircut.

766
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,972
Well, you're not
the barber, are you?

767
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:49,075
Oliver, I'm Dr. Del Amico
and you're in a hospital.

768
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:52,478
Yeah, well, whatever you say
is fine but I feel just great

769
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:55,148
uh, just like Jimmy Stewart
was in, uh, "Harvey."

770
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:58,418
Oliver, listen...I need you
to listen to me for a minute.

771
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:01,221
We took a picture of your
brain and, unfortunately

772
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,089
you have a tumor
on the right side.

773
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:06,059
You...you look
like Carole Lombard.

774
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,361
‐ She had a brain tumor.
‐ Oliver, it's very serious.

775
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,330
Serious?

776
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:14,300
Are you saying I'm gonna die?

777
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,637
Uh, the people upstairs
in surgery are going to do

778
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,072
everything they can
but we can't be sure.

779
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:23,376
Oh...I'm going to die?

780
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,278
'I'm going to die.'

781
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:28,048
Oh...God!

782
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,586
'Oh...God.'

783
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:43,396
Henry, what the hell
are you doing up here?

784
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,699
You're supposed to be
on your ER rotation.

785
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:47,568
If I don't load
the sequencing gel now

786
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,570
it could ruin
the whole experiment.

787
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,538
Doesn't your ER rotation
mean anything to you?

788
00:32:51,572 --> 00:32:53,306
You mean beyond
it's being a requirement?

789
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:57,310
Alright,
what's all this stuff?

790
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:58,645
This is a plasmid control

791
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,382
with ten micrograms
of Salmon Sperm carrier.

792
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,117
Would you like
to see my linkage map?

793
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,420
Wait, wait,
don't‐don't‐don't touch this.

794
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,556
This is‐this is
ethidium bromide.

795
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,159
It can, uh, slip between
your DNA, cause a mutation.

796
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:17,598
No, no, eh‐eh..

797
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:19,399
...don't, don't
touch the eppendorf.

798
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,173
Hey, did you feed him yet?

799
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:28,775
I got stuck in the OR.

800
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,545
No, Tabash says I can't
try until this evening.

801
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:34,515
Good. I thought I was
going to miss the first time.

802
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:37,183
Listen, um, I'm on tonight.

803
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,786
Page me and I'll
come straight up.

804
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,623
‐ How's he doing?
‐ He's doing great.

805
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,658
But they're asking for a name.

806
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,793
We gotta get this birth
certificate straightened out.

807
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:49,295
Yeah, I guess we have
put it off a bit, huh?

808
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,164
"We?"

809
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,267
I had no idea you
could be so superstitious.

810
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,304
‐ Yeah...neither did I.
‐ So, what are we going to do?

811
00:33:58,338 --> 00:33:59,472
Are we going
to flip a coin?

812
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:01,207
Reese or Benton?

813
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:04,244
Carla...we talked about it

814
00:34:04,277 --> 00:34:05,812
and we said it was
going to be "Benton."

815
00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:08,615
It's easier
for the insurance.

816
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:10,350
We already talked about
it, but we definitely

817
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:11,752
did not agree on it, Peter

818
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:14,220
And that insurance
reason is an excuse.

819
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:17,257
You know you just want your boy
to have his daddy's last name.

820
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,692
So what's wrong with that?

821
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,627
What's wrong with him
having his mama's name?

822
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,696
I'm the one that's going to get
up in the middle of the night.

823
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:26,432
Feed him, change him,
rock him back to sleep.

824
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:28,134
Carla, I can do that, too.

825
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:30,671
So you're just going
to move into my apartment now?

826
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:32,539
Look, I know we
haven't talked about it..

827
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,240
No, we haven't because
you kept acting like

828
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:36,677
this day was
never going to come.

829
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,613
He needs a family.

830
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:44,284
‐ Is that what you think we are?
‐ Look, I mean, you know..

831
00:34:44,317 --> 00:34:46,520
We don't have
to formalize things.

832
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:52,759
If there wasn't
a baby in the picture

833
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:54,795
would you see
the two of us as a family?

834
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:05,305
It's okay, Peter.

835
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:06,540
I don't, either.

836
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:23,356
22‐year‐old female,
GSW to the left upper chest.

837
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:24,891
Two IV's of saline in the field,

838
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:27,227
BP 100 over 60, pulse 110.

839
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,829
O2, 15 liters by mask.

840
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:31,832
‐ Hey, hey, hey, look out.
‐ Who is that guy?

841
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:33,867
They're checking
for radioactivity.

842
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,468
God, I love this job.

843
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,503
Okay, let's go.

844
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:41,508
'One, two, three..'

845
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:44,344
‐ I'll get her clothes off.
‐ What have we got?

846
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:46,680
‐ Gunshot wound to the chest.
‐ Two in one day?

847
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:48,381
Honey, you haven't been
here very long, have you?

848
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:50,483
‐ I can run it.
‐ Why don't I have a go at it?

849
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:55,188
Right. The usual investigations.

850
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,724
FBC, electrolytes, type
and cross match four units

851
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,192
and a portable
radiograph of the chest.

852
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,294
‐ FBC?
‐ Full blood count.

853
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,797
Run in a liter of saline
and a gram of cephalexin.

854
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,366
The trachea is midline,
no jugular venous distention.

855
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,869
Strong radial pulse,
subclavian's intact.

856
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:11,304
Pulse ox is 92
on 15 liters.

857
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,839
BP's 95 palp.

858
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:13,940
Diminished breath
sounds on the left.

859
00:36:13,974 --> 00:36:15,375
She'll need a tube thoracostomy.

860
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:16,710
‐ A what?
‐ Chest tube.

861
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:19,880
Dr. Weaver,
could you intubate, please?

862
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:22,716
Number eight ET
tube and suction.

863
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:25,485
And I wonder if everyone
might slow down just a bit.

864
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,353
I think things will
run much more smoothly

865
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:29,255
if we have a little
more peace and quiet.

866
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:31,925
Has anyone bleeped Dr. Benton?

867
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,794
Oh, I like that one,
"Bleeping Benton."

868
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:35,962
Well, perhaps somebody
could just ring him up now.

869
00:36:35,996 --> 00:36:37,397
Page, right?

870
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,965
‐ Let's page Benton?
‐ 'I got it.'

871
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:40,000
One percent lidocaine.

872
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,201
Alright, I'll get it.

873
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:46,873
Okay...I'm in.
Let's bag her.

874
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:48,842
We're out, I'm going
to go get some from supply.

875
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,849
Es mi hijo.
Por favor ayudenos.

876
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:58,318
‐ Es mi hijo.
‐ Connie, get the lidocaine.

877
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,554
‐ Es mi hijo. Por favor.
‐ Anna, we need your help.

878
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:02,388
'Esta sangrando.'

879
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:04,457
Esta sufriendo, por favor!

880
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,561
‐ What is it? What happened?
‐ Por favor, miren.

881
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,896
‐ He's stopped breathing.
‐ Agarenlo!

882
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,832
Pedes laryngoscope
and a number six ET tube.

883
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:13,399
Chasity, get ready to bag him.

884
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:15,268
El doctor dijo
que era bronquitis.

885
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:19,305
‐ Bronquitis, no lo pienso.
‐ Ay, no, por favor, no!

886
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:20,541
What happened?

887
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,543
Dr. Corday just
stabilized your patient.

888
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,377
GSW to the left upper chest.

889
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,979
Came in with a
pressure of 100 over 60.

890
00:37:26,012 --> 00:37:27,648
Received two liters
of crystalloid.

891
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:30,784
Spun hematocrit is 34,
gave a gram of cephalexin.

892
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:34,287
Placed a left thoracostomy tube
with 300cc's of blood.

893
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,489
Missed the great
vessels...lucky girl.

894
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:38,859
So I guess you
were paying attention.

895
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:40,293
Always.

896
00:37:45,398 --> 00:37:47,601
‐ Her sister died in 1984?
‐ That's right.

897
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,736
So obviously her sister did
not push her down the stairs.

898
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,404
‐ Not recently.
‐ I'll kill her.

899
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:52,773
You can't kill her,
she's a borderline.

900
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:55,041
You can never get
rid of borderlines.

901
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:57,678
Randi, call psych
for me, I need a consult.

902
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:59,312
They won't admit her.

903
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:00,947
Not until medicine's
completed her evaluation.

904
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:02,583
I'm still waiting
on eight tests.

905
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:04,751
You know what I've done
for this woman today?

906
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,787
She claims you tried to
suffocate her with the pillow.

907
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,988
She what?

908
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:09,923
Gratitude.

909
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:12,358
Have you seen Dr. Carter?
He keeps paging me.

910
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:14,961
Oh, Henry, come with me, you're
about to do some baby‐sitting.

911
00:38:14,995 --> 00:38:16,029
Come on.

912
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,367
'Hi, Mrs. Webb..'

913
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,608
I asked if the boy
had had his shots.

914
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,409
They didn't realize
you meant vaccines.

915
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:31,044
They thought you meant
had he ever had any shots.

916
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:32,713
I didn't think
of whooping cough.

917
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:33,747
It presents a lot
like bronchitis.

918
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,948
I've missed it myself.

919
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:36,416
Well, thanks for
stepping in. Thank you.

920
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,450
‐ Oh, God.
‐ What?

921
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,586
Excuse me.
Malik..

922
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,121
He was supposed to be
up in neurology an hour ago.

923
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:42,422
Yeah, we're on our way up.

924
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:43,990
Dr. Weaver needed
some labs, stat.

925
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,859
Well, get him up
there now, please.

926
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:48,662
Well, hi there, you're the
ice cream person, aren't you?

927
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:50,496
You don't want to
spill on that coat.

928
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,432
No, no, you're
the pharmacist.

929
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:53,967
See, I already
have my toothpaste.

930
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,002
Hey, Oliver, do you remember
you're in the hospital?

931
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:57,871
Hospital?

932
00:38:57,904 --> 00:38:59,105
Is something wrong with me?

933
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,377
'Dr. Greene..'

934
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,046
...I just need you to
sign a chart for me.

935
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,048
It's for that woman with
slurred speech, Ethyl Hayes.

936
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,450
Oh, did she finally dry out?

937
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:12,886
Not exactly,
LP showed pleocytosis

938
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,555
and elevated
gamma globulins.

939
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:16,890
MRI confirmed she has
multiple sclerosis.

940
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:19,159
Did you order
a neurology consult?

941
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,762
‐ Yes.
‐ Good.

942
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:26,767
Hey...I am now officially
having a bad day.

943
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,071
The one non‐puking kid I had
almost died of whooping cough.

944
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:33,173
‐ Well, I'm ready for a drink.
‐ You want to join me?

945
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:35,441
Uh, I can't.
What's your bad day?

946
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:37,143
Remember Chris Law?

947
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,979
Oh, yeah, the, um,
his brother died.

948
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:40,847
‐ The basketball player, right?
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

949
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:43,116
Well, that's what the process
server was about this morning.

950
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:46,987
He and his family are slapping
me with a malpractice suit.

951
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,955
It's a great world, huh?

952
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:51,925
First, he beats me up,
and then, he sues me.

953
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,694
Chris Law didn't
beat you up, did he?

954
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,429
The police said
he had an airtight alibi.

955
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:59,065
Ah. That's what
the police said.

956
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,734
But you don't believe them, huh?

957
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:04,638
I don't know.

958
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:12,579
So, what happened
with your amnesia patient?

959
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:15,048
Mm. He kept forgetting
he was dying.

960
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:16,583
I had to tell him
five different times.

961
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,084
Hmmm.

962
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:21,888
And after all that, they
give us this humiliation.

963
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,690
Wow, a paycheck.

964
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:24,825
Alleged paycheck.

965
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:26,560
So small,
the rich kids at CHOP

966
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,194
would blow the whole thing
on poker the first night.

967
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:31,131
‐ Didn't think I'd even care.
‐ About getting a paycheck?

968
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,466
Hm? Uh, no, no,
I just meant that, uh..

969
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:34,835
I didn't think the money
was gonna make that

970
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:36,069
that much
of a difference.

971
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:38,972
Well, it won't...
after I pay my landlord

972
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:41,942
the med school bills,
my phone bill, the gas bill.

973
00:40:41,975 --> 00:40:43,777
That should leave
me about four bucks.

974
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,247
Oh, yeah. Me, too, uh..

975
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,849
‐ See ya.
‐ See ya.

976
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,587
‐ Hey, Dr. Weaver.
‐ John.

977
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,756
I know I said that
I didn't need to be paid

978
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,124
but it sure feels good, and I
just want to say thank you.

979
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:00,594
Yeah, I'd hoped to catch you
before you actually got it

980
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:03,163
but I need to have you endorse
your check back over to County.

981
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,665
What?

982
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,032
Apparently, to cover
disability and malpractice

983
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:07,233
they issue one
every week and then

984
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:08,569
you sign it back over to us.

985
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:09,703
Endorse it back over to County?

986
00:41:09,736 --> 00:41:11,605
‐ Right.
‐ Every week?

987
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,106
That's what we agreed, right?

988
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,176
You didn't
need to be paid?

989
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,615
Right.

990
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:24,718
Alright, thank you.

991
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:27,187
Yep...pen.

992
00:41:33,193 --> 00:41:35,128
Been up to any
of the labs recently?

993
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,296
Why do you ask?

994
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,864
‐ Give me your shoes.
‐ What?

995
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:40,601
I said get me your shoes,
they're radioactive.

996
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:42,235
You know how much
these things cost?

997
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:44,004
‐ Did he say radioactive?
‐ Carter, give him your shoes.

998
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:45,205
‐ I won't.
‐ Yes, you will.

999
00:41:57,884 --> 00:41:59,886
Hey.

1000
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,656
‐ He's really doing it, huh?
‐ Oh, yeah.

1001
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:05,926
This boy is really doing it.

1002
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:07,994
Only lasts a couple
of minutes, though.

1003
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,563
Then he gets really tired.

1004
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:20,674
Listen, um..

1005
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,976
I thought about
what we talked about and, uh..

1006
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:27,614
I don't have any more
claim on his name than you do.

1007
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:30,751
I'd be happy
with the name Reese.

1008
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,219
I would.

1009
00:42:33,253 --> 00:42:35,656
Well...I thought
about it, too, Peter

1010
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:38,859
and, uh, I'd be
okay with Benton.

1011
00:42:42,295 --> 00:42:45,131
So, why don't we name him..

1012
00:42:46,332 --> 00:42:48,068
Reese Benton?

1013
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:53,840
‐ Reese Benton.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1014
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:58,078
Sounds a little formal but, uh..

1015
00:42:58,111 --> 00:42:59,646
...we'll get used to it.

1016
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:04,317
Reese Benton.

1017
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,819
Reese..

1018
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,154
Yeah.

1019
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:09,656
Yeah, we will.

1020
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:28,561
'Dr. Greene.'

1021
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:30,868
Hi. Um, I'm sorry
to bother you.

1022
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:33,238
‐ Do you remember me? I..
‐ You're, uh..

1023
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:34,905
‐ Cynthia Hooper.
‐ Yeah, right.

1024
00:43:34,939 --> 00:43:36,574
You've been hanging
out here all day?

1025
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:39,844
No. Well, I sat
over at the diner.

1026
00:43:39,877 --> 00:43:41,679
Look, I know I'm out
of contention for the job

1027
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:43,714
but I just really
wanted to apologize

1028
00:43:43,748 --> 00:43:45,183
for how I was
in the interview.

1029
00:43:45,216 --> 00:43:46,717
I‐I just get so nervous

1030
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:48,686
and I never say
the right thing, and..

1031
00:43:49,787 --> 00:43:51,256
It happens to all of us.

1032
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:53,558
Yeah, well, at least I
didn't throw up in there

1033
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,460
which I actually have
done in an interview.

1034
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:57,262
That probably hurt
the interview.

1035
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:02,633
Is this your
first time in Chicago?

1036
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:04,435
Yeah. Thanks.

1037
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:09,340
I've only been
here for six days

1038
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:11,842
but, um, I'm actually
starting to figure it out.

1039
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:13,811
The lake is..

1040
00:44:13,844 --> 00:44:15,580
‐ That way.
‐ That way.

1041
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:16,681
Right.

1042
00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:24,822
I'm glad you stopped by
'cause I didn't have a chance

1043
00:44:24,855 --> 00:44:27,425
to make any phone calls
yet and so I can just

1044
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,959
tell you that you got the job.

1045
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:32,430
What?

1046
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:33,898
Oh, you're kidding, right?

1047
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:36,601
No, no. It's yours
if you want it.

1048
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:38,603
Of course I want it. I‐I‐I..

1049
00:44:38,636 --> 00:44:40,305
Are you sure
you're not kidding?

1050
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:42,573
You can start next week.

1051
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:43,574
Oh, my God.

1052
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:46,477
I don't know what to say.

1053
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:47,645
Thank you.

1054
00:44:47,678 --> 00:44:48,779
You're welcome

1055
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:50,481
‐ Goodnight.
‐ Goodnight.

1056
00:44:58,756 --> 00:45:00,691
‐ Are they closed?
‐ Closed.

1057
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:04,562
‐ Keep them closed.
‐ I said they're closed.

1058
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:08,499
Okay.

1059
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:09,767
Open them.

1060
00:45:11,502 --> 00:45:12,903
Alright.

1061
00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:16,441
That was very
delicate, Doug.

1062
00:45:16,474 --> 00:45:18,043
What the?

1063
00:45:18,076 --> 00:45:19,977
Well, that's a drawer.

1064
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:22,680
You know what?

1065
00:45:22,713 --> 00:45:24,949
‐ I love this drawer.
‐ Good.

1066
00:45:24,982 --> 00:45:26,251
Come here, you.

1067
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:29,354
Come here.

1068
00:45:35,093 --> 00:45:37,895
You know what? I love sitting
out here on the porch with you.

1069
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:40,498
It's..

1070
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:41,832
Something new.

1071
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:44,302
Something new.

1072
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:49,440
Nice drawer.

1073
00:45:49,474 --> 00:45:50,975
It's a good touch,
don't you think?
