1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,307
Previously on "ER".

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,575
They got you on oxygen?

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,578
I need help
living my life, Mark

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,379
you'll be
the first person I call.

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,782
I mean, he did
every crappy assignment

6
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,251
that the navy wanted him to do.

7
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,053
It didn't matter.

8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,487
He never got the nod.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,256
You wanna talk
about this later?

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,125
No, I didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable. I was just‐‐

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,593
You didn't make me
feel uncomfortable.

12
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,329
Your father loves you
very much, Mark.

13
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,534
He may not show it in the way
that you want him to

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,035
'but he does.'

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,211
'Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to San Diego.'

16
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,847
'Please remain seated
until the aircraft'

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,149
'has come to a full
and complete stop.'

18
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,720
'Flight 89
from Chicago has arrived.'

19
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,790
'We apologize for the delay
and we will begin boarding'

20
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,392
'for continuation
in just a few minutes.'

21
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,681
Mark?

22
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,382
Dad, I told you
I was gonna rent a car.

23
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,551
Your mother
appreciates you coming.

24
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,820
Wishes she could have
called you herself.

25
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,556
‐ They get her knee wired?
‐ And put in a cast.

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,791
I've been warning her
for years not to use

27
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,659
that footstool
like a stepladder.

28
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,260
Were you there?

29
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,229
I was out in the garage.

30
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,898
I don't have any bags.
We can go.

31
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,867
We've got to wait for the next
flight. Your friend's coming.

32
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,837
She tried to catch up with you
at O'Hare, but she missed you.

33
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,171
What friend?

34
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,307
Surprise!

35
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,612
Hi, Mark.

36
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,779
Hi.

37
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,649
Mm.

38
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,784
‐ Dad, this is Cynthia Hooper.
‐ Hi.

39
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,152
I hope you weren't
just being polite

40
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,186
on the phone, Captain Green.

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,522
I, I didn't want to barge in

42
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,356
but sounded like
you had your hands full

43
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,791
and I just really
wanted to help out.

44
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,326
That's nice of you.

45
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,393
‐ Here, let me take that.
‐ Oh, thanks.

46
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,862
I got it. I got it.

47
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,496
‐ How was your flight?
‐ It was great.

48
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,765
Especially the landing.

49
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,867
I've never seen
the Pacific before, so.

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,268
Do you have luggage?

51
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,337
Uh, I think
I packed too much.

52
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,675
You look like your dad.

53
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,712
'I can't believe
they lost my bags.'

54
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,548
'It's pretty late, but your mom
will be disappointed'

55
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:28,782
'if you don't stop by.'

56
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,216
'New hospital looks nice.'

57
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,953
'Best facility in the country.'

58
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,688
'I knew I couldn't
let you do this alone.'

59
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,922
That's sweet.
It's just, you know.

60
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,223
What about your shifts?

61
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,692
I left a message
for Kerry Weaver.

62
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,360
I mean, Mark, this is family.

63
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,362
I mean, I know
it's your family, but..

64
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,465
Mrs. Greene.
please, Mrs. Greene.

65
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,800
Be careful, please, Mrs. Greene.

66
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,869
No, don't make me stop.
No, no, no.

67
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,971
I thought sailors loved
the cancan.

68
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,373
‐ Hi, mom.
‐ Oh, there you are!

69
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,975
Oh, I'm so glad!

70
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,310
‐ You okay?
‐ Oh, look what I did.

71
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,514
‐ I'm so mad at myself.
‐ Yeah, well, accidents happen.

72
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:05,318
All I can do is cancan, and the
corpsman says I can't cancan.

73
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,953
Cancan. Cancan.

74
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,454
What meds is she on?

75
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,524
‐ Uh, morphine and benzo.
‐ Ativan?

76
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,858
Yeah, Dr. Sayers
has started tapering her off.

77
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,527
Dr. Sayers?
Is that her orthopod?

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,961
He's the neurology consult.

79
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,663
Why does she have a neurologist?

80
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,998
You don't mind me filling
in your son, do you?

81
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,602
A mother has to have
some secrets, right?

82
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,670
‐ Could you get him for me?
‐ I can see if he's on call.

83
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,273
‐ Hello.
‐ Hi.

84
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,575
Mom, this is Cynthia Hooper.

85
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,276
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Greene.

86
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,612
You're not getting
married again?

87
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,779
No, we're not, uh, thinking

88
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,582
about that now.

89
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,552
‐ At least she's not a sourpuss.
‐ I hope not.

90
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,722
His first wife
had a real sour streak.

91
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,590
Mark, you know,
as much as I hate to say it

92
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,659
I'm afraid Rachel's got it, too.

93
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,829
You can, uh,
visit more tomorrow.

94
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,396
Yeah, we‐we gotta
say goodnight, mom.

95
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,432
Okay, baby, night‐night.
Sweet dreams.

96
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,934
‐ I love you.
‐ Love you, too.

97
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,669
‐ Bye. Nice meeting you.
‐ We'll see you tomorrow.

98
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,604
'Goodnight. Buh‐bye.'

99
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,373
‐ Goodnight, Mrs. Greene.
‐ Bye‐bye, sweetheart.

100
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,776
Ahem, I wanna
speak with Dr. Sayers

101
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,344
whether he's on call or not.

102
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,512
Your mother's heavily medicated.

103
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,280
That's not my mother.

104
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,735
Could she have hit
her head when she fell?

105
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,638
Mark, for the fifth time,
I have no idea.

106
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,039
She didn't mention it.

107
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,341
Maybe something
slid off the shelf and hit her.

108
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,743
Dr. Sayers says that was normal.

109
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,377
I disagree.

110
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,079
Looks like
a little low density to me.

111
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,815
What would that mean?

112
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,950
She wasn't acting
like this before?

113
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,719
You mean
being emotional and all?

114
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,354
No, I mean being completely
loony and out of control.

115
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,123
Mark, she wasn't that bad.

116
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,592
It's the morphine.
That's what Dr. Sayers said.

117
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,427
It's just with her history of
high blood pressure

118
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,762
I don't wanna take any chances.

119
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,430
Excuse me, Dr. Greene.

120
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,466
I have Dr. Sayers for you.

121
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,870
Dr. Sayers
is a straight shooter.

122
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,404
I respect the man.

123
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,907
Your mother's getting
first‐rate care.

124
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,876
They owe her that.

125
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,549
Don't you worry about this.

126
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,517
'Mark is gonna get
to the bottom of it.'

127
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,889
No, it doesn't
look like artifact to me.

128
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,626
'That's not good enough.'

129
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,863
I want the MRI done
tomorrow morning first thing.

130
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,931
'What a nice quiet
neighborhood you live in.'

131
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,567
You got beer in the house?

132
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,435
Look, you may find
a couple in the garage.

133
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,771
Uh, may I please
use your bathroom?

134
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,973
My eyeballs are
about ready to float.

135
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,508
Yes, ma'am.
Right through there.

136
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,776
Why doesn't anybody
say that anymore?

137
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,110
Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am.

138
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,912
It makes you feel better
about people

139
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,980
just hearing it.

140
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,081
Yes, ma'am, it does.

141
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,535
'Oh, I feel so much better.
Thanks for the shampoo.'

142
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,677
Is this too weird?

143
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,580
No. Me in my old bed.

144
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,716
You in my mom's bathrobe.

145
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,619
'It's not weird at all.'

146
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:02,222
‐ I can take it off.
‐ No, that's alright.

147
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,490
Do you think your dad minds
that I'm here?

148
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,727
‐ I think he likes me.
‐ Of course, he likes you.

149
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,663
What's not to like?

150
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,666
He's really beating himself up
over your mom.

151
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,635
That would be a first.

152
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,971
I'm sorry, it's just
being here brings out

153
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,040
the adolescent in me.

154
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,944
Flip over.
I'll do your back.

155
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,122
'So this was your bed
growing up?'

156
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,158
From age eight.

157
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,862
We moved it from, uh,
Jacksonville to Norfolk

158
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,164
to Corpus Christi to DC.

159
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,168
So that's why you curl up
when you sleep.

160
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,836
Hmm?

161
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,805
Your feet are hanging
over the edge of the bed.

162
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,908
All through high school.

163
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,645
And during high school

164
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,681
you would lie in this very bed..

165
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,551
And think about Kate Jackson.

166
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:05,986
Kate Jackson?

167
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,021
‐ Not Farrah Fawcett?
‐ No, no.

168
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,256
Farrah Fawcett was too scary.

169
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,992
Oh, and Holly Fecteau

170
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,528
the girl next door.

171
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,730
Who would one night..

172
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,865
...sneak into this room..

173
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,903
...pick up the covers..

174
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,041
...and slide into the bed
next to you.

175
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,555
What?

176
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:42,723
Mm.

177
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,232
‐ 'We're late.'
‐ I told you to give me a shout.

178
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,901
I didn't know it would take you
so long to get cleaned up.

179
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,104
You don't just turn off
a router and walk away.

180
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,305
‐ There he is.
‐ Who?

181
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,007
Dr. Sayers.

182
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,777
Uh, Dr. Sayers.

183
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,312
You caught me, sir.

184
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,148
I guess it's addiction
when you're running late

185
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,617
and still have to stop
for your morning fix.

186
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,752
This is my son, Mark.

187
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,186
Oh, it's nice
to meet you in person.

188
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,287
Did you get
a few hours sleep?

189
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,756
A few.

190
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,824
Uh, I'd like
a triple grande, non‐fat cap.

191
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,159
Gentlemen?

192
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,728
‐ No, thanks.
‐ I'll take a tall latte.

193
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,130
We're navy,
but we're still California.

194
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,132
And one of those
almond buns, too, please.

195
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,970
I know you're concerned
about your mom.

196
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,738
With my mom's history
of high blood pressure‐‐

197
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,007
And she has
an upgoing right toe.

198
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,309
'It suggests stroke,
no two ways about it'

199
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,078
but the CT didn't confirm that

200
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,881
and I didn't detect any
hemiparesis or hyperreflexia.

201
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,716
That's why I wanted
to go ahead with the MRI.

202
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,751
I was only waiting
to complete a neuro exam

203
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,152
before I put her
through more tests.

204
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,955
‐ Mark, if that's better‐‐
‐ Dealer's choice.

205
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,091
My concern was giving
your mom some time to‐‐

206
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,826
Time could be
my mom's worst enemy.

207
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,394
That's why we moved it up.

208
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,263
Listen, I'd like to be present
for the neuro exam.

209
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,199
I mean, I know you're tapering
her off the narcotics

210
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,266
but frankly, I'm a little..

211
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,773
Present arms!

212
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,891
Mrs. Greene, we're going
to begin the first sequence.

213
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,092
Okay.

214
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,394
This will take about
a half an hour, mom.

215
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,330
It's important that
you don't move or speak.

216
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,833
Just take shallow, easy breaths.

217
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:36,236
This first sequence will take
two and a half minutes to shoot.

218
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,105
Beginning...now.

219
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,841
Where did my dad go?

220
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,442
He said he'd be back
after lunch.

221
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,978
Uh‐huh. Back to his garage.

222
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,114
He's building a wheelchair ramp
for my mom when she comes home.

223
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,783
That's all he's worried about.

224
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,918
‐ It'll come in handy.
‐ Okay.

225
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,020
Hang in there, Mrs. Greene.
You're doing well.

226
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,423
No...no.

227
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,693
Just relax.

228
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,862
‐ No.
‐ I'm here, mom. I'm here.

229
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,965
I...Mark..

230
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,701
I can't stand it, Mark.
Get me out!

231
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,035
Alright, stop it.
I'm getting her out.

232
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,137
Mark! Oh, please!

233
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,239
‐ Alright. It's okay.
‐ Oh, please! No!

234
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,307
I'm here, mom. I'm here.

235
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,043
Okay. Okay. Shh.

236
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,344
It's okay.
Don't move your leg.

237
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,914
‐ I can't stand it.
‐ I know. I know.

238
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,216
‐ What's the matter with me?
‐ No, no, no. It's normal.

239
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,918
It's a normal,
it's a normal reaction.

240
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,086
I was all alone.

241
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,288
‐ No, no, no.
‐ Yes, I was all alone.

242
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,790
No, no. You're not alone now.

243
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,391
I'm here.
I'm here for you, mom.

244
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,059
I'm here. Shh. Shh. Shh.

245
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,928
You're a good boy, Mark.

246
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,496
Stay with me, please.

247
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,165
I'll stay. I'll stay.
I'll stay.

248
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,001
Just like always.

249
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,737
Just like always.

250
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,908
How's that ramp coming?

251
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,112
Taking a break.

252
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,147
What did the doctor say?

253
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,116
Just presumptive diagnosis.

254
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,752
Doctor's best guess.

255
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,790
Her symptoms present
like a deep tissue disease

256
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,759
'in the frontal lobe
of the brain.'

257
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:10,897
MRI and second CT don't
indicate stroke or injury.

258
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,836
Sayers is thinking
uh, multi‐infarct dementia.

259
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:16,870
What's that?

260
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,304
Small infarcts..

261
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,473
...too small to detect..

262
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,442
...in the brain tissue.

263
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,413
'It could manifest
as disinhibition.'

264
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:31,184
It fits with her history
of hypertension.

265
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,958
Can you, uh,
explain that in English?

266
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,325
What's an infarct?

267
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,996
A series
of very small strokes.

268
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,866
‐ What can they do about it?
‐ Not much.

269
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,901
Take a wait and see approach.

270
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,279
‐ You still box?
‐ No.

271
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,951
You always had
the footwork for it.

272
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,854
‐ I hated the whole thing.
‐ You made that clear.

273
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,464
What do you think

274
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,433
about this wait and see
for your mother?

275
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,972
I think the whole thing stinks.

276
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,314
'Dad?'

277
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,118
'Dad?'

278
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,625
Greene residence.

279
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,492
Uh, no, she's not.

280
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,895
Uh, hold on just a second.

281
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,531
Uh, what was that? Stanley..

282
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,032
Stanley what?

283
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,000
Uh‐huh.
What's this regarding?

284
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,139
Well, she may know,
but this is her son

285
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,907
and she's gonna be
tied up this week.

286
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,543
So I don't think
she's gonna keep

287
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,945
her appointment,
whatever it's for.

288
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,949
Right, okay.

289
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,417
I'll pass it along.

290
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,986
'It's like
a foreign language.'

291
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,655
You have to grow up
in it to get it right.

292
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,422
Hey, good morning.

293
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,658
My luggage didn't come, did it?

294
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,225
Nope.

295
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,161
Dad, do you know
a Stanley Black?

296
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,395
No.

297
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,964
Where does mom go
every Thursday?

298
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,398
What do you mean?

299
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,200
On her calendar,
2 o'clock is marked

300
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,003
every Thursday
for the last couple of months.

301
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,304
It could be her women's group

302
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,239
over at Family Services
Pavilion.

303
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,309
‐ 'Which group is that?'
‐ Spouses of retired officers.

304
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,078
The wives get together.

305
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,947
Uh‐huh. Is that for bridge
or service projects or what?

306
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,483
It's your mother's group, Mark.
I have no idea.

307
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,451
Who wants breakfast?
I can scramble up some eggs.

308
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,354
You already got one
burning there, dad.

309
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,924
You take that one,
instead of sneaking mine

310
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,325
when I'm not around.

311
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,061
You counting cigarettes now?

312
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,063
I'll pass on breakfast, thanks.

313
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,204
I didn't start that.

314
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,339
He was in a good mood before.

315
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,476
'What were those three items'

316
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,679
'that I asked you
to remember earlier?'

317
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,216
There were three?

318
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,352
'Yeah. One was a phone book.'

319
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:21,522
Mm.

320
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,225
Were they important?

321
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,326
‐ 'Not really.'
‐ Hmm.

322
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,360
'But do you remember?'

323
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,962
'Phone book.'

324
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,532
'An apple and..'

325
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,235
Banana?

326
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,674
No?

327
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,110
Do I lose points for guessing?

328
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,046
Not at all.

329
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,748
Let's move on.

330
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,750
I'm going to tell you a saying.

331
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,352
It'll be something
that you've heard before

332
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,055
and I want you
to tell me what it means.

333
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,123
Okay.

334
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,026
"People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw bricks."

335
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,494
Have you heard that one?

336
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:04,230
‐ Yes, I have. I've heard.
‐ Hmm.

337
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,199
And what does it mean?

338
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,103
I should get this.

339
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,172
We've lived in lots
of different houses

340
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,607
haven't we, Mark?

341
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,242
Never a glass house.

342
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,445
"People in glass houses
shouldn't throw bricks."

343
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,182
Well, people shouldn't
throw bricks

344
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,051
even if it's close quarters,
and it usually is.

345
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,287
You've got to get along
with all the other families.

346
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,691
They're all in
the same boat you are.

347
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,193
The children are probably
the ones throwing the bricks.

348
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,797
And how are the mothers
supposed to stop them

349
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,065
if the fathers aren't around?

350
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,367
It's always the mother's fault

351
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,036
even if she doesn't
wanna have the children

352
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,338
in the first place.

353
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,445
That was a trick question.

354
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,782
I think I've got it, sneaky.

355
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,420
If you live in a glass house..

356
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,057
...there are no bricks to throw.

357
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,425
Right? Right?

358
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,802
'Dr. Greene?'

359
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,538
‐ Yes?
‐ 'Okay.'

360
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,273
I've got Corey‐Bloom

361
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,809
"Acta Neurologica Scandinavica"

362
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:26,747
McLauchlin, Sandison
and Flostein.

363
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,848
Thank you.

364
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,282
I'm off at midnight

365
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,151
but you're welcome
to stay if you need to.

366
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,452
I will.

367
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,832
'Hey.'

368
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,768
I thought you were asleep.

369
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,269
'I woke up.'

370
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:56,409
‐ Sorry I got ahead of you.
‐ Oh, don't you dare apologize.

371
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,311
I thought you were with me.

372
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:03,183
You are the most considerate man
that I have ever been with.

373
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,719
Every single time doesn't
have to be about me.

374
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,087
Still..

375
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,791
I don't know
where you get it.

376
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,793
You know, being so generous.

377
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:15,295
If I had..

378
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,864
...whatever it is
that your mom has..

379
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:19,666
...and if I just said..

380
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,202
...everything
that was on my mind

381
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,870
I would thank both
of your parents

382
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,339
for raising a son
who was such a good lover.

383
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,409
You bring it out in me.

384
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,911
You lie.

385
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,879
It has nothing to do with me.

386
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,849
You take care of people.

387
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:38,652
Yeah.

388
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,621
That's me, the caretaker.

389
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,923
It's not a bad thing.

390
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,659
I'm like a magnet
for needy people.

391
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,694
They find me wherever I go.

392
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,465
Like I did?

393
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,168
‐ No, I‐I‐‐
‐ Yeah, Mark, I lean on you.

394
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,170
I mean...it must be a drag.

395
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,139
No...it..

396
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,242
It's just all this..

397
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,210
...stuff with my mom.

398
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah.

399
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,449
You're just overwhelmed
right now.

400
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,389
'Very still, mom.
Very still.'

401
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,426
What's this one for?

402
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,395
We wanna rule out encephalitis.

403
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,731
It might be why you're not
feeling like yourself.

404
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,967
Isn't that why
they scanned my belly?

405
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,536
'That was to rule out
paraneoplastic syndrome.'

406
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,538
Hmm. Almost done.

407
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,640
'How many more
rule‐outs are left?'

408
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,941
Are you getting tired?

409
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,977
The other doctor said
I could go home.

410
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,879
He signed off on the knee.

411
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,747
We still have to do
an EEG tomorrow.

412
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,516
Actually it doesn't
have to be tomorrow.

413
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,519
If it's Jakob‐Creutzfeldt,
I don't wanna mess around.

414
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,921
How about a brain biopsy
while we are at it?

415
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,656
I know I'm pushing you

416
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,258
for a more aggressive approach
than you're used to.

417
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,628
I can be thorough
without being aggressive.

418
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,265
‐ All done, Mrs. Greene.
‐ Can I go now?

419
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,834
Probably in another day or two.

420
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,202
Oh.

421
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,707
Look, if my mother
were in the ER

422
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,575
I'd be terrible support for her.

423
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,611
I don't have the temperament
for emergent care.

424
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:11,945
I don't have the temperament

425
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,614
for a passive course
of treatment.

426
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,449
Is your mother sick,
too, doctor?

427
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,018
No, Mrs. Greene.
My mother's fine.

428
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,754
Your indulging me
in a few tests is not enough.

429
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,790
I want a second opinion.

430
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,527
I'll arrange for the chairman
of neurology to come in.

431
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,762
No. I'm gonna find a civilian.

432
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,507
'She's been seeing
this shrink for a month.'

433
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,775
'What for?'

434
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,844
The guy wouldn't tell me
without a release.

435
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,879
I'm gonna meet with him
at the hospital tomorrow.

436
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,584
Uh, sorry, son,
you a retired naval officer?

437
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,386
Uh, no, my father is.
We're meeting him here.

438
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,522
I'm afraid I'll have
to ask you to leave.

439
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,858
‐ Give me a break.
‐ It's club night.

440
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,527
You need to be in the company
of a retired officer.

441
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,462
Well, he's on his way, he must
be running a little late.

442
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,531
Then, you'll have to wait
for him if you wanna be seated.

443
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,768
You're wrong, pal.
We're seated.

444
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,770
I'll have a draft
and a margarita.

445
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,509
‐ And what are you buying me?
‐ I beg your pardon?

446
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,511
You're as stubborn
as your old man.

447
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,847
Don't tell me you're as cheap
as he is, too.

448
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:23,950
Admiral J. Jackson, retired.

449
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:26,620
And you better be
Dave Greene's son

450
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,623
or I got myself
into a hornet's nest.

451
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,057
That's right...Mark Greene.

452
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,827
‐ This is Cynthia Hooper.
‐ How do you do?

453
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,062
Your dad just called
to say he'd be late.

454
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,932
‐ So what are you drinking?
‐ Not a drop more.

455
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,434
I'm late for dinner as it is.

456
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,904
Pleased to see
you again, though.

457
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:47,708
We met your senior year.
You were considering Annapolis.

458
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,710
My dad was considering
Annapolis.

459
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:53,547
Hey, you can't blame
your old man for trying.

460
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,783
Turn down
a flag billet for your family..

461
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,719
...you don't mind seeing
your son make the grade.

462
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,921
‐ What's a flag billet?
‐ Admiral.

463
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:04,090
His dad was in line.
Middle of his command tour.

464
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:06,026
Took himself out of the running.

465
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,061
Why, didn't he wanna be admiral?

466
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,663
Long story.

467
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:10,997
Put their drinks on my tab.

468
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:12,933
Are you sure you
don't want to stay?

469
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,935
Admiral Jay,
nice to see you, sir.

470
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,903
Sorry I have to run.

471
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,805
I could relive
the Korean conflict

472
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,542
for you young folks.

473
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:23,877
‐ How's Ruth?
‐ She'll be home tomorrow.

474
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,648
‐ She will?
‐ That's what I said.

475
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,584
Uh, Lucy and I will drop by
when she's feeling better.

476
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,953
‐ Nice seeing you, meeting you.
‐ Same here.

477
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,856
What can I get you, dad?

478
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,559
‐ Not a thing.
‐ Something wrong?

479
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,426
Why did you say
mom was coming home?

480
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,829
‐ She's had her last test.
‐ No, she hasn't.

481
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,931
Yes, she has, Mark.

482
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:46,466
‐ Syphilis?
‐ What?

483
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,669
You had your mother tested
for syphilis?

484
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,771
‐ Did the results come back?
‐ No.

485
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:52,973
I stopped the whole damn thing.

486
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,675
Whatever gave you the idea..

487
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,510
I'm looking
for an explanation.

488
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,712
What the hell do you think
of your mother?

489
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,413
The symptoms fit.

490
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,915
What the hell
do you think of me?

491
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,985
Settle down, dad.
Why don't you use your inhaler?

492
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:06,086
Is your oxygen in the car?

493
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,789
Some damn nerve.

494
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:11,625
If the test is so unthinkable,
what's your fear?

495
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,193
You're accusing me?

496
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,662
No, he didn't mean it like that.

497
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,063
I need a diagnosis.

498
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:19,766
You need someone
to blame, like always.

499
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,136
‐ Oh, take it easy, dad.
‐ Don't you patronize me!

500
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,071
There's no need
for you to meddle.

501
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,472
Should I get your oxygen?

502
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:27,708
Insult your mother.

503
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,009
Okay. Great.

504
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,177
Go back to Chicago
and leave us alone.

505
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:33,847
I mean, she's going home.

506
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,716
Good, then I'll just tell
that psychiatrist

507
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,117
'that she's been
secretly seeing'

508
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,819
to not bother coming
to the hospital.

509
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,687
What the hell
are you talking about?

510
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:42,088
She's going to a shrink

511
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:44,124
not a sewing circle
every Thursday.

512
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:45,559
Now why would she be doing that?

513
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,660
Mark, come on!

514
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:47,928
Or is that me meddling, huh?

515
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,730
Making too much trouble

516
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,998
when her life with you
is so picture perfect?

517
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:58,471
Alright, dad, take a breath,
take‐take a breath.

518
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,006
Where's your Albuterol?

519
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,875
‐ Shall I get the oxygen?
‐ Yes, go!

520
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,910
‐ He's not breathing.
‐ Let's get him on the ground.

521
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,947
‐ 'Call 911 for him.'
‐ Let him down easy.

522
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,633
'Your dad's peak flow's
improved to 250.'

523
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,135
'He's maintained a pH of 7.38
on ten liters.'

524
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:32,906
His PO2's 65,
his PCO2 is down to 48.

525
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,207
It's not gonna
get much better.

526
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,842
‐ He's a pretty heavy smoker.
‐ Yeah.

527
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:39,045
We've got him
on 125 Solu‐Medrol IV.

528
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,615
Captain Greene,
do you feel better?

529
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,617
I feel fine.

530
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,018
I understand you've been
under some stress lately

531
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,120
with your wife
admitted upstairs.

532
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,689
That's right.

533
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:50,624
That may have brought on
the attack.

534
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,125
We're gonna keep an eye
on you here in the ER

535
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,027
for a few more hours.

536
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,696
Why don't you come back later,
see if we can release him.

537
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:56,697
Thanks.

538
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:02,936
You kinda gave us a scare.

539
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:05,539
‐ Is Cynthia up with your mom?
‐ Drove her home.

540
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:08,274
She was asleep on her feet.

541
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:11,878
You're not going to bother
your mother with this.

542
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,847
No. She doesn't need to know.

543
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:23,223
I'm sorry if I upset you.

544
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:26,727
‐ About that test for your mom‐‐
‐ It's canceled.

545
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,328
No.

546
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,063
Draw the blood.

547
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,032
You need to know.

548
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,103
I was treating your mother's
depression with Paxil.

549
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:39,906
She failed to mention
her hypertension.

550
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,174
I should let you know that

551
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,810
I'm getting a second
neurological consult

552
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:45,211
from a colleague at UCSD.

553
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:47,147
Dr. Hemmings,
she was with your mother

554
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,181
when I arrived this morning

555
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,883
Good.

556
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,118
But I told her I agree
with Dr. Sayers' diagnosis.

557
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,287
Multi‐infarct dementia
and co‐morbidity

558
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,056
with her depression.

559
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,357
I know it's not
the kind of diagnosis

560
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,925
you were hoping for.

561
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,661
It's not about what
I hope for, Dr. Black.

562
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,629
It's about my mother's care.

563
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,031
I'm sure you've heard about

564
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,834
how stubborn the men
are in my family.

565
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,770
I'm not asking you
to break confidentiality.

566
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,104
Actually your mother
signed a full release.

567
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,305
You're welcome to know anything

568
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:13,339
about her psychiatric
treatment

569
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,775
that you'd care to.

570
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:16,009
If I wanna know about my mom's
depression

571
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,043
I'll ask her.

572
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,311
Be sure you want the answers.

573
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,646
In her current state of mind

574
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,648
she's liable to tell you.

575
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,261
Mark.

576
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:36,630
Mark.

577
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:38,865
‐ What's wrong?
‐ Nothing.

578
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:39,900
Everything's fine.

579
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,134
You were gone for a long time.

580
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,203
I needed it.

581
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:45,739
Yeah, um, Dr. Hemmings called.

582
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,074
She wanted to push up
your meeting to 3 o'clock.

583
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,010
It's the neurologist
I called in.

584
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,712
She's an old friend?

585
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:53,379
Went to med school.

586
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:54,981
She wanted to know
if I'd be coming along

587
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,250
if we'd meet, but I figured
that you probably want

588
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,985
to talk
about your mom privately.

589
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,954
Yeah. It's about her condition.

590
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:16,870
'Hey, guys, take turns'

591
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,004
'or you're both gonna
get a time out.'

592
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,306
'Thank you, Josh.'

593
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,976
They say girls are more mellow.
Please confirm that.

594
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,411
‐ Don't ask me.
‐ You have Rachel.

595
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:28,014
Not full time.

596
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:30,350
I remember when Rachel was born.

597
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,018
You were third year.

598
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:34,120
I was so envious
of you and Jen.

599
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:37,290
You? You were the most
driven student in class.

600
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,926
Yeah, but you were
the most together.

601
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,063
You knew you wanted a family
and you went for it.

602
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:46,332
‐ Now you've lapped me.
‐ Twice.

603
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:48,101
If I'd known you were
on maternity leave

604
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,402
I wouldn't have called.

605
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,972
Oh, it was my pleasure.

606
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,340
I was a little taken aback
when I found out

607
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:57,944
that your mom's a patient
of Andrew Sayers.

608
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,713
He's hot stuff.

609
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:02,215
Gaining a national reputation.

610
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:05,018
I haven't been that wowed.

611
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:06,787
You know, I'm really
surprised at you.

612
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,054
I..
Josh, no.

613
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:11,024
Please. We don't throw sand.

614
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:14,294
I thought the ER
would be a brief detour.

615
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:17,430
I thought for sure
you'd end up in family practice.

616
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,099
Really? I was that boring, huh?

617
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:21,234
You know I didn't think that.

618
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,169
We were 25.

619
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,471
I was busy showing
how independent I was

620
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:28,274
and you were determined
to be the good family man.

621
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:32,212
Now, here I am,
and you're a cowboy.

622
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:36,149
Well, I still haven't given up
on the idea of having a family.

623
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:39,452
Yeah, Cynthia sounded sweet.

624
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:43,757
Still know how to cut
to the quick, don't you?

625
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,859
You wanna hear about your mom?

626
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,861
Do I?

627
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:51,464
Your mom may not fully return
to the way she was.

628
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,433
That's gonna take
some getting used to.

629
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:22,395
‐ How's she doing?
‐ She was asleep when I arrived.

630
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,930
I owe you an apology.

631
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,465
No, you don't. It's your mother.

632
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:27,500
Still, I..

633
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,536
Just know it wasn't personal.

634
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,137
You don't have to explain.

635
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,939
My dad was in the navy, too.

636
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,875
Chip on my shoulder's
that easy to read?

637
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:37,310
Plain as rank.
Strong, hard‐working father.

638
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,546
Never there.

639
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,882
But you followed
in your dad's footsteps.

640
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,119
I wish I could tell you
it got me closer.

641
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,358
'Okay, people,
give me a hand, here!'

642
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:53,860
What's going on?

643
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:54,895
We gotta move your dad
out of the way.

644
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:56,029
I got a mass cal coming in.

645
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:58,364
They had chopper crash, a CH‐46.

646
00:29:58,398 --> 00:29:59,833
'The Sea Knight?
Holds a platoon?'

647
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,134
Lucky, she just
had her crew aboard

648
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,302
and one injured on the ground.

649
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:03,469
‐ 'How many critical?'
‐ Three.

650
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:04,505
Evac's landed!

651
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:06,072
Let's move, people!

652
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,174
Third‐degree burns,
20% to face and legs.

653
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,943
He's had ten of morphine.

654
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:13,079
Ready, one, two, three.

655
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:17,483
Alright, people, on my count.
Ready? One, two, three.

656
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,052
She's got an eviscerating
abdominal wound!

657
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,622
Get O‐neg on the rapid infuser.

658
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,490
BP's 40.
Pulse is weak and thready.

659
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:31,397
'Okay, people, on three.
Ready? One, two, three.'

660
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:34,034
‐ How bad are they?
‐ Pretty bad.

661
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:39,139
‐ Fib!
‐ They're gonna defibrillate.

662
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,074
They're gonna shock her.

663
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:47,548
I tried to pull up,
but the stick got heavy.

664
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:50,951
'The stick..'

665
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,285
'...it wouldn't budge.'

666
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,020
'We were only 30 feet
off the deck.'

667
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:55,355
'Don't worry, son.'

668
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:56,923
Hey, are the others
gonna be alright?

669
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,358
They're doing
everything they can.

670
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:00,894
We pitched forward.
I couldn't pull her back.

671
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,395
I couldn't budge the stick!

672
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,598
Just thank God you weren't full.

673
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:06,199
I gotta get up.
I gotta help my crew!

674
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,034
Settle down, son.
You did your best.

675
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:10,604
‐ I couldn't pull the stick!
‐ Now, that sounds mechanical.

676
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:13,439
'Now, you got
the best doctors and nurses'

677
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:16,342
'and corpsmen in the world
working on your crew.'

678
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,479
So stop blaming yourself
and let them do their work.

679
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,684
Can you hear me, son?

680
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:24,918
Mark?

681
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,554
Hey, buddy.

682
00:31:27,588 --> 00:31:29,255
‐ This guy's not breathing.
‐ What happened?

683
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,525
‐ He was just talking.
‐ No carotid pulse. Bag him.

684
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,326
‐ Mark.
‐ He's crashing!

685
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,330
‐ Corpsman, take over here!
‐ It's a tension pneumo.

686
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,465
Yeah, you're right.
Fourteen gauge.

687
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:42,969
'Notify the surgical
and critical care unit.'

688
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:45,171
'Alright, but notify the OR.'

689
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,207
Is he okay?

690
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,942
'She's got eviscerating
abdominal wound.'

691
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:50,577
'Get O‐neg
on the rapid infuser.'

692
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:53,246
Good call.

693
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,415
Yeah, I'm prepping for an
escharotomy on the burn victim.

694
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:58,251
‐ You ever done a chest tube?
‐ I've seen two.

695
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,020
You don't have staff privileges,
do you, doctor?

696
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:01,287
I'm not even licensed
in this state.

697
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:02,623
You mind running
this intern through it?

698
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:04,691
No, not a problem.
Chest tube tray.

699
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:06,993
'Whatever Dr. Greene says,
consider it an order.'

700
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:08,194
Yes, sir.

701
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,330
Alright, get gloves on.
I'll assist.

702
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:11,965
You'll need a 36 French.

703
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:13,399
Is he okay now?

704
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,435
He should be.

705
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:16,737
How about you?

706
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,711
Fifth intercostal space

707
00:32:24,745 --> 00:32:26,680
'mid‐axillary line.'

708
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:30,316
20 CCs of Xylocaine.

709
00:32:31,652 --> 00:32:33,119
'That's right.'

710
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,162
‐ Home sweet home!
‐ Oh, you guys were so fast!

711
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:45,566
‐ Dinner isn't even ready!
‐ 'Oh, look at the azaleas.'

712
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,234
‐ 'They never looked so good!'
‐ I picked off all dead ones.

713
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:50,571
That's why you like 'em.

714
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:53,173
It's so good to be back,
I'm telling you.

715
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:55,308
‐ Welcome home!
‐ Oh, thank you.

716
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:57,678
No wonder you took a spill.

717
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,713
Well, I had to start
cleaning things up.

718
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,682
I don't even know
half the stuff that's in there.

719
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:05,418
‐ Oh, look, was this yours?
‐ Oh, my God. Mr. Funny Bear.

720
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,420
You sure loved the fur
off this thing.

721
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:10,423
‐ Oh, and what is this?
‐ 'Oh, no, not that fiasco.'

722
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,358
You remember?
You saw it in the PX.

723
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:14,561
And you begged
and begged me for it.

724
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:17,030
We hung it from the ceiling
in his bedroom.

725
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:19,065
It was Dave's first tour
of Vietnam..

726
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,333
It was his first tour,
wasn't it?

727
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:22,068
‐ I don't remember.
‐ Must've been.

728
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:23,637
Your father took you
to the airfield

729
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,438
and put you in the cockpit
before he left.

730
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:26,773
You looked at this thing

731
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:28,374
'hanging from the ceiling
every night.'

732
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:30,811
Until he got home
and laughed his head off.

733
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,146
We'd gotten
the wrong damn plane.

734
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,481
That's a Phantom.
Dad flew A‐6s.

735
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:37,217
"What the hell's that doing
in your bedroom?"

736
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,552
He wasn't angry with you.

737
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:40,353
‐ He tore it down.
‐ No, you tore it down.

738
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,421
'Don't you remember
you got a spanking'

739
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:43,056
'for standing on your dresser.'

740
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,157
That was the one
that he bought to replace it.

741
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,425
I tore that one down.

742
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,793
Well, somebody tore
something down.

743
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:48,428
Anyway, I'm hungry!

744
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:50,531
Oh, um, look,
I'm really sorry about dinner.

745
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:52,332
I'm just...I wasn't used
to your oven

746
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,067
so let me make you
something to eat.

747
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,503
You know, every woman's not
cut out for the kitchen.

748
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,238
'In my generation,
we all had to be'

749
00:33:58,271 --> 00:33:59,740
natural‐born wives and mothers.

750
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:01,842
Doesn't sound so bad.

751
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,143
Ah, I think he's back.

752
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,177
You know, sex isn't enough

753
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,712
to hold a family together.

754
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:09,282
God knows Dave and I always
got the sex part right.

755
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:11,451
Can't count on that
if you are counting on it.

756
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:13,086
We're not counting
on anything, mom.

757
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,420
This is a little inappropriate.

758
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:16,456
‐ We're not?
‐ See, she's counting on it.

759
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,224
‐ I don't know what we're‐‐
‐ We're talking about sex.

760
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:20,160
And whether sex means
anything more than sex.

761
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,162
Okay, leave me out
of that conversation.

762
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,697
Why wouldn't you
want to talk about that?

763
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,398
I know why.
You don't have to say.

764
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,734
I hope pizza's okay.
The sandwich place was closed.

765
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:29,335
I'm not hungry.

766
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:36,142
I am so sorry.

767
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:40,246
You are a wonderful,
beautiful person.

768
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,383
But you don't love me.

769
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,251
I‐I don't know.

770
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,420
Then you don't.

771
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:48,689
I was such an idiot
to come out here

772
00:34:48,722 --> 00:34:50,323
like I was part of your family.

773
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,225
No, no, no, that's my fault.

774
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,460
I..

775
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:57,363
I should have told you.
I was..

776
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:59,332
...just being selfish.

777
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:06,507
You mean a lot to me.

778
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,478
I never intended
to lead you on.

779
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:17,684
I‐I thought we were both
en‐enjoying ourselves‐‐

780
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:18,785
Stop.

781
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:20,754
Please.

782
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:24,157
This may be new for you,
but I've heard it before..

783
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,659
...too many times.

784
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,661
So I guess I asked for it.

785
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,296
No.

786
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,300
I never should have
let it go on so long.

787
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:35,435
You know, we should go.

788
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,303
I, uh, I don't wanna
miss my plane.

789
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:38,939
Cynthia, you really
don't need to leave.

790
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:41,908
Yeah, I really do.

791
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:44,578
I'll be back in Chicago
in a week at the latest.

792
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:47,280
‐ We'll talk more?
‐ We don't have to talk.

793
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,516
You know, there's a lot that's
good about us together.

794
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,284
I, I mean, I feel that way.

795
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,654
That...I hope you do, too.

796
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:55,656
At least I got to see
the Pacific.

797
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:06,667
‐ Ready, mom?
‐ 'Yeah. I'm ready.'

798
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:13,707
Put your arm around my neck.
Lean on me.

799
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,275
Good.
No weight on that leg.

800
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:18,211
I don't know
why I can't use the walker.

801
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:21,748
Wait until the therapist
gives you your lesson, okay?

802
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,885
Don't empty that.

803
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:26,452
I might need to use it again.

804
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,989
Your nurse isn't gonna
be here for an hour.

805
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:31,357
You know, you've got to let dad
and I help sometimes.

806
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,859
I do. I am.

807
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:37,430
It's time for your pills.

808
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:39,465
I'm tired of pills.

809
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:42,235
Just take the pills, mom.

810
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:44,505
I can't get dad
to pay attention.

811
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:45,806
He pays attention.

812
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,274
Yeah. From the garage.

813
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:50,276
Now, don't be like that.

814
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:55,381
Is it true that dad
had a shot at making admiral?

815
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:58,885
Yes, of course, he did.

816
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,420
You know that story.

817
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:02,355
Remind me.

818
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:05,025
Oh, it was that Leadbetter boy.

819
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,827
He was such a bully to you.

820
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,629
‐ Tommy Leadbetter?
‐ Uh‐huh.

821
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:11,331
He used to beat me up
every day in sixth grade?

822
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:12,566
You were scared
to go to school.

823
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,267
I don't remember that part.

824
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,569
Well..

825
00:37:15,602 --> 00:37:17,804
...I made your father
come back..

826
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:18,939
...'cause..

827
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:22,442
I didn't tell him he had to

828
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,711
but I knew that if I wrote
enough, he'd‐he'd come.

829
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,680
That's when he took
that desk job in Hueneme?

830
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:27,714
Mm‐hmm.

831
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:35,388
And you know,
he never once complained.

832
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:44,064
Dr. Black says that
you and your father

833
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,700
are responsible
for your own feelings.

834
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,973
'But I know
I started it.'

835
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:58,712
I blamed him.

836
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:01,915
I blamed you.

837
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:04,585
I...I didn't want a baby.

838
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,689
'It was too soon.'

839
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:10,824
'We'd only dated
a couple of times.'

840
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:16,797
Of course, when I saw you

841
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,799
I loved you.

842
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:20,767
And I tried to make up for it.

843
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,339
But I'd already
spoiled everything

844
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:28,809
between you and your father.

845
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:31,044
And it just kept going wrong.

846
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:36,382
'No matter how much
I loved you both.'

847
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:50,864
'David!'

848
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,635
'David!'

849
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:57,971
What's going on?

850
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,806
I don't know. She's not in bed.

851
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,376
'David!'

852
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:05,546
'Help me! Help me!'

853
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,047
David! Hurry! Oh!

854
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,050
'Hurry up!
Oh, God, hurry up!'

855
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,519
‐ Hurry up! Hurry up!
‐ Dad, get the wheelchair.

856
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:13,920
Mom, mom, what happened?

857
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:16,056
I just thought
a little broth would be nice.

858
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:17,390
Okay. Alright, we're gonna
get you up slowly.

859
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,994
Dad, give me a hand.
Okay, on a count.

860
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:22,596
One, two, three.

861
00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:25,932
Okay? Alright, easy, easy.

862
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:28,401
Is your leg okay?

863
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:29,469
Oh, gosh!

864
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:31,037
What if I broke it?

865
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:32,906
Yeah.
Ha ha ha.

866
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:35,175
Slide back. There you go.

867
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,110
That's why you can't
use that walker, okay?

868
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:39,045
'Cause this can happen.

869
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,048
Oh, dear, I forgot
to go to the bathroom.

870
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:44,417
It's okay. I'll clean it up.
You just go ahead.

871
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:49,389
Oh! Okay.

872
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,814
'We have a non‐injury accident
in the right‐hand lane.'

873
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:50,651
'Traffic is extremely slow
on the Bay Bridge today'

874
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:54,821
'with the USS Long Beach
home ported at North Island.'

875
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,523
'Is that gonna hold us up?'

876
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:58,792
'We're not going
on the Bay Bridge.'

877
00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:00,994
'I heard you tell the nurse
we wouldn't be back for lunch.'

878
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:03,564
'That's right.
No more clues.'

879
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:13,574
You used to bring me down here.

880
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:15,609
There used to be
something to see.

881
00:41:17,711 --> 00:41:19,880
Every one of those docks
used to be full.

882
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:22,683
Here.

883
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:25,619
‐ No, thanks. I've stopped.
‐ You what?

884
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,654
Gave them up
for your mother.

885
00:41:27,688 --> 00:41:31,091
‐ Since when?
‐ Since the hospital.

886
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:33,994
Have you seen me
take a cigarette?

887
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:37,297
You smoked two packs
a day for 50 years.

888
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,200
You must be going through
some heavy‐duty withdrawals.

889
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:41,201
Uh‐huh.

890
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,040
We saw the Kitty Hawk here,
remember?

891
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:49,576
Yeah. It scared me.

892
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,612
It's huge.

893
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:54,047
I remember that flight deck,
it was like, uh..

894
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,583
It was like standing
on the edge of the earth.

895
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:58,885
The most hazardous
work site there is.

896
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:02,255
What was it like
working on a carrier?

897
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:04,625
Hard.

898
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:09,596
How many aircraft
would you launch in a day?

899
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,066
Oh, up to 140
in a 12‐hour shift.

900
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:18,104
Launchings 20 seconds apart.

901
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:20,106
Landings every 40 seconds.

902
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:23,944
We worked all kind of weather.

903
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:26,179
Day and night.

904
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:28,248
Sounds intense.

905
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:31,051
The best time was first thing
in the morning

906
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:33,019
'before they started
the engines.'

907
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:36,857
I'd come up on the...the bridge

908
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:40,360
watch the sun rise
over the flight deck

909
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,963
and the canopies.

910
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:46,600
'Ocean rolling as far
as you could see.'

911
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:48,635
'Admiral wasn't up yet'

912
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:51,071
complaining of the jet fuel
in his water.

913
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,976
Deck crew would be out working

914
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:59,613
on the catapults
and the arresting gear.

915
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:01,582
Ordnance guys loading up.

916
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:08,054
'You knew in a minute
the engines would start'

917
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,724
'and lives would be at stake'

918
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,594
'for every minute of
the next 12 hours.'

919
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:19,065
Sound familiar?

920
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:21,301
Sort of.

921
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:27,107
I'm proud of what you do, son.

922
00:43:28,341 --> 00:43:29,943
'I'm proud of you.'

923
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:35,982
Thanks for helping me get there.

924
00:43:43,356 --> 00:43:45,291
Your mother's gonna be worried.

925
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:49,630
We should get back.
