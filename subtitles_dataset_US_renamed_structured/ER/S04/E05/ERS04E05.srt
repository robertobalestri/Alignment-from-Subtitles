1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,473
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,610
This is Carla.
Carla, this is Dr. Corday.

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,045
Doug has difficulty
dealing with strong women.

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,479
I don't know about that.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,616
‐ We work as a team.
‐ Oh, come on, what team?

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:19,052
Every contractor in Chicago
will hear that I have AIDS.

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,486
Do you mind walking me
up to the platform?

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,723
I just, get kinda
scared out here at night.

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,424
‐ What's the story?
‐ Motorcycle accident.

10
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,692
Left upper quadrant contusion.

11
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,127
It's okay, I can handle it.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,194
But if my mother gets

13
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,797
another bill from this hospital

14
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,600
maybe I'm gonna kick some ass.

15
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,401
Maybe I'll start with yours.

16
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,743
There could be
some kind of counseling

17
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:47,147
for teenage mothers,
abuse victims, you know.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,849
‐ Doug?
‐ 'Listening.'

19
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,151
I think a clinic's a good way
to keep track of people

20
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,285
who fall
through the cracks.

21
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,754
Okay, here we go.

22
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,522
I got it.

23
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,758
No, it's...it's a good idea.

24
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,359
I just don't know
that Kerry Weaver's

25
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,294
looking for new ways
to spend money.

26
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,629
It would be on
a volunteer basis.

27
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,732
Well...worth a try.

28
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,200
Right, you ready?

29
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,835
Yeah, I'm ready
if you are.

30
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,404
If I am?
This was your idea. Hang on.

31
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,206
Doug, I was kidding.

32
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,141
I didn't think you'd actually
go out and rent equipment.

33
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,444
'Now, now, you talked about
this fantasy years ago.'

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,247
I did not.

35
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,549
‐ Did I?
‐ Yeah.

36
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,687
Uh, actually, I think
you accused me

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,389
of taping myself with
various 20‐year‐olds.

38
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,424
‐ Oh, that was harsh.
‐ Yeah.

39
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:32,859
Was I right?

40
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,494
Uh...no.

41
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,797
You see all this stuff..

42
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,666
...I did it because
I wanna make you happy.

43
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,302
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

44
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,436
You did all
this for me?

45
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,806
I'd do anything for you.

46
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,550
Come on, Reese,
daddy's workin'.

47
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,685
Reese, I've got to study
for a proctocolectomy.

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,486
Come on, man,
give me a break, please?

49
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:04,257
Please, Reese,
please, please.

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,560
Okay, okay, okay.

51
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,195
Come on, come on, okay.
Alright, alright, alright.

52
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,864
I know, I know, I know.

53
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,933
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.

54
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,835
Okay, hey,
you gonna wake up mommy.

55
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,436
You gonna wake up mommy.

56
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,938
Do you wanna wake up mommy?

57
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,940
Huh? Do you wanna
wake up mommy?

58
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,910
If you wake up mommy,
she's not gonna be happy.

59
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,182
She's not gonna be happy!

60
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,887
Okay, okay, okay.

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,222
Come here, come here.
It's just me and you.

62
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,891
Okay? It's just me and you.

63
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,626
Come on. Hey, hey!

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,728
Hey, hey, hey.

65
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,764
Hey, you wanna get funky
with your old man, huh?

66
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,299
You want to get funky with your
old man? Come on, come on, say.

67
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,535
♪ Papa don't take no mess
hey hey hey ♪

68
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,737
♪ Papa don't papa don't
papa don't ♪

69
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,338
Come on, Reese.

70
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,808
Come on, give me
a break, please?

71
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,744
What do I have to do
to make you stop crying, huh?

72
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,346
Okay, okay, shh.

73
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,284
Shh, I know, I know, I know.
Come here. Come here.

74
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,720
What do I have to do to
get you to stop crying, huh?

75
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,322
Talk to me,
talk to me, okay.

76
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,757
Alright, man,
come here.

77
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,826
Okay, hey, you wanna study
with your old man?

78
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,528
You wanna study
with your old man?

79
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,330
How's that, huh?
Come here.

80
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,932
Come on and study.
Come on.

81
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,601
Come on, come on, come on.

82
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,702
I know, I know.

83
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,336
Listen.

84
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,939
"After performing the colectomy,
take the distal ileum

85
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,508
"and measure seven inches

86
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,410
from the transected distal end
proximally."

87
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,245
Seven inches.
Seven inches.

88
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,481
"Fold that distal end upward
to form a J‐pouch."

89
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,517
You like that?

90
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,918
You like that, Reese, huh?

91
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,686
You like forming a J‐pouch?

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,488
Do you know how to form
a J‐pouch? Okay, here we go.

93
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,526
"And begin stapling together
the two limbs of the small bowel

94
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,894
with the GIA 55."

95
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,462
Hey, man, you like that, huh?

96
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,369
Thank you very much.

97
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,773
And in seconds,
we will chop these onions.

98
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,274
'Hi. We're not here.'

99
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,944
'Please leave a message
at the tone.'

100
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,848
'Lisa, whose voice
is that on the machine?'

101
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,483
'Lisa, pick up the phone.'

102
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,286
'Lisa, who you there with?'

103
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,288
'Pick up, I know you home.'

104
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,690
'Sorry ass bitch.'

105
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,659
'Why you got to..'

106
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,495
'Pick up the damn phone now,
Lisa! You know I‐‐'

107
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,897
Hey, wrong number.

108
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,298
'Who the hell are you?'

109
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,600
'Put Lisa on the phone!'

110
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,869
Look, pay attention, dumb ass.

111
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,005
There's nobody here named Lisa.
You got the wrong number.

112
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,473
Goodbye.

113
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,441
‐ Hey, Mark.
‐ Peter.

114
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,509
Thought you didn't
drink caffeine.

115
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,377
Yeah, well, I do now.

116
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,412
Listen, you had your kid when
you were in med school, right?

117
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,548
Yeah, sure did.

118
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,550
What a mistake that was.

119
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,851
See you around, Peter.

120
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,895
We got Ernesto Ruiz
in curtain two.

121
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,430
18 years old,
through and through GSW

122
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,666
to the right shoulder.

123
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,967
You know, this
same knucklehead was in here

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,869
a couple of months ago,
shot in the chest?

125
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,971
He must walk around
wearing a bull's eye.

126
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,907
I gave him a gram of Ancef
and called surgery.

127
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,043
Three is a 40‐year‐old gentleman
with urinary retention

128
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,514
and Jeanie's working up
a 65‐year‐old woman in exam two

129
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,782
with abdominal pain.

130
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,650
Alright. We'll do
rounds about 8.

131
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,185
And I'll drum up
some more business.

132
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,420
Hey, Mark, take a look
at a patient for me?

133
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,089
‐ Yeah.
‐ Female, 65.

134
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,658
Recurrent right upper quadrant
pain over the past six months

135
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,760
becoming increasingly
worse today.

136
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,762
Temp's 101,
white count's 15,000

137
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,631
and she's vomiting
bilious material.

138
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,932
Sounds like cholecystitis.

139
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,133
Yeah, I think she
might need surgery.

140
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,467
Let's take a look.

141
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,506
Hi, Pablo.
No, Haleh's not here.

142
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,840
Is, uh, Haleh here?

143
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,642
No. She called
in sick today.

144
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,910
Oh, but today's Thursday.

145
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,646
I know, but she'll
be back tomorrow, okay?

146
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,114
Yeah, she be
back later on.

147
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,749
She'll be back tomorrow.
Why don't you come then?

148
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,983
She'll be glad to see you.

149
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,952
‐ Yeah, okay.
‐ Okay?

150
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,787
Hey, Anna, you got
any procedures?

151
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,823
Can't wait for the next one
to come through the door, huh?

152
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,490
Nah, it's for Fu's benefit.

153
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,059
I swear to you,
I'm going to turn that kid

154
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,561
into a functioning med student.

155
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,062
How many times has
he puked in trauma?

156
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,131
Twice, but the second time
was really dry heaves.

157
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,033
‐ Uh‐huh.
‐ How's yours doing?

158
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,168
Uh, he's not the sharpest
knife in the drawer

159
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,170
but he's a hard worker.
He hasn't puked yet.

160
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,872
Ha! So, you got
anything we can do?

161
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,541
You can cath the guy
in curtain three.

162
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,743
Perfect. Thank you.

163
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,044
Tell me if this hurts.

164
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,512
You're a good‐looking fellow.

165
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,514
Ah, Thank you.
Does this hurt?

166
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,149
Oh!

167
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,652
Last night, it was so bad,
I couldn't sleep.

168
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,554
‐ What about here?
‐ Not really.

169
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,588
Here?

170
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,189
No. Higher.

171
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,228
Can I have my hand back?

172
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,065
Ma'am...give me
my hand back.

173
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,035
Wait...handsome.

174
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,504
‐ You can handle this.
‐ Uh, Mark.

175
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,005
I think she's got
a hot gallbladder.

176
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,507
We should get an ultrasound
and surgical consult.

177
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,741
‐ Good. Do it.
‐ Yeah, but, Mark‐‐

178
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,276
I don't have time
for this today.

179
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,778
For the average
male penis you'll use

180
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,646
a 16 French
Foley catheter.

181
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,515
Those French,
they think of everything.

182
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:02,983
It refers
to the circumference.

183
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,219
One French is a third
of a millimeter diameter.

184
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,655
You wanna check
the Foley balloon for leaks

185
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,091
by injecting some saline.

186
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,127
You lube up the tip
with lidocaine jelly.

187
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,996
Now you are ready to insert

188
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,965
applying gentle,
constant pressure.

189
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,601
Isn't this a nurse's job?

190
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,903
Um, You need to know how, Ivan.

191
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:26,707
So...grab that penis
and show it who's boss.

192
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,610
Yo.

193
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,077
‐ When can I go home?
‐ Who's your doctor?

194
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,679
Some chick.
I don't know her name.

195
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:33,914
Uh‐huh. Well,
why don't you go back

196
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,248
to your own bed
and wait for her?

197
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,017
Hey, what are you
doing to that dude?

198
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,719
Hey, come on, let's go.
back to your bed. Please.

199
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,587
Uh‐uh, sometimes
it's a little tricky

200
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,088
'to get it past
the, uh, prostate.'

201
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,157
You all did this
to me last time.

202
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,792
Yeah, I wish I knew
who it was, too.

203
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,293
Am I gonna have
to call security here?

204
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,029
Come on, let's go.
Back to your own room.

205
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,031
'It's in, Dr. Carter.'

206
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,566
'Balloon's inflated.'

207
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,735
Okay, hey, hook it up
to the bag, Ivan!

208
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,876
Hi. Who peed in
your cornflakes?

209
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,044
What?

210
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,612
You're in a bad mood.

211
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,081
Just caught up
in this lawsuit.

212
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,983
Have to give a deposition
this afternoon.

213
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,652
Lawsuit? Over what?

214
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,254
Family of a gunshot victim
who died last spring.

215
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,256
It's a shakedown and they're
just looking for money.

216
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,325
Wow. Well, I'm pretty good
at giving back rubs.

217
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,894
It might help you relax.

218
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,996
Thanks. I'll take
a rain check on that.

219
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,065
Okay. Sure.

220
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,001
Um...I hope
that wasn't inappropriate

221
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,202
to say in the workplace.

222
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,772
Don't worry,
I won't sue.

223
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,275
‐ 'Hey, Mark.'
‐ Hey.

224
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,910
So, where's that going?

225
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,344
‐ What do you mean?
‐ You and the desk clerk.

226
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,247
There is no
me and the desk clerk.

227
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,283
Girl like that, you do
get into something

228
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,318
you better be thinking ahead
how you gonna get out.

229
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,087
A girl like what?

230
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,690
Pretty needy.

231
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,758
A, you don't know
anything about her

232
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,828
and B, if I was interested
in her or anybody else

233
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,197
I don't need your advice.

234
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,774
Brett Nicholson, 20.

235
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,375
Complains
of shortness of breath.

236
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,244
No fever, just
a little tachy at 100.

237
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,946
‐ Okay, I'm Dr. Del Amico.
‐ Hi.

238
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,247
Tell me
what happened.

239
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,216
Uh, I was just running.
I'm on the lakefront.

240
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,251
Got so out of breath,
I had to stop and sit down.

241
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,353
Have you ever had
shortness of breath before?

242
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,922
No, just the last few weeks

243
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,423
but it's getting
worse and worse, you know.

244
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,191
Any history of asthma?

245
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,893
‐ No.
‐ Okay.

246
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,194
Let's listen
to your chest.

247
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,063
Alright.

248
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,298
‐ So, you're an athlete?
‐ Yeah, I'm a runner at De Paul.

249
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,167
'Take deep breaths, please.'

250
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,436
‐ What's your event?
‐ 400 meters.

251
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,338
‐ Again.
‐ Best time?

252
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,706
46 flat.

253
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,074
Man, that's good.

254
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,276
Deep breaths.
You listening, James?

255
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,778
That's why I'm freaking out
a little bit.

256
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,212
Not being able
to run to me, that's like

257
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,981
not being able to walk,
you know what I mean.

258
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,283
Shh. Hold on.

259
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,685
What do you hear?

260
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,219
Scattered rales, bilaterally.

261
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,856
I agree.
What do you wanna do?

262
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,458
Get a chest film and order CBC
to check the white count.

263
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,993
White count doesn't
change your management.

264
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,294
What do you guys
think it is?

265
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,830
Uh, we'll have to wait
for your x‐ray.

266
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,799
Call radiology,
and next time

267
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,101
make sure the nurse
gets them into a gown.

268
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,903
Kerry, you got a minute?

269
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,104
Half a minute.

270
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,373
‐ Can I bounce an idea off you?
‐ Sure.

271
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,810
I see a need for some kind of
patient follow up in the ER.

272
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,478
You know, services like
psych counseling.

273
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,947
We patch these people up,
throw them back out there

274
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,916
without any hope
of staying well.

275
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,185
So I was thinking about a
women's and children's clinic.

276
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,419
Entirely volunteer staffed.

277
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,354
A women's and children's clinic.

278
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,991
We could designate an exam room,
two or three days a week.

279
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,359
Yeah, it's a‐a‐an
interesting idea.

280
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,962
Hey, I'd volunteer. I'm sure
lots of docs and nurses would.

281
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,098
I'll add it to the long list
of interesting ideas

282
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,166
we could implement
if we had the money.

283
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,235
Stony Island's ER
got a $100,000

284
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,838
from the department of public
health for a wound check clinic.

285
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,206
‐ Now, if they can do‐‐
‐ Carol.

286
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,775
I'm going to a budget meeting,
trying to see to it

287
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,144
we don't compromise
basic patient care.

288
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,080
I'm not looking to take on
any new side projects.

289
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,449
But my door is always open.

290
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,320
Going someplace, Ernesto?

291
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,955
Yeah, I'm leaving.
Where's my shirt?

292
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,323
Surgery's been by to see you.

293
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,958
For what? Bullet
went straight through.

294
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
A surgeon has to
explore the wound.

295
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,194
Nothing's wrong
with me, I'm fine.

296
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,496
‐ You need a wound explored?
‐ Oh, hold on a sec.

297
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,432
So, you're now,
now you're a big tough guy?

298
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,934
Last time you were yelling
for your mama.

299
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,036
‐ I can help you out.
‐ You're not a surgeon.

300
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,137
I've done it 50 times.

301
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,506
What are you doing?

302
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,845
Bye‐bye, chica.

303
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,446
You don't think I could
debride a gunshot wound?

304
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,850
Put some pressure on that so you
don't bleed all over the place.

305
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,151
‐ Maggie‐‐
‐ See you next time!

306
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,452
You know, I could
help you out there.

307
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,954
I called surgery.

308
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,321
Who was supposed
to be covering the ER?

309
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,891
You‐you're not gonna
be sick, are you?

310
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,296
Start with the
colectomy at the secum

311
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,497
and proceed distally.

312
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,099
His bowel's
very friable.

313
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,068
Metz.

314
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,005
How do you make a W‐pouch,
Dr. Benton?

315
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,274
Measure seven inches
from the transected distal end

316
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,442
fold it upward
and begin stapling‐‐

317
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,478
That's a J‐pouch.

318
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:01,047
I said W‐pouch.

319
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,250
Well, I assumed
we were doing a‐‐

320
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,252
Dr. Corday?
A W‐pouch?

321
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,420
'It's just the same
as the J‐pouch'

322
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,922
'but with two
extra loops.'

323
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,390
You take the distal
ileum and fold it

324
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,125
back on itself three times
instead of just once.

325
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:16,196
Quite right. Didn't get that far
in your reading, Dr. Benton?

326
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,965
I understand, that you've fallen
behind in your operative reports

327
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,366
and discharge summaries as well.

328
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,003
I plan to get caught up
this week, sir.

329
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,305
Perhaps your day would be
better spent in medical records.

330
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,073
Dr. Anspaugh,
I'm prepared for this.

331
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,842
Would you step out, Dr. Benton?

332
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,243
Catch up on your dictations.

333
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,978
Don't worry about
the patient.

334
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:35,816
I'd say that he's in
quite capable hands.

335
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,405
'Whoa, what are those things?'

336
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,276
Cannonball infiltrates,
probably testicular cancer.

337
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,611
Testicular?

338
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,346
It metastasizes through
lungs like this.

339
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,082
‐ Who's the unlucky soul?
‐ Twenty‐year‐old male.

340
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,417
Presented, uh, with
shortness of breath.

341
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,020
Sweet guy, college athlete.
He won't know what hit him.

342
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,155
Did he do the
testicular exam?

343
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,489
That's next, yeah.

344
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,258
If you think it'd be better,
I can do it.

345
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,960
Why would I think
that's better?

346
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,962
Because he might feel more
comfortable with a male doctor.

347
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,030
If it were a young woman
needing a pelvic exam

348
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,599
would you hand it off to me?

349
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,000
‐ I was just offering.
‐ Thanks. I can handle it.

350
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,301
Okay. Fine.

351
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:31,972
Great.

352
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,242
'Cynthia?'

353
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,178
How long has Pablo
been sitting out there?

354
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,379
‐ That guy?
‐ Yeah.

355
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,947
Ten minutes.

356
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,983
Will you tell him
Haleh is not coming in.

357
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,384
Try back tomorrow.

358
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,286
‐ Okay.
‐ Thanks.

359
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,521
Somebody call
for a surgeon?

360
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,655
Yeah, three hours ago.

361
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,090
I called, Dale.

362
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,592
Something about
a gangrenous toe?

363
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,127
Joseph Kupchak,
49 year old diabetic male

364
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,563
noticed an infection on his
left baby toe two weeks ago.

365
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:57,998
He put off coming in.

366
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,133
Oh, this is why
you quit surgery.

367
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,535
So, how's the
internship going?

368
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,969
It's going great.

369
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,070
'Mr. Kupchak?'

370
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,172
I'm Dr. Edson. I'm a surgeon.

371
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,674
Here to take care
of this toe for you.

372
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,377
Oh, Carter..

373
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,580
...this looks like something
you could have handled.

374
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:16,449
I want you to tell me
if you feel this.

375
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,951
No.

376
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,485
Alright, I don't believe
that they don't trust

377
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,187
a first year to clip a toe.

378
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,657
I think I clipped a couple of
toes when I was a student.

379
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,225
‐ Feel that?
‐ No.

380
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,492
How's Benton treating you?

381
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,529
Oh, piece of cake.
I got him handled.

382
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:29,730
‐ Hey, you know, Rocket's back.
‐ Dr. Romano?

383
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,164
Oh, yeah, I heard that.

384
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,198
He's letting me
scrub in tomorrow.

385
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,000
'Lab collie with a laser.'

386
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,235
Hey, did you work
with him before

387
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,269
you washed out of surgery?

388
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,638
I didn't wash out, Dale.

389
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,272
That's your story and
you're sticking to it, huh?

390
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,374
‐ What you got?
‐ Head lac, MVA.

391
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,076
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Head lac?

392
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,377
Gosh golly.

393
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,149
Feel that?

394
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,518
Uh, September 5, '52.

395
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,153
Hi. I'm Dr. Carter.

396
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,288
‐ Tom Angevine.
‐ What happened, Mr. Angevine?

397
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,323
Uh, going to
a lunch appointment.

398
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,459
Then I get this sudden,
blinding headache

399
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,595
and bam, straight
into a tree.

400
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,496
'Pressure's 210 over 160.'

401
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,131
Do you have a history
of hypertension?

402
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,333
Yeah, I'm taking
vasotec and lasix.

403
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,336
Okay, let's bring
that pressure down.

404
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,775
Let's start nitroprusside,
0.3 mics per kilo per minute.

405
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,545
'Get an EKG And keep
monitoring his pressure.'

406
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,213
And call for an abdominal CT.

407
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,515
‐ Abdominal CT?
‐ Right.

408
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,783
For hypertensive emergency‐‐

409
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,051
Just do it, please,
Connie, okay?

410
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,186
Okay.

411
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,155
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, Brett.

412
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,724
You guys
find out what's wrong?

413
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,759
Uh, we have an idea but
we're going to have to do

414
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,194
a further physical
examination.

415
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,229
I need to examine
your testicles.

416
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,601
I'm, uh, I'm short of breath.
How'd my testicles get into it?

417
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,803
I have to check
for abnormalities.

418
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,738
Uh, my student can leave
the room if you like.

419
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,774
Uh...no, he can stay.
I don't care.

420
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:48,775
Alright.

421
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,450
Okay, could you take down your
pants and underwear, please?

422
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,685
Alrighty.

423
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,690
It's a good thing
I put on clean drawers, huh?

424
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,166
Thanks.

425
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,369
Whoa.

426
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,806
Oh.

427
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,344
Oh, man.
Oh, man.

428
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,080
Hey, I'm, uh,
sorry about that.

429
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,115
It's alright.
It's a normal male reaction.

430
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,752
Oh, God, I'm sorry, doctor.
I‐I'm sorry, I can't do this.

431
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:36,189
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about, Brett.

432
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,459
‐ Uh, Brett‐‐
‐ Okay, just wait, just wait.

433
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,661
It's really not a problem.

434
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:41,862
Okay. Okay.

435
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,132
I'm sorry, It's really important
that we finish the physical‐‐

436
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,069
Just give me a minute. Okay?

437
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,104
Alright?

438
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,675
Geez.

439
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,309
Carter, tell me

440
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,845
about your hypertensive
crisis Mr. Angevine.

441
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,782
Presented as a minor trauma
case, head lac from an MVA.

442
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,417
Upon exam, he was
tachycardic, diaphoretic.

443
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,320
BP was 210 over 160.
We got his pressure down.

444
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,122
Why'd you do
an abdominal CT?

445
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,391
History of intermittent
flushing and palpitations.

446
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,159
Classic findings for a pheo.

447
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,662
That's going fishing with
some pretty expensive bait.

448
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:17,864
‐ What did the CT Show?
‐ It hasn't come back yet.

449
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,466
I know for you it's tempting
to reach for a surgical cause

450
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,702
but in the ER, we can't run

451
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,504
expensive tests
based on hunches.

452
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,872
Just check with me
in the future.

453
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,308
‐ Carol.
‐ Yeah.

454
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,176
I didn't mean to be
short with you earlier.

455
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,179
I do think an ER clinic is an
interesting idea and you might

456
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,348
be able to get some state
and federal funds for it.

457
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,416
‐ I might?
‐ Yeah.

458
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,918
Here's the place to start.

459
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,185
What are these?

460
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,353
Grant application manuals.

461
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,522
And this is a really good book

462
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,156
on fundraising strategies.

463
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,791
Oh, no, Kerry.

464
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:47,928
‐ I didn't mean me.
‐ I don't have the time.

465
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,429
What am I supposed
to do with these?

466
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,532
Carol, the only way
a good idea comes to life

467
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:54,167
is if somebody chooses
to see it through.

468
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,537
If you need help deciphering
these, we can talk later.

469
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,172
Kerry, I've got a problem
with this case.

470
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,741
Hey, you know what,
could you tell Mark? I've‐‐

471
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,709
Mark is the problem.

472
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:05,579
I worked up this LOL with a hot
gallbladder and Mark walked out

473
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,614
in the middle of the physical
exam and refused to finish.

474
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,683
‐ Why?
‐ The woman's a little flaky.

475
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,217
She put Mark's hand
on her breast

476
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,418
but that doesn't mean
she's not sick.

477
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,620
The ultrasound
confirms cholangitis.

478
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,355
Let me see.

479
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,456
Maybe he's got
other things on his mind.

480
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,524
You know, how
Mark's been lately.

481
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:18,792
She's a Medicare patient?

482
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,927
Yeah. I was reluctant
to bring this to you.

483
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,729
I don't care if somebody
is in a bad mood‐‐

484
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:23,897
‐ I'll talk to Mark.
‐ When it affects‐‐

485
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,766
I'll talk to him.

486
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:31,304
Uh, Brett, you have a mass
on your left testicle.

487
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,707
The chest x‐ray shows
spots on your lungs

488
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,342
which is why you've been
short of breath.

489
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,211
Spots? What..

490
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,847
The growth on your testicle
may have spread to your lungs.

491
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,250
What, cancer?

492
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,319
Before we can determine,
I need to draw up some blood

493
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,590
and, uh, you need
a CAT scan on your abdomen.

494
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:50,957
Could I have a,
uh, pen and paper?

495
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,759
I just want to write
this down real quick.

496
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:53,927
Sure.

497
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,698
Thank you.
Thanks.

498
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,569
Okay, so...so‐so
what happens now?

499
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:03,837
What, you draw some blood?

500
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,739
Right, um, then I'll send you

501
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,374
back to radiology
for the CAT scan.

502
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,244
And then I'll call
an oncologist down to see you.

503
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,813
Okay.

504
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:14,581
So, how bad...how
bad is the cancer?

505
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,316
We're not certain that
it is cancer.

506
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,018
Yeah, but you think so.
So what happens if it is?

507
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,520
You know what,
these are things

508
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,921
you should really discuss
with an oncologist.

509
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,255
Look, I don't wanna wait
for somebody else to tell me

510
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,690
if you could tell me now.

511
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:28,962
Okay.

512
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,298
If it is, uh, cancer

513
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,300
treatment is removal
of the testicle

514
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,537
'plus chemotherapy,
probably radiation as well.'

515
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,304
What, you gonna cut
one of my nuts off?

516
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,374
With successful treatment,
there's a 70% survival rate.

517
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,579
Oh, my god.

518
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,415
Oh, my god.

519
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,791
Dr. Greene?

520
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,560
Mark?

521
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:00,661
What?

522
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:01,695
Hi, Alan.

523
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,763
You didn't get my page?

524
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,364
Oh, yeah, no, I‐I got it.

525
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,033
I just, uh, I was just
on my way up.

526
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,537
If you're gonna lie to an
attorney Dr. Greene, try harder.

527
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,839
Listen, I know you don't feel
the need for final preparation

528
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:13,974
for this, but I do.

529
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:15,475
We're not prepared enough?

530
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,410
For deposition,
there's no such thing.

531
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,646
Alright, any question
they ask, you answer what?

532
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,348
Yes, no, or I don't recall.

533
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,350
That's right,
and nothing else.

534
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,952
Why the hell haven't we
settled this thing already?

535
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:28,421
Well, these people won't come
down from eight figures.

536
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,356
They say they're entitled
to compensation

537
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,992
for what Kenny Law
might have earned

538
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,927
if he'd made it
to the NBA.

539
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,829
And the jury could
go for that.

540
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,898
Listen, their lawyer,
she's gonna try to rattle you.

541
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,432
Can't rattle me.

542
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,434
I did everything I could
to save the boy's life.

543
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,704
I'll page you when they come.

544
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,772
Answer it this time.

545
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,477
Primary surgeon,
Dr. Peter Benton.

546
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:54,881
Attending, Angela Hicks.

547
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,483
Oh, boy. Boy, boy...

548
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,586
♪ Hey papa don't
hey hey hey ♪

549
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,688

551
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:06,026
Alright, come on, do this.

552
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,029
Clinical narrative.

553
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,131
"This patient presented
to the emergency department

554
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,399
"with a gunshot wound
to the right upper quadrant

555
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,569
and a systolic
blood pressure of.."

556
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:17,403
Hey, how you doing?

557
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,772
Dr. Peter Benton.

558
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,707
‐ Vinay Radhakrishnan.
‐ Ah, yeah.

559
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,843
Hey, you know, that's
the way to do it

560
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:24,377
instead of letting
them stack up on you.

561
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,680
It's like falling
off a freight train.

562
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,116
Do you have kids?

563
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,019
Yes. Three boys, two girls.

564
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:34,955
Well, uh, how do you
balance it with work?

565
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:37,758
I mean, if you
don't mind me asking.

566
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,126
My wife handles everything
with the children.

567
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,396
Pardon me, please.

568
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:46,399
"This is Dr. Vinay Radhakrishnan
dictating a discharge summary

569
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,068
"on patient Stella Kline

570
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:51,505
medical record
number 84‐98‐29."

571
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,439
I didn't know what to say.

572
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,941
You know, he was stooped
over with an erection

573
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:56,810
and I needed to
finish the exam.

574
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,178
Don't beat yourself up over it.

575
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,880
You like these
spicy string beans?

576
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,447
Yeah, all of it's good.

577
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,116
‐ How much was it?
‐ No, my treat.

578
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,519
‐ No, how much do I owe you?
‐ Why can't it be my treat?

579
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,420
Thirty dollars?

580
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,122
Where is this place?

581
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,057
On Wacker.

582
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:12,793
Keep spending like
that you're, uh..

583
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,695
you're gonna be in big trouble.

584
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,496
Back at chop, I got
way in over my head

585
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,531
maxed out
on my credit cards‐‐

586
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,965
Mr. Angevine's CT.

587
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:20,200
You're right. It's a pheo.

588
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,035
‐ Yeah?
‐ Good pickup, Dr. Carter.

589
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,704
‐ Whoa.
‐ There it is.

590
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,540
DC the nipride and
start him on phentolamine

591
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,576
five milligrams IV.
I'll call down a surgeon.

592
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,045
‐ Way to go, Dr. Carter.
‐ Uh‐huh.

593
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,947
Here, I owe you
a buck fifty.

594
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,683
I, uh, gotta go check
on my track star.

595
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,730
‐ Ding dongs?
‐ Uh‐huh. Want a bite?

596
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:50,964
No, no. I'll just
watch you eat it.

597
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,701
These are
my all time favorites.

598
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:55,769
When I was in Virginia

599
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,738
they didn't call
them ding dongs.

600
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,139
They called them king dons

601
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,173
only on the package.

602
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,474
All I'm saying, why weren't they

603
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,843
called ding dongs in Virginia?

604
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,045
I mean, look, what law
does that violate, right?

605
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:06,613
What I can't figure out
maybe you can help me

606
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,749
with this...ding dongs,
ho hos, same food

607
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:09,816
just different shape.

608
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,851
How did they get
away with that?

609
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:11,885
That's right.

610
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:12,919
Why are they pretending that

611
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,154
they're two different things?

612
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:16,256
Ding dong, ho ho, conspiracy.

613
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,758
Mark, can I see you
for a minute?

614
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,526
Yeah. Sure.

615
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,927
What's up?

616
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,964
You saw a patient
this morning Marian Rice.

617
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,265
Ah, horny old lady?

618
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,068
Medicare won't
reimburse 100%

619
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,604
unless an attending
has examined the patient

620
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,673
and written out
a note in detail.

621
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:34,575
You walked out in the
middle of the exam.

622
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,643
Ah, who told you that? Jeanie?

623
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:38,512
We can no longer write
seen and agree notes

624
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:39,980
on Medicare patients.

625
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:41,748
You didn't read the memo
I sent out last month?

626
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,149
Which memo was that?

627
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:47,153
Alright. What do I have to do
so that we can get paid?

628
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:48,889
You need to examine this patient

629
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:50,624
and chart your
findings in detail.

630
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,726
If I have to examine
every Medicare patient

631
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,761
that comes in here,
why do we have PAs?

632
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:57,631
‐ This is not about the PAs.
‐ Alright, alright.

633
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:58,765
No problem.

634
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,934
Jeanie, football.

635
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,537
‐ What?
‐ Bears play tonight.

636
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,805
Hey, you wanna get some
squares for Al?

637
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,006
No. We're not gonna
play this week.

638
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,207
Three weeks in a row?
What's up?

639
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,809
Y'all quit rooting
for the Bears?

640
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,210
We're still rooting,
we're just not betting.

641
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:11,678
Okay, well, you know
where you can find the brother.

642
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:12,946
What's all this stuff?

643
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:14,981
Grant applications.
Weaver gave them to me.

644
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,950
Might be a good idea
to start a clinic in the ER.

645
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:17,984
Like Stony Island?

646
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,185
That's where the gangsters go

647
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:21,087
to get their old
bullet wounds looked at.

648
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:23,323
Hey, they got a $100,000
state grant.

649
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,258
So, Weaver's got you
panhandling for her now?

650
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,960
No, it was my idea.

651
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,762
You know, it was a nurse who
started that Wun Zhai clinic.

652
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:30,864
‐ Really?
‐ Yep. ER charge nurse.

653
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:31,998
Mr. Angevine's in shock!

654
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,867
‐ His BP crashed!
‐ My pheo?

655
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,269
He's flossing multiple PVCs
and he's desaturating.

656
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,572
Okay. Get four units of O‐neg
going and pre‐op labs.

657
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:39,906
And find out why a surgeon
is not down here?

658
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,307
‐ What happened?
‐ He's in v‐fib.

659
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,176
‐ Tumor maybe infarcted.
‐ Where's surgery?

660
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,078
‐ Charging, 200.
‐ Clear.

661
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,782
‐ Go again.
‐ Charging, 300.

662
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,216
Clear.

663
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,284
'Let's get ready to move
him into surgery.'

664
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,919
Is this the pheo?

665
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,721
We shocked him out of v‐fib.
You're Dr. Romano?

666
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:55,989
Call me Rocket.
We'll take it from here.

667
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,891
'Dr. Carter made
the diagnosis.'

668
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,961
Great. Come on,
don't wait for me. Let's go.

669
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,095
You ever do one of
these, Dr. Edson?

670
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,597
No. Are you gonna use a scope?

671
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,898
No, we'll do it
the old‐fashioned way.

672
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:05,932
I'll walk you through it.
They're fun.

673
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:08,602
‐ Look out.
‐ Alright.

674
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:09,903
Nice work, Carter.

675
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,171
Thank you.

676
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,575
'Come on, let's go.'

677
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:30,891
I brought you some tea.

678
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,694
Oh. Thanks.

679
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:34,828
This'll be me
in a month's time.

680
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,229
Then you can
return the favor.

681
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,131
Oh, man.

682
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,933
How did the
proctocolectomy go?

683
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:44,337
Ooh, my ileo‐anal pouch
drew rave reviews.

684
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,371
Listen, you've not worked

685
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:46,907
with Dr. Romano, have you?

686
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,242
Rocket Romano?
No, he's never here.

687
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,944
Ten months out of the year,
he's in Europe.

688
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,913
Well, he's performing
an operation tomorrow

689
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,282
with an extraordinary
device, the Aesop 2000.

690
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:59,152
Are you interested in robotics?

691
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,220
No.

692
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:02,388
I can get you in
on the team.

693
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,324
The Aesop's a robotic
arm with a camera.

694
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:06,660
Rocket will be directing it
with a microphone headset.

695
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,328
Like Madonna, or whoever.

696
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,132
Hmm, fascinating.

697
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,000
Uh, how could you
get me on the team?

698
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:16,136
Oh, Rocket's
sponsoring my BTA.

699
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:18,204
‐ BTA?
‐ Been to America.

700
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:20,674
In order to come here,
I needed a sponsor.

701
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:23,877
And now you wanna broaden
my surgical horizons, huh?

702
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,013
You really should
get to know him, Peter.

703
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:29,750
No, no, I, um..

704
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,919
My plate's full.

705
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:35,155
‐ Thank you.
‐ 'Alright.'

706
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:38,058
I'll let you get back
to your beauty sleep then.

707
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,062
Angevine. A‐N‐G‐E‐V‐I‐N‐E.

708
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:44,164
Anybody see a black,
male patient

709
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:45,999
twenty years old,
about six foot three?

710
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,801
‐ No.
‐ You lose somebody?

711
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,036
He might have had on a gray
sweat suit. Nobody saw him?

712
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,739
This is Dr. Carter in the ER.

713
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:54,708
Yeah. I'm trying to find out
about a patient named Angevine.

714
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:57,077
"Emergency excision
of a pheochromocytoma."

715
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,145
Dr. Romano took him up?

716
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,248
Romano.
What's wrong?

717
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:04,150
My testicular
cancer guy ran away.

718
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,819
The oncologist never saw him.

719
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:06,887
You want me to
help you find him?

720
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,288
No. I'll try
this number he gave.

721
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:09,756
I think he lives on campus.

722
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,024
Oh, use this phone.

723
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,325
I'm not getting
anywhere with surgery.

724
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,060
‐ Thanks.
‐ Dr. Carter.

725
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:15,962
I can't find a vein
on the patient in four.

726
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,230
Really?

727
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,099
Well, you see,
he's blown them all.

728
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:20,200
Well, if you'll all excuse me

729
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:21,367
I'm going to put my years

730
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:23,870
of education and training
to the test.

731
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:26,172
By drawing blood
from a heroin addict.

732
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,775
‐ Come on, Ivan.
‐ Is Haleh here?

733
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,911
No. She's sick, remember?

734
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:32,779
No, because, see,
today's Thursday.

735
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,314
Oh, I know, Pablo.

736
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:36,750
Haleh's not here today,
come back tomorrow.

737
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,218
Yeah, okay.
I come back later, huh?

738
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:40,754
No, no, no. Manana.
Friday, okay?

739
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,288
Manana.

740
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:48,795
I told you. You won't
find nothing there.

741
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,297
How long have you been
an IV drug user, Mr. Hayes?

742
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,534
Since 1977.

743
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:54,768
Wow.

744
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,503
There's always a vein somewhere.

745
00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:59,072
Summer of '77.
Never will forget it.

746
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,007
I was over at
Charlie Wilson's house.

747
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,143
Old Charlie boy!

748
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:06,312
Down in the basement, banging.

749
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:09,082
Like we just invented something.

750
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:12,919
Told you you wouldn't find
nothing over there.

751
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:14,454
Hmm.

752
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:17,357
Warm compresses
or a dab of nitro paste

753
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,392
'can dilate a hidden vein,
but before we do that'

754
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,928
let's see if we can find one
in a lower extremity

755
00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:25,532
like the saphenous
vein in the leg.

756
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:28,034
‐ How about the femoral vein?
‐ Nope.

757
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:30,571
Dorsal venous plexus
of the foot?

758
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:33,173
Give it here. I'll find you one.

759
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:39,546
Thank you. Cotton.

760
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,184
Yeah.

761
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,159
‐ Uh..
‐ Oh.

762
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:54,194
Wow.

763
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:01,401
Wow! Don't you ever,
ever try this.

764
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,617
I screwed up.

765
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,953
With my testicular
cancer patient. He ran away.

766
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,922
Ran away?

767
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,423
I sent my student out
to look for him.

768
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:26,192
The guy likes to run
along the lakefront.

769
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:27,594
He's not running anywhere
with those mets in his lungs.

770
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:28,995
Yeah.

771
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,897
I left a message at his dorm.

772
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:34,500
He'll show up,
you know, but, uh..

773
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:36,570
...the thing is,
when we do find him

774
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:39,372
it would be good
if he could talk to a man

775
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,942
about the orchiectomy.

776
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:44,244
If you could explain to him
that his life's not over

777
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,912
just because
he's losing a testicle.

778
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,581
Alright, well. Let me
know when you find him.

779
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:49,249
We got a wild one!

780
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:50,416
Alright. Give it to me.

781
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,352
ALOC, heavy ETOH Odor.

782
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:54,988
Unrousable at scene.
BP 130 over 80.

783
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,023
‐ Let me go!
‐ Sinus rhythm 72.

784
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:58,391
O2 by mask, ten liters.

785
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,927
Go to trauma one.
Cynthia, call security.

786
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,529
We started an IV,
gave d‐50 and

787
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,665
two milligrams of narcan.
No effect.

788
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,167
No signs of trauma on scene,
but he awoke en route

789
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,335
kicked out
the window of the rig.

790
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,137
He's got a nasty lac here!

791
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:12,906
Tough as hell
throwing him into restraints.

792
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,174
Hard leathers!

793
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,576
You can't tie me up like this!

794
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:17,343
We'll need as many
as we can to transfer.

795
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,280
‐ Hold his head down.
‐ Are we ready to move him?

796
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,082
‐ What's his name?
‐ McNamara.

797
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:24,150
Mr. McNamara, you gotta stop
thrashing around.

798
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:25,485
Who are you to tell me?

799
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,120
‐ I was kidnapped from my house.
‐ Listen to me.

800
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:28,221
Ow! Damn you people!

801
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:30,691
'Hold him down.'

802
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,058
Son of a bitch!

803
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:33,627
She bit down on her tongue.

804
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,563
You have no right
to tie me up like this!

805
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:39,299
That's enough!

806
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:41,602
Listen up, you understand!
Don't move!

807
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:43,570
‐ 'Ow!'
‐ 'Don't move!'

808
00:31:43,604 --> 00:31:45,205
‐ 'Mark!'
‐ Shut up and don't move.

809
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,540
Mark!

810
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,443
Go check on Chuny.

811
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:55,949
'Alright, everybody,
we're gonna move him'

812
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:58,051
'on the count of three.'

813
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,285
'Hold him down.'

814
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,688
'One...two...three.'

815
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:04,057
I'm sorry I embarrassed
you, Dr. Carter.

816
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,191
You didn't.

817
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:08,161
Well, I embarrassed myself.

818
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:10,063
You know, you get
used to this stuff, Ivan.

819
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,397
How?

820
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,466
Eventually,
it doesn't faze you.

821
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,301
What if I can't cut it?

822
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:18,171
Well, you need to see more.

823
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:20,273
Get a few more traumas
under your belt.

824
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:23,176
What if my whole life
is a wrong decision?

825
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,012
Yeah.

826
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:31,685
Ah, Dr. Anspaugh.

827
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:33,186
How are those dictations coming?

828
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:34,721
Almost finished,
I wanted to thank you

829
00:32:34,755 --> 00:32:36,256
for giving me time
to get caught up

830
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,991
and to also apologize
for this morning

831
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:39,993
for not being prepared.
It'll never happen again.

832
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,762
I should hope not.

833
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,764
You know, when your, uh..

834
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,198
when your son was in the NICU

835
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,267
everyone gladly bent
over backwards

836
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,170
to accommodate you because
we all felt sympathy

837
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:51,572
'for your situation.'

838
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,239
'But now, your baby's
out of the hospital.'

839
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,175
And as you've probably noted

840
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,044
Dr. Corday has raised
the bar considerably

841
00:32:58,078 --> 00:32:59,145
'for surgical residents.'

842
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,681
Yes. She's talented.

843
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:02,448
If we don't stay on our toes

844
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,618
she could end up
making all of us look bad.

845
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:12,225
Oh man, these
grant applications

846
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,394
are making my
eyes glaze over.

847
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:15,729
What's the nurse's
name at Stony Island

848
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,063
who started up
their clinic?

849
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:18,298
Um, Ellen Buckley?

850
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,633
Maybe she could
show me the ropes.

851
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,334
Oh, I can tell you
how she got her grant.

852
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:22,636
‐ Really?
‐ No big mystery.

853
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,338
Her dad's a state senator.

854
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,773
Dr. Del Amico?

855
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:28,509
Your patient?

856
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,310
Oh, yeah.
That's him, thanks.

857
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:33,146
Hey, Cynthia, can you find
Dr. Ross for me, please?

858
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,347
'Yeah. Right away.'

859
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,550
‐ Hey, Brett.
‐ Hey.

860
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,818
Where'd you go?

861
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,586
Just walking around.

862
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:43,557
Listen, I know
this great doctor.

863
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,458
He's a pediatrician,
but he'd be

864
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,827
a good person to
talk to about all this.

865
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,461
'Any questions
you might have.'

866
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,263
What? You don't wanna
answer any more of my questions?

867
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:51,565
No, I thought you might
be more comfortable

868
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:53,734
with a male doctor.

869
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:56,537
Is he gonna tell me that
my left nut's got to go?

870
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,371
If that's the diagnosis, yes.

871
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,206
I don't care if‐if
it's you or whoever.

872
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,742
I just..

873
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,376
I just needed to walk
around a little bit.

874
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,378
Get this all straight
in my mind, you know?

875
00:34:06,747 --> 00:34:07,781
Okay.

876
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:13,820
So, what do you want me to do?

877
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:15,589
You want me to go
talk to that oncologist?

878
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:18,424
Yeah. I'll, uh, I'll
take you up there now.

879
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,661
Uh, do you have
any family in the area?

880
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:22,829
Uh, yeah. Milwaukee.

881
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:26,232
You should call them.

882
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,749
Hey. Can I bum one?

883
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:43,750
Yeah.

884
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,420
You know, that was so great

885
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,322
the way you handled
that drunken jerk.

886
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:51,357
Uh, I don't know
about that.

887
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,459
Hey, nobody else
could get him under control.

888
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:54,761
You did,
I was watching.

889
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:56,462
Yeah, well.

890
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:01,434
Can I tell you something, Mark?

891
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:02,503
Mm‐hmm.

892
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:03,704
I understated before

893
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,506
when I said that
I give good back rubs.

894
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:07,407
I give really great back rubs.

895
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,809
It's one of
the things I'm best at.

896
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:10,744
Want me to show you?

897
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,245
Here?

898
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,248
Turn around.

899
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:23,757
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh, man, you are so tight.

900
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,627
I knew you'd have a really
strong back, though.

901
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,229
That feels great.

902
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,169
It's Alan McConagha.

903
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:38,939
‐ Huh?
‐ The hospital lawyer.

904
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:41,642
I'd better get going.

905
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:43,276
Can I walk with you?

906
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,444
Sure.

907
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,752
I could never do this.
What was I thinking?

908
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:52,819
What'd you say?

909
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,688
Nothing.

910
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:56,489
Still thinking
about a clinic, huh?

911
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:58,358
You could spend half your life
trying to get this money.

912
00:35:58,391 --> 00:35:59,560
Yeah, if you go
to the government.

913
00:35:59,593 --> 00:36:02,596
You should look into
private foundations.

914
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:05,566
‐ Private?
‐ Yeah. Yeah?

915
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,401
No, no, no, I just wanna
know if Thomas Angevine

916
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:10,504
is out of surgery or not.

917
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:12,839
I was just on hold.
I was just on hold.

918
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,374
Private foundations?

919
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,777
Yeah. They exist pretty
much to give money away.

920
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,978
It's that or pay taxes.

921
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:19,613
Do you think a
private foundation

922
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:21,715
would consider this clinic?

923
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,552
You should hear some of the
nutty ideas that get pitched

924
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:26,587
to my grandmother.

925
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,889
I.. wait a second. Yeah.

926
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:30,891
What do you mean,
nobody knows?

927
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:33,259
Just go down the hall!
Wait, wait, no, no, no.

928
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:35,261
Just tell me what OR they're in.

929
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:36,863
Okay. Thank you.

930
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:38,599
Your grandmother's involved
in a foundation?

931
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:39,933
Yeah, yeah.

932
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,702
I gotta go to surgery.

933
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:44,437
Wait, Carter. Do you think
your grandmother would consider

934
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,772
this clinic idea?

935
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:46,807
If you put something
down on paper

936
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,275
she'd probably look at it, yeah.

937
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:53,614
Have there been previous
lawsuits alleging

938
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:55,816
malpractice by you, Dr. Greene?

939
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:57,684
Yes. One.

940
00:36:57,718 --> 00:37:00,286
Isn't it true that
in the spring of 1995

941
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,324
a Mrs. Jodi O'Brian,
a healthy 29‐year‐old woman

942
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:05,692
pregnant with her first child

943
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,961
died as a result
of your misdiagnosis?

944
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:09,362
No. Her medical course was‐‐

945
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,430
Mark..

946
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:12,265
You answered the question.

947
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:14,267
'Following the death
of Mrs. O'Brian'

948
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,469
did you express feelings
of guilt to co‐workers?

949
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:17,671
Not that I recall.

950
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:19,372
'Did you, in fact,
feel guilty?'

951
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,607
Guilty? No.

952
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,042
'What word would describe your'

953
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,744
'state of mind
regarding her death?'

954
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:25,411
‐ Regret.
‐ Huh.

955
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:27,814
Is it fair to say that
this regretful feeling

956
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:29,015
'reflected an awareness
of the quality'

957
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,450
'of care you provided?'

958
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:31,952
No. It happens here
all the time.

959
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:33,687
People die,
we feel horrible.

960
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,455
Did you feel horrible
after the death of Kenny Law?

961
00:37:35,488 --> 00:37:36,723
Hell, no.

962
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:38,491
Mr. Law, you're
here as a courtesy.

963
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:40,293
Look, we can cut
this short right now.

964
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,696
Please refrain
from commenting.

965
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:44,731
I put a question
to you, Dr. Greene.

966
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:48,434
Ask it again.

967
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,771
Did you feel horrible
after Kenny Law died

968
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:52,639
after being treated
by you in this hospital?

969
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,074
I felt regret, yes.

970
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,842
Had you applied the same
standard of care

971
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,611
to Kenny Law as
to the white teenager

972
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:59,312
'brought into the emergency
room five minutes before?'

973
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:00,881
‐ Yes.
‐ That's a damn lie!

974
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:02,716
Oh, Miss Davis, do something
about your client please.

975
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:03,950
‐ Chris, will you be quiet.
‐ He knows it's a lie.

976
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:04,985
You be quiet!

977
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:06,419
You're in no position to accuse

978
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,688
me of anything!

979
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:09,289
You, of all people.

980
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,697
Dr. Greene, do you hold
the life of a young black man

981
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,899
to be of lesser value than
the life of a white person?

982
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:20,366
What kind of question is that?

983
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,702
Will you answer it?

984
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,870
People die. I'm human.
I'm fallible.

985
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,371
So, you'd characterize
yourself are fallible.

986
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:26,740
Don't twist my words around.

987
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:28,341
'Let me ask you about
this fallibility.'

988
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:31,344
When this young black man
was brought into the ER‐‐

989
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:32,879
You want me to say
that I'm a racist, is that it?

990
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:33,914
I'm a racist, alright?

991
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:35,015
Does that makes you feel better

992
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:36,583
about almost beating me
to death?

993
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:37,884
'Mark, sit down and shut up.'

994
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:39,052
Is that gonna bring
your son back?

995
00:38:39,085 --> 00:38:40,554
Hey, don't point at my mother!

996
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:41,688
That's it!
We're taking a break.

997
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:42,989
We're stopping this right now.

998
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:44,891
Talking about regret.
Regret.

999
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,627
You never expressed
any regrets to my mother.

1000
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,761
You belong in jail.

1001
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:48,795
I wish it was me who kicked

1002
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,396
your white ass!

1003
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:58,572
Dr. Carter,
coming back to surgery?

1004
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:00,507
I just came to pay a visit.

1005
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,576
Oh. We miss you up here.

1006
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:03,944
Did you work on this
pheo with Dr. Romano?

1007
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:06,547
Yes. Dr. Edson
did the procedure.

1008
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,749
‐ He did?
‐ Are you looking for him?

1009
00:39:08,782 --> 00:39:11,051
I think he's
in the waiting room.

1010
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:13,019
Okay. Thanks.

1011
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:15,388
Honey, settle.
Thank him, sweetie.

1012
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:16,790
This is the doctor
that saved your daddy's life.

1013
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:19,059
‐ Thank you, doctor.
‐ Hey.

1014
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:21,494
I heard Dr. Romano
let you do the procedure.

1015
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,797
That's right. I was just saying,
it was a total success.

1016
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,065
So when can I see Tom?

1017
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:26,499
He's just been
moved down to ICU.

1018
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:27,634
I can take you down there,
if you'd like.

1019
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:28,802
Uh‐huh. Great.

1020
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:30,136
Hi. I'm Dr. Carter.

1021
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,105
Oh, were you part
of the surgical team?

1022
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:34,841
Uh, no, I wasn't.

1023
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,510
I‐I actually saw
your husband when he came

1024
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:37,644
into the emergency room.

1025
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:38,845
Oh.

1026
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:41,682
Well, I'm glad
everything went alright.

1027
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,116
‐ Thanks.
‐ ICU is this way.

1028
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:44,618
Oh, thanks so much, Dr. Edson.

1029
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,419
Come on, sweetie.

1030
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:59,866
I'll be leaving on time,
so what? I'll meet you there.

1031
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,735
‐ Last call for football.
‐ Okay, see you soon.

1032
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:05,005
‐ Hi there, Pablo.
‐ Is Haleh here?

1033
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:06,607
No. I'm gonna do you this time.

1034
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,642
‐ Haleh not here.
‐ No. You got Carol today.

1035
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:09,710
‐ Oh, Carol.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1036
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:11,878
Oh, okay.

1037
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:14,447
Mark. Hey. How'd it go
with the lawyer?

1038
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,482
‐ I don't know.
‐ You leaving?

1039
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:17,651
‐ Yeah.
‐ Hang on ten minutes.

1040
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:19,019
I'll go with you.

1041
00:40:19,052 --> 00:40:20,721
See you tomorrow, Doug.

1042
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,456
You know what, Liz?

1043
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,558
I'm thinking I'm gonna want you

1044
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:25,792
handling the laser tomorrow.

1045
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:27,561
While you control
the Aesop 2000?

1046
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:28,662
Terrific.

1047
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:30,030
Don't act too surprised.

1048
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:31,497
Ah. Peter. That's fantastic.

1049
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:32,833
Now I get to introduce you.

1050
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:34,701
Peter Benton,
Rocket Romano.

1051
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:36,803
Dr. Benton. Hey!

1052
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:38,639
‐ Lizzy's talked about you.
‐ It's a pleasure.

1053
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,607
Tell me something.

1054
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:42,909
You think Chris Rock is funny?

1055
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,646
‐ Excuse me?
‐ The comedian, Chris Rock?

1056
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,713
Did that HBO special.

1057
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:48,214
Must have used the "N" word..

1058
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:50,016
...fifty times.
"N" word this, "N" word that.

1059
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,618
They're calling him a genius.

1060
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:52,886
If I went around
saying the "N" word

1061
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:53,920
you'd probably wanna
smack the hell

1062
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:55,656
out of me, am I right?

1063
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:57,958
I think Chris Rock is hilarious.

1064
00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:02,696
‐ Good to meet you.
‐ Have a good night.

1065
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,167
You're right.
I like him.

1066
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:11,945
Feeling better now, Pablo?

1067
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:13,680
Yeah, I'm feeling better now.

1068
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:14,781
All nice and clean?

1069
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:16,550
Yeah.

1070
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:19,253
Now Haleh listens
to my chest.

1071
00:41:19,286 --> 00:41:20,520
Why?

1072
00:41:20,554 --> 00:41:22,322
So my pneumonia
doesn't come back.

1073
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,457
You had pneumonia?

1074
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,226
Yeah, twice.

1075
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,594
Okay.

1076
00:41:27,627 --> 00:41:28,828
I want you to take
a nice, deep breath

1077
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,730
for me, alright?

1078
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:33,633
And again.

1079
00:41:35,835 --> 00:41:38,938
‐ Sounds good.
‐ Uh‐huh.

1080
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:40,907
Pablo?

1081
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,443
If there was a clinic
in the emergency room

1082
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:45,779
where you could get checkups
and medicine if you needed it.

1083
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:48,382
‐ Uh‐huh.
‐ Do you think you'd come?

1084
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:50,917
‐ Free clinic?
‐ Yeah.

1085
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,487
‐ Would Haleh be there?
‐ I bet she would.

1086
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,755
I'd like it. Yeah,
I would come. Uh‐huh.

1087
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:56,956
Okay, Pablo.

1088
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:04,431
‐ Hey, Carter.
‐ Hi.

1089
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:06,900
Anything new and exciting
happening in the ER?

1090
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:09,869
Oh, I diagnosed
a pheochromocytoma.

1091
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,738
‐ You serious?
‐ Patient crashed.

1092
00:42:11,771 --> 00:42:13,573
They took him up to surgery.

1093
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:15,709
Dale did the procedure,
but I hear he did pretty good.

1094
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,577
Ah, Dale's a weasel.

1095
00:42:17,611 --> 00:42:19,479
Excuse me?

1096
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:22,849
Carter, you're twice
the surgeon Dale will ever be.

1097
00:42:22,882 --> 00:42:24,318
Thanks.

1098
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,253
Busy day for you?

1099
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:27,921
Yeah. Anspaugh
got on my case

1100
00:42:27,954 --> 00:42:29,689
about some
delinquent charts.

1101
00:42:29,723 --> 00:42:31,291
Bummer.

1102
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:32,692
So, you enjoying fatherhood?

1103
00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:37,664
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1104
00:42:37,697 --> 00:42:39,966
Goodnight, Carter.

1105
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,402
Goodnight.

1106
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,703
Congratulations, my man.

1107
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:45,539
Yeah, my luck's changing.

1108
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:46,906
Send over two ginger ales.

1109
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,442
'You got it.'

1110
00:42:51,678 --> 00:42:53,480
I thought it was
gonna be no gambling.

1111
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:57,617
Well, it's just a ball pool.

1112
00:42:57,651 --> 00:42:59,619
You're not gonna complain now.
It's 200 bucks.

1113
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:02,822
We just have to be
careful with our money.

1114
00:43:02,856 --> 00:43:05,659
Don't‐don't spoil
this for me, okay?

1115
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:10,430
Billy Nelson just came in.

1116
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:13,032
‐ Give me a cold one.
‐ 'Sure.'

1117
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:14,268
Thanks.

1118
00:43:17,671 --> 00:43:20,440
You talked to him
since the accident?

1119
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:22,509
About what?

1120
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:24,911
The drugs he has to take
over the next six months

1121
00:43:24,944 --> 00:43:28,682
'in the off chance
I gave him HIV?'

1122
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:30,517
‐ 'I haven't talked to him.'
‐ He's staring at us.

1123
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,818
I'm gonna go say something.

1124
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:33,887
Just drink your‐your
ginger ale, okay?

1125
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,954
But he's your friend, Al.

1126
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,756
That's how I know.

1127
00:43:38,758 --> 00:43:40,694
If I was in his place..

1128
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:46,466
'Hey, Al, how'd you get it?'

1129
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,702
Hey, Al, how'd you get it?

1130
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:51,771
In the arm? Huh?

1131
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:52,872
You get it through the vein

1132
00:43:52,906 --> 00:43:54,441
or you get it through the booty?

1133
00:43:54,474 --> 00:43:56,476
'I wanna know!'

1134
00:43:57,811 --> 00:43:58,778
Huh?

1135
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,681
Bill, just come over
here and let's talk.

1136
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:03,683
Sit down, bitch!
I ain't talking to you.

1137
00:44:03,717 --> 00:44:05,785
What? Who the hell do you
think you're talking to, man?

1138
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:06,886
That's my wife!

1139
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,788
You're gonna try
and be a man, now?

1140
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:10,357
Yes, that's right.
You shut your mouth!

1141
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,991
...got AIDS,
and gave it to your wife!

1142
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,693
You tried to give it to me!

1143
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:15,395
Hey! Not in here, fellas.
Not in here!

1144
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:16,563
Al, please, take me home.

1145
00:44:16,596 --> 00:44:17,797
That's right,
get the hell out of here

1146
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:19,466
before I do
what I feel like doing.

1147
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:21,801
‐ Move away. Al, please.
‐ What you wanna do?

1148
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:23,770
What?

1149
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:27,841
That's what I thought.

1150
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,975
Faggot!

1151
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:31,978
Wait!

1152
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:34,047
‐ Okay, now, come on!
‐ Come on!

1153
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:36,049
Don't, Al!

1154
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:38,852
Stop it!

1155
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,987
Stop it!

1156
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,856
'Stop it, Al!'

1157
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:47,827
'Stop it.
Al, stop it!'

1158
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:55,369
Stop it, Al.
Stop it.
