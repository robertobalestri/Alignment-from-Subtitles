1
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,696
Carter. Carter!

2
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:15,032
Carter, wake up!

3
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,201
Yeah.

4
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:17,716
GSW. To the head coming in.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,611
Benton's in surgery,
and Greene's got an MI.

6
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:21,780
Carter!

7
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:22,949
What?!

8
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:24,129
Let's go!

9
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:25,488
Oh, God.

10
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:35,909
Ouch!

11
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:38,215
Put a .357 in his mouth
and pulled the trigger.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,552
It isn't pretty.

13
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:41,400
Two large bore
IVs, 15 liters O2.

14
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:43,460
BP's 80/50... Ready?
One, two, three!

15
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:44,963
Cynotic. Blood loss?

16
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:46,399
At least a liter.

17
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:47,613
Where's Benton?

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,104
He's still with
that knife wound.

19
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:50,775
Hey, we need a doctor in here!

20
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,996
There's no gray matter up here.

21
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:55,397
Pupils mid-range and sluggish.

22
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,387
Today's my last day.

23
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:57,890
Where's his face?

24
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,393
Left it on the dining room wall.

25
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,831
Oh, sweet Jesus!

26
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:02,867
Oh, God!

27
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:06,175
Ma'am? Ma'am, please.

28
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,214
I didn't think he knew
where I kept my gun.

29
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,562
Okay. Pulse ox 70.

30
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:12,221
He's going to need an airway.

31
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:13,856
You've done it.
I've only watched.

32
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:15,561
Get somebody down here<i> now.</i>

33
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:18,563
Who? If they've got on
a white coat, tackle them.

34
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:21,975
Oh, boy. I hope medical
malpractice covers this, huh?

35
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,728
Okay. 7.5 ET Tube.

36
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:25,048
Suction.

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,199
No, no... Damn it,
I can't see a thing.

38
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:29,574
Bag him.

39
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:32,013
PCO-2's 60.

40
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:33,198
PO-2's 55.

41
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,902
PH is 7.20.

42
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:36,083
Wet rales, diminished
breath sounds.

43
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:37,457
Where the hell is everybody?!

44
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:38,922
He's hypoxic as
hell. He needs a crike.

45
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:41,549
I can't do it. Really, I can't.

46
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:44,824
Well, somebody do something.

47
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:51,822
All right. Get the crike tray.

48
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,186
Versed, Norcuron?

49
00:01:58,221 --> 00:01:59,699
No, no, no, no.
If I paralyze him,

50
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:01,337
I don't get the
crike, then he dies.

51
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:03,998
Okay, drape. Drape!

52
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,720
Could someone please
hand me a sterile drape!

53
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:17,505
Is that the membrane? Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:19,029
Horizontal or vertical?

55
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,613
Horizontal.<i> No...</i>
vertical skin incision first,

56
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:24,185
then cut horizontally
through the membrane.

57
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,371
I'm sure.

58
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,814
Thyroid's got to be
in there somewhere.

59
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,996
Okay, horizontal.

60
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,189
All right, Carter,
give me the bullet.

61
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:34,207
14-Year-old with a
self-inflicted GSW. To the mouth.

62
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,532
He's had four units.

63
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,001
BP's 70/50. Uh... pulse is 54.

64
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,206
Tried to intubate him,
but there was too much

65
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,055
blood and tissue
occluding his airway.

66
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,160
Just about to start a
crike thyroid on him.

67
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:45,052
All right, all right.
You paralyze him?

68
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,132
No. Good boy, good boy.

69
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:48,626
All right.

70
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:51,482
Skin hook.

71
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:53,314
Come on, come
on. 6.0 Trach tube.

72
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:54,806
Let's move.

73
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,545
Call radiology, let them know
he's on his way with a CT.

74
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:00,318
Bag him.

75
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:02,255
Come on. Let's move.

76
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,791
All right, let's pack it.

77
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,262
Stop all this bleeding.

78
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,718
So you were going
to do the crike?

79
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:11,558
Yeah.

80
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:12,794
Huh.

81
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,047
All right. Malik?

82
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:15,128
Yo.

83
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:16,418
Get head and neck out of bed.

84
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:17,933
This is their lucky day. Got it.

85
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,225
Wrong choice?

86
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:20,789
Nope. All right,
come on, people,

87
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,081
let's go, let's get him up,

88
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:23,718
let's get him up, move.

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,868
Last day, right?

90
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,961
All right, don't forget to turn
in your lab coat and your ID.

91
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:39,017
You'll get your deposit back.

92
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:40,493
Chloe, you need
to do the laundry.

93
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:43,265
The detergent's
in the closet, okay?

94
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,902
Oh, my God.

95
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:47,708
Chloe, can you hear me? Please?

96
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:51,215
She's finally asleep.

97
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,721
Were you up all
night again? Sorry.

98
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:57,762
Oh, gosh, I hope it stops
raining before the wedding.

99
00:05:57,798 --> 00:06:01,638
I don't think I'm
going to make it.

100
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:03,073
Yes.

101
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,910
Chloe, yes, you are.

102
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:06,760
I'm not strong enough, Suz.

103
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,653
Chloe, you're doing great.

104
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,423
Listen. I'm already
running late.

105
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,659
Please do the laundry.

106
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:13,329
The machines are
in the basement.

107
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,443
The wedding starts at 5:00,

108
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:15,901
so I have to be
back here by 3:00.

109
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:17,237
Start getting ready, okay?

110
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:19,007
Bye, little one.

111
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,145
3:00.

112
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,582
3:00, Right?

113
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,035
Yeah.

114
00:06:32,822 --> 00:06:34,769
Car TC, no seat belt.
Complain of chest pains

115
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,639
Somebody give
me a damn cigarette!

116
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,631
IV started.

117
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,470
Well, go see her.
Tell her how you feel.

118
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:42,875
Well, I'd have to<i>
know</i> how I feel.

119
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,945
Oh.

120
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,147
Yeah. Oh.

121
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:46,783
Maybe it's for the best.

122
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:47,931
Except for Jake.

123
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:49,422
Yeah, yeah.

124
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,026
Well, except for Rachel.

125
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,428
Yes.

126
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:53,765
Who are they?

127
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,606
Ah, new meat...
medical students.

128
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,621
This way, children. Follow me.

129
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,626
Mark, a drunk MVA in Trauma One.

130
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,556
Carter, the attempted suicide's
mother's still down here.

131
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,560
Get her up to the
OR waiting room.

132
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:08,563
How is he?

133
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,601
Tell her he's in surgery.

134
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:12,951
I'm sorry to hear
about your mother.

135
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:13,942
Yeah, thanks.

136
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:16,213
Carter, I need your
course evaluation by noon.

137
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:17,727
My what? Course evaluation.

138
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:20,100
Your assessment of
your E.R. trauma rotation.

139
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:21,590
I get to grade you?

140
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:24,943
Just get a form from Rolando
and put it in Dr. Hicks's box.

141
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,280
Is he joking? Nope.

142
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:28,406
Oh, there is a God.

143
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:30,739
Pulse is thready
at 120, resps 36.

144
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:32,230
She's shocky, 70/50.

145
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,945
Hit a parked
car... no seat belt.

146
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:35,939
Bent the steering
wheel of her Buick.

147
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:37,107
Name's Bonnie Curtis.

148
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:39,156
No sign of head trauma.

149
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,152
Pulse ox is 85.
Glucose is normal at 110.

150
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:44,167
Bonnie? Bonnie, do
you know where you are?

151
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:45,660
Whew, God!

152
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:47,029
Ooh, she's drunk.

153
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:48,231
Oh, yeah.

154
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,701
I need a cigarette.

155
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,773
Bonnie, do you
know where you are?

156
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,944
Somebody, get me
a damn cigarette!

157
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,382
CBC, chem 7,
cardiac enzymes, EKG.

158
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:57,651
Blood alcohol?

159
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:58,753
I need a cigarette.

160
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,158
Sure. Get a chest and a
cross table C-spine going<i> now.</i>

161
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:02,741
"The resident helped you

162
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,944
achieve competency
with procedures."

163
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,236
Yes, he did.

164
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:07,840
That's a four.

165
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:12,183
"The resident made himself
available to answer questions."

166
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:13,953
No. Two?

167
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,289
I'd go for a one.

168
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,537
Really? Seems kind of harsh.

169
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:17,972
We're talking about Benton here.

170
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:20,767
One.

171
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:23,907
"The resident provided you
with constructive comments

172
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:26,313
and criticism of
your performance."

173
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:27,315
Constructive.

174
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,885
Do they have negative numbers?

175
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,887
There's a zero.

176
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:30,889
Hey, hey, hey.

177
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,058
Zero it is.

178
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,060
That's it.

179
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,830
What's the total?

180
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,434
Sixteen.

181
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,205
Out of a possible...?

182
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,441
Forty.

183
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:42,258
Hmm. Maybe I ought to go
a little easier on him, huh?

184
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:45,152
He had to turn in his
evaluation of you last week.

185
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:46,355
16 it is.

186
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,958
Where's Dr. Hicks's box?

187
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,445
What have we got?

188
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,427
Single car accident.
No seat belt.

189
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,197
Hit the steering wheel. Drunk.

190
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,235
He's shocky, but
I'm not sure why.

191
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,360
Internal bleeding?

192
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:59,868
Abdomen's soft, nontender.
No rebound or guarding.

193
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,420
Normal bowel sounds.

194
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,760
Pulse ox is 85,
but she's a smoker.

195
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:06,626
PO2's 70 on room air.

196
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,118
Resps are high.

197
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,088
No widened
mediastinum or apical cap.

198
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:11,926
Ruptured aorta
is highly unlikely.

199
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:13,763
Could be a mild
myocardial contusion or MI.

200
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,746
I'm thinking pulmonary embolus.

201
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,717
Resps are high, tachy, low PO2.

202
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:19,576
This woman is drunk
at 7:00 in the morning.

203
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:21,547
It's probably just
alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

204
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:22,767
I'd like to get a VQ scan.

205
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:23,864
You're grasping at straws.

206
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:26,208
Give her thiamine,
folate, multi-vits.

207
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:27,610
Rehydrate her with D5 NS.

208
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:29,647
Support her pressure
with dopamine

209
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,552
and then admit her to telemetry

210
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,289
for serial EKGs and enzymes.

211
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:39,268
Get her to Radiology
and get a VQ scan.

212
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:43,710
Do Swift's orders
and scan her anyway.

213
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:46,127
Hi, Caleb.

214
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,586
I'm Dr. Ross.

215
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,459
This is Dr. Carter,
and you have a fever.

216
00:09:50,494 --> 00:09:53,098
101. No cough,
no abdominal pain.

217
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,446
Mm-hmm. I feel okay.

218
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,216
He just finished
a round of chemo.

219
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,620
Look for a bacterial
focus of the infection.

220
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:00,391
You been around any sick people?

221
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:02,000
It's probably just the Hickman.

222
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,637
That's what happened last time.

223
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:04,956
Catheter? Is it sore?

224
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:06,359
Yeah. It's always sore.

225
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:08,731
It's no big deal.
Sarah just freaks out.

226
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:09,995
I was scared, Caleb.

227
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,915
Did you call your parents
and tell them you're here?

228
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:13,590
Now, Sarah did the right thing.

229
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,564
After chemo, your body
doesn't want to fight infection.

230
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:17,678
CBC plus differential,

231
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:19,046
blood cultures times three,

232
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:19,804
urine culture,

233
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,358
throat swab, a chest film.

234
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:22,727
What else, Dr. Carter?

235
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:24,113
I'd do an LP.

236
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:25,633
I don't want a spinal tap!

237
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,804
I just had one. I don't
need another one.

238
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,952
Why a tap, Carter?

239
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:30,544
Irritability, and/or lethargy

240
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,247
are early signs of meningitis.

241
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,146
Yes, see, the
deal is this, Caleb:

242
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,585
You're not lethargic,
but you are irritable.

243
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:39,123
Now, that could either
be a sign of meningitis

244
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:40,549
or just your personality.

245
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:41,979
So, I tell you what
we're gonna do:

246
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:43,549
We're gonna wait
a couple of minutes,

247
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:44,618
take a look at some tests

248
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,490
and if you're still
being a pain in the ass,

249
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:49,567
then we're going to
give you the tap, okay?

250
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:51,823
Broad-spectrum antibiotics?

251
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:53,076
Mm-hmm, yep.

252
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,579
Gentamicin, 80mgs

253
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:57,168
Oxacillin, one
gram, Piperacillin,

254
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:58,922
1.5 grams, IV,

255
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:00,770
and find out who's
on call for oncology.

256
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,077
Peter.

257
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,018
Hey.

258
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,054
Hi.

259
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,704
I called you.

260
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,474
You, uh, you get my messages?

261
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:13,335
Yeah, I'm sorry. I've
been working a lot.

262
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,174
Yeah. And you really
shouldn't call me at home.

263
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:20,483
Uh... we need to talk.

264
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,454
All right.

265
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:24,426
Lunch?

266
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:26,430
All right. We'll talk.

267
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:28,333
Yeah.

268
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,171
Okay. See you then.

269
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:35,883
You paged me, Doctor.

270
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,889
Saddle embolus.

271
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:41,161
You ordered
pulmonary angiography.

272
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:42,497
Yes.

273
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,714
Before or after you went
ahead and scanned her?

274
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,542
BP Was falling,
increased respiratory rate,

275
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:50,348
rising PCO-2,
falling PO-2 and pH.

276
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,352
S-one, Q-three on the EKG.

277
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:54,222
Did you book an O.R.?

278
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,692
Mm-hmm.

279
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,774
Well, what are you waiting for?

280
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,600
Go ahead, move her!

281
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,836
Go! Go!

282
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,278
Good work.

283
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:05,647
Thanks.

284
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:08,487
We got served today
on your pre-eclampsia.

285
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:09,989
Malpractice suit.

286
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:11,426
Jody O'Brien?

287
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:14,966
Yeah. Wrongful death, pain
and suffering... the usual.

288
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:18,341
What, you didn't
think they would?

289
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:21,163
Wasn't sure.

290
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,233
Oh. Come see me later.

291
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:25,004
We'll talk it out.

292
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,631
Get some blood culture, Bonnie.

293
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:58,894
What medications are
you taking, Mr. Allison?

294
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:00,564
DDC, Bactrim, AZT,

295
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:03,035
Fluconazole and Rifabutin.

296
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:06,509
Let's start hydration
with D5 NS, 300cc's.

297
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,447
Susan, what do you got?

298
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:10,362
End-stage AIDS patient.

299
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:12,868
Multiple meds, temp 101, tachy.

300
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,030
"History of GI lymphoma,
PCP pneumonia, Kaposi's

301
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:19,470
AIDS dementia, oral thrush,
cryptococcal meningitis."

302
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:21,709
He has high-pitched bowel sounds

303
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:24,514
tenderness, distention,
hepatosplenomegaly

304
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,987
positive guaiac, no
recent stool or gas.

305
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,869
He's vomiting blood and bile.

306
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,973
Started a 300cc fluid challenge.

307
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:33,200
Okay, let's get a
KUB, lateral decubitus,

308
00:13:33,236 --> 00:13:35,621
chest films, blood
cultures times three

309
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:38,094
including microbacteria,
fungal and CMV,

310
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,782
CBC, chem 24, urine, and
let's get an NG tube down now.

311
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:41,980
He's all yours.

312
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:42,971
All right.

313
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,708
Morphine four IV.

314
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:46,957
We suspect he has
a bowel obstruction

315
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:50,153
from enlarged lymph nodes
due to recurrent lymphoma.

316
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:51,890
This is Dr. Benton.

317
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:53,259
He's the surgical resident.

318
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:55,609
Oh. Is-is he going
to need surgery?

319
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,599
Maybe.

320
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,536
We'll try drugs
and hydration first.

321
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,176
Thanks.

322
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:02,879
All right, let's get
some Neupogen.

323
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:05,586
300 mikes to stimulate
neutrophil growth.

324
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:07,824
See if we can't
get some of those

325
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:10,530
good white blood
cells going again, huh?

326
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:12,579
I know what neutrophils are.

327
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,817
Do I have to stay
in the hospital?

328
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,108
Well, it's too early to say.

329
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:17,278
We're going to have wait

330
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:19,282
and see if you respond
to the antibiotics.

331
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,586
Let me know how he's
doing in a couple of hours.

332
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:24,192
Okay. Dr. Carter is going
to keep an eye on you

333
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,740
and I'll be back, all right?

334
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:30,640
Last time I got a rash
from the antibiotics.

335
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:33,212
Do you need anything?

336
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,784
You don't have to leave, too?!

337
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:37,788
He's just trying
to be nice, Caleb.

338
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,057
Shut up, fat Sarah!

339
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:40,394
Hey.

340
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,709
No, actually, I don't
have to be anywhere.

341
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,101
Today is my last day.

342
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:46,379
I can be anywhere I want.

343
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:52,101
Okay. See you later.

344
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:54,238
I'm bored.

345
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:57,446
Well, I could get you
a VCR from Pediatrics.

346
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,450
You could watch a video.

347
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:01,253
I don't want to watch TV.

348
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,657
I'm sick of TV.

349
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:06,650
Last chance.

350
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,645
Suit yourself.

351
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:19,092
Temp's 102.

352
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:22,734
BP's still 70/50.

353
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:27,243
We're not seeing much
progress, Mr. Warren.

354
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:28,747
Do you have power of attorney

355
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,416
to make decisions for Mr. Thomas

356
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:31,686
in situations like this?

357
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,367
I don't know; his mother does.

358
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,027
We should call her.

359
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:36,062
I already have.

360
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:40,254
What do you want to do?

361
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,308
Well, if the bowel
obstruction doesn't clear,

362
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:43,979
we're going to
resolve with surgery.

363
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:45,292
A colostomy?

364
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:46,551
Yes.

365
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:49,774
Yeah. We've had a lot
of friends go though this.

366
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,763
How soon can his
mother get here?

367
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:55,437
What? Can it wait?

368
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:58,109
Not long, no.

369
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,923
I'll, uh, I'll go
call her again.

370
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,813
Hey! Thought you
were a bridesmaid.

371
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,272
On my way out.

372
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,154
So it's a late
afternoon wedding?

373
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:15,679
As if you didn't know.

374
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,295
Got an unconscious
geezer in Two.

375
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,987
Four martini lunch
I'm already off.

376
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:20,334
With a belly ache in Five.

377
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,026
Carter, I got a drunk in Five.

378
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,874
Whatever happened
to the practice

379
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:25,345
of Pediatrics around here?

380
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:26,336
Carter...

381
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,874
I turned in my course
evaluation this morning.

382
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:30,778
It is in Dr. Hicks's box.

383
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,760
Yeah, yeah, fine.
Look, Wilkins decided

384
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,264
to take the orthopedic sub-I,

385
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:36,034
so the surgical
sub-I is left open.

386
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:37,904
Left us hanging.
You want it or not?

387
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:38,895
In the E.R.?

388
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,577
Yeah. Look, I mean,
hurry. Yes or no?

389
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:41,568
I got it?! Carter...

390
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:42,815
Yeah, yeah, I
want it, I want it.

391
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,252
Definitely want it.
Okay, okay, okay.

392
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:45,577
September 5, 5:00 a.m.

393
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:47,614
Don't be late. Okay, thank you!

394
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:53,960
Oh, oh...

395
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,099
Excuse me.

396
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,172
Get drunk for me.

397
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,276
Free champagne?
You can count on it.

398
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,580
Rolando!

399
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:03,726
What?

400
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,354
What happened to all the
stuff that was in Dr. Hicks's box?

401
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:09,026
My course evaluation that I
turned in this morning is gone!

402
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,076
She cleaned out her
box a couple minutes ago.

403
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,612
It finally stopped
raining? Hours ago.

404
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:13,603
Have fun!

405
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:14,706
You know we will, girl.

406
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:18,458
Is there anybody who
isn't going to this wedding?

407
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:21,486
Just us... the sick,
the lame, the uninvited.

408
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,225
Oh, I'm a dead man.

409
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,753
Ah, here it is.

410
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:35,244
Do I need an attorney?

411
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:37,336
The hospital will handle it.

412
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:38,907
My wife's an attorney.

413
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:40,444
She may want someone

414
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,593
to take a look at
it independently.

415
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:44,085
It's your money.

416
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,096
Thanks.

417
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:50,733
Is that it?

418
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:53,003
No. I've decided
to take a chance.

419
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,576
Sign off on you as
attending for next year.

420
00:17:57,615 --> 00:17:59,585
Show of appreciation
is customary.

421
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:07,535
I have to talk to my wife.

422
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,870
Fair enough.

423
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:11,777
I'll need to know by tomorrow.

424
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:21,531
Thank you.

425
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:33,657
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

426
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:36,095
She knew, Peter.

427
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,066
Yeah, but look, we...

428
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:41,941
Sorry.

429
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:46,250
I can't do this.

430
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:48,322
Do what?

431
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:53,883
I like you, Peter,
but I-I... I don't know.

432
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,555
I think this is
about your mother.

433
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,343
Hmm.

434
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,365
We'd like to think that, huh?

435
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,931
Chloe, I am so late.

436
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:26,603
Could you grab a
half-slip and some-some...

437
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,273
hose out of, out of, uh...

438
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:31,614
Gosh, I, uh... I think
they're in the second drawer.

439
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,790
Oh, Chloe, I asked
you to do the laundry.

440
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:39,631
I don't even have a dry towel.

441
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,967
Chloe.

442
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:42,470
Chloe?

443
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,642
Chloe?

444
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:49,118
Of course. Perfect.

445
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,804
Oh, my...

446
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,204
Oh, yeah. It's okay.

447
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,208
It's all right, it's all right.

448
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:09,478
Shh...

449
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:12,417
Yes?

450
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:13,419
Dr. Hicks?

451
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:14,522
Hi. I'm John Carter.

452
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:15,925
I'm Dr. Benton's student.

453
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,996
Come on in, Carter.

454
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:21,003
I turned in my course evaluation

455
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:22,907
from my trauma
rotation this morning

456
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:23,943
and I was wondering

457
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:26,414
if I might get it back to
make some revisions.

458
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:28,085
Yes. I've read it.

459
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,755
A 16.

460
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,394
Sounds like you had a
disappointing experience.

461
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,098
Uh...

462
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:38,941
Would you like to hear
what he said about you?

463
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,344
Sure.

464
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,848
Ah. "Carter, John Truman.

465
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:51,852
"An exceptional student.

466
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,021
"Well-trained,

467
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:55,092
"superior diagnostic skills

468
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:57,731
"fast learner,
dedicated, selfless.

469
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,936
"Excellent bedside
manner with patients.

470
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:01,255
"Far more successful at dealing

471
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,626
"with the patients' emotional
needs than this instructor.

472
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,681
Highly intelligent."

473
00:21:05,716 --> 00:21:07,585
Want to hear more?

474
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,962
It concludes, "one
of the finest students

475
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:15,168
"I've ever had the
opportunity to work with.

476
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:17,206
Recommend high honors."

477
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,943
He gave me high honors?

478
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:24,905
I was upset because he
didn't give me the surgery sub-I.

479
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,075
Did he tell you

480
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,688
Wilkins had dropped
out and you<i> had</i>

481
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:29,532
the surgical sub-I?

482
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:32,305
So you came up
here to get this back.

483
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:33,724
This is what you really

484
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,212
thought of Dr. Benton's
supervision?

485
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:40,188
No, no, no. I mean, He was
hard on me and demanding,

486
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,891
but I learned a lot.

487
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,501
Why don't you take another
crack at this evaluation.

488
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:48,489
Thank you.

489
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,161
And Carter, I don't want it back

490
00:21:51,196 --> 00:21:52,515
at a 40.

491
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,101
Be honest, fair.

492
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:57,325
Right. Uh... 38 okay?

493
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,378
Yeah, something like that.

501
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:42,671
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton.

502
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:44,353
We need your permission

503
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:46,680
to perform an
emergency colostomy.

504
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,183
The lymphoma?

505
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:52,743
This would be a very difficult
and painful way for him to die.

506
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:54,630
It can't be any worse

507
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,402
than what he's
already been through.

508
00:22:57,438 --> 00:22:59,440
I won't put him through it.

509
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:08,626
Okay.

510
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:11,632
We'll, uh, we'll try to make
him as comfortable as possible

511
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,739
and maybe the current treatment
will resolve the obstruction.

512
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:21,236
Four more morphine IV.

513
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:36,335
Marjorie decided against
the surgery, didn't she?

514
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,805
Yeah.

515
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,476
Yeah, I knew she would.

516
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:41,813
It's what Thomas
would have wanted.

517
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,487
That's why he chose
her instead of me.

518
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:47,192
He knew I wouldn't
have the strength.

519
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,869
Um... can I take him home?

520
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,509
I... I wouldn't.

521
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:58,917
If he does regain
consciousness, it could be rough.

522
00:23:58,953 --> 00:24:01,356
Here, we can manage his pain.

523
00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:09,373
You know, we-we've
already said our good-byes.

524
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:17,490
But I-I guess you're
never really ready.

525
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,149
Well...

526
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:24,455
back to the deathwatch.

527
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,059
Yeah.

528
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:49,308
Mr. Hahn, I'm Dr. Ross.

529
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:50,978
Is Caleb going to be okay?

530
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:52,482
How's his temperature, Wendy?

531
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:53,817
Down to 99.

532
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:55,099
It's not the chemo, Mr. Hahn.

533
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:56,534
His white blood cells look fine.

534
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:58,906
Caleb has a temperature,
we think, from an infection.

535
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,477
The antibiotics
seem to be working,

536
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,847
but we'll keep him for a
few hours just to make sure.

537
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:06,110
Mr. Hahn, there's a call from
a Dr. Bernstein on line two.

538
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:07,614
You can take it out here.

539
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:08,782
Our oncologist.

540
00:25:08,817 --> 00:25:10,999
Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm going
to check back in a little bit.

541
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,323
Why don't you and your daughter

542
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,327
get something to eat,
bring it back for Caleb.

543
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:16,232
Cheeseburger and
fries, am I right?

544
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,568
Right.

545
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,355
Be right back.

546
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,597
Still bored?

547
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,402
What do you think?

548
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:26,770
Mortal Kombat.

549
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:29,444
I stole it from a
hemophiliac in Pediatrics.

550
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,180
You stole it?

551
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:33,202
Rented it, really.
Cost me ten bucks.

552
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:34,337
But I'm pretty good,

553
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:36,943
and it's got to be more
fun than sitting here,

554
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:39,431
feeling sorry for yourself.

555
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:43,339
Come on. You can
be anybody you want.

556
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:44,676
Johnny cage.

557
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:45,995
What?

558
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:47,666
I get to be Johnny cage.

559
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:49,469
Okay, right.

560
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:52,008
I thought you said
you knew how to play.

561
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:55,032
I do, I do. I just, I just know
them more by their colors.

562
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,500
Dime a match.

563
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:58,873
How much is that
going to cost me?

564
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:00,921
Depends on if you
really know how to play.

565
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:02,397
All right, you're on.

566
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:17,062
Mark.

567
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,001
Hi, everybody.

568
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,007
Mark, Jennifer, could
you take the baby, please?

569
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:24,377
Don't ask.

570
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,066
The bottle's in the pouch
and I just changed her, okay?

571
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:28,068
Where's Chloe?

572
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:29,755
Who knows?

573
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,792
I got to go.

574
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:37,220
I'm sorry.

575
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:39,159
Chloe stuck me with the baby.

576
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:40,161
How do I look?

577
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:42,310
Like a big peach snow cone.

578
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,706
Oh, oh, oh, here she comes.

579
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:54,241
She looks beautiful.

580
00:27:06,586 --> 00:27:08,455
Carol.

581
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,790
Come on, girlfriend.

582
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,008
I think this dress cost more

583
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:14,277
than both of my weddings.

584
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,903
Oh, carol.

585
00:27:17,442 --> 00:27:19,177
So?

586
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:20,480
You look great.

587
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,534
Oh, God, I'm really nervous.

588
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:24,872
Time to seat the bride's mother.

589
00:27:24,908 --> 00:27:26,911
I'm not going to cry.

590
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:32,021
Now, remember, not too
many petals at once, okay?

591
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:33,859
I know how to do it.

592
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:36,396
You all set, Carol?

593
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:37,874
Yep. Uncle Mikhel, you're on.

594
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:41,241
Oh.

595
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:43,440
Well, Father, we're all set.

596
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:44,498
Let's go.

597
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:47,154
Yep. All we need
now is the groom.

598
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:51,797
How's Thomas doing?

599
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:53,801
Temp's up to 103.

600
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:56,507
BP is 65/50.

601
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:51,284
Tag, what are you doing?

602
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,560
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

603
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:57,231
Yeah, it is.

604
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,246
Tag, we've got a whole church

605
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,940
full of our friends
and family waiting.

606
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:05,314
Are you scared?

607
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:08,588
A little.

608
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:10,292
Me, too.

609
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:19,128
I was thinking that maybe
you don't love me enough.

610
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:22,134
Tag, I love you.

611
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,937
Do you really?

612
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,049
I was waiting in the sacristy

613
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:32,372
and I was thinking that
you really don't love me,

614
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:34,678
that I've known it all along,

615
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:37,049
and I've just been
kidding myself.

616
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:40,723
I wouldn't be marrying
you if I didn't love you.

617
00:30:41,762 --> 00:30:44,699
I wake up every
morning and I thank God

618
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,603
for bringing you into my life.

619
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:52,399
I wake up in the middle
of the night sometimes

620
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,470
just to watch you sleep.

621
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:57,025
When we're at the
movies and your hand

622
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,031
brushes against mine,
I can hardly breathe.

623
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:06,829
Do you love me like that, Carol?

624
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:19,741
If you care at all about
me, please tell me the truth.

625
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:28,325
No.

626
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:31,632
I don't.

627
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,351
But I do love you, Tag,

628
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:42,722
and I want to be with you.

629
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,845
Thank you.

630
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,435
After 6:00.

631
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:25,513
Should be Dr. And
Mrs. Taglieri by now.

632
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:27,095
Connie, did anyone ever tell you

633
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,865
you're a truly evil person?

634
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:30,691
Somebody's waiting for you.

635
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:32,707
I can't, I got to look in
on a patient in Three.

636
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:34,365
He's been waiting awhile.

637
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,782
Was it something I did?

638
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:43,502
No, you didn't do anything.

639
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:44,838
You were great.

640
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:46,342
This is all me.

641
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:48,178
Well, maybe we can fix it.

642
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:49,514
I don't think so.

643
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,851
We can try.

644
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,021
Jake, look, I did something bad.

645
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:55,060
I hurt your mother, okay?

646
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,199
What did you do?

647
00:32:58,235 --> 00:32:59,703
Come here. Sit down.

648
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:01,072
Sit down.

649
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:13,616
I know that you think
that I'm a... a good guy,

650
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:15,420
but I'm not really.

651
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:21,533
I... don't know why I hurt
people sometimes, and...

652
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:26,543
I did something
with another woman

653
00:33:26,578 --> 00:33:27,914
that I shouldn't have done

654
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:29,850
and your mother
found out about it

655
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:32,856
and now she doesn't want
me to come around anymore.

656
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:34,911
Oh.

657
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:40,390
You and I can't hang out.

658
00:33:42,964 --> 00:33:46,870
I never meant to hurt... you.

659
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:47,973
I mean, I...

660
00:33:48,008 --> 00:33:50,929
The one with the nice
clothes and all the hair?

661
00:33:54,872 --> 00:33:59,547
Yeah, um... the
one with all the hair.

662
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:03,122
I'm sorry, buddy.

663
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:09,786
I got to go.

664
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:12,793
My mom would be mad
if she knew I was here.

665
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,926
Show me the thing...
how you do the thing

666
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,530
where they rip
the guy's head off

667
00:34:25,554 --> 00:34:26,801
and they set him on fire.

668
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:28,793
Up, right, kick,
kick, down, block.

669
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,931
Wait, up, up...

670
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:33,236
Up, right, down, down, kick.

671
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,109
Die, you bastard!

672
00:34:36,144 --> 00:34:39,265
Yes! Triple power move...

673
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,036
and a fatality!

674
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:44,209
You're pretty
rough on your sister.

675
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,526
You've got A-L-L, right?

676
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:57,170
My brother Bobby had leukemia.

677
00:34:57,205 --> 00:34:58,673
Yeah?

678
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,443
Mm-hmm.

679
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:03,450
He used to pick
on me all the time.

680
00:35:03,486 --> 00:35:05,722
Come up and hit me

681
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:10,298
when I wasn't expecting
it for no reason.

682
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:13,154
Come on!

683
00:35:13,189 --> 00:35:16,495
Yeah, he... he hated
my mom for babying him.

684
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,802
He just wanted to
be a regular kid, so...

685
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:22,139
so he took it out on me.

686
00:35:22,174 --> 00:35:24,490
He was just, um... pretending

687
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:27,630
he could still do
everything that he used to,

688
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:29,589
but...

689
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,165
he couldn't.

690
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,537
Your turn.

691
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:40,029
Did he make it?

692
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:42,033
Um... no.

693
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:43,769
No, he died.

694
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:47,155
But he had AML, which is a...

695
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,462
is a lot harder to beat.

696
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:51,702
It was a long time ago.

697
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:53,740
Medicines are
a lot better now...

698
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:58,033
and the kids are a lot tougher.

699
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,560
Where's Carol?

700
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:28,565
Talking to her mother.

701
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,901
How is she?

702
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:32,406
We confiscated her
shoelaces and belt.

703
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,757
Somebody ought to shoot him.

704
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:36,415
Amen.

705
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,662
What do you think they're
going to do with all that food?

706
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:44,744
Probably give it to a
shelter or something.

707
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:45,868
Yeah, but shelter?

708
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,256
Alkies can barely keep down
a peanut butter sandwich.

709
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,896
How the hell are they gonna
hold on to lobster Newburg?

710
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:51,898
They got lobster?

711
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,303
Big ones... size of your head.

712
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,274
You guys are going to eat?

713
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:58,205
They're not gonna miss
a couple plates' worth.

714
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:00,199
Mommy, I'm hungry.

715
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:01,552
Come on, Rach.

716
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:02,888
Mark...

717
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:04,204
She's hungry.

718
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:07,398
Anybody want a drink?

719
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,400
Uh-huh.

720
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,563
Gin and tonic.

721
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:10,905
Chivas straight up.

722
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:43,341
You in one piece?

723
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:45,879
Yeah, never been better.

724
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:58,824
So I thought I was
having a bad day.

725
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,165
What's that?

726
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,104
Oh, they went ahead
with the reception.

727
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,441
You know my family.

728
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:07,876
What's a little humiliation

729
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,713
when there's free
food and drink?

730
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:20,687
What's wrong with me?

731
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:26,634
Why can't I fall in
love with a nice guy?

732
00:38:26,669 --> 00:38:29,973
Someone who loves me,
who wants to be with me,

733
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,777
who's honest and decent?

734
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,948
Hmm...

735
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,936
And boring.

736
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:37,973
God, he was dull.

737
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:47,694
All that talk about
fly-fishing and bowling

738
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,135
and his glory days
playing football in college.

739
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,472
Bowling?

740
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:53,841
Yeah.

741
00:39:07,473 --> 00:39:09,441
I just want to be happy

742
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:12,447
and I'm so afraid
I never will be.

743
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,150
You will.

00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:25,575
You will.

745
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,877
Dr. Benton?

746
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:55,857
I just want to say
thank you for everything.

747
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:57,894
I learned a lot.

748
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:03,874
Have a good summer.
