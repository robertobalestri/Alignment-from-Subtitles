1
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,916
Hello.

2
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,235
Get the door!

3
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,902
Need some help! Watch out!

4
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,238
She's cyanotic.

5
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,473
Let's get her to Trauma One.

6
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,921
I don't care if it's closed.

7
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:03,245
We can't take...

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,714
No. No, look, Jesus,
I'm telling you...

9
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,828
Jesus... Jesus, are you deaf?

10
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:11,319
Move out M.I. Moving to five.

11
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:12,849
What the hell is going on?

12
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,958
Mercy's closed to trauma,
and Lakeside's power is out.

13
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,292
That makes us it.

14
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,293
Hi.

15
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,728
Hi.

16
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:22,281
Jen went to Milwaukee
to find an apartment.

17
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,748
Why is it so hot in here?

18
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,362
Air conditioning's out.

19
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,252
Ah! Great. Hottest
day in October.

20
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,165
Isn't this your
day off? Hi, Rach.

21
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,455
Tommy missed his plane

22
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,657
coming back from
his brother's wedding.

23
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,520
The joys of being
chief resident.

24
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:37,212
Dr. Ross, there's
a five-year old

25
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:41,016
with some kind of heart
problem in Trauma One.

26
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,017
Okay.

27
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:43,185
Bye, Rach.

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,520
Bye.

29
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:46,899
Our baby-sitter's
not going to be here

30
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:48,235
for a couple of hours.

31
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:50,587
Is there anybody who
can watch Rachel?

32
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,911
Uh... Joanna's off in ten.

33
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,647
What are all those
wires sticking out?

34
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,082
That's so

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,434
we can give him medicine

36
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:00,953
to make him better.

37
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,387
Is he sick?

38
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,705
Actually, he's...

39
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,024
uh...

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,026
What's he doing out here?

41
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,940
Paramedics brought him in D.O.A.

42
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,529
from some nursing home.

43
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,131
The heat got him.

44
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,533
City's supposed to
come pick him up.

45
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,336
Come on, Rachel. I'll show
you where the TV is, okay?

46
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,872
I thought Tommy was back today.

47
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,207
He's supposed to be.

48
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,020
Doug needs you in One.

49
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,678
I got to take Rachel
into the lounge.

50
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:27,757
I got her.

51
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,892
Come on, Rach.

52
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,482
I'm not even changed.

53
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,600
Let's see what's
in the fridge, huh?

54
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,222
What do you got, Doug?

55
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,902
Okay, Mark, we
have a five-year-old

56
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,293
with known
coarctation of the aorta.

57
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,094
She had a sudden onset

58
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,097
of severe respiratory
distress about an hour ago.

59
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,700
You worried about
congestive heart failure?

60
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,036
Yeah. Resp's 40, B.P.'S 180/100.

61
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,366
She's tachycardic.
Her rate is 180.

62
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,857
You get blood
gasses? Chest film?

63
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:57,192
Yeah.

64
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:00,679
Mid-systolic murmur.

65
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,684
Bolus her with 20 milligrams

66
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,352
of Lasix.

67
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,564
What's her name?

68
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,654
Kanesha.

69
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,755
Hi, Kanesha.

70
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,990
I'm Dr. Greene.

71
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,659
You know, I have
a daughter your age

72
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,845
and she came with
me to work today.

73
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,531
When you're feeling better,
how about I bring her in here,

74
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,867
and she can meet you, okay?

75
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,334
Okay.

76
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,904
Get a cardiologist down here.

77
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,807
I'm going to go check on Rachel.

78
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,926
I'll be back in a
couple of minutes.

79
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:34,808
You just stop it!

80
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:36,309
I told you!

81
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,432
That's all!

82
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,511
Indian summer.

83
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:39,901
It gets this hot,

84
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:42,504
people just sort
of lose their heads.

85
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,117
Supposed to be 102 today.

86
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,340
Hoo!

87
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,154
Dr. Greene, a pizza
delivery guy got stabbed.

88
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:49,723
He's driving himself in.

89
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:50,762
How soon?

90
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,842
Only a couple of blocks away.

91
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,232
Where's Benton?

92
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,767
Jerry.

93
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,962
Somebody order a pizza?

94
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:35,473
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

95
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,146
Do you have any
pain in your head? No.

96
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,459
In your neck? No.

97
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,794
What about your chest?

98
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,718
Jerry, would you call Security?

99
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,686
Somebody's in my parking space.

100
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,687
Ba-da-bum!

101
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,988
Where's Rachel?

102
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,535
Joanna's keeping an eye on her.

103
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,236
Cardiology been down yet?

104
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,228
Yeah. Kayson's finishing
up an angiogram right now.

105
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,631
Should be here in
about 20 minutes.

106
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,199
Anyhow, now she's
got a fever of 102.

107
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,735
A fever?

108
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,016
How you doing, kiddo?

109
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,685
Her rhythm's changed.

110
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,000
Ventricular tachyrhythmia.

111
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,557
Tachyrhythmia?

112
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:03,222
20 Milligrams of
Lidocaine, I.V. push.

113
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,390
Could be secondary

114
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,713
to the congestive heart failure.

115
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,282
Has she had any
surgeries recently?

116
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:11,820
No. Her family's
in the waiting room.

117
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:13,822
I'll see what I can find out.

118
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,710
They stabbed me!

119
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,045
Mr. Etker, does your neck hurt?

120
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,158
No!

121
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,582
Pressure's 210/120.

122
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,916
Squeeze my hand.

123
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,918
Press down with your foot.

124
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:27,997
I'm dying!

125
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,387
Does your chest hurt?

126
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,789
They stabbed me!

127
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,790
Where?

128
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,791
My side.

129
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,559
Where?

130
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:35,944
There. There!

131
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,812
You want me to prep

132
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:39,608
for a peritoneal lavage?

133
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,234
No. I want you to get some
Bactine and a Band-Aid.

134
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:45,486
What's wrong?

135
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:47,005
Why aren't you helping me?

136
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,940
It's just a scratch, Mr. Etker.

137
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,027
A... a scratch?

138
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,885
It was a<i> really</i> big knife.

139
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,491
Jerry, can we at least get this
D.O.A. into an empty room?

140
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,004
Well, there aren't any.

141
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,961
Then take him down to Pathology.

142
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,095
Uh-huh.

143
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,280
So?

144
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,799
Five on 300.

145
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,003
I'm in. 350.

146
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,841
I got 375.

147
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,410
Wendy?

148
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,811
I never win.

149
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,279
Oh, come on.

150
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,914
It's only five bucks.

151
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,103
Okay. Um...

152
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,407
200.

153
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:42,643
200? Man, you can play anytime.

154
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,058
200 it is, Wendy.

155
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:48,015
Lydia?

156
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,717
Hey, she's smelling.

157
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:52,920
She's not allowed
to smell, is she?

158
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:55,106
465.

159
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,192
Uh... Dr. Lewis,
want to get a piece

160
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,106
of today's blood alcohol pool?

161
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,613
Oh. Who's today's victim?

162
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,842
Arthur.

163
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:06,651
Ooh. Well, anything
under 400's a sucker bet.

164
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,119
550.

165
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,665
Ooh. Ooh.

166
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,155
Ahh.

167
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,940
Oh, Dr. Lewis?

168
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:15,054
Your sister's looking for you.

169
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,127
She's in the lounge.

170
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,784
Hi, Chloe.

171
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,887
Hi, little sis!

172
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,989
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

173
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:29,624
Look at you!

174
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,138
Wow. Stethoscope and everything.

175
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,162
Even a little badge.

176
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,242
Man, look at that picture.

177
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,344
It's worse than the D.M.V.

178
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,380
Is that a push-up bra?

179
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:41,669
No.

180
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:44,205
You've got sugar on your chin.

181
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,918
I was eating doughnuts.

182
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,242
Are they yours?

183
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,709
No. They were in the fridge.

184
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:51,146
I thought they
were for everybody.

185
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,480
Well, they're not.

186
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:54,182
I'll replace them later.

187
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:56,317
You sure? Okay.

188
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:57,318
Eeeehhh!

189
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,720
Aahh! Chloe, I'm working!

190
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,990
Oh, hey, is this your locker?

191
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,592
Chloe...

192
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,728
Wow. Must be cool to
have your own locker.

193
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,165
Sort of like back in school.

194
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,594
Chloe, I really have
to get back to work.

195
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,814
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

196
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:16,816
Uh... I lost my apartment.

197
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,841
What happened to
the money I sent you?

198
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,276
It wasn't enough.

199
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,827
$500?

200
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,132
I can't do this right now.

201
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,866
No, please.

202
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,202
No, Chloe. Not this time!

203
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,115
Mom won't let me
stay at the house.

204
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,139
I can't. Really.

205
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,868
It's just for a couple of weeks.

206
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:36,624
Weeks?

207
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,192
Days then, okay?

208
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:41,296
I promise, this time,
I won't screw up.

209
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,313
I won't.

210
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,332
Please, Susie.

211
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,017
Please?

212
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,069
I don't have
anyplace else to go.

213
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:00,998
Don't let the cat out.

214
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,535
And none of your friends
can come over, ever.

215
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,337
You hear me? All right?

216
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,406
Understand?

217
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,421
It'll be okay. I promise.

218
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,078
Good. I know it will be.

219
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,513
I got to go.

220
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,592
Thanks.

221
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,965
No friends.

222
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,238
Was surgery ever scheduled

223
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,773
to correct the malformation?

224
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:27,875
They found it when
Kanesha was a baby,

225
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,411
but they said I had until
she was six or seven

226
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:31,846
to have it taken care of.

227
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,199
She was doing so well, there
didn't seem to be any hurry.

228
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,529
Normally, that'd be true,

229
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,765
but her condition
clearly worsened today.

230
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,701
Dr. Kayson is going to
examine her in a few minutes.

231
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,569
He's an excellent cardiologist.

232
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,660
Can I have 75 cents for a soda?

233
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:47,044
Shandra.

234
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,442
Doe she have a cardiologist?

235
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,199
We've got a pediatrician.

236
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,945
I should probably call him.

237
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:54,886
<i>Her.</i> Ellen Mathias.

238
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,016
Her. Sorry. I'll
call Dr. Mathias

239
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,019
and get Kanesha's records
over here right away,

240
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,676
and I'll be back as
soon as Dr. Kayson's

241
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,152
had a chance to examine her.

242
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,337
How's she doing?

243
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,105
Lytes came back normal.

244
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,707
Damn it.

245
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,643
She's hypertensive... 180/100.

246
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,489
Hypertension, agitation.

247
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,713
Fever, ventricular
tachyrhythmia.

248
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,081
Poisoning?

249
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,017
Let's get a tox screen
going right now.

250
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,420
Sweetheart, did
you take anything...

251
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,356
Anything your dad
told you not to touch?

252
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,991
Anything in the sink,

253
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,961
in the bathroom, in
the garage, anything?

254
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,666
Peter, it's your
liquor store guy again.

255
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,111
Ivan? Oh, God. What now?

256
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,702
Shots were fired.

257
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,620
The paramedics say it looks bad.

258
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:49,390
Multiple gunshot wounds.
Pulse 150, thready. B.P. 50.

259
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:51,358
We got two large-bore
I.V.s wide open,

260
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,094
but his pressure's
still crashing.

261
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,428
Where's Ivan? Ivan Gregor?

262
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,630
I thought that's who
you were bringing in.

263
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,744
Over here, Doc. I
thought you were shot.

264
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,746
That's the one... The
one who shoot me.

265
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,103
Now I shoot<i> him.</i>

266
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,504
Dr. Benton?

267
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,417
Get six units O-neg now.

268
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,374
Now I shot you, huh?

269
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,411
See how it feels,
huh, you little bastard!

270
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:11,913
Now<i> you</i> see!

271
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:21,022
Oh, no. What...?

272
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,457
Is she okay?

273
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,986
Your daughter's fine, sir.

274
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,494
Oh, thank Jesus.

275
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,028
Thank you, Doctor.

276
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:29,647
Thank you.

277
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,898
I'd like to see her now.

278
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:33,468
I'm Dr. Ross. Sir, your
daughter wasn't suffering

279
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,047
from congestive heart failure.

280
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,104
She wasn't?

281
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,439
This is Mrs. McGillis,

282
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,253
from the Department of
Child and Family Services.

283
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:41,621
She'd like to ask
you some questions.

284
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,862
Your legal name and address?

285
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,050
What the hell's going on here?

286
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,829
I need your legal
name and address.

287
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,320
Where's Kanesha?

288
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,656
I want to see her, now.

289
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,558
Your five-year-old daughter

290
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:59,193
overdosed on
cocaine, Mr. Freeman.

291
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,709
No palpable B.P.

292
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:16,889
Capillary refill's bad.

293
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:19,246
All right, he's bleeding.

294
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:20,865
Let's get that blood
in a pressure bag.

295
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,433
He needs a bilateral
chest tube now.

296
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,968
How old is he?

297
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,436
14, tops. Let's roll him.

298
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,670
Here we go.

299
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,673
Oh, God, Ivan. What
did you use, a cannon?

300
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,876
The kid's got no exit wounds.

301
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,077
Move, Carter.

302
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,279
Exit wounds?

303
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,281
He was shot in the back.

304
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,682
Call the O.R...
See who's available.

305
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,886
Get them down here, and
get them down here now.

306
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,105
All right, here we go.

307
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,001
He had a seizure
in the waiting room?

308
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,291
Yeah. He slammed his head

309
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,393
against the corner
of the admitting desk.

310
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,996
Says his name is Monte,
and that he's HIV positive.

311
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,726
Are you on any
medications, Monte?

312
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,451
AZT, DDI, Bactrim?

313
00:13:56,486 --> 00:14:01,539
Uh... AZT and some
white and red ones.

314
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,225
Dilantin? Have you
been taking them?

315
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,244
Sometimes I forget.

316
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,962
Have you been drinking, Monte?

317
00:14:07,998 --> 00:14:10,981
You can't mix
alcohol and Dilantin.

318
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,117
It's very dangerous.
Do you understand?

319
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,769
I try to get to the clinic,

320
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:18,723
but they won't let me on the bus
because I don't have any money.

321
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,242
Get a C.T. tox screen,

322
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:24,195
CBC, a Chem seven, Dilantin,
and blood alcohol levels.

323
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:27,810
Decreased breath
sounds bilaterally.

324
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,568
Carter, get over here and
put a stitch around the tube.

325
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:31,636
To hold it in. Move!

326
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,237
Here comes the cavalry.

327
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,416
Who is it?

328
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,607
Langworthy.

329
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,819
Great. Just what I need.

330
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,576
What have we got, Peter?

331
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,378
Teenage male with
multiple gunshots in the back.

332
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,747
Bilateral hemothorax.

333
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,416
We've got a lead
out of the left already.

334
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,568
Dr. Benton, that Russian
guy keeps screaming for you.

335
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:48,702
He says you're the only one

336
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,071
he's going to let
sew up his head.

337
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,150
I don't get a pulse here.

338
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:52,318
Carter, go take care of Ivan.

339
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:53,419
I'm putting in the stitch.

340
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:55,121
Got a bullet in
the right ventricle.

341
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,722
Tamponade. Here we
go. I'll crack his chest.

342
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:57,929
No, you won't.

343
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,130
He's my patient.

344
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,265
Carter, you still here? Go.

345
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,117
Go. Move. Move.

346
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,285
Thoracotomy tray.

347
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,903
Let's move, let's move.

348
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,316
Come on, come on.

349
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,207
Here we go.

350
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:12,593
Hi, Kanesha.

351
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:13,961
This is Rachel.

352
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:16,930
Hi.

353
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,143
Hi.

354
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,145
I'll get you a stool, okay?

355
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,136
Is she going to get better?

356
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,149
Yeah, she's
feeling a lot better.

357
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,473
Aren't you, Kanesha?

358
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,807
Yeah, good.

359
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,542
I like your dog.

360
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,278
His name is Schmedley.

361
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:33,281
I had a dog... a real dog.

362
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:35,566
His name was Max.

363
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,451
Did he run away?

364
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,237
He was old and he died.

365
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,658
My mom died, but she wasn't old.

366
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,627
My mommy's in Milwaukee.

367
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:48,512
My daddy's your doctor.

368
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,999
He helped make me better.

369
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,751
That's what doctors do.

370
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,788
I get a real dog

371
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,841
when I'm ten.

372
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,343
My dad says I get to name him.

373
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:22,808
P.E.A., tachycardic. 140.

374
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,810
Heart's racing with no pressure.

375
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,700
Spreader.

376
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:29,504
Thank you, Sarah.

377
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:38,813
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

378
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:40,131
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

379
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,415
Is he sick?

380
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,561
Yeah.

381
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,751
I think he is.

382
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:45,186
Did somebody hurt him?

383
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,320
I don't know, darling.

384
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:47,466
Somebody bad?

385
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,475
Probably somebody very bad.

386
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,410
It was him.

387
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,812
He came in before,
with his friend,

388
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,214
and he shoot me.

389
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,616
You need to stay
still, Mr. Gregor.

390
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,018
Now<i> he</i> just come
in... Like nothing.

391
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,686
He thinks I'm being afraid.

392
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,899
Not this time.

393
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,290
This time<i> he</i> should
be afraid, huh?

394
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,704
What would<i> you</i> do if he come in?

395
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,048
The one who shoot you before.

396
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,964
I don't know.

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,178
You shoot, that's what you do.

398
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,668
Just like me.

399
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,472
Any man say he
don't, he is a liar.

400
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,010
A damn liar.

401
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,515
Whoa.

402
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,582
Hey. Hi.

403
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,662
Hi.

404
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,253
I was going to
look for you today.

405
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,267
I have to get to the lab.

406
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,857
Well, I'll walk with you.

407
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,259
Look, I was a jerk showing
up at your place like that.

408
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,427
Uh-huh.

409
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,963
And, so, I owe you an apology.

410
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,386
You're not making this
any easier for me, are you?

411
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:53,754
Oop!

412
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,724
Hey.

413
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,825
Hi.

414
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:01,745
Aren't you going up to the lab?

415
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,630
No. I always take the stairs.

416
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,950
Great girl, isn't she?

417
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:13,340
Yeah.

418
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,544
I don't blame you for
still wanting to be with her.

419
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:17,845
I know I do.

420
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,447
You know, I was a jerk

421
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:21,849
going up to Carol's
place like that.

422
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:26,170
I've done the same
sort of thing myself.

423
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,337
Don't be so tough

424
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,289
on yourself.

425
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,159
Hey.

426
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,360
Hey.

427
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,997
We'll get you all fixed up now.

428
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,679
You getting off?

429
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,003
Not my floor.

430
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,403
We're on the 12th.

431
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,840
Yeah, I punched the
wrong button there.

432
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,796
Pericardium's full of blood.

433
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:52,997
Get me a 2-0 suture.

434
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,198
No time.

435
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,544
Make like the Dutch boy

436
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,179
with his finger in the dike.

437
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,635
Hold on tight, everybody.

438
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,171
This is going to be a gusher.

439
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,706
Ready!

440
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,009
O.R.'s been alerted.

441
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,510
Where is it?

442
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,578
Got it.

443
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,979
All right, let's go.

444
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,347
All right, come on.

445
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,493
Coming through.

446
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,017
Clear the way, people.

447
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,685
Coming through.

448
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:15,686
Clear the way.

449
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,088
Come on, let's go.

450
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,288
Step on it.

451
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,456
Call the O.R.

452
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,926
Tell them they've got a
tamponade coming up.

453
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,862
Tell Cardiology they're
going to need ten units now!

454
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,664
Have O.R. prep for
a heart/lung bypass.

455
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,977
Coming through, people!

456
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,167
Hold the elevator!

457
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,769
Let's go! Come on!

458
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,137
Step on it.

459
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,960
And the winner is...

460
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:57,996
Aw!

461
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,908
Read it and weep, boys.

462
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,566
.473. Every damn time.

463
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,235
How does she do it?

464
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,637
This is going to be a tough one.

465
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,772
You really going
to clean him up?

466
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,408
Tradition is tradition.

467
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,942
Glad I didn't win.

468
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,255
Come on, Arthur.

469
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,991
You've got an appointment
with some hot water.

470
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,848
Your sitter still hasn't shown?

471
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,350
The car overheated.

472
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,363
When are they going to fix

473
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,631
the air conditioning?

474
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,055
They're working on it.

475
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,157
Jerry, the dead
guy is still here.

476
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,759
What, are we waiting
for him to get ripe?

477
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,761
I'm sorry, Dr. Greene.
I called Pathology.

478
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,575
Why don't you throw a
sheet over him at least?

479
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,965
All right.

480
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,768
Hi.

481
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,970
You must be... "Jerry."

482
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,689
I'm Linda Farrell,
Novell Pharmaceuticals.

483
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,408
Oh, hi.

484
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,543
You like pepperoni pizza, Jerry?

485
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,622
I'm a vegetarian.

486
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,814
I'll eat it.

487
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,815
Is Dr. Greene available?

488
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,784
Um...

489
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,452
He's expecting me.

490
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,904
On his day off?

491
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,773
Uh... he's on the board.

492
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,758
What are you
selling, Miss Farrell?

493
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,695
Are you in a procurement
position, Doctor...?

494
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,491
Lewis. Dr. Greene's
very busy today.

495
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,182
I'll wait.

496
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,884
Could be quite awhile.

497
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,787
Jerry and I will catch
up on old times, then.

498
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:15,172
Won't we, Jer?

499
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,340
Oh.

500
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,707
Uh...

501
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,826
sure.

502
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,513
I'll tell him you're here.

503
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,085
Where you from, Jerry?

504
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,304
West Town?

505
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:31,588
Yeah. Ukrainian Village.

506
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,885
I knew it. My grandfather

507
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:35,103
grew up on West Haddon Avenue.

508
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,760
Huh! Cortez Street.

509
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,123
What do you know about that?

510
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:40,681
Maybe we're cousins

511
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,996
or something, huh?

512
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:51,025
Hey, Mr. Kinnett.

513
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,471
Mr. Kinnett?

514
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:55,295
Has the anesthesia taken hold?

515
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:56,831
He's out.

516
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,401
Okay.

517
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:02,603
Up...

518
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,471
you go.

519
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,484
How did he dislocate
his shoulder?

520
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:07,791
Waterskiing accident.

521
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:11,645
He's still in love with you.

522
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,563
Doug? He's a little kid.

523
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,843
He always wants

524
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,299
what he can't have.

525
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,052
You ready?

526
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,588
Yeah.

527
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,725
Let's move in together again.

528
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:25,926
What?

529
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:27,661
It's been five months.

530
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,298
Got it.

531
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,534
I still have more
than enough room.

532
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,498
I just got a new couch.

533
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,704
So we'll stay

534
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:40,006
at your place.

535
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:45,262
Okay. Let's get an X ray
for a postreduction film.

536
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:48,114
And... at least
think about it, okay?

537
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,467
Okay.

538
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:00,828
He seems really nice.

539
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:02,830
He is.

540
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:04,598
Is it that Doug?

541
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,502
No. It's me.

542
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,896
He says it wasn't him.

543
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,030
That he doesn't know

544
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,265
where Kanesha could
have gotten cocaine.

545
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,344
And you believe him?

546
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,679
Did you call the police?

547
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,669
What for?

548
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,287
Child endangerment.

549
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,384
He's middle class.

550
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,068
He owns a home. He has a job.

551
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:32,242
I got families of ten
living in '67 Buicks.

552
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,555
He could be a coke dealer.

553
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,229
The Department will
follow up with a field visit.

554
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,732
If anything seems
wrong, we'll pull the kids.

555
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:41,379
I'm not releasing her
till I think she's ready.

556
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:43,283
That's your prerogative, Doctor.

557
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,296
"He looked and he looked.

558
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,789
"He could see nothing there
but a small speck of dust

559
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:03,635
blowing past through the air..."

560
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,559
Hey, Rachel. What
are you reading?

561
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,027
A book.

562
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:08,495
<i>Horton Hears a Who.</i>

563
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,231
Oh, I remember that one.

564
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,599
Keep going.

565
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,913
Okay. "'I say, '
murmured Horton.

566
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:18,572
"'I've never heard tell
of a small speck of dust

567
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:21,324
"'that is able to yell.

568
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,539
"'So you know what I think?

569
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:26,263
"'Why, I think that
there must be someone

570
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,866
"'on top of that
small speck of dust...

571
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,769
"'some sort of a creature
of very small size,

572
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:35,506
"'too small to be seen
by an elephant's eyes.

573
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,676
"'Some poor little person
who's shaking with fear

574
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,889
"'that he'll blow in the pool.

575
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,896
"'He has no way to steer.

576
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:46,382
"'I'll just have to save
him, because, after all,

577
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,820
a person's a person,
no matter how small.'"

578
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,950
So cancel your credit card.

579
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:55,142
If I report it stolen,
and she tries to use it,

580
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:56,677
they'll arrest her.

581
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,356
Would that be so bad?

582
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,049
Last time Chloe moved in
with me, she stayed for months.

583
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,262
You could have told her no.

584
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:06,654
I tried to, but she's...
she's my sister,

585
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:08,355
and I care about her.

586
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,225
I don't know. Every year,
she seems to get worse.

587
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,961
Would you talk to her?

588
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:15,240
And say what?

589
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,764
Anything. Just observe her.

590
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,699
Let me know what you think.

591
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,546
Well, I could recommend someone.

592
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,235
We tried. She won't go.

593
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,538
I'll introduce you
as my boyfriend,

594
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:25,739
and then she'll never know.

595
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,341
Your boyfriend?
Is that what I am?

596
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:30,343
This is my sister, Div.

597
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,413
Look, it's a bad...
it's a bad idea.

598
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,915
Why?

599
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,391
What if she asks me what I do?

600
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,565
You want me to lie to her?

601
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:40,688
Damn right.

602
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:43,591
What if I have to
tell you something

603
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,203
you don't want to hear?

604
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:46,594
Like what?

605
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,128
Oh, I don't know...

606
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:51,865
Like your Uncle Bob
molested her as a child.

607
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:54,101
We don't have an Uncle Bob.

608
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:58,072
I'm sorry, but this
is just an awful idea,

609
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:00,574
and I'm not going to allow you

610
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,476
to talk me into it.

611
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:03,751
Ho! Ho, ho, ho!

612
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,657
Time to feed the animals.

613
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:08,281
So you're not going to help her?

614
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,717
No. No. No, I'm not.

615
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:11,585
Fine.

616
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:14,187
I'll do it on my own.

617
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,776
He went into a systole.

618
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,088
What do you expect?

619
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,212
Yeah, but you
can't anticipate that.

620
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,281
Sure, you can.

621
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,349
I'll see you around.

622
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,952
Yeah. Sure.

623
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:30,054
How is the boy?

624
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:33,106
He's in surgery.

625
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:34,742
Is he going to be okay?

626
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,112
No, Ivan, he's not.

627
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,917
I was very scared.

628
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,557
I stay, see how he do, okay?

629
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,612
Look, Ivan...

630
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,614
yeah.

631
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,383
Yeah.

632
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,217
I'll find you later.

633
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,086
Good.

634
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,339
Good. I wait here.

635
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,291
Huh?

636
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:18,351
Right here.

637
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,789
Right here.

638
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:37,988
Rachel just wanted

639
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,073
to say good-bye to Kanesha.

640
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,925
Did Tommy finally show up?

641
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,688
Yeah. He just
called from O'Hare.

642
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:45,094
He's on his way in.

643
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,547
Is she okay?

644
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,833
She's sleeping, Rachel.

645
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,370
You, uh... still planning
on admitting her?

646
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,439
Mm-hmm.

647
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,906
For how long, Doug?

648
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,842
I don't know.

649
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,929
She could go home tonight.

650
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:03,246
No, she can't.

651
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,584
She could live with you, Daddy.

652
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,886
Kanesha's got a family

653
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,205
of her own, Rach.

654
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,441
But she doesn't have a mom.

655
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:17,761
No, she doesn't.

656
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,180
And you'll be lonely
when we go to Millakey.

657
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:23,133
"Milwaukee"?

658
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,869
It's hard not to have a mom.

659
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:29,606
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

660
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,693
Lots of families are that way.

661
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,311
Some families just have moms,

662
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,995
some just have dads,

663
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:38,565
but it works out okay.

664
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,235
Doug, I need you in seven.

665
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,737
Kid with a bellyache.

666
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:46,706
Okay. Listen, sweetheart,
will you stay here

667
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:47,891
till I get back?

668
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,544
I don't want her
to wake up alone.

669
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,695
Okay, Dad?

670
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,197
Sure.

671
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,247
Okay. Thank you.

672
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,425
Hey, Carol.

673
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,383
I'm in a hurry, Doug.

674
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,918
Taglieri and I

675
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,419
had a little talk.

676
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,922
Nothing like that.

677
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,423
He accepted my apology.

678
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,904
Well, he's a bigger
person than I am.

679
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,394
Come on. Slow down here.

680
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,397
Why don't we just agree
to behave like adults

681
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,765
when we're around each other?

682
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,267
"We"?

683
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,734
Mm-hmm. No. Me.

684
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,937
It's me, and I'm sorry.

685
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,439
Want to hit me?

686
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,490
Come on, you know you want to.

687
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,992
Here, hit me. Right here.

688
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,494
It'll make you feel better.

689
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,995
You know you want to.

690
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,997
Just give it your best shot.

691
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,499
You must be Dr. Ross.

692
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,011
Linda Farrell, Novell
Pharmaceuticals.

693
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,503
I understand you handle
emergency pediatrics

694
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,604
around here.

695
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:51,888
Yes. I do.

696
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:52,989
Hi. I'm<i> Doug</i> Ross.

697
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,474
Ow!

698
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:55,475
You're right.

699
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,760
I feel better.

700
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,078
Did I interrupt something?

701
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,597
No. We're done.

702
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,301
Uh...

703
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,514
Who did you say
that you worked for?

704
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,721
Novell.

705
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:09,767
Have you tried our
new cephalosporin?

706
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,352
It has excellent coverage.

707
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,842
Doug!

708
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,855
I tell you, Miss Farrell,

709
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,857
whatever you're
selling, I'm buying.

710
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,759
It's<i> Miss</i> Farrell?
Is that right?

711
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,067
Call me Linda.

712
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:22,422
You can call me Doug.

713
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:25,605
Doc. Hey, Doc.

714
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,108
Oh, hi. How are you feeling?

715
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:30,077
Okay, you know. Much better.

716
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:31,211
Good.

717
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:34,147
Hey, Doc, Doc...
um... I am a screwup.

718
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:35,648
Always have been.

719
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:38,685
Uh... I think I need
to get into a program.

720
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,652
Dr. Lewis?

721
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,154
Oh, it's okay, Jerry.

722
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,623
Yeah, sure. I can give
you some referrals.

723
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:45,158
But I can't be in one

724
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:46,993
on the South Side.

725
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,946
I got to get out of
the neighborhood.

726
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,283
But it costs money to move...
To set up someplace else?

727
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,569
You got to find
someone to help, to care.

728
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,088
No.

729
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,585
It's just a couple of
hundred bucks. That's all.

730
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,008
I said no.

731
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,094
A hundred bucks...

732
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:05,361
50!

733
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,662
What are you? Deaf?

734
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,864
I said no!

735
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,160
That's it.

736
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:11,168
Hey! I wasn't doin' nothin'!

737
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,270
You're out of here, pal!

738
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,439
You bitch! I was only
askin' you for help!

739
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,725
Bitch!

740
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,560
Bitch!

741
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:22,261
Bitch!

742
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,567
Dr. Ross...

743
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:29,369
Might as well go
home, Mr. Freeman.

744
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:31,537
Kanesha's not going
to be released today.

745
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:33,084
That's because of you, right?

746
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:34,074
That's right.

747
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,725
Dr. Ross, can I take

748
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,544
my baby home tonight?

749
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,063
Your five-year-old
daughter is recovering

750
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,531
from a cocaine overdose.

751
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,776
I don't know where she got it.

752
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,750
At 6:00 in the morning?

753
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:44,751
I'll give you a hint.

754
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:45,847
She got it from your house.

755
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,654
It's because I'm black, right?

756
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:49,906
Drugs, black man...
Got to be trouble.

757
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,603
Your daughter could have died.

758
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:52,559
You understand that?

759
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:54,238
She has a serious
heart condition.

760
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:55,746
You have no right

761
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,564
to judge me!

762
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,115
Watch me.

763
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:13,179
Your boy died.

764
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:15,649
Yeah. I heard.

765
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,551
When did it start raining?

766
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,397
Couple of minutes ago.

767
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:23,322
Well, maybe it'll cool
things down, huh?

768
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,490
Maybe.

769
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,492
Gather your things up, Rach.

770
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,528
Did you make him all better?

771
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:33,933
Who?

772
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:36,502
The boy in the green room.

773
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,210
The gunshot victim.

774
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,107
They tried really
hard, Rachel...

775
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,842
but he died.

776
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,278
Will his mom be sad?

777
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,846
Very sad.

778
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,982
Are you sad?

779
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,769
Yeah.

780
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:13,506
If you're sad, why
aren't you crying?

781
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,649
I am...

782
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,987
right here.

783
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,814
Dr. Benton, there's a detective
here from Violent Crimes.

784
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,850
Wants to talk to you
about that gunshot kid.

785
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:51,695
Put all your stuff
away. Okay, hon?

786
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:11,331
Got a minute?

787
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,632
Mm-hmm.

788
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,602
He's got a point.

789
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,771
Would you feel the same way

790
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,073
if her name was
Stephanie and she lived

791
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:22,075
on the North Side?

792
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:23,288
This isn't about race.

793
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:25,111
Oh, sure it is.

794
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,614
So you think I'm a racist, too?

795
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,698
No.

796
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,201
I think he deserves a chance.

797
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,468
I believed him.

798
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,453
And are you willing

799
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,133
to stake that
child's life on it?

800
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,591
See if he's willing
to take a drug test...

801
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:40,559
The rest of the family, too...

802
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:42,562
And find out who else

803
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:43,863
has been hanging

804
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:45,281
around the house.

805
00:34:57,746 --> 00:35:00,480
Ta-da!

806
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,915
Arthur?

807
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,567
The very same.

808
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,069
That's incredible!

809
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,771
He looks better

810
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,266
than your last husband.

811
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,768
Here's your old clothes, Arthur.

812
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,091
Take my advice.

813
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,292
Burn them.

814
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,329
<i>What</i> was that?

815
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,609
Ah! The air
conditioning is back on.

816
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:23,436
Great. Just in time
for me to go home.

817
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:24,454
Good night.

818
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,855
Bye-bye.

819
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,627
Jerry, if this guy's
here in the morning,

820
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,631
why don't we get some
shovels and bury him

821
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,098
in the parking lot?

822
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,600
Sorry, Dr. Greene.

823
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:40,803
Good night.

824
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,503
So, when they
brought the boy in,

825
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:47,560
was he conscious?
Did he say anything?

826
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:50,141
Ivan had been shot by
the same kid twice before.

827
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:51,976
Yeah. Oh, is that
what he told you?

828
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,467
Did he tell you that he
shot the kid this time?

829
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:56,414
Yeah. Look, how
many times was Ivan

830
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:58,699
supposed to let this
kid attack him? Huh?

831
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,689
All right.

832
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,956
Thanks a lot, Doc.

833
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,026
We'll be in touch if
we need anything else.

834
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,695
Look, Detective...

835
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:11,251
Ivan's not the kind of
man that belongs in jail.

836
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:12,752
What? You two friends?

837
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:15,721
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we are.

838
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,835
Yeah? Well, that
kid was unarmed.

839
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:19,259
Mr. Gregor chased him

840
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:21,928
out into the street and shot him

841
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:23,446
as he ran away.

842
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:26,482
You know where
Mr. Gregor is, Doctor?

843
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,255
Ivan...

844
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,456
Um...

845
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,792
I'm sorry.

846
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:17,967
Dr. Benton, they need
you in Trauma Two.

847
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:21,036
Dr. Benton?

848
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,438
You okay?

849
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,923
Yeah.

850
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,525
Uh... two.

851
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,892
Let's go.

852
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,584
Carter?

853
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:59,876
Mr. Freeman, the test came back.

854
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,379
It was negative.

855
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:03,946
Good.

856
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:06,282
I can have my baby?

857
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,418
Your older daughter
Shandra's drug test

858
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,221
was positive.

859
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,695
You knew that, didn't you?

860
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,766
Do you have kids, Doctor?

861
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,868
One. I have a son.

862
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,957
The year before my wife died...

863
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:38,581
she and Shandra were
at each other's throats.

864
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:42,751
Typical adolescent stuff.

865
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,304
They just...

866
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:49,642
never had a
chance to work it out.

867
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,569
I don't know what to do.

868
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,938
How to reach her.

869
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,909
Sometimes...

870
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:10,913
I think she's
trying to kill herself.

871
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,504
She needs help.

872
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:21,891
I can help you get it for her.

873
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,223
Honey, you can
fall asleep in here,

874
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:41,828
but I'm going to have to put
you in your own bed later, okay?

875
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:43,808
Okay. Does Mommy
come home tomorrow?

876
00:39:43,832 --> 00:39:45,298
Day<i> after</i> tomorrow.

877
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,733
Now, good night.

878
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:48,301
I miss her.

879
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:49,836
Me, too.

880
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:53,907
Daddy?

881
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:56,242
Yes?

882
00:39:56,277 --> 00:40:01,180
If I got hurt, would you fix me?

883
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:03,499
Yes. I would.

884
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,001
You wouldn't let me die?

885
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:15,010
You are... the most
important thing to me

886
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,595
on this earth,

887
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:21,067
and I would do everything
to make you better.

888
00:40:21,102 --> 00:40:22,301
Everything.

889
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,738
I love you, Daddy.

890
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:28,107
And I love you, sweetheart.

891
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,708
Come on, Chloe,
don't do this to me.

892
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,745
Chloe...

893
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,783
What are you...?

894
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,656
Chloe, I told you
not to let the cat out.

895
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,465
Chloe?

896
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,876
Chloe...

897
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:48,537
Oh, damn it!

898
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,978
Oh, Chloe...

899
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:38,788
Susan?

900
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,791
Susan?

901
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,333
The cat was out.

902
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,045
It's going to be all right.

903
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,347
I'll talk to her.

904
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,383
We'll get her some help.

905
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,755
It's going to be okay.

906
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,164
It's okay, it's okay.

907
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,032
Shh, shh, shh.
