1
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,720
Oh, God. Oh, no.

2
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,899
Something wrong?

3
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,390
All right, people,
who ate my salad?

4
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,041
Keep looking, Peter.

5
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:28,043
It's there. Yeah.

6
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:29,389
Damn it, it's not in here.

7
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:30,546
The ignition's shot.

8
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:31,724
Somebody took it.

9
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:34,383
No. I need someone
to fix it today.

10
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,385
Thank<i> you.</i>

11
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:40,989
I think I'll shove my
sister in front of a train.

12
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:43,170
She burn out your
ignition switch?

13
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:45,994
Yeah. I had to
hot-wire it to get to work.

14
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:47,896
You know how to hot-wire a car?

15
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:50,465
Learned it from one
of Chloe's boyfriends.

16
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,711
He's in Joliet.

17
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,012
Grand theft auto.

18
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:54,336
Oh, God!

19
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:56,404
We got a rollerblader coming in.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,906
Bashed head again.

21
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,107
Five minutes off.

22
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:00,842
This place is a mess, man.

23
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:03,278
Doesn't anybody
ever clean it out?

24
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:06,582
Jerry? Jerry...

25
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:09,150
don't turf me a
patient without a chart.

26
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:10,630
I'm sorry. I thought...

27
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,288
don't apologize. Just
do your damn job.

28
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,823
Ignore him.

29
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,295
More charts. That's great.

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,598
Any more exciting,
I'll check myself in.

31
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:23,777
Dr. Ross... Yeah.

32
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,311
Rescue 61's bringing in a woman

33
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,902
with severe head trauma.

34
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,638
All the neurosurgeons
are tied up in the O.R.

35
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,451
Divert the woman to St. Luke.

36
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:34,042
So, uh, who died and
left you Chief Resident?

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:35,376
Mark's got the flu.

38
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:36,522
I'm covering.

39
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:37,813
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,114
Saint Mark is out?

41
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,782
Must be pneumonia.

42
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:42,084
Hiya, Peter.

43
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,284
Sarah.

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,385
You two excited?

45
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,754
Announcement's today.

46
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,056
I know how to read
a calendar, Haleh.

47
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,390
What announcements?

48
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:50,659
Starzl Fellowship.

49
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,060
Maybe you noticed

50
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:55,275
Dr. Benton's a little anxious.

51
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,133
Dr. Ross, they needed
your DD-5 20 minutes ago.

52
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:00,568
I will send them four
pints of my blood.

53
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:01,970
What is a DD-5?

54
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,571
It's the shift status report.

55
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,407
You're supposed to fill it out.

56
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:07,142
How does Mark do all of this?

57
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:09,489
He puts in four
hours after every shift.

58
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:11,947
That's it. Jerry, I will do
anything to get him down here.

59
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:13,348
I'll put him on a drip.

60
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,550
I'll give him my
next four paychecks.

61
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,085
I don't care how sick he is.

62
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,884
Phone...

63
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,342
don't answer it.

64
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,913
It might be Craig.

65
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,315
Who's Craig?

66
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,317
Judge Franklin's other clerk.

67
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,852
Yeah?

68
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,186
Call him back.

69
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,956
Hello?

70
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,274
Hello?

71
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:40,358
Hello? Hello.

72
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,794
What the hell?

73
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,195
She called you from the street?

74
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,530
35th, over in Bridgeport.

75
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,531
Mark?

76
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,810
Look, are you certified

77
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,113
or do we need to
call in a counselor?

78
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,102
I'm certified.

79
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,404
She say anything?

80
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,306
Yeah. Not to touch her.

81
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,430
Jamie?

82
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:03,626
I'm Carol Hathaway. I'm a nurse.

83
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,050
Can I take your coat?

84
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,119
It's kind of warm in here.

85
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,720
There you go.

86
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,658
Todd knows my boyfriend.

87
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:19,598
He said Jack told
him to pick me up.

88
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,403
I shouldn't have gone with him.

89
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,938
I should've stayed home,

90
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,107
but he was a friend of Jack's.

91
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,525
I let it happen.

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,876
It was my fault.

93
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,594
It's okay. You're safe here.

94
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,030
It's going to be okay.

95
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,569
Is it?

96
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:47,092
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

97
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,437
What are you talking about?

98
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,139
It was incredibly inappropriate.

99
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,885
Please. I snapped
at a desk clerk?

100
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,609
He's not a desk
clerk. He's Jerry.

101
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,355
Well, he didn't do his job.

102
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,163
He didn't kill anyone,
Div. He lost a chart.

103
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,511
All right, I promise, I'll never
snap at a desk clerk again, okay?

104
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,667
This morning it was the cashier

105
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,170
at Starbucks.

106
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,071
Well, I-I don't know, um...

107
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:53,091
What is wrong?

108
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,193
Well, what's wrong is

109
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,640
is that you're wasting my time,

110
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,809
and, uh, and I'm
late for rounds.

111
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,667
Dr. Lewis, call on two.

112
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,839
Susan Lewis.

113
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,340
You're not coming?

114
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,645
You promised you'd
bring an ignition switch.

115
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,024
Never mind.

116
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,582
I know someone
who could fix your car.

117
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,261
I'll worship you forever.

118
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:22,320
Maybe you could just
help me get into an O.R.

119
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,199
Hmm... I think
they're up on Three.

120
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,528
Dr. Benton always forgets me.

121
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,197
Carter, important
lesson in life...

122
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,367
He who asks, gets,
he who doesn't, doesn't.

123
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,380
Coming through, coming through.

124
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,370
Carter!

125
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,872
Let's go.

126
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,052
Kenny, Mike, 17, passed
out at school. Vitals are stable.

127
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,876
Kid's a wrestler
at St. Robert's.

128
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,377
Susan, I need a pill-push.

129
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,546
I don't think there's a surgeon.

130
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,981
Let's go. LEWIS: Got it!

131
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,061
Get the history on this kid?

132
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,050
I don't know.

133
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,552
Okay.

134
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,398
All right, people, let's
take him and shake him.

135
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,456
On my count. One, two, three.

136
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,743
Lily, do a dextrose stick.

137
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,456
Carter, get another
line in. Let's move.

138
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,679
Let's get a CBC, lytes,

139
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:07,265
and let's tox screen him
for the works. Let's move.

140
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,383
Hypotensive, 70/60 and falling.

141
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,097
Glucose normal.

142
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,986
He's in trouble.

143
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:14,338
Are those PVCs? Rhythm strip.

144
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:18,393
Could be a nodal
rhythm with a block.

145
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:19,794
Why would he be having those?

146
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:21,307
All right, Susan,
it's your call.

147
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:22,609
What the hell is this?

148
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,732
I don't know.

149
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,850
A 17-year-old kid
with heart trouble...

150
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,405
It doesn't make sense.

151
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,288
Uh-oh. Extra beats.

152
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,406
He's going into arrhythmia.

153
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:33,991
What do we do now?

154
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,432
What exactly am I signing?

155
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:44,769
Title to your car...
Belongs to me now.

156
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,617
We have a 300-pound
diabetic in Two.

157
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,818
She's in ketoacidosis.

158
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,108
All right, see if there's an
endocrinologist upstairs.

159
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,444
Mm-hmm.

160
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,683
You are late, Mookie James.

161
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,418
Guards wouldn't let me in.

162
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,565
Well, you just get here earlier.

163
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,688
J-o-b, job.

164
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,390
That means be on time.

165
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,924
Don't sweat me.

166
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,464
Hey, how much money
these doctors make anyway?

167
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,865
30,000 a year.

168
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,199
That's all?

169
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,634
Mm-hmm.

170
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,969
Underpaid, overworked.

171
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,005
Get used to it.

172
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,136
Pressure's still falling. 60/45.

173
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:28,463
All right, central line is in.

174
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,797
Blood's back.

175
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,466
No drugs, but his
lytes are screwed up.

176
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:33,001
What's his potassium?

177
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,102
It's a 2.0.

178
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:35,598
All right, piggyback
20 milliequivalents,

179
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,088
and keep on eye on the EKG.

180
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,801
Why is his potassium crashing?

181
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,726
It could be hyperaldosteronism
or Bartter's Syndrome...

182
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,711
Carter, put that damn book down.

183
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:43,923
Any word on his family?

184
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:46,614
Or, uh... cirrhosis.

185
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,067
Heart's racing. Looks like SVT.

186
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,503
Rate's 240 and climbing.

187
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,883
We got to stop
this. It'll kill him.

188
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,524
Okay, rapid bolus
adenosine, six milligrams.

189
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,729
Nothing here. No constricting.

190
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:02,697
It's not coming down.

191
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,032
Let's shock him.

192
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,567
Hit the sync switch.

193
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,674
100. Charged.

194
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,008
Clear!

195
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:14,843
Pulse?

196
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,711
Faint. I'm barely getting it.

197
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,879
Shock him again. 200.200.

198
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,115
Clear!

199
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,801
Still no pulse.
We're losing him.

200
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,637
We have to get this guy's
rate down. Send it up to 360.

201
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,639
Ready.

202
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,674
Clear!

203
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,274
Give me a pacer. I'm
going to overdrive him.

204
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:35,430
You're going in blind?

205
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:37,644
You know, I'd love to
wait for a fluoroscope,

206
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:40,234
but I don't think this young
man would appreciate it.

207
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,280
Carter, come in close.

208
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:42,715
You're not going to
see this every day.

209
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,059
Let's get a line. Here you go.

210
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,080
He has to float the catheter

211
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,885
into the heart very... slowly.

212
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,808
Pacer captured.

213
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,578
Push it up to 300.

214
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,168
All right, now
bring it down slow...

215
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,820
very slow.

216
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,906
Slow.

217
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,035
Is that smoothing out?

218
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,177
Normal sinus rhythm.

219
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,521
Call me when he wakes up.

220
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,945
Last count, I filled
out 306 forms.

221
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,313
It's not even noon.

222
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,526
You finish the shift report yet?

223
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,751
What are these
abbreviations for?

224
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,252
This column... What's T.W.D.?

225
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,653
"Truly weird doctors."

226
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,788
Thank you.

227
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,356
How does Mark do this?

228
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,958
What is he, a machine?

229
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,510
You ready for another round?

230
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,634
Just give me one minute.

231
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,303
I knew you were a lightweight.

232
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,340
It's so great to
see you so happy.

233
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,309
I never felt like this before.

234
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,245
I'm good at something.

235
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,482
Franklin loved the rewrite
of my zoning opinion.

236
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,452
They look at me
differently now...

237
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,722
The other clerks
and the secretaries.

238
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,590
I like it.

239
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,331
I didn't understand
about you, Mark...

240
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,801
How you love to go to work.

241
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,442
Mmm...

242
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,016
Thank you for
staying home today.

243
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,163
I'm feeling a little guilty.

244
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,287
You're entitled to a day off.

245
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,556
You didn't take a
single sick day last year.

246
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,594
Ah, ah... let the
machine get it.

247
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,996
It might be Craig.

248
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,532
He's supposed to give me
notes on my new opinion.

249
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,212
Please leave a
message at the tone.

250
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,702
Mark, it's Doug.

251
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,071
You're probably in the
bathroom throwing up right now,

252
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,572
but I'm sinking here, buddy.

253
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,604
Dr. Ross, they're calling
about that shift report again.

254
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:21,295
Tell them I will get to
it when I can get to it.

255
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,714
Mark, if you ever had
any feelings for me at all,

256
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,428
if there's a glimmer
of friendship,

257
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,819
then you will haul your
ass off of that sickbed,

258
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,854
and you will get down here,

259
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,689
and you will rescue me.

260
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,558
I am not kidding there, buddy.

261
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,059
What is this? What is that?

262
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,494
I'm dying here, pal.

263
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,564
So, if you're awake,
and you could call me,

264
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,998
I'd appreciate it.

265
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,135
Now I'm feeling really guilty.

266
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,439
Mark, how many times
did you cover for Doug

267
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,774
last year?

268
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,442
Eight? Hmm?

269
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,443
Ten?

270
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,211
Mmm...

271
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:15,383
Anybody ever do it to you?

272
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:18,786
I've never been raped, no.

273
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,956
My mother always
said I was asking for it.

274
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,026
Jamie, look at me.

275
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,996
You said no,

276
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,448
and that's enough.

277
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,394
Nobody wants to be raped.

278
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,753
We have to take some samples...

279
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,856
Swab for semen, pubic hairs.

280
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,959
It's called a rape kit.

281
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,260
Doctor going to
put his hands in me?

282
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,207
No. No, I do it
with another nurse,

283
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,915
but the police will have
to take photographs.

284
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,152
He's not bad... Todd.

285
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,671
Been nice to me.

286
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,341
We have to do a rape kit now.

287
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,411
What's Jack going to say?

288
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,349
Not going to
believe Todd did it.

289
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,451
It's not your fault.

290
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,353
Are you hearing me?

291
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,866
Yeah. Can you tell me
when the results of the Starzl

292
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,502
are going to be announced?

293
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,549
So how we supposed to find out?

294
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,250
They're going to be posted?

295
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,619
Good. Maybe you
can just tell me if I...

296
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,312
Hello? Hello?

297
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,114
What are you so cheerful about?

298
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,250
I love watching you worry.

299
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,784
This is Mookie James.

300
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,119
You remember Mookie?

301
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,120
Yeah.

302
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,400
This is Dr. Benton.

303
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,535
He's going to be
your supervisor.

304
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,937
That means, if he says,
"Jump," you ask, "How high?"

305
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:49,927
Got it?

306
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,096
Yo, what's up?

307
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,397
Follow me.

308
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,099
Here. Put these gloves on.

309
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,718
You're going to need them.

310
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,801
Take everything out.

311
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,070
If it's green, it goes.

312
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,271
If it smells, it goes.

313
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,239
I want you to check
expiration dates.

314
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,908
Look for mold. Look for anything

315
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,944
that can crawl out
of here on its own.

316
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,579
Then I want you to scrub it all

317
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,213
from top to bottom. You got it?

318
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,882
I want to be able
to eat Sunday dinner

319
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,050
off of this thing.

320
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,051
Let's go. What?

321
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,719
I'm a janitor?

322
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,055
What did you think you
were going to be doing...

323
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,556
Performing brain surgery?

324
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:21,559
We got a cop in Trauma
2. Gunshot, superficial.

325
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,394
All right. Come on, let's go.

326
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,929
Don't take all day.

327
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,391
How you doing?

328
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,210
You okay?

329
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,545
Yeah, I'm okay, yeah.

330
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,525
This will just take a minute.

331
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,084
Just relax.

332
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,251
There you go.

333
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,965
So, you got a boyfriend?

334
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,134
Uh-huh.

335
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:08,889
What is he, like, a doctor?

336
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,591
Yes, he is.

337
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:13,978
Must be great.

338
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,246
You make lots of money.

339
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,532
That's it.

340
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:28,776
Why am I doing this?

341
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:33,247
I want my name in the
paper, I'll go kill myself.

342
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:37,785
You listen to me.

343
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,488
You're going to
get through this.

344
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,623
You'll move past it.

345
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:45,126
Yeah.

346
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,162
Sure.

347
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,800
So I put in a new
ignition switch

348
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,380
and some leads there for you.

349
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:58,405
By the way, why ain't
the lady doctor paying?

350
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:01,809
I'm going to get
that from her later.

351
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:03,243
$198.50, Doc.

352
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,723
For that kind of dough,

353
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,458
I hope she's good-looking.

354
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:08,382
She's a friend.

355
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:09,683
Yeah.

356
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,371
Mmm. It's Craig.

357
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,772
No, don't get it.

358
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,173
It could be Doug.

359
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,575
Hello?

360
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,310
Mark?

361
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,078
Sorry.

362
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,381
Hi, Doug.

363
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,549
How are you?

364
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,918
Um... a little better.

365
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,637
My fever's down.

366
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:30,871
What are you doing?

367
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,157
Um... just raiding
the refrigerator.

368
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,492
Well, you're eating.

369
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,759
You must be better.

370
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,295
You sure you don't
want to come in?

371
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,464
Um... I don't think so.

372
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,310
I thought Jen was in Milwaukee.

373
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,202
Um... actually, the
judge she works for,

374
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:49,306
he had to fly to Washington,
and so she got the day off.

375
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,759
Just one day,
huh? It's been, what,

376
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,144
two weeks since
you saw her last?

377
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,462
Three.

378
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:57,131
Three. That's right.

379
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,534
Okay. Well, I better let
you get back to being sick.

380
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,069
We wouldn't want you to...

381
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,638
wouldn't want it to
turn into pneumonia.

382
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:07,041
Thanks, Doug.

383
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:18,219
What?

384
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,554
Mark is very sick,

385
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,557
at home, with his wife.

386
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,409
Oh.

387
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,198
Hi.

388
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:32,266
Hi.

389
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,334
I'm John Carter.

390
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:34,601
What are you doing?

391
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,003
I was feeling better.

392
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,604
I needed some exercise.

393
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,307
I don't think exercise is
such a great idea right now.

394
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:43,010
You had a major coronary
event this morning.

395
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,878
You a doctor?

396
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,380
No, I'm a med student.

397
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,849
Dr. Lewis tells me
you're a wrestler.

398
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:50,084
I used to wrestle.

399
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,169
Junior varsity,
college, at Penn.

400
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,337
Oh, yeah. Great coach.

401
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,822
I read about him in the Trib.

402
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:59,242
Making your weight class okay?

403
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,845
Sure. Easy.

404
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,158
I didn't eat sometimes
to make mine.

405
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,760
Boy, I was tired a lot.

406
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,067
Me, too.

407
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:07,784
So you're not eating.

408
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,754
No, no. I eat plenty.

409
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,983
That's weird.

410
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,301
Your blood tests
look like you're

411
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,110
not eating at all.

412
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:18,178
I was there this morning,

413
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:19,896
and you almost died.

414
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,433
I'm okay.

415
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,686
I'm in good shape.

416
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:27,749
Uh-uh. How much did you lose...

417
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,018
Eight, ten pounds?

418
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,053
You must be cycling up and down

419
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,526
between every match.

420
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:36,446
I have a match against
Western next week.

421
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,766
The team's counting on me.

422
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:42,536
I think you should
tell Dr. Lewis the truth

423
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:45,772
so she can admit
you to the hospital.

424
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,574
Please...

425
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:52,463
I have to be on the team.

426
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,081
You've got a problem.

427
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:58,152
It's a kind of anorexia.

428
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:01,288
And, if you keep starving
yourself between matches,

429
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:02,856
it is going to kill you.

430
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:08,529
Has he been coughing?

431
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,030
No, he just won't eat.

432
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,300
Usually he eats like a
horse. He never stops.

433
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,967
You put anything
in front of him.

434
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,102
He's not picky.

435
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,103
It's okay.

436
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,516
He's going to be fine.

437
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,673
Temp's 100.2

438
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,185
All right, Ben, I want you

439
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,529
to take a deep
breath for me, okay?

440
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,827
Mm-hmm. One more time.

441
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,568
All right.

442
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:31,969
He has a sore throat.

443
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,837
That's why he's not eating.

444
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,755
Could it be croup?
He had it as a baby.

445
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,375
He's a little old for that.

446
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,860
Let me get some X rays,
make sure it's nothing serious.

447
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,161
It hurts.

448
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:42,980
I can't eat.

449
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,210
I know, buddy. We're
going to fix you right up.

450
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:46,634
Okay? All right.

451
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,135
I'll be right back.

452
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:57,494
Have an intubation
tray standing by

453
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,996
in case he gets worse.

454
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,400
Doug, some irate internist
is looking for your scalp.

455
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,069
Something about
assigning one of his patients

456
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,837
to the resident on call.

457
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,274
You take Ben to radiology,
and you stay with him.

458
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,311
You let me know if
anything changes, okay?

459
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,645
Right through here.

460
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,847
Your son is on his
way, Mrs. Benton.

461
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,016
On his way? Where?

462
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,718
He's coming to see you.

463
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,987
It's the stroke.

464
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,756
Some days she's
a little out of it.

465
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,890
Carter...

466
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,592
Hey, Walt, what's up?

467
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,461
Hey, Ma. How you doing?

468
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,862
My foot hurts.

469
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,530
Yeah, I know. You
sprained your ankle.

470
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,032
Walt, she's in a
lot of pain. man.

471
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,651
You should have taken her
to Emergency. It's a lot closer.

472
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,337
I thought you would
want to take care

473
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,972
of your own mother.

474
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,791
Petey, when did you
grow that mustache?

475
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,945
Three years ago, Ma.

476
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:54,201
Don't you have to be
somewhere, Carter?

477
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:56,481
No. Actually, it's kind of slow.

478
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,958
Carter? You got
people in Tennessee?

479
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,876
On my father's side.

480
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:06,447
I think his people
owned our people.

481
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:11,652
But you're a nice boy.

482
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,887
You come to Thanksgiving dinner.

483
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,307
She doesn't mean that.

484
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,125
No. You come to dinner now.

485
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,359
You promise.

486
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,630
I promise.

487
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:23,631
Okay, Ma.

488
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,899
Let's go take care of that foot.

489
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:28,702
Morgenstern wants
you in the O.R., Peter.

490
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:29,970
Mesocaval shunt.

491
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:33,674
Ma, I'm going to have
to see you later, okay?

492
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,575
Dr. Carter here is going

493
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,094
to take care of you.

494
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,196
Walter, don't even start, man.

495
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,564
I got to go.

496
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,936
Would you excuse
me for a second?

497
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,154
I'll be right back.

498
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,829
Where are you going?

499
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:58,310
I thought you might
let me go with you.

500
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,478
Mesocaval shunt.

501
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:02,068
I ought to learn, and
maybe I could help.

502
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:04,605
Well, I asked you to
look after my mother.

503
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,451
I could have a nurse do that.

504
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:08,975
You said yourself
it was only a sprain.

505
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:12,179
Well, still, I want you to
clean those lacs in two

506
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,447
and stitch them up.

507
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:16,000
See if my mother
needs anything to eat.

508
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,201
She doesn't eat enough.

509
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,736
Go. Let's move.

510
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,214
Headline news!

511
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,015
Guess who's leaving us?

512
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,784
Starzl Fellowship winner.

513
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,018
Good guys win?

514
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,455
Cancel the champagne.

515
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,656
Excuse me.

516
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,460
What is this, a
funeral or something?

517
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,634
Dr. Langworthy's
a year ahead of me.

518
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,570
I didn't expect to win.

519
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,545
Schedule.

520
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:02,913
Thanks.

521
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,792
When can you come back?

522
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,950
Not before Thanksgiving.

523
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,186
Can you come up next weekend?

524
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,732
No. I work both days.

525
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,122
I've got Wednesday.

526
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,069
We do oral arguments
on Thursday.

527
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,726
We do a lot of briefing
on Wednesday nights.

528
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,962
That's where you always are.

529
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,276
It's almost seven years, Mark.

530
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,999
They say you get an itch.

531
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,368
Yeah.

532
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,735
All the time.

533
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,207
I don't think about
anybody else.

534
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,542
Susan Lewis?

535
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,876
We're just friends.

536
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,378
Uh-huh.

537
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,712
What is this?

538
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,314
You projecting?

539
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,069
Where else can we do it?

540
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,726
I want to have
memories to hold me

541
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,440
for the next couple of weeks.

542
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,130
Kitchen table?

543
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,842
It's your grandmother's.

544
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,200
What would she say?

545
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:57,867
Worked for Grandpa.

546
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,371
Let the machine get it.

547
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,713
Let me out of here!

548
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:11,148
Get your hands off me!

549
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,327
I can't stitch him

550
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,862
if he won't settle down.

551
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,286
Get your hands off me!

552
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,354
I'm a citizen of a free country!

553
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,567
Mr. Randall!

554
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:21,492
Your head is bleeding.

555
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:22,726
Let me go!

556
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,461
Mr. Randall...

557
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,099
Mr. Randall?

558
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,567
Mr. Randall...

559
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,180
Take him to Exam Two.

560
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,416
Get Cvetic down
here to look at him.

561
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,708
He might need assessment
for suicide and depression.

562
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:38,709
Sure.

563
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:39,744
Thanks.

564
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:58,161
How long are you going to
pretend I'm not here, Peter?

565
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,776
That's fairly self-centered
of you, Sarah.

566
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,843
I'm working.

567
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,066
Yeah.

568
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:08,071
Um... congratulations
on the, um... Starzl.

569
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,873
I'm sorry you didn't get it,

570
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,709
but I'm glad I did.

571
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:14,244
Would you rather
someone else had won?

572
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,814
I really wasn't
that invested in it.

573
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,917
You wanted me to
lose if you couldn't win.

574
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,302
Peter...

575
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:25,205
I'm a year ahead of you,

576
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:27,825
and I could help you
be a better surgeon

577
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,025
if you'd let me.

578
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:32,396
You know what your problem is?

579
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:33,964
No, but, um...

580
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,210
I have a feeling

581
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:37,011
you're willing to tell me.

582
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,869
Losing to a woman.

583
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,787
Oh, come on.

584
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:44,909
The truth is, you
want to sleep with me.

585
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:48,095
Then you wouldn't
be so threatened.

586
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,432
Sarah, um...

587
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:59,123
not only don't I want
to sleep with you,

588
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:02,059
I've never even
fantasized about it.

589
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,629
Obviously, you have.

590
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,104
Yeah, right.

591
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,573
Excuse me.

592
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,129
Look, I... I just
want to leave, okay?

593
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:27,901
Um... why don't
you want a doctor

594
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,603
to take care of your head?

595
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:32,373
What are you, a shrink?

596
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:33,540
Shrinks.

597
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:36,276
They tell me I'll get over it.

598
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:39,680
My wife gets smashed
against a streetlight,

599
00:26:39,715 --> 00:26:42,549
and my son gets
his head cut off,

600
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:44,985
and I'll get over it real soon.

601
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:49,590
You know, there's, um...

602
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,761
nothing wrong with
being angry, you know.

603
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:56,597
I don't need this
patronizing crap.

604
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:59,700
You think you're
real important, hmm?

605
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:04,121
No one... no one denies
your pain, Mr. Randall,

606
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,339
but self-pity isn't the answer.

607
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:15,515
I'm, uh...

608
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,095
I'm ordering Mr. Randall

609
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,596
committed for 72 hours.

610
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:20,698
Take him to Five.

611
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,133
Put him in restraints.

612
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:23,740
You're locking me up?

613
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,776
You dumb bastard!

614
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,577
Who do you think you are?!

615
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,913
You can't do this to me!

616
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,383
I can drink all day long!

617
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,463
What's that about?

618
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,471
Oh, I committed him.

619
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:38,939
What?

620
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:39,940
Mm-hmm.

621
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:40,975
He's a drunk.

622
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:42,354
He's a dangerous drunk.

623
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:43,588
He tried to hit me.

624
00:27:43,612 --> 00:27:46,346
Did you do a full psych exam?

625
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:48,343
He's a pathetic
drunk. I didn't have to.

626
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,200
What's wrong with
you? Are you trying

627
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,835
to destroy your career?

628
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,003
What if he sues?

629
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,588
Well, screw him.

630
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:56,389
What if he does, huh?

631
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,392
Are you busy later?

632
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,395
Want to do some
Italian or something?

633
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:06,900
Carol?

634
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:07,901
Mm-hmm?

635
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,147
You got a minute?

636
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:11,538
Yeah. Excuse me.

637
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:14,074
The police lab called
about the rape kit.

638
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,075
Yeah?

639
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,354
They said there are

640
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:18,089
four different pubic hairs

641
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,079
in the samples.

642
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,514
Hers and three others.

643
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:22,649
Will you cover for
me for a minute?

644
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:23,767
Sure.

645
00:28:27,423 --> 00:28:29,623
Jamie, who else
was there last night?

646
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:32,192
There were three other
types of human hair

647
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:33,627
in the samples we took.

648
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,529
The police are going to ask you

649
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:37,263
the same questions I'm asking,

650
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,166
so, if you want me to
help, you have to help me.

651
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:42,180
I was with Todd,
like I told you.

652
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:43,637
And who else?

653
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:44,971
I don't remember.

654
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:47,841
Have you told me
anything that's true so far?

655
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,142
Yes!

656
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:51,695
I went over to Todd's,

657
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,563
and he had two friends there,

658
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,565
and I didn't know them,

659
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,967
and we were drinking.

660
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,580
And then what happened?

661
00:28:58,604 --> 00:28:59,803
I don't remember.

662
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:00,954
Anything?

663
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,021
No.

664
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:03,523
No!

665
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,158
Christ, no!

666
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:06,560
I don't remember it.

667
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:08,395
I was drunk.

668
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,196
And there were these guys,

669
00:29:10,232 --> 00:29:12,265
and I was pushing Todd away.

670
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,234
And this other guy... oh, God!

671
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:15,602
Oh, God!

672
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,172
Okay. It's all right.

673
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:20,607
It's okay.

674
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:21,959
Shh. It's okay.

675
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,293
I don't remember.

676
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,677
I don't remember.

677
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,346
I am the acting Chief
Resident of this E.R.

678
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,870
So why don't you go
back up to the sixth floor.

679
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,540
Aren't you late for a golf
game? Or is it tennis?

680
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,121
Doug, the McCabe kid
stopped breathing. Trauma Two.

681
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,377
Damn it.

682
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,845
Lydia?

683
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,113
Call Anesthesiology

684
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:46,183
and get an E.N.T. surgeon
down here now, please.

685
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,417
He's hypoxic.

686
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,563
Epiglottitis.

687
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:49,664
Coming through.

688
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,921
50-Year-old crasher,
collapsed lung.

689
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,237
Let's go.

690
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,961
Oxygen SAT 70 and dropping.

691
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,296
Laryngoscope.

692
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,326
How long has he been out?

693
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,332
Less than a minute.

694
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,678
Sore throat...
this came on fast.

695
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:05,113
Waiting room.
Where's the mother?

696
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,820
I can't even see his cords.

697
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,488
Connie, see if we can get

698
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:09,940
an air bubble.

699
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,342
Yes, Doctor.

700
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,689
There's a lot of
swelling in there.

701
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:18,081
Suction.

702
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,628
This tube is too big.

703
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,892
I need a smaller one.

704
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,270
Diminished breath
sounds on the right.

705
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:29,893
Hyperresonant.

706
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,498
Okay.

707
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,499
We got a tracheal shift.

708
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,700
Oh, no.

709
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,012
Tension pneumo.

710
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,747
Doug needs a small E.T. Tube.

711
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,238
Where the hell are they?

712
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,674
Bottom drawer.

713
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,009
What's Doug got in there?

714
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,477
Epiglottitis.

715
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,512
Six-year-old.

716
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,231
Give me a 14-gauge needle.

717
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,232
Come on.

718
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,333
Let's go.

719
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:02,876
Got it.

720
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:04,639
Congratulations, Mr. Kalman.

721
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,962
You're going to live.

722
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,163
He's swollen shut.

723
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,198
Yeah.

724
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,035
Carter, do me a favor.

725
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,403
Take this needle.

726
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,657
How long has he been out?

727
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:19,003
Coming up on two minutes.

728
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:20,872
What about a needle crike?

729
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:22,061
Not yet.

730
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,205
What are you doing?

731
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,373
I'm going in.

732
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:34,541
I said not yet.

733
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,153
Haleh...

734
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:50,723
hook up a 3.0 E.T. tube
hub to a cath and bag him.

735
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:56,782
Hyperventilate him now.

736
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:12,963
O2 SAT's up to 95.

737
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:17,233
All right. Start him
on 750 milligrams

738
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,019
Ceftriaxone I.V., Q-12.

739
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,656
Son of a bitch.

740
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:38,871
You lose a fellowship, so
you have to prove something.

741
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:40,873
Dr. Benton, otherwise
known as God.

742
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,392
You couldn't get the tube in.

743
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,172
I had plenty of time
to crike him myself.

744
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,780
Another 90 seconds, that kid's
brain would have been mush.

745
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,559
Right. 90 seconds,
and it's my choice.

746
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:49,733
The kid's alive.

747
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:50,912
He's my patient.

748
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,535
So it's okay if he dies, right?

749
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,933
Oh, so you're the only person

750
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:57,238
that can keep him alive?

751
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,582
It was a judgment call, Doug.

752
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,587
One I should have let you make.

753
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:37,614
You lost a fellowship
today, Peter, not a patient.

754
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:46,289
You know what I looked
like in there? Hmm?

755
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,190
In that interview?

756
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:53,596
I made a fool out of myself
in front of Morgenstern.

757
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,449
You saved two
lives in five minutes.

758
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:58,084
That's not a bad day.

759
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,793
Don't give her a hard time.

760
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,177
Just take her statement.

761
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,286
Jamie?

762
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:24,293
What's going on?

763
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,630
Jerry, have you seen
Jamie Hendricks?

764
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:27,964
Who?

765
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,499
The girl who was raped.

766
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,034
I think she just left.

767
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:54,924
My mom's dropping Rachel
off in about 20 minutes.

768
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,293
We should get dressed.

769
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,962
Are we pretending?

770
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,865
I think your mom
knows that we have sex.

771
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,801
She doesn't like to be reminded.

772
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,538
Let the machine get it.

773
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,339
Hi. We're not here.

774
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,709
Please leave a
message at the tone.

775
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,744
Hi, Jennifer. It's Craig.

776
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,079
The judge read
your new opinion...

777
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,382
Hi. I'm here.

778
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,283
He liked it?

779
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,653
That's great. Mm-hmm.

780
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,566
Why don't you call him back?

781
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,225
Let me get it out. Yeah.

782
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,661
Okay.<i> Morrison v. Kentucky.</i>

783
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,264
If you look at the form
selection clause arguments,

784
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:39,602
I think you'll see that the
jurisdictional issues apply.

785
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,271
I know the Supreme
Court settled it,

786
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,874
but the arguments
are very similar

787
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,676
to the ones we're using.

788
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,698
Well, use some
imagination, Craig.

789
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,818
Yes.

790
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,188
Go to page three.

791
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,257
Mm-hmm.

792
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:06,363
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

793
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,999
Oh, Dr. Ross.

794
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:14,203
This is our new
E.R. aide, Bogdana...

795
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,040
No. Bobdana... What is it?

796
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,275
No. Bogdanalivetsky.

797
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,610
Right.

798
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,011
How about "Bob"?

799
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,547
Bob?

800
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,916
Yeah. You see, you're answering

801
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,851
to your new name already.

802
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,353
Bob. See, that's cool.

803
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,925
Cool. Bob.

804
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,048
I'm taking Mr. Randall
downstairs. His meds are back.

805
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,461
You got to sign him out.

806
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:44,650
Okay.

807
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:46,763
Dr. Cvetic know about this?

808
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,421
Thank you.

809
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,605
Uh... what's going on?

810
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,641
You seem much better.

811
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:12,611
Yeah. It, uh... happens
when you sober up.

812
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,714
That was a nasty gash.

813
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,952
Yeah, uh... I
walked into a door.

814
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:26,559
Uh... what are we doing in here?

815
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:31,531
Going for an elevator ride.

816
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,832
A doctor with a sense of humor.

817
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:37,470
That... that's a treat.

818
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:44,277
Go home, Mr. Randall.

819
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:47,013
Uh... I thought I
was in for 72 hours.

820
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:48,998
You seem much calmer.

821
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,967
Call a cab. Go home.

822
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,469
Thank you.

823
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,541
Hey, Walt.

824
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,810
Hey. You got car trouble?

825
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:20,980
No, I, uh... no.

826
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:24,417
Pass me a wrench, will you?

827
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:26,152
Five-eighths.

828
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:28,566
Man, would your dad be surprised

829
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,125
if he could see me now
running his business

830
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,726
and you a surgeon?

831
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:39,232
Did you hear about that
fellowship thing today?

832
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:40,666
Yep.

833
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:42,235
Well, if you got it,

834
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,438
I'd hate to see the look
on your face if you didn't.

835
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:47,184
Yeah, well, I didn't get it.

836
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,742
No kidding.

837
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:54,847
You know, Walt,
man, it's hard to lose.

838
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:57,950
Yeah, well, most
of us are used to it.

839
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:01,020
Your trouble is, Pete, you
got most of what you want.

840
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:02,555
And, when you don't get

841
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,358
what you want, it hurts more.

842
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:08,827
Yeah? So, is that wrong?

843
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:11,564
It's just a little selfish.

844
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:16,001
You got a hard shell, Pete.

845
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,437
You don't let anyone in.

846
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:20,406
Just like your dad.

847
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:29,515
I wouldn't worry
about it though.

848
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:33,486
You're basically a good guy.

849
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,991
Give me a hand with this.

850
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,780
Jamie?

851
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,282
Go away.

852
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,917
What happened?

853
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,719
What are you doing here?

854
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,489
A lot you care.

855
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,191
Jaimie...

856
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,826
I don't know where to go.

857
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:35,631
My boyfriend doesn't
want me to come home.

858
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,118
He doesn't believe me.

859
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:47,025
Maybe I could
have fought harder.

860
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,661
I let him do it.

861
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,977
How could I let him do it?

862
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,003
Nobody will believe me.

863
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,139
You said no, didn't you?

864
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:05,177
I did.

865
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,680
Then you have to finish this.

866
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,349
You got to take care of things.

867
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,850
If you don't,

868
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,253
they come back.

869
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:16,756
They always do.

870
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,794
I don't know.

871
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,398
I know.

872
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:33,205
Come here.

873
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,707
Come on.

874
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,375
Come on.

875
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:55,311
