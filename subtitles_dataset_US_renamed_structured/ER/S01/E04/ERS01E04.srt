1
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:16,458
Carter.

2
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,711
Oh, man, somebody
get a drool bucket.

3
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,535
Carter... Where?

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,849
Up, up, up! Let's go.
Where's your pager?

5
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:25,085
I've been beeping
you for five minutes.

6
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,741
It's right... It's right here.

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,322
You take this, and you
keep it on your pillow.

8
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:31,591
That way, you don't
sleep though a page.

9
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,859
Now, come on. Let's go.

10
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,394
You've got patients to see.

11
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,618
Carter, let's go! Come on!

12
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,833
We've got an unwashed
and undomiciled male

13
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:41,601
with a laceration
to the forehead in 2.

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,536
Clean the wound, and
stitch him if need be.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,239
Whatever you do, please,
don't take off his shoes or socks.

16
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:47,473
God knows what you'll find.

17
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:48,608
Heads up! Coming through.

18
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,332
This way, this way,
this way. Come on.

19
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:51,533
When you finish with him,

20
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:53,902
see the little old lady
with leg pain in 6. Got it?

21
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,415
Yeah. You ever get used to this?

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,738
Used to what?

23
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:58,251
Going on three hours' sleep.

24
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,253
Anything more than three
hours, and I'm sluggish all day.

25
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:01,243
Chart's right there.

26
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:03,011
Mark, how was the big day off?

27
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,490
First two hours was great.

28
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:07,393
Then Rachel and Jen
left for Detroit for five days.

29
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:08,683
What's that all about?

30
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,263
Job interview. Oh, really?

31
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:11,431
Don't even start.

32
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:12,787
Morning, guys.

33
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,801
Susan, can you
work Thursday night?

34
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,159
I am on Thursday night.

35
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:18,827
It's tough.

36
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:20,395
Wife so far away,

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,998
and other more immediate
temptations so close.

38
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,677
You haven't the faintest idea

39
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,346
what you're talking about.

40
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,670
I know<i> exactly</i> what
I'm talking about.

41
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:30,672
Doug, I need you in 3.

42
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:33,008
And good morning to
you, Nurse Hathaway.

43
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:35,210
Good morning.

44
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:38,113
No, the price breaks
on the photocopiers

45
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:39,781
start with five-unit orders.

46
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:41,449
Be off in a jiff.

47
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:42,951
Tell you what, Sam.

48
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:46,121
If you're free to sit down this
afternoon, say around 3:00,

49
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:48,456
I'd like to lay out a package

50
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,127
that covers your phone,
fax and e-mail needs as well.

51
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:53,461
All right, tomorrow then.

52
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:55,430
Sam, have I told you
about our all-inclusive

53
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:56,498
five-year service plan?

54
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,533
Okay, in broad strokes,

55
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,567
We guarantee every
pinion, spindle, sprocket,

56
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:00,869
for the life of the machine,

57
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,355
including unlimited service
for the first five years.

58
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,690
It started last week.

59
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,369
People would speak to Ozzie,

60
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,693
but he wouldn't respond.

61
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,361
I thought maybe

62
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,390
something was
wrong with his hearing.

63
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:12,731
Ozzie, can you hear me?

64
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,834
You wouldn't stick things
in your ears, would you?

65
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,836
That's good, because
my mom told me

66
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,505
that you never put
anything in your ears

67
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,090
smaller than your elbow.

68
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:25,526
Ozzie, can you
hear me whispering?

69
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,311
Okay. Yes.

70
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,397
Okay, I'll tell you,
Mrs. Schap, um...

71
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,867
there's no sign of
infection, and no injury,

72
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,653
and, right now, Ozzie's
hearing seems to be fine.

73
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,516
Yeah. That's
what's so frustrating.

74
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,424
He does hear some things,
but he doesn't hear others.

75
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,326
What are some of the
things that he doesn't hear?

76
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,146
Hmm... like my
mother's voice, for one.

77
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:47,882
She says really
terrible, terrible things.

78
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,569
She thinks that
I'm a bad mother.

79
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,838
And your mother lives with you?

80
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,508
No, no, no, no,
no, no. She's dead.

81
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:02,230
Uh... but you still hear her?

82
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,165
Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:07,252
What are some
of the other voices

84
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,004
that Ozzie can't hear?

85
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,039
My ex-husband's,

86
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,225
the ice cream man's,

87
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,510
Diana...

88
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:17,145
Diana?

89
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,598
The Princess of Wales!

90
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,799
Does that ring a bell?!

91
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,235
Can you excuse
us just for a second?

92
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,206
Call Psych Services.

93
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,208
Tell them we need a consult.

94
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,244
Get Social Services
down here for the boy.

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Leave the door open
until he gets here.

96
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,448
Hey. Doctor...

97
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,451
Yeah. What's up, kiddo?

98
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,453
Me and my mom...

99
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,466
we can stay together, right?

100
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,223
You bet you can.

101
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:49,243
Did you leave the money there?

102
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,597
Oh, that was...

103
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,536
That's what you sound like!

104
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,564
Patient is experiencing
severe pain

105
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:48,998
in the right lower extremity.

106
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,833
Recent history
includes colon cancer,

107
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,635
as well as a
four-hour plane flight.

108
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,371
Upon examination, patient's
calf was found to be tender

109
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,340
as well as four centimeters
larger than the unaffected side.

110
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,799
Differential diagnoses
include cellulitis injury,

111
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,334
hematoma, Baker's cyst,
and deep vein thrombosis.

112
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,336
Okay, so what would you do?

113
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,349
I suggest a CBC, Chem seven,

114
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,341
coag study and a
duplex scan of the leg.

115
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,943
All right. Bye, now.

116
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,389
In addition, given
that two elements

117
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,124
of Virchow's Triad are present,

118
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,226
I feel that a
venogram is indicated

119
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,228
if the scan is inconclusive.

120
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,885
Proceed.

121
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,899
So you concur with
my recommendations?

122
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,889
I said, proceed.

123
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,891
Mr. Madsen gets a GI cocktail,

124
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,204
and check with Urology.

125
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,238
Can I get some help, please?

126
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,873
We need a doctor.
Malik, get a wheelchair.

127
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,563
She came in with chest pains.

128
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,911
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene. Can
you show me where it hurts?

129
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,234
My heart.

130
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,914
Have you had heart
problems before?

131
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,403
She had two heart attacks

132
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,906
before they put that
machine in her chest.

133
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,241
A pacemaker?

134
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,909
No. A defibrillator.

135
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,255
Okay, well, just relax.

136
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,913
I want a 12-lead,
CBC, Chem seven,

137
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,582
cardiac enzymes
and a coag profile.

138
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,929
What's your name, ma'am?

139
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,252
Vilma.

140
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,598
Okay, Vilma, you just relax,

141
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,399
and we're going
to take care of you.

142
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,502
Sir, sir... I need you
to go with the nurse

143
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,837
and go to the waiting room.

144
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,339
I'll come talk to you as
soon as I can, all right?

145
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,664
What the hell is
Virchow's Triad anyway?

146
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,666
That sounds like a
board exam question.

147
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,333
One that I'd skip.

148
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,669
Jerry, do me a favor.

149
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,081
Bring the fan over here.

150
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,349
I'm burning up.

151
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,607
Word on the vine is
that you and Langworthy

152
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,943
both put in for the
Starzl Fellowship.

153
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,623
Yeah? Well, that's
no big surprise.

154
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,414
She's a year ahead
of you. So what?

155
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,200
So, heads up. Here
comes the competition.

156
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:28,220
You get the results on bed four?

157
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,754
Not yet.

158
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,089
Sarah...

159
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,608
what's Virchow's Triad?

160
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,511
Stasis, trauma and
hypercoagulability.

161
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:40,514
And, Jerry, get
this fan out of here.

162
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,817
It's blowing right in my face.

163
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,853
Dr. B. Wanted it there.

164
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,557
Code 3 scoop and run...

165
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:50,803
Auto versus pedestrian...
Just pulled up.

166
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,126
I'll take it.

167
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,862
Come on, Peter. You can assist.

168
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:55,697
Come on! Step on it! Step on it!

169
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,811
Hit-and-run victim,
approximately 17.

170
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,496
Found him lying in a
crosswalk, in full arrest.

171
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,620
Vitals?

172
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,954
Negative.

173
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,290
Pupils are blown.

174
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,303
How long was he lying there?

175
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,294
Who knows? No one saw him.

176
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,463
Get five units of
O-neg to Trauma 1.

177
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,131
Come on, grab that I.V., Peter.

178
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,628
Step on it, people.
Let us through.

179
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:18,753
We need more blood,
and give an amp of EPI.

180
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:20,789
Any heart sounds? Negative.

181
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:23,091
18 minutes. Time?

182
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,425
X ray?

183
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,094
Wait! Aprons!

184
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,112
People, move it!

185
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,663
Protect your gonads, Peter.

186
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,526
I always do when
you're around, Sarah.

187
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,844
Let's move, people.

188
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,834
Come on, move it! Move it!

189
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,848
Fire in the hole.

190
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,850
Come on.

191
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,840
Move it, people.

192
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,294
What's going on?

193
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,329
Kid was D.O.A.

194
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,964
They're trying to
bring him back.

195
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,032
His tube is loose.

196
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,617
Carter, get over here
and hold his E.T. tube.

197
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:52,137
His left side is full of blood.

198
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,200
Autotransfuser.

199
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,523
Let me in.

200
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,442
Give me some help.

201
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,443
Come on, give me some help.

202
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,946
Come on, come on. You can do it.

203
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,502
Come on.

204
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,773
B.P.?

205
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,342
150/105.

206
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,021
How are you feeling, Vilma?

207
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:17,345
I can't breathe.

208
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,358
Respiration is 28, pulse 120.

209
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:22,350
Let's give her .4
nitro sublingually.

210
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,352
Please, Doc...

211
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,354
I feel like I'm dying.

212
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,473
Respiration's 32.

213
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,791
She's hyperventilating.

214
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,404
Try and control
your breath, Vilma.

215
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,794
Slowly.

216
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,178
It hurts.

217
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,464
Let's get her some morphine.

218
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,919
Vilma?

219
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:48,059
Oh, my God.

220
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:53,915
Blood pressure's coming down.

221
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,235
Feeling better?

222
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,888
Better.

223
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,822
Much better.

224
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,295
I think you guys
can take it from here.

225
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:20,709
She says she's been taking

226
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,410
both Prolixin and Ativan.

227
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,412
Schizophrenic?

228
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:26,080
Floridly, yes.

229
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:28,416
Went off her meds...
Now she's delusional.

230
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:30,418
Hearing voices.

231
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,765
I'm going to have to admit her.

232
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,422
What about the boy?

233
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,938
The social worker's calling
the Presbyterian Home.

234
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,267
Skull fracture,
C-5 neck fracture,

235
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,780
hemopneumothorax,

236
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,437
ruptured diaphragm.

237
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,105
Any heart activity?

238
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:55,159
Time?

239
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,961
31 Minutes.

240
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,164
Sarah...

241
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,279
Time of death...

242
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,149
10:06.

243
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:36,743
We lose them all
the time, Carter.

244
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,534
Does the pain move around?

245
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,937
It just sits there like
a bayonet to the gut.

246
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,355
Ah!

247
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:16,357
How long have you had this?

248
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:18,025
A year, off and on.

249
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,694
Never this bad.

250
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,663
Also, I get constipated,

251
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,676
and sometimes there's
blood in the bowl.

252
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,283
You haven't seen a doctor?

253
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,102
If he was open nights
and Sundays, I would have,

254
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:29,537
but who's got the time?

255
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,724
It's me.

256
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,392
Harry Stopak.

257
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,061
Bob Wellman!

258
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,729
How are you?

259
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,098
You got the
brochure I sent over?

260
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,579
Sorry. I got to take this.

261
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,581
So, you like the EM-250?

262
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,238
That's a good copier, Bob.

263
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,975
But, frankly, I saw you
more in an EM-250R.

264
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,361
Yeah.

265
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,374
You get any breakfast yet?

266
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,064
No.

267
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,244
Well, get some,
and be back in 15.

268
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:00,735
Carter, come here a minute.

269
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,337
He must have been on
his way to shoot buckets.

270
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:04,973
No I.D., no name on the ball.

271
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,919
His gym shorts say
Von Steuben High.

272
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,409
Call the high school.

273
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,623
It's summer vacation, but
maybe someone can I.D. him.

274
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,191
Wait a minute. Who
gave you permission

275
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,526
to assign duties to my students?

276
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,994
I didn't know you
owned Mr. Carter.

277
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:17,096
I thought he was assigned
to the Surgical Service.

278
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,598
Yeah? Well, he isn't.

279
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:20,588
Are you saying he's
unavailable to me?

280
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:22,924
I'm saying, next time, you ask.

281
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,271
Dr. Carter, identify the dead
boy for Dr. Langworthy here,

282
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,107
and then you report back to me.

283
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:29,764
Doug Ross.

284
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,600
We've got a little girl who
may have a broken hand.

285
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:34,769
Let go of me,
you son of a bitch!

286
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,137
Can you hold on a second?

287
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,208
You son of a bitch!

288
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,227
Get his hands off me!

289
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,829
No, no!

290
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,748
You're in a hospital.

291
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,716
Mrs. Schap...

292
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,868
Get his hands off me!

293
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,204
Nobody's going to hurt you.

294
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,825
Thank you.

295
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,395
No, no...

296
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,063
Ow!

297
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,231
Damn it!

298
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,233
Damn it!

299
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,602
No, no, no!

300
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:08,936
Where am I going?

301
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:12,323
Give her five Haldol
I.M., and get her upstairs.

302
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:15,610
Oh, look at you!

303
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:17,579
Why are you doing this?

304
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:19,914
Ozzie?

305
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,916
Stop this!

306
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,651
The kid's gone.

307
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:25,319
Ozzie! Ozzie!

308
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:27,989
I'll call Security.

309
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,323
Damn it!

310
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:32,326
You got to get somebody
to look at your hand.

311
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,528
Thank you, Doctor.

312
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,897
God!

313
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,998
Vilma, your lab tests look fine

314
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:40,068
and your heart rhythm's normal.

315
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:42,070
I'm going to give you the name

316
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:43,737
of an anti-gas tablet.

317
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:46,074
And I'd lay off the
kielbasas for breakfast.

318
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:47,420
Thank you, Doctor.
You saved her.

319
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:49,676
It's another attack!

320
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,496
Is she seizing?

321
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,966
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

322
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,135
Just relax. Just relax.

323
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,937
No, her heart's fine.

324
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,972
Has this happened before?

325
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,373
Never.

326
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,708
What was it?

327
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,344
I definitely felt that.

328
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,224
What's happening, Doc?

329
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,532
The defibrillator in your
wife's chest is going off.

330
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,068
Why is it shocking me?

331
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,499
It's supposed to, but only
when you're having arrhythmia,

332
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,250
which you are not.
Must be malfunctioning.

333
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,202
Can't you shut it off?

334
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,693
That's what we're
going to try and do.

335
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,579
Call Cardiology.

336
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,944
She really sank
her teeth into you.

337
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,369
Any patient who's even
potentially psychotic

338
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,705
should be placed in
four-point restraints

339
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,373
and muzzled.

340
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,052
Spoken like a true healer.

341
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,378
After 15 years, not
one week has gone by...

342
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:44,382
Not one week... without being
bitten, spat, puked or peed on.

343
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,495
You're a misanthropic old fart.

344
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,303
I'm not old.

345
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:53,774
Is this necessary?

346
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,395
The human mouth
literally swims with bacteria.

347
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,480
Staph aureus, eikenella.

348
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:02,450
The woman deserves a lobotomy.

349
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,952
A hammer to the head.

350
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:05,619
Ow!

351
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,955
Sorry. Did that hurt?

352
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,691
Yeah.

353
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,848
Dr. Langworthy?

354
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,116
Yes?

355
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,451
The only one left

356
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,431
over at the high
school is the janitor

357
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,367
who left a message
for the principal

358
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,935
and he's going to give
me a copy of the yearbook

359
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,904
so maybe I can
find the boy's picture.

360
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,206
I just wish there was
something more I could do.

361
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,530
Such as?

362
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,864
I don't know.

363
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,879
So, for now, should I go
back to Dr. Benton or...?

364
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,369
Go.

365
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,737
Okay.

366
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,522
My passing hand.

367
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,535
If Billy Fleishell
hadn't piled on,

368
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,204
it never would have happened.

369
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,528
He left cleat marks
on your knuckles.

370
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,863
It's from his teeth.

371
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,198
He speared me, so I popped him.

372
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,766
The game's rougher
than when I played.

373
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,168
I don't think it's broken,

374
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,237
but Carol will take
Blair up to X ray,

375
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,572
and give her something
for the pain, okay?

376
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,241
I don't need anything.

377
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,575
Right this way.

378
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,077
John, thanks for coming down.

379
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,412
Hey, no problem.

380
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,691
Hey, listen, I understand

381
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,577
you've been quite
attentive to carol

382
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:26,595
since she got back.

383
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,953
Well, I didn't mean to be.

384
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,222
No, no, it's okay.

385
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:34,174
I'm glad you guys
are still friends, really.

386
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,344
Okay?

387
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,690
Call me anytime, okay?

388
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:39,714
Okay.

389
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,953
Hi.

390
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:48,956
Mr. Stopak, you need
to see a specialist

391
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:50,986
for further tests to rule out

392
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,078
ulcerative colitis,
which is very serious.

393
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,946
You think that's what I've got?

394
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,804
Based on your history,
and what I've seen, no.

395
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,073
I think you have
irritable bowel syndrome,

396
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,003
which can become
serious if untreated.

397
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,129
Assuming that's what I've
got, how do I get rid of it?

398
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:14,092
Increase the bran in your
diet and, more important,

399
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,844
decrease the
stress in your life.

400
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,336
I don't exactly control
the stress in my life.

401
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,848
Cut back your work hours.

402
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,606
Cut back? Doctor, in my office,

403
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,241
there are two kinds of guys:

404
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,276
those who sell
more than $10 million

405
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,612
and make the annual
trip to Palm Springs,

406
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,946
and those who don't.

407
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,431
You know how long it's been

408
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,766
since I missed the trip?

409
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,034
I have<i> never</i> missed the trip.

410
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:35,703
I'm back.

411
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,038
Good.

412
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:38,673
Fill out these slips,

413
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,676
and take those urine
samples up to the lab.

414
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:43,477
It's good to be back.

415
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:49,016
Hey, Walt, what's up, man?

416
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:52,019
Parked you in the first
row near the Dumpsters.

417
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:54,021
Oh, yeah? So, it was
the transmission, huh?

418
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,355
That sucker was shot.

419
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:57,692
Hey, how you getting
back to the station?

420
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,504
Peanut followed me in the truck.

421
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:01,261
Jackie's excited about tonight?

422
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:03,809
Oh, yeah. I'm taking
her to this fancy place

423
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,132
she's been dying to try

424
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,512
ever since she heard
that Oprah owned it.

425
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:09,265
It's steep, but I figure,

426
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,483
hey, it's our tenth anniversary.

427
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,335
What the hell?
Your sister's worth it.

428
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,926
And I appreciate
you coming to sit

429
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,344
with your mom.

430
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,415
Yeah.

431
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,985
How's she doing, man?

432
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,636
No incidents this week,

433
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,970
but you can't

434
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,984
leave her alone
for five minutes.

435
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,109
She'll be in the backyard
yelling at the neighbors.

436
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:36,163
But she's making Jackie
take her to the beauty parlor

437
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,510
so she can look pretty for you.

438
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,529
Look, man, I got to split.

439
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,852
8:30, right?

440
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,621
Yeah. I'll be there.

441
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,117
Hi.

442
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,889
My name is Carol.

443
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,138
I like your sneakers.

444
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,129
They're not the good kind.

445
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,465
My mom got them
from the cheapo store.

446
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,468
Where is she?

447
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,904
The doctors took her upstairs.

448
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,906
She's very sick.

449
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,709
They're going to try
and make her better.

450
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,481
That doctor said
we can stay together.

451
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,151
Well, it looks like
your mom may have

452
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,706
to stay her for a while.

453
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,989
Can I see her?

454
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,558
I don't know if she
can have visitors,

455
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,992
but I'll check.

456
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,729
You want to hang out with me?

457
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,164
I'm taking you up to Cardiology.

458
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:07,866
They're familiar
with this problem,

459
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,901
so you don't have to
worry about anything.

460
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,359
You'll be okay. Hold on.
Let me grab your records.

461
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:14,573
Dr. Lewis, listen, I
appreciate what you said.

462
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:17,192
My wife's been telling me
the same thing for 18 years.

463
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,599
You have the number
for the gastroenterologist?

464
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,613
Hey, you happen to
know who's in charge

465
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,932
of business machine
procurement around here?

466
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,075
Hello.

467
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,245
Louise!

468
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,208
Did you get the
rate card faxed over?

469
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,127
Sorry. I can't hear you!

470
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,895
It's quite noisy here.

471
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,969
Sir, hang up that phone.

472
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:39,787
What?

473
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,388
Hang up the phone now!

474
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,609
Are you okay?

475
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,744
What kind of phone is that?

476
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,291
The most powerful
handheld on the market.

477
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,626
It's got turbo-dial,
alphanumeric memory.

478
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,017
I'll get you half-price.

479
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,385
I don't want to buy one.

480
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,053
I want you to take that phone

481
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,805
out of this hospital. Now. Now!

482
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,157
You're supposed
to screw the caps on.

483
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,159
Here. Von Steuben High yearbook.

484
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,495
A guy dropped it off.

485
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,647
Sure, I'll take care of it.

486
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:09,903
Find him?

487
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,839
Yeah, uh...

488
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:13,841
Steven Tierney, a junior.

489
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:18,412
A member of the marching
band, and on the debate club.

490
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:22,649
He was kind of a nerd.

491
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:24,851
Kind of like me.

492
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:30,357
I, um... I got to get up to
the O.R. and do a hernia.

493
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:31,909
You call his folks?

494
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,743
Should I?

495
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,158
Just get them down here.

496
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,593
Let Langworthy break the news.

497
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,097
Change your clothes, huh?

498
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:50,911
You haven't even thought
about it with Susan?

499
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:52,390
So what? I'm a married man.

500
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:54,982
Doesn't mean I'm not allowed

501
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,383
to even speculate.

502
00:23:56,418 --> 00:24:00,054
You're saying you would
never act on it, ever?

503
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:01,822
If your question is,

504
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,601
are there circumstances

505
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,871
in which I might
possibly, conceivably...

506
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:07,027
commit adultery, yes.

507
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:09,163
Let's say Jen takes
a job out of town

508
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,943
in, oh, I don't know, Detroit,

509
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:12,878
and she leaves you here.

510
00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:15,936
No, no, there would
have to be more.

511
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:17,482
An affair, perhaps.

512
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:18,884
She goes out on you,

513
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:21,019
and you could, justifiably...

514
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,509
even the score?

515
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,012
Yes.

516
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,948
That's not going
to happen though.

517
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:30,584
You never know.

518
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:33,220
Maybe I could be of service.

519
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,992
Ow!

520
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:39,726
Mark, that chest pain

521
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:41,940
rule-out M.I. just got here.

522
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:43,397
Oh, okay.

523
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,016
55-Year-old with
substernal chest pains.

524
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,050
Thank you.

525
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,473
What about her?

526
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:54,987
They lost the key.

527
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:57,811
We're going to need
bolt cutters for these cuffs.

528
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,413
And cut off these chaps, okay?

529
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:01,159
This is so embarrassing.

530
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:03,216
Exam room 2, Jer?

531
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,885
Curtain 3; and what's
the patient's name?

532
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,755
It's Neil Shearer.

533
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,641
Thank<i> you.</i>

534
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,390
Hey, Jerry, this is Ozzie.

535
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,891
Hi.

536
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,393
How you doing?

537
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,795
He's going to hang
out with us for a while.

538
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,397
His mom's on the fifth floor.

539
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:34,898
Ah. Okay.

540
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,733
I have to check
on some patients.

541
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,402
Can you watch him for a while?

542
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:39,903
Sure. No problem.

543
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,272
I'll be right back.

544
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,253
So, you ever seen a picture

545
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,837
of a diseased gall bladder?

546
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,172
Check it out.

547
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:03,744
Excuse me.

548
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,079
My neighbor says that my
husband was brought here

549
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:07,263
in an ambulance.

550
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,314
What's his name?

551
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,716
Neil Shearer.

552
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:12,052
Uh...

553
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,854
Wait here one second.

554
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:20,878
His rhythm's off.

555
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,558
He's having multifocal VCs.

556
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,748
Uh-huh. Give him a hundred

557
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:28,185
of Lidocaine I.V.
push and start a drip.

558
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,687
There you go.

559
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,466
Here you go, ma'am.
Sit down right here.

560
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,923
Thank you. Thank you.

561
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,469
Excuse me. What is it?

562
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,327
Mr. Shearer's
wife is at the desk.

563
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,629
Oh, God!

564
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:41,543
Are you and Mrs.
Shearer acquainted?

565
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,967
I'm her secretary.

566
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,002
Jerry, why don't you

567
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,970
show Mrs. Shearer
to the waiting room?

568
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,482
Behind you. Look out.

569
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,974
Ah, Malik, you
look like a surgeon.

570
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,341
Yeah. Excuse me.

571
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,776
Oh, can you...?

572
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,344
Come on.

573
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,680
Okay, does it hurt
anywhere in here?

574
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:57,914
Not really.

575
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,351
All right. Just tell me
when it does, okay?

576
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,819
You did an abdominal
series, and ultrasound?

577
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,455
They were negative.

578
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,101
C.B.C., U.A. Chem
seven, amylase?

579
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,592
All negative, but
her sed rate's 50.

580
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,904
Oh! Right there.

581
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,728
Okay, okay. Just sit tight.

582
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,731
You pulled me out of
my first pantaloon hernia

583
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,567
for an old lady with
arthritis in her back?

584
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,069
But her sed rate...

585
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,483
Her sed rate is high due
to chronic inflammation.

586
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,018
She's got no G.I. symptoms,

587
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,519
no rectal mass,
Y.A. negative stool.

588
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,688
So just what surgical
problem do you think she has?

589
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,745
Gall bladder, appendix,
mysenteric infarction...

590
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,958
Based on what?

591
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,515
Based on what the
patient's telling me.

592
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,128
Okay. Well, I'll leave you two

593
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,496
to chat a little bit more.

594
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,530
I'll be in the O.R.

595
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,034
if you get a real
surgical candidate.

596
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,993
Mrs. Shearer?

597
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,829
Mrs. Shearer?

598
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,433
Ozzie.

599
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:50,700
Ozzie?

600
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,238
I'll find him.

601
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:59,159
Hello, Mr. Tierney.

602
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:00,594
This is, um...

603
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:02,229
My name's John Carter,

604
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:07,000
over at the emergency room at
Cook County General Hospital.

605
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:11,771
Your... your son Steven has
been involved in an accident

606
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,240
and, uh...

607
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,909
well, his condition
is... serious,

608
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,481
and I think you should
come down here right away.

609
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:23,250
It's serious.

610
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,784
Very, very serious.

611
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,320
Thank you.

612
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:37,581
Carol, does the
name Joey Skarneckia

613
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,116
ring a bell?

614
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,629
It's a pedes case... car
accident... three months ago.

615
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,253
Not a clue.

616
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,856
Well, this insurance company
wants some information.

617
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,493
Will you call medical
records for me?

618
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,962
Are your hands painted on?

619
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,430
What?

620
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,865
Pick up the phone and dial.

621
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,747
Now, out of curiosity,

622
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,406
is this free-flowing
hostility aimed

623
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,409
at the world in
general, or just me?

624
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,122
You don't want to know.

625
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,128
What?

626
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,479
What?

627
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,792
You told that little boy

628
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,393
he could stay with his mother

629
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,129
when you knew she'd be put away,

630
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,496
probably for a long time.

631
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,632
Just who did you
help by lying to him?

632
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:18,822
I didn't lie.

633
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,001
Sure, you did.

634
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,070
You told him what
he wanted to hear

635
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,828
because you didn't want
a big emotional scene,

636
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,975
which is something
you can't handle,

637
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,432
and avoid at all costs.

638
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,449
Oh, boy.

639
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,940
White count's 20,000.

640
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,441
Oh, God! Call the O.R.!

641
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,454
Get Morgenstern down here now!

642
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:42,913
Hang in there.

643
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,159
Hang in there.

644
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,149
Come on! Come on!

645
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,150
I'm trying.

646
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,328
Faster! Please!

647
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,652
Relax.

648
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,521
We still got S.T. elevation
in the anterior leads.

649
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,023
Go to the left, please!

650
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:55,237
There's a Mrs. Shearer outside.

651
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,538
I've got to go!

652
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:57,682
Patient's conscious.

653
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,900
God. Neil, what happened?

654
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,353
Patient's<i> unconscious.</i>

655
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,698
He had a small heart attack,

656
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,684
but we were able to
give him medication,

657
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:10,907
and he's stabilized now.

658
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,609
However, I'm going to have
to ask you to wait outside.

659
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,939
Why do I have to
wait in the hallway

660
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:16,006
if you said he's stabilized?

661
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,848
It's hospital policy.

662
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,182
I'm sorry.

663
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,684
No, I'm sorry.

664
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,919
This is my husband,

665
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,104
and I want to be wherever he is.

666
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,842
What's this?

667
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:31,728
Do you have a pen?

668
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,129
Oh, yeah.

669
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,549
Where are my husband's clothes?

670
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,535
Excuse me?

671
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:40,515
The clothes that he was wearing

672
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,316
when he was brought in here.

673
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,706
Where are his clothes?

674
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,041
Uh... I'm not sure.

675
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,580
Well, they have to be here
somewhere, don't they?

676
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,084
Priscilla?

677
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:30,203
I suppose you all think
this is very, very funny.

678
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,389
Don't you?

679
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,131
Excuse me.

680
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,967
Call the O.R.!

681
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,202
Tell them we got

682
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:53,810
a retrocecal appendix,
and we need a room!

683
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,211
Did she perf?

684
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,158
Yes, she did,
thanks to Dr. Lewis.

685
00:31:57,182 --> 00:32:00,049
Patient presents with
stabbing lower back pain,

686
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,586
and you didn't ask
for a surgical consult?

687
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,821
A medical student
would know better.

688
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:05,867
She consulted me.

689
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,469
I assessed that the patient

690
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,137
wasn't a surgical candidate.

691
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,438
Do you need an assist?

692
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,329
Yes, I do.

693
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,164
Come on, Sarah.

694
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,176
Watch it!

695
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,878
Have you seen Dr. Langworthy?

696
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,358
What do you want her for?

697
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,849
Well, the parents of
the high school kid...

698
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,017
They're here.

699
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,297
What's his name?

700
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:36,353
Steven Tierney.

701
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,865
All right, um... come on.

702
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,289
You got to learn this anyway.

703
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:46,991
Mr. and Mrs. Tierney?

704
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,426
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton.

705
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,495
At around 9:30 this morning

706
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,830
your son Steven was brought in

707
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:53,998
at full cardiac

708
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,767
and respiratory arrest.

709
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,368
We tried to revive him

710
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,903
but with no success.

711
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:00,359
I'm sorry.

712
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,462
Your son died.

713
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:07,600
No... No...

714
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,273
Can...

715
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:17,777
Can we see him?

716
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:22,365
Sure.

717
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,839
Oh, no.

718
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,318
Dear God.

719
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,191
Jack?

720
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:50,560
Jack?

721
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,728
Doctor...

722
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,648
this isn't our son.

723
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:31,484
Dr. Greene!

724
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,971
Dr. Greene!

725
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,307
Damn, it's good to see you, man.

726
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:38,642
Bob Brickley.

727
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,327
One year ago today,
you saved my life.

728
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,212
Of... course.

729
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,548
A small token of my gratitude.

730
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,717
Frozen T-bone
steaks... The real deal...

731
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,319
All the way from Texas.

732
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:53,072
From now on, August 25 will
be "Dr. Greene Day" in my book.

733
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:54,708
I'm going to honor it every year

734
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:56,476
for the rest of my life.

735
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,012
Well, uh...

736
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:01,530
I don't know what to say.

737
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,199
Thank you.

738
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,635
Hey, man, a
handshake won't do it.

739
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,372
Happy Dr. Greene Day!

740
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:16,780
I was embraced by two men today.

741
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,281
I find that highly unusual.

742
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,827
Some guys have all the luck.

743
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,318
One of them gave me
a dozen steaks as a gift.

744
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,220
How about a cookout
up on the roof?

745
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,367
That sounds nice,
but I've got a date.

746
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,523
Oh, yeah? Anyone I know?

747
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,291
Yeah, actually. Div Cvetic.

748
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,077
We've kind of been

749
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,878
together for a month or so.

750
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:33,997
Really?

751
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,984
Great. Div's a great guy.

752
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,303
What's with this patient?

753
00:35:45,327 --> 00:35:47,727
Drug addict going
through withdrawal.

754
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:51,064
He sounds like a car
alarm that you can't shut off.

755
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:09,616
Mr. and Mrs. Fisher?

756
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:11,618
I'm John Carter.

757
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:16,623
Your son David was
hit by a car this morning,

758
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:22,629
and he was brought here
by ambulance in full arrest

759
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:24,964
and, uh...

760
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:28,968
we tried to resuscitate
him for 31 minutes.

761
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:34,641
We used all of our capabilities,
but his injuries were too severe

762
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,976
and, uh... he died.

763
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,681
And I'm sorry.

764
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,591
How is she?

765
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,538
Fine. Grabbed the appendix,

766
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,206
in and out, 20 minutes.

767
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,176
Peter, listen, that was
a difficult diagnosis.

768
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,701
A lot of surgeons
would have missed it

769
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,782
because a lot of surgeons
don't take the time

770
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,717
to listen to their patients.

771
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,407
The good ones do.

772
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,218
I'm doing a Whipple procedure.

773
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,720
Care to assist?

774
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,054
A Whipple?

775
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,389
Are you kidding?

776
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,235
Patient's a 62-year-old man

777
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,571
with a history of
pancreatic cancer.

778
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,911
First presented four
weeks ago with...

779
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,547
E.R.

780
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:53,553
Dr. Ross, Dr. Taglieri wants
to see you outside Supply.

781
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:55,721
It's about that missing kid.

782
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,437
And these squiggly tubes here...

783
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,372
These are the intestines. See?

784
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:04,609
And this blob...
That's the heart.

785
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:06,265
Where's the gallbladder?

786
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,935
What do you know?
Someone took it out.

787
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,937
Must have been diseased.

788
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,950
You still got yours,
though, don't you?

789
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:14,619
It's down there somewhere.

790
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:15,942
Hey, Ozzie.

791
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,611
Where are you
taking me this time?

792
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:21,047
A social worker is
going to take you

793
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:23,032
to the Presbyterian Home.

794
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,969
I can't stay with my mom?

795
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:32,275
The truth is that your
mother is very sick.

796
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,643
It's not her fault.

797
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,439
She hasn't done anything wrong.

798
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:37,207
But, to help her get better,

799
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,283
she's being sent to
the psychiatric hospital.

800
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,538
I hate her.

801
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,541
I don't think that's true.

802
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,545
Listen, your mama
loves you very much.

803
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,730
Then why is this happening?

804
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,616
I wish I could tell you.

805
00:38:57,652 --> 00:38:59,001
Come here.

806
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:03,022
I wish I knew.

807
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:15,468
How was the Whipple?

808
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:17,303
No problem. In and out.

809
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,005
Who performed it?

810
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,706
I did.

811
00:39:27,716 --> 00:39:29,182
Walt, I'm sorry...

812
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:30,850
Our tenth anniversary...

813
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,963
I know. I got held
up in the O.R.

814
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:34,954
Don't hand me that O.R. crap!

815
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:37,623
I already know how
important your work is

816
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:40,176
compared to the
small events of my life.

817
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,111
Walter, I'm sorry.

818
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,395
We don't ask much.

819
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:44,897
Practically nothing.

820
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:46,398
Just that, once in a while,

821
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:48,534
you come over and
sit with your mother

822
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:51,337
so your sister and I can
have a few hours together.

823
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:53,823
And you act like you're
doing us a damn favor!

824
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,592
Okay. All right, Walter,
my next three nights off,

825
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,195
I'll come, I'll sit
with her, I promise.

826
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,030
It's just... I forgot, man.

827
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,565
I swear. I'm sorry.

828
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:05,784
Yeah.

829
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,257
Funny how that happens

830
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,626
when it comes to your family.

831
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:29,141
Carter.

832
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:32,612
Ah...

833
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,113
You off?

834
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:36,115
Yeah.

835
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,617
Me, too.

836
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:40,419
12 whole hours.

837
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:42,422
When you back on?

838
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,757
Tomorrow...

839
00:40:44,793 --> 00:40:46,693
if I come back.

840
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:48,728
You serious?

841
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,067
I can't remember
even why I'm doing this.

842
00:40:54,102 --> 00:40:57,103
Well, you want to
be a doctor, right?

843
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,439
Benton told my adviser

844
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:03,409
that I was doing a
generally adequate job,

845
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:06,145
and that was before today.

846
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,814
I don't...

847
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:09,415
I don't belong here.

848
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,094
What kind of drugs
is that guy on?

849
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,313
Help! Help!

850
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,482
My wife is having a baby!

851
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,867
It's coming.

852
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,918
It's coming. I can feel it.

853
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,254
That's the head.

854
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,255
What do we do?

855
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,001
You take it. I'll get help.

856
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,159
Okay, ma'am,
you'll be just fine.

857
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,493
Your baby's coming.

858
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:40,463
All you have to do
is lie back and push.

859
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,798
Okay, whenever you're ready.

860
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,133
Here it comes.

861
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,071
That's it. Just push.

862
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,072
Push.

863
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,239
Push.

864
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:51,641
That's it. Push.

865
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,542
Okay, one final
push now. Come on.

866
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:55,544
That's it.

867
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,879
You're doing great.

868
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,058
You're doing great. Just push.

869
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,160
Move the cord
back over the head.

870
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,095
Yeah, you got it. That's it.

871
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,203
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

872
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,205
Okay, one final push. Come on.

873
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,540
One final push.

874
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:08,541
Here it comes.

875
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,554
Move the cord over the head.

876
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:11,888
That's it. That's it.

877
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:13,212
Don't drop it.

878
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,549
Yes, yes.

879
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:18,116
It's a girl.

880
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,705
There you go.

881
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,073
Oh.

882
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:35,217
Everything all right?

883
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,552
Yeah.

884
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:37,887
You got her?

885
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,189
Yeah, I got her.

886
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,628
You got to undo the lock.

887
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,332
Yes!

888
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,352
Yes!

889
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,725
Hey, Doug.

890
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:51,427
Hey, John.

891
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:56,398
Uh, you know...

892
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:58,300
it's a bad idea.

893
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,855
Who is it?

894
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,940
Doug Ross.

895
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,077
What are you doing?

896
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,080
Nothing. My, uh... you
know, car broke down,

897
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:14,249
and the tow truck
was taking so long.

898
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:17,453
I thought I'd come in
here and use your phone.

899
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,074
I'm late for my date.

900
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:26,423
You know, I see the
tow truck right there...

901
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:27,779
now...

902
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:31,783
I'm really sorry.

903
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,369
Hey!

904
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,204
Hey! Hey!

905
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:54,040
Hey!

906
00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:55,407
Hey!

907
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:05,785
What were you thinking?

908
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,387
What could you<i> possibly</i>
have been thinking

909
00:45:08,422 --> 00:45:09,855
would happen tonight?

910
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:12,958
That you would come to my
doorstep at midnight, drunk,

911
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:16,078
and I would find that some
sort of grand gesture of love?

912
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:17,746
Is that what you were thinking?

913
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,148
That you can just show up

914
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,717
and I'll invite you back
in my life? In my bed?

915
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:25,053
I don't know. Is that what you
imagined would happen tonight?

916
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,756
You have no right to
even think about doing this!

917
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,109
I'm sorry.

918
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,178
Do you think that
you love me? Huh?

919
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:35,982
For how long, Doug?

920
00:45:36,017 --> 00:45:38,517
How long till you
start wondering

921
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:40,802
if there isn't someone better

922
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,872
in the next room
or the next bar?

923
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,807
How long till that
little voice in your head

924
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:47,209
starts reminding you of
all the infinite 22-year-olds

925
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,911
you could be screwing tomorrow

926
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:50,612
or the next day or the next?

927
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:54,783
I will not let you
do this to me again.

928
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,824
I'm sorry.

929
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:17,089
