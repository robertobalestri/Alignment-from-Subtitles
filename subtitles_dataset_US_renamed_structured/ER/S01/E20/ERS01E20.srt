1
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:49,256
You got patients waiting.

2
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:50,827
I know.

3
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,620
Are you going to
stand here all night?

4
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:59,295
I don't know.

5
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,502
Are you okay?

6
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:05,224
I just can't stop
thinking about them.

7
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:07,737
Maybe you should
take some time off.

8
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:08,865
I'm okay.

9
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,216
Take tonight off.

10
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,217
I'll get someone
to cover for you.

11
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:16,031
If we get in trouble, I'll
have someone page you.

12
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,700
Yeah, okay.

13
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,355
Thanks.

14
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,890
No, no, no, Bob.

15
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,393
Intakes go here.

16
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:31,064
Discharges go there.

17
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,068
<i>I</i> have my own system.

18
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,506
Well, you're screwing
everything up.

19
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,221
Okay, Diane.
Listen. I got to go.

20
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:39,125
I'll pick you up at
9:00. Okay. Bye-bye.

21
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,751
What's the problem?

22
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,923
Bob's reorganizing
the department.

23
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:45,160
Tell her to put
me in for a raise.

24
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,742
Me first. Good night, all.

25
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,713
Good night. All
right, what's my bid

26
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:50,985
for the Saturday night special?

27
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,989
A jilted boyfriend on PCP...

28
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,158
22 years old, 6'8",

29
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,062
comes strapped
to his own gurney.

30
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm going home.

31
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:59,792
Going once, going twice.

32
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:03,834
Sold to the doctor in
the pale green scrubs.

33
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:05,271
Doug, I said I'm going home.

34
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:06,640
Susan, you take it.

35
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:10,348
He still upset?

36
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:11,685
Still.

37
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:12,899
Hi.

38
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:14,023
Hey.

39
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,493
Busy night?

40
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:16,563
Refreshingly slow.

41
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,709
Are you going out?

42
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:18,900
It's Saturday night.

43
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,269
Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,742
You need a break, Peter.
Go home, get some sleep.

45
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:25,125
Yeah, but my mother gets
anxious if nobody's there.

46
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:26,482
How long can you keep this up...

47
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,499
Working here and
staying with her all night?

48
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,957
I don't know. Till
she goes home.

49
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,308
Home?

50
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:32,629
Yeah, home.

51
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,035
Why don't I sit
with her for a while?

52
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:37,451
We can finish up
here, grab some dinner,

53
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:39,111
give me a chance to get

54
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:41,850
all the gory details
about your adolescence.

55
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:44,488
All right. Yeah. Yeah,
that sounds good.

56
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:46,159
Yeah, it sounds fascinating.

57
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,963
I'd like to come along.

58
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:51,336
Carter, finish your notes, and
mind your own business, huh?

59
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,109
Carter, will you
stop him? Carter!

60
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:56,447
Whoa! You're speeding, sir.

61
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,020
Help! She's killing me!

62
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,356
Louie drank a six-pack.

63
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:01,960
He has an enlarged prostate.

64
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:04,833
Been trying to put in a
foley catheter for an hour.

65
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:06,169
Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:08,842
Oh, but I'm off now,
so, Carol, he's all yours.

67
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,178
Oh, gee, thanks.

68
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:12,193
All right, Louie. Don't worry.

69
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:14,620
I'm going to use
plenty of Lidocaine.

70
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,090
Your shift over yet?

71
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,128
Yeah, if Benton ever leaves.

72
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,835
Ever worked a full
moon Saturday night?

73
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,738
No. Is it that different?

74
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,575
Stick around and find out.

75
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:25,979
Call security!

76
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:27,782
Code white to trauma two!

77
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,904
Get me out of here!

78
00:04:05,182 --> 00:04:07,084
Watch it, watch it. Stay back.

79
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:13,213
Rita! You cheating
bitch, I'll kill you!

80
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:18,057
Full moon Saturday night.

81
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:20,463
Cool.

82
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:24,689
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

83
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,338
What are you doing?

84
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:20,821
Just checking out
your procedures.

85
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,780
Well, hey. Next time, ask.

86
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,331
You think you've done
enough to get high honors?

87
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:26,589
I don't know.

88
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:27,591
I don't count.

89
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,195
You should. I do.

90
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:30,630
Hey, Carol, Mark went home.

91
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,312
Could you call
Foster in tonight?

92
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:33,871
He broke his leg skiing.

93
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,375
Oh. Uh, what about Alonzo?

94
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:36,377
Doing ICU.

95
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:37,379
How about Ross?

96
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:38,882
Previous engagement. Oh.

97
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:39,884
Do you care?

98
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:40,886
Nope. Yes, you do.

99
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,101
No, I don't. Diane Leeds.

100
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,503
Really? The one with
the kid? Mm-hmm.

101
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,739
Susan. Yeah.

102
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:46,399
Auto versus pedestrian, ETA now.

103
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,035
Gangbanger in the suture room,

104
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:50,441
and that sore
throat is still waiting.

105
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,754
Call someone. Moonlighter?

106
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:53,792
They're always senile
or dermatologists.

107
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,296
Okay, moonlighter it is. Okay.

108
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,556
It's going to be
one of those nights.

109
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,238
Kerstetter, David,
18, intoxicated.

110
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,075
Played chicken with
a Taurus and lost.

111
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,380
He came out of nowhere.

112
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:03,997
I slammed on my
brakes, but it was too late.

113
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:05,868
Okay, don't worry.
We'll take care of him.

114
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,861
B.P.'s 140/90; tachy at 160.

115
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,369
Minimal blood loss,
considering the chest laceration.

116
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,173
Gave him 300cc's of saline.

117
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,654
Mental status at the scene?

118
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:15,979
Alert. GCS 15.

119
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:17,260
Notify his family.

120
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:18,463
Oh, nasty gash.

121
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,066
Malik, get chest
and abdominal films

122
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,202
and throw in a head CT.

123
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:22,671
Carter, what do you want to do?

124
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,525
Check for pneumothorax,
do a quick neuro exam,

125
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:25,784
rule out abdominal trauma

126
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,499
and get an EKG to screen
for cardiac contusion.

127
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:28,857
Good.

128
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:30,177
Carter?

129
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:32,799
Oh, yeah. Okay, everybody,
on my count, now...

130
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:33,869
One, two, three.

131
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,605
Nice and gently.
Nice and gently.

132
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:37,087
Good. Go ahead.

133
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:38,238
Does this hurt?

134
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:39,430
No. My chest.

135
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,545
Get a tox screen
and a blood alcohol.

136
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:42,636
Reflexes intact.

137
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:44,858
Pupils are equal and
responsive to light.

138
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:47,309
Haleh, get a
cross-table c-spine.

139
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,769
Breath sounds clear bilaterally.

140
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,450
God, it hurts!

141
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,844
Abdomen is soft,
apparently nontender.

142
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,514
Give him 60 of Toradol.

143
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,020
Don't want to mix
alcohol with morphine.

144
00:06:58,089 --> 00:06:59,223
Need any help, Dr. Lewis?

145
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,904
How are you with
sutures? Excellent.

146
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,508
Great. When we're
finished here, you can start.

147
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:03,611
Looks like he's going to live.

148
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:04,779
What are you doing here?

149
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,083
I heard you were
staying, so I'm staying.

150
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,836
Susan, that banger's
waiting. Okay.

151
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,476
Uh, Dr. Lewis, I was sort of
hoping I could follow this patient.

152
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,402
Carter, there's plenty
of wounds to go around.

153
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,372
Deb, you start there.
Carter, you start there.

154
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:15,809
Call me when you
reach the middle.

155
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,281
Okay, looks like we're
going to need two suture kits.

156
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,478
How's it going?

157
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:34,348
Okay.

158
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,990
You work around here?

159
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,593
Yeah.

160
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:42,567
What's good on the menu?

161
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:45,238
Nothing.

162
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:47,410
Bagel looks safe.

163
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,255
Excuse me.

164
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,702
Friendly place.

165
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:02,126
Oh, doctor?

166
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:03,628
Yeah?

167
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:05,331
Will he be all right?

168
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,172
Well, for a guy hit by a car,
he's in pretty good shape.

169
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,440
Can I see him? Apologize?

170
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,679
Yeah. As soon as they're
done sewing him up.

171
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:13,183
Wait right here.

172
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,389
This isn't a race, John.

173
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:18,694
Yeah, well, you
could have fooled me.

174
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:20,176
You know, if you
go a little slower,

175
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,046
your stitches wouldn't
invert so much.

176
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,822
Is he screwing up?

177
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,292
Relax.

178
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:27,814
What are the rules for
sharing procedures?

179
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:28,984
What?

180
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,333
You know, for our books.

181
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,526
Whoever's been here
the longest, I guess.

182
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,252
Hmm...

183
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,496
how about whoever
sews more takes it?

184
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,551
You're on.

185
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:51,315
Hey, Carol!

186
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:53,720
I need a gurney!

187
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,958
Mr. Travis, are you in pain?

188
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,462
My chest...

189
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,133
Okay, okay. We're
going to take care of you.

190
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,604
Get this off him.

191
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:04,978
Okay. On my count...
One, two, three.

192
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,748
Good.

193
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:10,958
What do you got?

194
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:13,997
Hank Travis, the driver
who hit the chest lac.

195
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:16,135
He collapsed with chest pain.

196
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:17,488
Looks like an MI.

197
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,558
Yeah.

198
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:23,736
What's going on?

199
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,808
Can't tell.

200
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:32,152
John, um, finish
up for me, will you?

201
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,859
He's got an early
diastolic murmur.

202
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:36,997
B.P.'s skyrocketing... 230/160.

203
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,433
Aortic rupture?

204
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:40,839
I don't think so... pressure's
too high. Do we have a crit?

205
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:42,219
Yeah. 46. Not bleeding.

206
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:44,212
Do you have high blood pressure?

207
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,234
Yes.

208
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,139
We need to lower his
pressure before he strokes out

209
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,476
or rips his aorta.

210
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:52,041
I'll call O.R.

211
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:53,332
Thanks, Malik.

212
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,669
Susan, want a beta blocker?

213
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:56,706
Yeah, bolus and
3.5 migs of Esmolol

214
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,844
and let's do a
transesophageal echo

215
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:00,748
to check out the damage, okay?

216
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:02,218
I'll get the echo.

217
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,299
Okay.

218
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:04,556
Who's in charge?

219
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,761
Dr. Lewis.

220
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:09,467
Sir, you're going to
have to wait outside.

221
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:10,938
I'm Dr. Swift.

222
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,842
Oh, moonlighter's here.

223
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,112
Spandex. Nice look.

224
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,701
Well, don't just stand there.

225
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,259
Glove up and get
your butt over here.

226
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:22,829
How's his pressure?

227
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:24,632
It's falling... 190/130.

228
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,573
I'll bet you've never seen
an transesophageal echo.

229
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:28,809
One or two.

230
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,314
Mr. Travis, this
isn't going to hurt.

231
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,129
I'm going to look at your heart

232
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:36,275
heart by putting this
instrument down your throat.

233
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,611
Two Versed?

234
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:40,133
Okay... Yeah. Let's
see what we've got here.

235
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:45,010
Look, it's going to get
real hairy here tonight

236
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,883
so pick out what you
think you can handle...

237
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:50,233
Sutures, weak-and-
dizzy-all-overs

238
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:53,262
kid with the croup...
All the easy stuff, okay?

239
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,449
I'll try and keep up.

240
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,399
There it is. Call a
thoracic surgeon.

241
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,175
This guy's in trouble.

242
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:01,412
Okay, get him up
to the O.R. now.

243
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:04,719
He's got a type-a dissection
of the ascending aorta.

244
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,073
You sure about that?

245
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:09,079
Acute chest pain, hypertension,
water hammer pulses

246
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,917
nonspecific ST changes.

247
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,765
Could be an aortic rupture.

248
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:14,224
I don't think so.

249
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:17,063
You don't think you
should consider that?

250
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,901
Who the hell are you?

251
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,417
I'm William Swift,
your new E.R. chief.

252
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,889
I'm taking over from
David Morgenstern.

253
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,849
Nice to meet you, Dr. Swift.

254
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,199
William.

255
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,890
So where are these
weak-and-dizzy-all-overs?

256
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,081
Okay. Short end takes the lice.

257
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,673
Oh, man.

258
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:44,973
It's 50-50.

259
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:47,545
Yeah, in theory,
but I never wi... win.

260
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:49,166
Cheer up, Carol.

261
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:52,272
Your bedpan days
will soon be over.

262
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:53,623
Man, not with my luck.

263
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,629
Once you marry Tag, you
can do whatever you like.

264
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,211
So, you're going to leave
us when you get rich?

265
00:11:57,235 --> 00:11:59,148
What? And leave all this beauty?

266
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:01,275
Hey!

267
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:02,489
Here you are.

268
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,881
What do you have here?

269
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,720
"12 Common Errors That
Can Ruin Your Wedding."

270
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:08,223
<i>Modern Bride?</i>

271
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,394
There's some
great articles in here.

272
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,065
Hey, did somebody page me?

273
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,569
No, not me.

274
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,072
Lookit. Check out number six.

275
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,446
"Make sure you audition the
band before you hire them."

276
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,061
So I guess your
brother's band is out?

277
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,753
They'd actually have
to know how to play.

278
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:23,300
So, what kind of
band should we get?

279
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:25,606
I thought maybe we'd do
some polka music or something.

280
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,976
Tag! Taglieri!
You're hysterical.

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,546
Yeah, what's up?
Did you get my page?

282
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,015
Yeah. So how come
you didn't tell me

283
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,519
you were kicking
my mother out, huh?

284
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,844
He's been at the computer again.

285
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:34,246
Yeah, you're damn right.

286
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:35,928
Hey, we talked about you
staying out of your mom's file.

287
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:37,131
Why are you discharging her?

288
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,534
The hospital's breathing
down my neck, okay?

289
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,204
I put them off a week.
Medicare won't pay any more.

290
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,958
Look. She needs
more time to recuperate.

291
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:44,285
I got her three more days...
It's the best I could do.

292
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:46,724
Get your family together
and talk over your options.

293
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:48,339
She's not ready to go home yet.

294
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:51,134
Face reality, Peter... she's had
a stroke and a hip replacement.

295
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:53,071
She can't go home.
She's going to require

296
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,259
skilled nursing
the rest of her life.

297
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:57,208
I will take my mother home

298
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,568
and care for her
myself if I have to.

299
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:01,472
She's not going home.

300
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,610
The hell she isn't.

301
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,956
Dr. Susan, we are
running out of rooms.

302
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,948
Ah, midnight...
The witching hour.

303
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:16,354
Let's make room for the
punks, skunks and drunks.

304
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:17,658
Man with hiccups

305
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:20,297
and 18-year-old female
weak and dizzy after sex.

306
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,935
Her first time? An
orgasm... god, I'm jealous.

307
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:24,104
Been a while?

308
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:25,508
I'll take the hiccups.

309
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:27,290
I've got a woman
with abdominal pain

310
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:29,126
and a wheezer who
needs a blood gas.

311
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,554
Carter, do a focused
H&P on the abdominal pain.

312
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:33,203
Hiccups sound more interesting.

313
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:34,994
You'll see a thousand
acute abdomens

314
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:37,834
for every case of the
hiccups... You need the practice.

315
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,338
And do a pelvic and a rectal.

316
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:40,841
Ooh...

317
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,484
Patient fumigation.

318
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:46,854
Hey, hey.

319
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:48,189
Hey!

320
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,541
Walking in space?

321
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,912
Lice.

322
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,262
Uh... sounds sexy.

323
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,080
You want to hear some bands?

324
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:55,386
Might as well.

325
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:58,045
What do you think?

326
00:13:58,113 --> 00:13:59,597
I think your brother

327
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,637
is starting to sound
better every minute.

328
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:05,277
Is that Wild Willie?

329
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,747
You know Dr. Swift?

330
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:09,753
Know him? We played
ball together at Ohio State.

331
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:10,968
Hey!

332
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:12,927
Hey, Lewis! Special delivery.

333
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:14,797
Where do I sign?

334
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,083
On the dotted line.

335
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:18,790
Four Beta Tau Sigma pledges
dumped on Rush Street.

336
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,893
Possible frostbite
to<i> all</i> extremities.

337
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:22,709
They left us in Lincoln Park

338
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,245
with just our shoes and socks.

339
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,266
What have we got here?

340
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,959
Popsicle pledges.

341
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:32,301
Uh, could we get some blankets
over here to warm these guys up?

342
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,047
Somebody... help me.

343
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,488
Ma... Ma...

344
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:43,993
it's Peter. I'm here, okay?

345
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:46,833
Why did they do that to me?

346
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,216
It's okay, Ma. It's okay.

347
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,514
I told them not to, but
they wouldn't listen.

348
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,564
I know, I know. It's okay, Ma.

349
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:59,193
I asked them to stop it,
but they wouldn't listen!

350
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:00,697
They won't do it again.

351
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,032
They never listen!

352
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,348
Okay, I know, I know.

353
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:04,653
Ma, listen to me...

354
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:06,308
I'll be right back, okay?

355
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:07,522
You okay?

356
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:08,828
All right, all right.

357
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:10,485
I love you, all right?

358
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,096
I...

359
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:19,750
I thought you were
sitting with her.

360
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,776
I went out to get
a cup of coffee.

361
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:24,158
How could you let
them do that to her?

362
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:25,550
Do what?

363
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,332
My mother doesn't
need to be restrained.

364
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:28,824
She was trying to
crawl out of bed.

365
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,706
Still, you shouldn't
have let them do it.

366
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,099
I'm the one who
asked them to do it.

367
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:39,614
Oh.

368
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,790
Don't bother to come back.

369
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:44,958
What?

370
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,629
I don't want your help.

371
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:48,700
Peter, she needs
to be restrained.

372
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:54,914
Mm-hmm... and
take a deep breath.

373
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,252
And let it out.

374
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,755
Ahh!

375
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,426
Oh... does that hurt?

376
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,096
A lot.

377
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:05,035
Uh-huh. Have you
had this pain before?

378
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:07,707
Never. It's the moon.

379
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:09,946
It's in the fifth house.

380
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:13,286
Something strange
is going on inside me.

381
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:15,157
Could you be pregnant?

382
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:17,496
Well, with this month's aspects

383
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:20,001
the unlikely is
probably definite.

384
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,838
Uh-huh.

385
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:25,346
Uh... I'm going to go ahead
and order a pregnancy test,

386
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:28,520
and then we'll just
take it from there, okay?

387
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:32,528
Um... are you by
any chance a Gemini?

388
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:34,700
Yeah.

389
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:37,105
When's your birthday?

390
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:38,775
June 4.

391
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:40,762
Um... year?

392
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,367
You know, I don't...

393
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,716
1970?

394
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,239
Yeah.

395
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,576
Time of birth?

396
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:49,247
For that, you're going to
have to ask my mother.

397
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:51,085
What's her number?

398
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,890
Timmy's tried everything...

399
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,195
Breath-holding...

400
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,518
Drinking ice water...

401
00:16:58,587 --> 00:16:59,731
Tickling,

402
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:01,335
breathing into a bag,

403
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,504
scary movies...

404
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,397
I haven't slept in two nights.

405
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:05,778
We're getting married

406
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:06,735
in two weeks.

407
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:08,117
Will he be all right?

408
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:11,261
Probably just a case of
the pre-wedding jitters.

409
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,786
Is there anything
you can give me?

410
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:17,224
Thorazine sometimes
works, Mr. Falco.

411
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,597
We'll try that, and we'll
run some blood tests

412
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:23,004
and take an abdominal X ray
just to cover all the bases, okay.

413
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:31,255
You know, I just can't decide
between Hawaii or Paris.

414
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:33,961
I kind of had my
heart set on the beach.

415
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:36,082
You burn so easily though.

416
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,170
No, I don't. I tan.

417
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,689
Hawaii it is.

418
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,527
But Paris sounds so romantic.

419
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:44,834
Have you had a chance to
check out those china patterns yet?

420
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:46,370
When was I supposed to do that?

421
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,641
People are starting to ask.

422
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,561
Really?

423
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,581
Got a call from the Tiki
Torch down the street.

424
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,720
They got a guy on a Porta-potty

425
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,089
with our name on it.

426
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,440
That would be Louie.

427
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,742
Could you get a cab
to pick him up, please?

428
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,078
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

429
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:01,637
Where were we?

430
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:07,383
How are we doing?

431
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:10,289
Swift's looking for Mark.

432
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,396
Where's Dr. Greene?

433
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:15,278
Board says he's on tonight.

434
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,806
He went home with
a touch of the flu.

435
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,413
Thank you.

436
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:22,593
You're welcome.

437
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:24,654
Your unsolved mystery is solved.

438
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:26,892
Congratulations.
You're pregnant.

439
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,973
Oh!

440
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:29,932
That's according to the Pisces

441
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,270
astrological forecast
in the<i> Tribune.</i>

442
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:33,941
Oh, and these lab results.

443
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,488
Thank you, Dr. Gemini.

444
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:38,283
I had a feeling you'd
bring me good news,

445
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:41,323
but are you sure there's
not something else?

446
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:42,559
What do you mean?

447
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:44,681
Well, I...

448
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:47,414
I constructed your chart,

449
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:50,009
and I'm certain
we haven't finished

450
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:51,359
our journey together.

451
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:53,361
Saturn is aligned with Mercury.

452
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:54,852
Is that bad?

453
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:57,325
It could be.

454
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:58,560
For who?

455
00:18:58,629 --> 00:18:59,911
Both of us.

456
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:05,141
You're conflicted,

457
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,382
searching to find your way.

458
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,238
Go with the voice inside you.

459
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:14,043
Fight the influence of others

460
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,115
who seek to destroy you.

461
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:21,560
I'll, uh... order
that ultrasound.

462
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,453
Welcome back, Louie.

463
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:35,523
Did you miss us?

464
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:39,866
Have you been
drinking, Louie, hmm?

465
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:42,272
You still have your catheter in?

466
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:45,545
Louie...

467
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:48,217
Six pints, Louie.

468
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,623
It's time to change your bag.

469
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:53,963
Okay.

470
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:58,407
Stay right there, Louie.

471
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:00,411
Hey, how are you holding up?

472
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,451
Not bad. It's kind of nice
not having the boys around.

473
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,455
Oh! Oh, my god!

474
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:07,570
Cherry bomb in the trash can.

475
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:11,011
Pledges. Pledges.

476
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,470
Hey, Carter.

477
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:14,474
Are you glad you stayed?

478
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:15,810
Whew!

479
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,649
There's a call on the radio.

480
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,155
Read you, Dispatch.

481
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:23,059
Implement disaster protocol.

482
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,464
EMS Plan One at
Wabash and Balboa

483
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,202
for nightclub fire.

484
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:29,039
How many? Over.

485
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,380
15 to 20, most with
third-degree burns.

486
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,385
I'll set up a triage point.

487
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,856
All right, I'll put
out call-backs.

488
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:43,137
What is it?

489
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,648
I'm getting beeped.

490
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:55,931
2:00 in the morning?

491
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,202
Welcome to my life.

492
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,131
Just better not be
another woman.

493
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:10,513
Oh, quit making so much noise.

494
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:13,519
I'm never going
to get back to sleep

495
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:15,239
if I really wake up.

496
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,309
Hey.

497
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:20,400
Mmm...

498
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:22,071
So, can I come back?

499
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:25,078
There's a spare key
on the kitchen table,

500
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:28,250
but you have to be back
out before Jake wakes up,

501
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,654
that's all.

502
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,707
Damn.

503
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:48,674
29 minutes, 32 seconds.

504
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,312
I beat you.

505
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,814
You what?

506
00:22:51,883 --> 00:22:53,635
What's going on?
Where's the victims?

507
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:55,606
You're looking at them.

508
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,493
Everyone, I'd like
to introduce Dr...

509
00:22:57,562 --> 00:22:59,943
William Swift, your new chief.

510
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,569
It's good to see y'all.

511
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:03,907
Which one of you
is Chief Resident?

512
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,396
We haven't been able
to locate Dr. Greene yet.

513
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:10,021
Okay.

514
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:14,062
I find these drills ideal
for meeting my team

515
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,536
and assessing how quickly
the residents can mobilize.

516
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,841
Now, seeing that
I have you here,

517
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,013
I'd like to take a few moments

518
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:25,019
and go over some of the
basics of E.R. management.

519
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:26,556
At 2:30 A.M.?

520
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,627
Don't worry. I'll have
you home by 4:00.

521
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:31,767
John, could you please
help me with a patient?

522
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:34,941
Why, is it a procedure
you've already done?

523
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,213
No. It's a guy
who's really drunk

524
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:39,784
smashed his finger in a car door

525
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,756
and he's pawing at me.

526
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:43,594
He also smells terrible.

527
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,842
And you have a
problem with that?

528
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:48,938
I can hardly wait
to get out of the E.R.

529
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:53,058
Mr. Denardo, this is John Carter

530
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:54,363
and we're here

531
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:56,654
to take care of that finger.

532
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,287
I want a real doctor,
not a couple of kids.

533
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,705
Great. then we're going to go,

534
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,843
and we're going to let
your finger get infected,

535
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:04,110
swell up and fall
off, if you prefer.

536
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,329
Thanks. Uh, you numb the finger

537
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:11,503
and I'll drain the nail
bed with a cautery.

538
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,643
This is going to
feel a little cool.

539
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,938
Wait, wait, wait!

540
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,330
Didn't anybody ever tell you
ethyl chloride is flammable?

541
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:26,018
Damn!

542
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:28,724
I'm really sorry.

543
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:31,864
Please don't tell anyone, okay?

544
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,880
A patient presents to the E.R...

545
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:36,742
Ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis.

546
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,811
Dr. Ross

547
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,015
what does that bring to mind?

548
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,485
The osis sisters.

549
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:43,055
I dated the short one.

550
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:45,004
Um, I believe you're describing

551
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:46,746
Horner's syndrome.

552
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:48,096
Correct.

553
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,515
Otherwise, a drooping eye.

554
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,205
What should you worry about?

555
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:54,579
Hmm?

556
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:58,288
Pancoast tumor

557
00:24:58,357 --> 00:25:00,343
of the superior
sulcus of the lung.

558
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,697
Correct. And you are...?

559
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,919
Bob. I started in housekeeping

560
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:07,157
and now I'm a desk clerk.

561
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:08,459
Yeah.

562
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:10,297
Dr. Greene for you on two.

563
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:11,667
Okay.

564
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:13,783
However, many of you
have a fondness for using

565
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:16,777
antibiotics prophylactically
when dealing with animal wounds.

566
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:17,847
Where are you?

567
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:18,982
An arcade.

568
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,853
I didn't feel like going home.

569
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,323
What's up?

570
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:25,563
New chief pulled a drill.

571
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:26,666
Okay.

572
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:35,050
One hour, 47
minutes... A new record.

573
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,520
Where are they?

574
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:38,024
Trauma One.

575
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:41,331
Any questions, my
door is always open.

576
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,509
Dr. Bagel, come right in.

577
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,090
Man, you're in trouble.

578
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:49,894
Wild Willie's on a tear.

579
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:51,063
Wild Willie?

580
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:52,500
Hi. Uh, Mark Greene.

581
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:53,790
Yeah, I've heard.

582
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,828
William Swift, your new chief.

583
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:57,398
How's the flu?

584
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,613
The what?

585
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:00,517
I guess you're
feeling better, huh?

586
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,493
Look. Go home,

587
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,915
read that before
your next shift,

588
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:06,519
then we'll talk.

589
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,701
The flu?

590
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:09,959
Sorry.

591
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,471
Guess I should have stayed, huh?

592
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,458
Ma.

593
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:29,150
Ma?

594
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,501
I'm here. I'm here.

595
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,603
Are you in any pain, Ma?

596
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:33,728
No.

597
00:26:33,796 --> 00:26:36,049
Okay. Okay, I got you, okay?

598
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:37,953
I got you. Damn!

599
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:39,322
How'd it go?

600
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,854
I think I blew it
with the new chief.

601
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:43,548
Let's just say you didn't
make a strong first impression.

602
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:45,052
You have to stay?

603
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,588
No. He sent me home.

604
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:48,737
Good. Let's get out of here
before he changes his mind.

605
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:52,869
Move the transducer down
to visualize the adnexa.

606
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:54,906
Is that the ovary?

607
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:56,510
It sure is.

608
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,046
And that's the ectopic.

609
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:01,521
You have both an
intrauterine pregnancy

610
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,391
and an ectopic pregnancy.

611
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,128
Twins.

612
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:06,699
That makes sense.

613
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,135
He's a Gemini.

614
00:27:09,673 --> 00:27:10,824
Will they be all right?

615
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:13,563
You can carry the
one in your uterus

616
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,536
but we need to operate
and remove the other

617
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:17,973
before it ruptures.

618
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:20,044
If that happens, you could die.

619
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:21,358
I'm sorry, Arlena.

620
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:22,717
Don't be.

621
00:27:22,786 --> 00:27:27,026
I'm having a baby, and
I'm going to be just fine.

622
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,596
Mm-hmm.

623
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:31,285
I scraped it climbing a cliff.

624
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:34,458
And why were you
doing that, Mr. Talbot?

625
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,995
Chasing cats.

626
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:37,599
Cats?

627
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,636
I'm a werewolf.

628
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:42,108
Oh, full moon, right?

629
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:44,739
Please put me in restraints

630
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:46,368
until sunrise.

631
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:48,906
It's only a couple of hours.

632
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:54,151
You think you might harm
yourself or somebody else?

633
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,792
There's no telling
what I might do next.

634
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,200
Okay. Well, I will go
and get you a doctor.

635
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:08,599
<i>Never</i> turn your
back on a werewolf!

636
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,522
I forgot. Sorry.

637
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,456
Oh!

638
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:22,762
Carter, I am so sorry.

639
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:23,977
Any good patients?

640
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:25,447
Nope. Just a couple of drunks.

641
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:26,716
Why don't you take a nap?

642
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,686
I'll beep you if
anything good comes in.

643
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,778
I'll be in Four.

644
00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:32,951
What was that?

645
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,188
Werewolf.

646
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:35,357
Huh?

647
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:37,948
Maybe you should lock your door.

648
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,568
Oh, you cured his hiccups.

649
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:49,772
They're gone.

650
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,409
I feel much better.

651
00:28:51,477 --> 00:28:52,990
I have some test results.

652
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,315
I should probably

653
00:28:54,383 --> 00:28:56,129
go over them with you alone.

654
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:57,422
No. No, go ahead.

655
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,161
We... we don't have any secrets.

656
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,885
You have some serious findings
in your CTs and ultrasound.

657
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:05,354
How serious?

658
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:09,046
These are abscesses...
Pockets of bacteria

659
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,361
invading your liver.

660
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:12,900
It's inflaming your
diaphragm, which is

661
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:14,235
what caused your hiccups.

662
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,097
We're going to have to
admit you, run some tests,

663
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,803
treat you aggressively
with IV antibiotics.

664
00:29:19,872 --> 00:29:21,574
I see.

665
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:24,362
Well, that'll cure him, right?

666
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,866
I hope so.

667
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,872
I need to ask you
some difficult questions.

668
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,177
Okay.

669
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:32,764
In cases like these,

670
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,854
in which an apparently healthy
young individual like yourself

671
00:29:35,922 --> 00:29:38,560
has such an unusual
illness, we need to consider

672
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:40,096
the causes.

673
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:42,719
Have you ever used IV drugs?

674
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:44,155
Never.

675
00:29:44,224 --> 00:29:46,811
Have you had high-risk
sexual contact...

676
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:49,300
Unprotected sex
with men, prostitutes?

677
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:53,809
What, are you
suggesting I have AIDS?

678
00:29:53,878 --> 00:29:55,981
It's an unusual condition,

679
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,987
and is sometimes seen
in patients with HIV.

680
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:01,559
It's probably just a
bacterial infection,

681
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:04,265
but I needed to
consider the risk factors.

682
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,544
I can't believe
you're telling me this.

683
00:30:09,612 --> 00:30:11,376
You didn't answer
my other question

684
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,851
about other sexual contacts.

685
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:18,513
No. Never.

686
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:25,161
So what do you think
about Wild Willie?

687
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,663
I don't know.

688
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:30,439
Probably going to make us
do pushups before every shift.

689
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:31,608
Yeah.

690
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,027
You think he'll take

691
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:34,781
Morgenstern's recommendation

692
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,319
and make you attending?

693
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:37,637
Yeah.

694
00:30:37,707 --> 00:30:39,909
You know, I hear that
he's promoting Carter

695
00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:41,613
to chief of surgery.

696
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:44,754
Uh-huh.

697
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:47,942
You getting any sleep at all?

698
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:49,346
Mark.

699
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,817
What?

700
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:53,099
Nothing. Just, you didn't
hear anything I was saying.

701
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:54,891
Sorry.

702
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,979
You got to let this OB case go.

703
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:59,452
Could have happened
to any one of us.

704
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:01,968
If you killed a patient,
you wouldn't be upset?

705
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:03,159
You didn't kill her.

706
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,432
Mark, you did everything
you could to save her.

707
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,103
Tell that to her husband.

708
00:31:08,172 --> 00:31:12,078
A year from now that little
boy will be taking his first step

709
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:14,083
and his mother won't be there.

710
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,254
His mother will never be there.

711
00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:18,560
It's not your fault, Mark.

712
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,067
That's my stop.

713
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:29,349
Listen, Mark, why don't
you come over to my place?

714
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:30,686
We can talk.

715
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,322
What for?

716
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,728
See you tomorrow, Doug.

717
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:08,678
All right, let's move him.

718
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:11,006
Okay. On my count.

719
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:13,077
Ready. One, two, three.

720
00:32:13,146 --> 00:32:14,581
What happened?

721
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:16,196
Drunk.

722
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,205
Took a 12-gauge
to the lower chest.

723
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:20,844
Accidentally broke into
the neighbor's house.

724
00:32:20,912 --> 00:32:22,348
Laryngoscope.

725
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,851
7½ ET tube?

726
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,733
Yeah, perfect. Call
Carter and Deb.

727
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:27,503
We could use some
help down here.

728
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:29,496
Deb's doing lacs,
and Carter's asleep.

729
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:30,431
Okay, get Carter.

730
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:31,901
Call Respiratory for a vent

731
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,883
and call Radiology
for a chest film.

732
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:35,175
Hang some O-neg.

733
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,397
Cross and type as
many as you can.

734
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:39,301
Looks like a flail chest.

735
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,438
He's got four or
five broken ribs.

736
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:44,127
After a blast like that,
he's lucky to have a chest.

737
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,130
He's bradycardic.

738
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,232
Pressure?

739
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:47,446
40 palp.

740
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,072
Okay, I'll start a central line.

741
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,811
He's bleeding out.
Tank him up with O-neg.

742
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:53,147
Hey.

743
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:55,135
Good morning, Carter.

744
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:57,268
Morning, Carter.

745
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:59,762
He's in arrest. Give
him an amp of epi.

746
00:32:59,831 --> 00:33:02,267
Carter, ever done
external compressions?

747
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:03,617
Uh, yeah.

748
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:04,923
Okay, Carol, get him started.

749
00:33:04,992 --> 00:33:06,370
A little lower. There you go.

750
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:08,041
Watch the right
side of his chest.

751
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,432
It's about to fall off.

752
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,720
Susan, baby with hypothermia.

753
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,393
Cops found it in a trash bag.

754
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:15,913
Okay.

755
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:18,025
Line's in. Keep the
compressions going.

756
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:20,424
Give him four units,
and someone call Swift.

757
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:21,959
Get another body down here now.

758
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:23,196
Okay. I'll call Tag.

759
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:24,982
It's darkest before dawn.

760
00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:25,984
Yup.

761
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:27,921
More epi.

762
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,662
Three-to-four-week-old male.

763
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,399
B.P. 60 palp. Rate, 80.

764
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,448
No arrhythmias. Temp 89 degrees.

765
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,808
Okay, give him
heated humidified O2.

766
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:38,377
Get a dextrose stick.

767
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:39,848
Let's start an IV.

768
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,654
Heated saline to 110 degrees.

769
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:46,429
What kind of parent
would do this to a baby?

770
00:33:46,498 --> 00:33:47,933
How's he doing?

771
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:49,803
We're rewarming him.

772
00:33:49,872 --> 00:33:51,153
Pleural lavage?

773
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:53,477
No, we need a neonatal warmer.

774
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,309
Check his lytes for acidosis.

775
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,302
I got a date with a
thoracotomy next door.

776
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:58,422
Go.

777
00:33:58,491 --> 00:33:59,557
How are we doing?

778
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:00,627
Not so good.

779
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:02,509
No pulse. A
pellet hit an artery.

780
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:03,644
Compressions aren't working.

781
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:04,996
We're losing him.
Thoracotomy tray.

782
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,500
Hey, hey!

783
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:08,510
Heard you needed some help.

784
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,514
Bone crusher? We're
doing a thoracotomy.

785
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:13,064
Cut between the ribs.
I'll clamp the aorta.

786
00:34:13,088 --> 00:34:14,535
I'm a little rusty on
my thoracotomies.

787
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,704
Don't worry, we'll
walk you through it.

788
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:17,608
I'll support the right chest.

789
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:20,001
Carry the incision
through the intercostals.

790
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,752
Okay, let me get in here.

791
00:34:22,776 --> 00:34:25,496
Vascular clamp.

792
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,317
Rib spreaders.

793
00:34:31,261 --> 00:34:32,696
Easy does it.

794
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:35,635
All right. Where is

795
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:37,450
that little gusher?

796
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:38,670
Got it. It's clamped.

797
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:39,644
Heart's beating.

798
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:40,994
That's teamwork.

799
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,466
It's fibrillating.

800
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,804
Carter, ever felt a live heart?

801
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:49,109
Make like a crocodile.

802
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,735
Okay, now...

803
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:54,576
gently compress the
heart between your fingers

804
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:56,959
about 80 times a minute.

805
00:34:56,983 --> 00:34:59,220
It feels like a bag of worms.

806
00:34:59,288 --> 00:35:02,076
Give him a couple
more units of blood.

807
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:03,445
It's filling.

808
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:05,450
No pulse.

809
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,970
Second unit's in.

810
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,084
He's still fibrillating.

811
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,721
We need to shock
him back into sinus.

812
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:11,078
Internal paddles.

813
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:12,865
Start with five.

814
00:35:12,934 --> 00:35:13,751
Charging.

815
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:14,754
Five, clear.

816
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,103
Clear.

817
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,342
Five more.

818
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:19,398
Charging.

819
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:21,300
Clear!

820
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,252
Clear.

821
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:23,740
We've got a rhythm.

822
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:25,710
Let's keep it.

823
00:35:26,647 --> 00:35:28,650
I've got a pulse.

824
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,969
He's stable.

825
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:31,306
Good work.

826
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,210
Okay, take him up to the O.R.

827
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,514
How's he doing?

828
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:48,709
Temperature's 92.

829
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:51,482
I think he's going to make it.

830
00:35:53,288 --> 00:35:55,741
How's your guy?

831
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,411
Still ticking.

832
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,266
Hey...

833
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:00,852
You look exhausted.

834
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:03,358
Why don't you take a breather?

835
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,532
I'll call Family Services.

836
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,769
He'll need a foster placement.

837
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,427
Hey, Deb, how's it going?

838
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:38,401
Fine, thanks.

839
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,608
Wow, did you shave
that scalp all by yourself?

840
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:43,111
Uh-huh.

841
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:44,982
What have you been up to?

842
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,164
Oh, internal cardiac massage.

843
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:48,523
See you later.

844
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,764
I don't think I like this.

845
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,267
What?

846
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:12,340
You coming and going
in the middle of the night.

847
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:13,655
Did you miss me?

848
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,114
You woke me up.

849
00:37:15,182 --> 00:37:17,618
Aww...

850
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:19,589
All right, you got 15 minutes.

851
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,093
Jake's an early riser.

852
00:37:21,162 --> 00:37:22,462
15 minutes?

853
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,344
That's not really
my style, but...

854
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,469
You can do it.

855
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,544
Come here.

856
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,085
Mark.

857
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:51,425
Hey.

858
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,913
Lovely place to sit around

859
00:37:55,937 --> 00:37:58,085
feeling sorry for yourself.

860
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,879
It has its charms.

861
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:03,083
It's freezing out here.

862
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:05,940
How'd you find me?

863
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:07,443
Doug.

864
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:11,184
He said he'd never
seen you so upset.

865
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,966
Things just, uh, aren't
working out the way I planned.

866
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:19,703
Sure they have.

867
00:38:22,878 --> 00:38:24,981
You leaving me...

868
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,152
I didn't plan for that.

869
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,326
People die, Mark.

870
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,197
You do the best you can.

871
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,547
You're human.

872
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,005
I'm not supposed to be.

873
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:38,343
Sure you are.

874
00:38:38,412 --> 00:38:40,935
You're the only one
who doesn't know it.

875
00:38:48,517 --> 00:38:50,452
What am I going to do?

876
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:55,046
You could get breakfast.

877
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:56,716
I'll even buy.

878
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:58,787
Come on.

879
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,283
Come on, Mark.

880
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,712
Susan...<i> Susan.</i>

881
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:28,385
Hmm?

882
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:30,890
Susan, Mr. Falco's
fiancee is out here.

883
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,393
She needs to see you.

884
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:33,897
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

885
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:35,466
Bring her in.

886
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:41,914
Dr. Lewis.

887
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:43,417
Sorry to bother you.

888
00:39:43,485 --> 00:39:44,987
No, no problem.

889
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:51,267
Is there a chance
that I might be sick?

890
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:54,775
I don't know.

891
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:58,149
To be safe, you
should be tested for HIV.

892
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:02,641
We're getting
married in two weeks.

893
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:04,446
I thought I knew him.

894
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:06,250
I didn't say he had AIDS.

895
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,819
I know...

896
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:13,582
but I think he hasn't
been honest with me.

897
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:16,689
I'm sorry.

898
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:18,360
Who'd have thought

899
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:21,851
a case of hiccups
would turn out like this?

900
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,187
Can I help you?

901
00:40:39,256 --> 00:40:41,676
Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm
Dr. Peter Benton.

902
00:40:41,762 --> 00:40:44,599
Your wife, she's been
taking care of my mother.

903
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:46,069
Oh, yeah, sure.

904
00:40:46,138 --> 00:40:47,304
Al Boulet.

905
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:49,020
Is everything all right?

906
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:50,128
Yeah, yeah.

907
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,478
Jeanie!

908
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:54,103
Peter Benton's here.

909
00:40:58,297 --> 00:41:01,118
What's wrong?

910
00:41:01,188 --> 00:41:03,423
I, um... I left
the restraints off

911
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:05,377
and she fell out of bed.

912
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:06,880
Is she okay?

913
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:09,820
Yeah, yeah. She's
got a couple of bruises

914
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:12,393
but, um, her hip's okay, so...

915
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:14,564
I got to get to work.

916
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:15,716
All right.

917
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:17,053
See you.

918
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:18,266
Okay.

919
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,625
Nice meeting you.

920
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:24,603
I, uh...

921
00:41:24,672 --> 00:41:27,091
I can't do this by myself.

922
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,732
Uh... I mean...

923
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:33,972
take care of my mother.

924
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,679
I've seen a lot of children try.

925
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:40,954
And uh...

926
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:44,662
it's just that I'm
afraid of what's going

927
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:46,967
to happen to her.

928
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:50,626
Yeah, um...

929
00:41:50,694 --> 00:41:52,530
can you, uh...

930
00:41:58,044 --> 00:42:03,486
can you help me
to... you know...

931
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:05,859
find a couple of names
of some good places?

932
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,848
Sure.

933
00:42:14,796 --> 00:42:17,567
I didn't think we
were going to make it.

934
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,072
You were great with
that thoracotomy.

935
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,243
You weren't so bad yourself.

936
00:42:22,312 --> 00:42:25,083
Hey, every full moon
should be ladies' night.

937
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,753
Yeah, we were terrific.

938
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:29,760
Like Thelma and Louise, man.

939
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:31,664
More like Lucy and Ethel.

940
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:36,775
Whose are those?

941
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:38,445
Tag brought them for me

942
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,084
so I could make some
headway on our wedding.

943
00:42:41,153 --> 00:42:42,955
Bridesmaids still wear peach?

944
00:42:43,024 --> 00:42:45,271
Hey, don't say anything
you might regret.

945
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:47,009
You may have to wear that.

946
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:48,968
Me? A bridesmaid?

947
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:50,672
Yeah. Would you?

948
00:42:50,741 --> 00:42:52,676
Yes, I would be honored.

949
00:42:52,745 --> 00:42:55,650
You may change your
mind when you see the dress.

950
00:42:55,718 --> 00:42:56,999
See you later.

951
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,172
Hello?

952
00:43:09,347 --> 00:43:10,782
Hello?

953
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,287
Sink's clogged and
somebody stripped

954
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:15,625
the damn threads.

955
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,296
You need some help?

956
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:19,333
I called maintenance
four hours ago.

957
00:43:19,402 --> 00:43:21,772
I figured it'd be
quicker if I do it myself.

958
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:23,854
Maybe you need a plumber's snake

959
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:25,479
like angioplasty.

960
00:43:25,548 --> 00:43:27,863
Thread it in, break up the clog.

961
00:43:27,887 --> 00:43:29,488
You know, you're right.

962
00:43:29,557 --> 00:43:31,226
Don't mention it.

963
00:43:32,898 --> 00:43:35,501
You thought of applying
for chief resident?

964
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,217
I'm only second year.

965
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:39,343
Really. That's all?

966
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:46,359
Huh...

967
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:47,845
What?

968
00:43:47,913 --> 00:43:49,811
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

969
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,204
Well, I can see we're
going to have to make

970
00:43:52,273 --> 00:43:54,076
some changes
around here. Really?

971
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:56,547
There's a few kinks in
the chain of command.

972
00:43:56,616 --> 00:43:58,051
Oh.

973
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:00,433
Don't worry...
You did a good job.

974
00:44:00,457 --> 00:44:01,893
Thank you.

975
00:44:01,961 --> 00:44:04,665
Right now, I need
a plumber's snake.

976
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:07,004
Ask Bob.

977
00:44:07,073 --> 00:44:08,674
Bob...

978
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,348
Hey...

979
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,852
Hi, Dr. Lewis.

980
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:15,254
Good morning, Jerry.

981
00:44:15,323 --> 00:44:16,591
Busy night?

982
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:18,139
Kind of crazy. Mm-hmm.

983
00:44:18,163 --> 00:44:20,077
Not for me. I had a blast.

984
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:22,544
Ah, we'll have to do
a Friday the 13th then.

985
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:25,026
Ooh, those are really spooky.

986
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:28,767
They called twice. From
1962, let's "Twist and Shout"

987
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,938
for Susan.

988
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:32,793
