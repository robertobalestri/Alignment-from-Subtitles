1
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,374
Help me.

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,859
Help me.

3
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:12,944
Please, please.

4
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,748
Oh, God, oh, God, it hurts.

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,083
B.P.'S 70/50.

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,418
Pulse down to 45.

7
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,097
Help me. Help me.
Pupils are sluggish.

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,088
Ophthalmoscope?

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:23,955
She's out.

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,268
Respiratory arrest.

11
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,824
Give me E.T. Tube, 7.0.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,860
I'll take that.

13
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:30,429
Mrs. Horne?

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,158
Kathleen, can you hear me?

15
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:36,368
All right, let's give her
500cc normal saline.

16
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,202
Here we go.

17
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,182
It's in. Let's bag her.

18
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,433
Hyperventilate.

19
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,602
Let's blow off the CO2.

20
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,726
All right, Doug, let
me give you a hand.

21
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,122
36-year-old female
fell off a ladder.

22
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,723
B.P., 70/50. Pulse is 45.

23
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,059
Possible bleeding in the brain.

24
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,785
G.C.S., 6. Hematomas
of the left lower quadrant.

25
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,699
Got lacerations of the upper-right
quadrant and her left thigh,

26
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,734
contusions on her back.

27
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,536
She fell off the ladder
and got this banged up?

28
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,976
What'd she do, bounce?

29
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,244
I see papilledema.

30
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,546
All right, she's in
trouble. Decorticate.

31
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:05,930
Get a head C.T.

32
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,082
Let's lavage first.
Her abdomen's rigid.

33
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:09,267
Terry, call the O.R.

34
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,702
Get a neurosurgeon
down here now.

35
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,470
Can I have a
peritoneal lavage kit?

36
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,971
Betadine in the cut, please.

37
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,007
I'm not getting any
sound down here.

38
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,579
Hey.

39
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,814
Hey, guys, come over here.

40
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,115
Come on.

41
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,185
My mom's going
to be okay, right?

42
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,464
We hope so.

43
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,132
Is your dad coming?

44
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,123
Yeah. I tried to call him.

45
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,070
What happened to your hand?

46
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,629
I hurt it when my
mom fell off the ladder.

47
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,565
Well, we've got to
get you cleaned up.

48
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,933
Come on.

49
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,275
Belly's full of blood. Spleen.

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,527
See who's on for Neuro.

51
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,758
You look awful, Carter.

52
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,981
I'm exhausted.

53
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,561
Good morning, Carter.

54
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:58,717
Morning.

55
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,163
You shooting for high honors

56
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,497
on your E.R. presentation?

57
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,121
I was up all night.
It's really hard

58
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,090
putting surgical
procedures down on paper.

59
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,659
Can I have Dr. Benton's
charts, please?

60
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,928
His patients have
already been checked.

61
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,763
Deb. Been here an hour.

62
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,232
All right, well, I'll
go get their labs.

63
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,567
Deb sent them.

64
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,069
Breakfast orders?

65
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,837
Gone to the kitchen.

66
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,084
Oh, John, boy, am I you're here.

67
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,641
Jerry, thank you.

68
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,876
I've done a census
of all six-month-olds

69
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,444
with fever in the past year.

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,847
I want to develop a
protocol. Can you help?

71
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,349
You checked
Dr. Benton's patients.

72
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,018
Now don't be upset.

73
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,653
You've been here awhile.

74
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,021
Everybody likes you.

75
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,388
I want to make a
good impression.

76
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,769
Carter, the girl in Two,
could you stitch her up for me?

77
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,093
Sure.

78
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,128
Um...

79
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,114
<i>Let's go.</i>

80
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,500
This isn't a Sunday
stroll, people. Come on.

81
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,107
Mrs. Horne's chart.

82
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,289
She's been here three
times in the last six months.

83
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,914
Mm-hmm. She broke her
arm falling down the stairs

84
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,383
but no bruises.

85
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,730
Orbital fracture
walking into a door.

86
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:07,852
Okay.

87
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,988
Hi, Mandy. I'm Dr. Ross.

88
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,357
Dr. Carter, would you
let me finish up here?

89
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:15,077
I'm just about to bandage it up.

90
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,444
Let me do this.

91
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,913
Yeah, okay.

92
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,447
Okay. Thank you.

93
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,116
Sure.

94
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,717
Hi.

95
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,865
Is my mom going to be okay?

96
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:27,122
Well, we don't know yet.

97
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,294
Hey. What's your name, buddy?

98
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,428
David.

99
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,491
Listen, David,

100
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,714
come over here for a second.

101
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,851
Okay, you guys, look.

102
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,286
Your mom got hurt
pretty bad today

103
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,306
and it could be a while

104
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:46,007
before she comes home.

105
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,526
How long?

106
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,460
Well, we don't know yet.

107
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,530
Want to tell me who's
been hitting your mom

108
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,432
for the last six months?

109
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,669
Mandy?

110
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,373
Mom can't take a whole
lot more of this. David?

111
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,443
Is there somebody else
staying at the house?

112
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,845
See, if we know,

113
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,164
we can get your mom some help.

114
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,451
We can find a safe
place for you to stay.

115
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,387
Things will get
better for all of you.

116
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,705
I promise that.

117
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,477
No?

118
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:25,880
All right.

119
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:28,016
Okay, well, I'll be back

120
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,385
when I know more about your mom.

121
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,934
It was Mandy.

122
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,458
Shut up, David.

123
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:38,142
It was Mandy.

124
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:38,894
Shut up!

125
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:39,895
Hey, hey...

126
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,862
'Cause you didn't
like her dress!

127
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,213
Shut up or I'll kill you!

128
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,144
You really did it
this time! It's not true!

129
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:45,261
I didn't. He's lying.

130
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,918
She hit her with my bat.

131
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,253
She hits her all the time.

132
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,122
I didn't! She fell off
the lad... She fell down!

133
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,299
When can my mom go home?

134
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,841
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

135
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,846
Pregnant patient in Two.

136
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,313
Suicide attempt's coming in.

137
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:55,303
Okay, thanks.

138
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:56,872
Rachel, Rachel Greene.

139
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:58,673
Oh, really? That's great.

140
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,309
Could you tell her
that her dad called

141
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,179
and that he'll talk
to her later? Thanks.

142
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:06,982
Rachel's on a field
trip to an aquarium.

143
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:09,017
I wish I was on a field trip.

144
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,518
Gunshot, hunting accident.

145
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:12,132
He's waiting for discharge.

146
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:13,521
So discharge him.

147
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,534
Oh, we decided
I'm not incompetent?

148
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:17,125
Nobody said you
were incompetent.

149
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,171
But I am the only one

150
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,140
who has to bring
my charts to the chief.

151
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:22,463
What time is your review
board with Kayson today?

152
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,510
3:00. Please don't
come to offer support.

153
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:27,485
God knows what you'd say.

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,440
Does that happen?
She's just a kid.

155
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,640
She hit her mother
with a baseball bat?

156
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,452
Well, we see three or
four of them a month.

157
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,976
Doug, broken leg, Exam Four.

158
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,310
A nice diversion.

159
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:37,757
Well, I-I-I just
can't believe it.

160
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,748
Well, you will get used to it.

161
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:42,161
Uh, well... Send Mrs.
Neely up to the O.R.

162
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:45,020
Oh, Dr. Benton, she wants her
surgery explained to her again.

163
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,433
Well, I've explained it
twice. That's enough.

164
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,556
Well, I could try.

165
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,158
Yeah, I'm taking a course

166
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,271
on relating to
patients as people.

167
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,273
It's called "The Whole Patient."

168
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:56,898
Just don't let it
interfere with your work.

169
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,800
He didn't mean that...

170
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,118
did he?

171
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,653
I didn't throw him that hard.

172
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,421
I just showed him
a takedown move.

173
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,923
I must have done the
same move a hundred times.

174
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,392
This hurt, Zack?

175
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,628
Yeah, it hurts a little.

176
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,795
I bet it hurts a lot.

177
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,597
I broke my arm when
I was nine years old.

178
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,599
Haleh, two migs
of morphine, I.V.

179
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,767
Does this hurt?

180
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,768
No.

181
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,414
13 years of teaching Phys. Ed.,

182
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,416
this never happened to me.

183
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,408
Mr. Allman, it's a
broken leg. Relax.

184
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,077
Posterior tibial pulse is weak.

185
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,325
All right, Zack, push down
on my hand like a gas pedal.

186
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,327
Mm-hmm. Okay, wiggle your toes.

187
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,468
Femur films?

188
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,886
Mm-hmm, yeah. A.P. and lateral.

189
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,789
All right, Zack, we're going to
get you up, get you some X rays

190
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,552
and see what's going on.

191
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:40,959
Is it gonna hurt more?

192
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,488
Well, it's gonna
hurt a little bit,

193
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,156
but think of the fun
you're gonna have

194
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,758
getting everybody
to sign your cast.

195
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,232
Here you go.

196
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:50,896
Look, she's been throwing up.

197
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,665
Maybe you should induce labor.

198
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,255
That's a little
extreme right now.

199
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,457
Mrs. Chang, have you
had any cramps, bleeding?

200
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:58,643
It's just her stomach.

201
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,573
You could have a condition
called preeclampsia.

202
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,274
Your blood pressure's
a little elevated.

203
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:05,499
But we'll know a lot more
when we get your tests back.

204
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:06,762
Maybe the baby's in trouble.

205
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,986
I mean, why not induce?
It's only two weeks away.

206
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,866
We're going to take
care of your wife.

207
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,456
Why don't you try to stay calm?

208
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,559
<i>Who's on for ortho?</i>

209
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,677
Taglieri.

210
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,546
Who else is available?

211
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,215
What about Dr. Nelson?

212
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,550
He's still up there, isn't he?

213
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,687
Tell Dr. Nelson
ten-year-old, broken femur.

214
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:29,968
I need somebody
a few days a week.

215
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,637
Haleh: Your mom's
gotten worse, huh?

216
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:32,927
You know anybody?

217
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,106
A woman on Eight.

218
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,275
Part-time in Physical
Therapy. Jeanie Boulet.

219
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,167
You'll like her as much
as you like anyone.

220
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:42,114
Haleh, Can you
get a blood workup

221
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:43,816
on that pregnant woman in Two?

222
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,619
I don't think so. The lab's
completely shut down.

223
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:47,753
What? Just kidding.

224
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,909
Mark, suicide attempt.

225
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,645
Harris, Fran, 32.
Looks like an O.D.

226
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,548
She wrote a note. They found
an empty bottle of imipramine.

227
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,549
Vitals?

228
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:57,017
B.P. 50, Palp. Pulse 120.

229
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,686
I started calling at 7:00.

230
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,855
I should have
gotten there sooner.

231
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,441
Get her on the bed.

232
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,076
On my count.

233
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,528
One, two, three.

234
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:07,724
Point eight narcan.

235
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,764
Haleh, get a glucose.

236
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,165
Dialysis or hemoprofusion?

237
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,278
Not with tricyclics.

238
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,034
We got to pump her stomach.

239
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,470
Let's get an Ewald
tube and a charcoal.

240
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,089
Draw a tox screen

241
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,090
and a ruds.

242
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,792
Was she on other
antidepressants?

243
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,971
I don't know.

244
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,929
She kept saying she
wasn't that depressed.

245
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,331
Ma'am, maybe you should
take your baby outside.

246
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,067
It's not mine. It's hers.

247
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,469
Take him outside.
Somebody help her, please.

248
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,873
See the bottle of pills,
get the shrink's name.

249
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,258
Find out what else she was on.

250
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:38,777
Ewald tube.

251
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,064
Capillary refill is poor.

252
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,210
Three liters saline.

253
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:45,427
Lavage till clear.

254
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,330
B.P. Falling. 40 Palp.

255
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,703
Sinus tach, 140.

256
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,206
Seizures, Mark.

257
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,556
Aw, crap.

258
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,824
Valium.

259
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,409
Ten milligrams, I.V. Push.

260
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:57,946
Dilantin, one gram
at 50 migs a minute.

261
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,015
Tachycardic.

262
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,430
Give her an amp
of bicarb, I.V. push

263
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:06,315
and then put two
amps into that liter.

264
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,072
Looks like torsade.

265
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,825
Magnesium sulfate, two grams.

266
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,289
Pulse ox is falling
here. Come on.

267
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,413
I.V.'s infiltrated.

268
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,715
Slow down.

269
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,150
Slow down.

270
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,471
Happened in gym class.

271
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:24,906
Wrestling.

272
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,521
Okay. I won't need
you for the exam.

273
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,655
No problem.

274
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,123
And, Doug? Mm-hmm.

275
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,714
Listen,<i> I'm</i> the
attending on call.

276
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,983
When I'm on, you call
me, not somebody else.

277
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,284
It's not personal,
it's professional.

278
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,553
Got that clear?

279
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,265
Yes, John, that's clear.

280
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,924
Hey, Tiger, how you doing?

281
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,527
Ma'am, would you
like to sit down?

282
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,694
No, I should stay.

283
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,864
When she wakes up,
she'll want to see her baby.

284
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,111
Miss Eiger, we can't get
in touch with her therapist.

285
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,013
Is there anything else
she might have taken?

286
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,538
I should call Carl, Fran's
boyfriend. He should be here.

287
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,018
Was she taking any
other prescriptions?

288
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,307
How could she do this?

289
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:01,609
I mean, she was happy.

290
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,144
She'd gone back to school.

291
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,345
Everything was fine.

292
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,691
If you'd just let me...

293
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,181
No, I'll take care of him.

294
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,594
It's okay. It's okay.

295
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,585
Okay. Yeah.

296
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,987
Was she taking any other drugs?

297
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,988
I should call Carl.

298
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:15,423
Where... Do you have a phone?

299
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,758
Where's the phone?

300
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:18,793
Hey, kiddo.

301
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,360
Pulse ox is 60.

302
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,684
This isn't working.

303
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,247
Still P.E.A.

304
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,537
No pulse.

305
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:31,822
High-dose epi, seven milligrams.

306
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,358
Another mig of atropine.

307
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,575
Get another I.V. line here.

308
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,078
She's really cyanotic.

309
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm done.

310
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:40,949
25 minutes at least.

311
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,433
I don't hear a thing.

312
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,936
She's in asystole.

313
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,555
You had to take tricyclics, huh?

314
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,974
Why the hell didn't
you take painkillers?

315
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,292
Abnormal doll's eyes.

316
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:52,894
Pupils fixed and dilated.

317
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,763
Brain stem's shot.

318
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,858
She's gone.

319
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,493
It's okay, buddy.

320
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,561
You'll be okay.

321
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:35,453
This big mass around the bone
may represent an osteosarcoma.

322
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,899
I can't believe I did this.

323
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,801
Well, turns out to
be a good thing.

324
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,392
What the hell is good?
He broke my nephew's leg.

325
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,472
Oh, Ted, please,
come on, don't swear.

326
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,757
Because it happened,
we found out about

327
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,709
Zack's condition sooner
than we might have.

328
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,033
Wait a minute. What condition?

329
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,029
We won't know for
sure till we get a biopsy.

330
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,037
A biopsy?!

331
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,739
What is this, cancer?

332
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,742
It would explain why
his leg broke so easily.

333
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,544
My husband died of liver cancer.

334
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,597
Is Zack going to die?

335
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:03,681
We really don't know.

336
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,050
I think it's much too
early to worry about that.

337
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,768
Would you like
me to talk to Zack?

338
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:13,641
No. We'll tell him.

339
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:17,378
I'll talk to him, all right?

340
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,713
Doctor, you have
to induce labor.

341
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,393
Your wife's tests are normal.

342
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:24,385
The nausea was probably
caused by something she ate.

343
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,721
She... she had a
drink from the herbalist.

344
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:30,136
I mean, I tried to
call her gynecologist,

345
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,504
but he was out of town.

346
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,727
Your gynecologist
is an herbalist?

347
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:35,073
No, no, no. I... She...

348
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,109
The New Year is coming.

349
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,111
It's the year of the pig,

350
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:42,102
and right now it's
the year of the dog.

351
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:44,133
And... I can't believe
I'm saying this.

352
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,367
People, they think sometimes

353
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,943
that the babies born in the
year of the pig will be lazy.

354
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,845
I mean, we don't believe that.

355
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,464
I mean, we sort of believe it.

356
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,234
I mean, my... my ma...
my mother believes it

357
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,403
and her mother
believes it, but...

358
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,537
So, you used herbs

359
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,366
to induce because
you didn't want

360
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,369
your baby to be born
in the year of the pig.

361
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:05,504
You want it to be born
in the year of the dog.

362
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:09,063
I know it sounds crazy, but
yes, we want you to induce...

363
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,999
Mr. Chang, this is an emergency
room, not an auto body shop.

364
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,134
We don't do procedures

365
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,301
just because you want them.

366
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:15,447
Dr. Greene? Yeah.

367
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:16,515
Hi. I'm Dr. Noble.

368
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,338
Hi. How are you?

369
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,700
These Mr. And Mrs. Chang?

370
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,391
I was just about
to discharge them.

371
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,570
I'm checking them in.

372
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,072
I'm covering for Dr. Whitbread.

373
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,407
They left a message,
they wanted labor induced.

374
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,730
Some religious thing?

375
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,715
Oh, thank God.

376
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:29,133
She's not due for ten days.

377
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,619
Hey, we induce so
people can go on vacation.

378
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,899
We do it at Christmas
for the tax break.

379
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:35,203
What's the big deal?

380
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,560
Have a very happy
year of the dog.

381
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,030
Gently.

382
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,366
Let the water do the work.

383
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,847
I'm not a housekeeper,
Dr. Benton.

384
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,238
I'm a therapist.

385
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,551
Yes, I know. Look, we just need
someone to take her for walks

386
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,753
and look after her two or
three times a week, that's all.

387
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,244
Stroke victims
need a lot of care.

388
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,845
Now, I'm sure you
love your mother,

389
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,180
but you should be
thinking nursing home.

390
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,515
Slowly, Mr. Fayid.

391
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,529
You're in there for an
hour no matter what.

392
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:05,519
Will you at least consider it?

393
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:10,023
Can you afford me
on a resident's salary?

394
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:14,629
I'll, uh... I'll find the money.

395
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,734
Well, I have nursing
classes Mondays and Fridays.

396
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,747
I'm working Saturdays here.

397
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:24,739
I could do a middle of the week
starting a week from Tuesday.

398
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:27,185
We'll try it for a while;
we'll see how it works.

399
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,511
Okay, okay. I,
uh... I appreciate it.

400
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:33,447
It's not a favor; I get paid.

401
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:36,584
All right. That's cool.

402
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,366
Mark, crispy critters coming in.

403
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,401
Guy tried to rescue
a kid from a fire.

404
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,725
Okay.

405
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:46,605
Come on, Tag, you promised.

406
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:48,406
I can't help it. Staff
meeting at 6:00.

407
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,931
We get the room at 7:30,
and I don't want to be late.

408
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,968
Carol. I've been dreaming
about this romantic weekend

409
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:56,336
with room service... without
my mother and your dog.

410
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,216
I'll try to move
the meeting, okay?

411
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,540
Okay.

412
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,308
Gurney coming in! Move over!

413
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:04,178
Kane, William. Entered a
burning building to save a kid.

414
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,423
Vital's normal, resp: 30.

415
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:06,947
Kid's coming right behind him.

416
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,360
My throat... it's burning.

417
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,151
Put him in Trauma One.

418
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,152
Right.

419
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,486
Potter, Nancy, 14.

420
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:15,134
Burns on her leg, chest
abrasion, hit by a falling beam.

421
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,058
B.P. 90/50. Pulse 90.

422
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,593
All right, Connie, we're
going to need blood gases,

423
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:23,764
cross-table C spine, H-and-H
type and cross with four units.

424
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,644
Give me O-negative
in the meantime.

425
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,768
All right, on my count.

426
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:28,936
I can't breathe!

427
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,105
Get that. Ready? Yes.

428
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,439
One, two, three.

429
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:33,618
There you go.

430
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:35,609
I can't breathe.

431
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:38,278
All right, let's
get that mask on.

432
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:41,115
Start a gram of Ancef.

433
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,617
Connie, call the
Burn Unit. Okay.

434
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:48,455
Throat's fine.

435
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,957
Pupils normal.

436
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,626
How long were you
in the fire, Mr. Kane?

437
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,294
A couple minutes.

438
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,930
A lot of smoke.

439
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:57,297
Pulse ox is only 80.

440
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,966
Respiratory's high at 36.

441
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,534
Is the little girl okay?

442
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:01,869
Come on, lie back on there.

443
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:03,470
Sounds like fluid in here.

444
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:06,373
Let's get him on a
mask, 15 liters of O2

445
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,209
and a chest film quick.

446
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,643
Right, I'll go check.

447
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:10,978
No distal pulses.

448
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:12,991
B.P.'S falling 70/50.

449
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,314
Open the I.V.s wide.

450
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,983
Looks like a bone fragment.

451
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,085
We've got an open
tib-fib fracture here.

452
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,055
All right, we're going to need
Vascular and Orthopedics.

453
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,556
Let's get her up to O.R. now.

454
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,225
Watch her arm.

455
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,127
All right, here we go.

456
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:28,129
Coming through!

457
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:29,429
Here we go.

458
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,597
O.R.'s been notified.

459
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,278
Hold that elevator, please!

460
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,080
Carter... there's
this guy outside.

461
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,915
Can you go and
take a look at him?

462
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:38,739
What, can't
somebody bring him in?

463
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,652
I don't think that's
going to work.

464
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:41,987
Yeah. Come on, John, let's go.

465
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:44,178
Hey, Jerry, I really
need a cigarette.

466
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,480
Do you know where
Lydia keeps her stash?

467
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:49,475
I didn't know you
smoked. I don't.

468
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,071
Uncle Ed.

469
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,896
Uh... how long has
he been... sleeping?

470
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:04,532
Since breakfast, I guess.

471
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,751
I don't know quite
how to tell you this,

472
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,887
but your Uncle Ed is dead.

473
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,288
My God.

474
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,875
I thought he was
awful quiet back there.

475
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,596
Jackie, Jackie, I said I
was going to be there.

476
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,531
Yeah, Michigan and Wacker.

477
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,132
All right, I won't be late.

478
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,767
Oh, my Lord.

479
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,402
That's dead.

480
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:29,935
We can take him
through to Denver.

481
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,092
Leave him with his son.

482
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,793
Please move, please move.

483
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,073
You can't do that...
It's against the law.

484
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:35,396
Why? He's<i> our</i> uncle.

485
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,409
Medical examiner's
got to come and get him.

486
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:38,610
His people are in Denver.

487
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,612
We're sure as hell
not burying him here.

488
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,036
Carter, throw a sheet over him.

489
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,656
S3 and s4 gallop.

490
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,358
Add nitro 50 milligrams...

491
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,403
William?

492
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,345
Willy. Everybody calls me Willy.

493
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,597
How's your breathing? Okay?

494
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,083
How's the little girl?

495
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,601
Her name is Nancy.

496
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,969
She's going to be fine.

497
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,922
Fire department said that you
inhaled some toxic chemicals.

498
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,009
Your lungs are badly damaged.

499
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,616
It's not the... only reason.

500
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,200
C.F.

501
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,520
You have cystic fibrosis?

502
00:19:20,343 --> 00:19:22,143
Is there anyone
you want me to call?

503
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:24,127
Your wife or your family?

504
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,597
Dad.

505
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,467
Doug, get a pulmonary consult.

506
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,868
Mm-hmm.

507
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,687
Haleh, do you know
Dr. Lubin's extension?

508
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,177
4230.

509
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,512
Lungs going, huh?

510
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,680
Yeah. Yeah.

511
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,883
Billy, go to the third floor
and get us some gauze.

512
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,687
Six gross of gloves and no 4x4s.

513
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,689
Oh, thanks.

514
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,158
It must be hard for you.

515
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,094
The overdose this morning.

516
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,996
The girl with the kid.

517
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,998
I didn't have a kid.

518
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:05,736
Haleh, I really try not to
think about it too much.

519
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,707
Can I ask...

520
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,446
Did you leave a note?

521
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,864
No.

522
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,468
I couldn't figure
out what to say.

523
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:53,400
And when did your pain start?

524
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,169
This morning.

525
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:56,854
Mm-hmm. Is it
constant or intermittent?

526
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:57,855
Both. What?

527
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,501
I think she means
it comes and goes.

528
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,169
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Is it sharp or dull?

529
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,125
Sharp.

530
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,539
Uh, uh... Ask her if
she's had the pain before.

531
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,047
Oh, oh, right. Have
you had this pain before?

532
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,193
The pain is in my stomach.

533
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,378
It hurts like hell.

534
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,212
I mean, what
else can I tell you?

535
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,636
Ask about meds.

536
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,171
Oh. Uh, d-d-do you
take any medications?

537
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,342
Yeah. Norvasc and Tenormin
for my blood pressure,

538
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,839
Allopurinol, Colchicine,

539
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,274
sometimes Indocin for the gout,

540
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:24,465
Zoloft for depression,
Antivert for vertigo...

541
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,483
Wait a minute.

542
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,518
What did you eat today?

543
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,637
Some granola.

544
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:33,507
Oh, a couple of poppy
seed bagels, some cheese...

545
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,125
a nice lamb chop.

546
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,077
Um, excuse us a second.

547
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:38,279
Yeah.

548
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:41,115
I'll bet you anything it was
the poppy seeds or the granola.

549
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,617
We'd better find Dr. Benton.

550
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:45,630
I questioned Dr. Lewis about
every conceivable symptom.

551
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:47,737
Is that the case, Dr. Lewis?

552
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,674
I don't think so. No,
Dr. Kayson was in a hurry.

553
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,993
Dr. Kayson, the
patient, Mr. Vennerbeck,

554
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:54,662
died under our care.

555
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:57,331
You say you asked
about every symptom.

556
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:58,666
Including back pain?

557
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:00,934
Dr. Lewis should
have mentioned it.

558
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,270
You didn't tell him about
the back pain, Dr. Lewis?

559
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:04,955
It was on the chart.

560
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,119
Well, you should have
called it to my attention.

561
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:08,570
Please let's try to stay civil.

562
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:12,896
Are you sure you gave
her your full attention?

563
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,893
No, I don't think that's
the problem here.

564
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,650
But you did sign the chart.

565
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:17,668
David, I already told you,

566
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,347
I didn't have all the
relevant information.

567
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,538
Aren't you supposed to
obtain the information?

568
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,657
Oh, come on. We
know what this is about.

569
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,442
We all depend on the residents

570
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,760
to do their job.

571
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:27,939
Dr. Kayson,

572
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:32,215
attendings are here to
help residents do their job.

573
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,387
Dr. Lewis,

574
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:41,058
the... back pain

575
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,811
was ascribed to
a previous injury.

576
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:46,479
How would you assess
that information now?

577
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,832
I think I'd consider
it more carefully.

578
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,485
A possible sign
of unstable angina.

579
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,517
Well, we all make
those judgments

580
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,208
and we learn from them.

581
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,178
Ladies, gentlemen,

582
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,197
Dr. Lewis, Dr. Kayson.

583
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,094
How you doing, buddy?

584
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,163
They going to fix my leg now?

585
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,985
They'll do a couple
of things first.

586
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,721
Can I talk to you
quickly, please?

587
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,710
You haven't told him.

588
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,645
We were gonna, but...

589
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,047
We discussed it, and we think...

590
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,032
we think he's just
too young to hear it.

591
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,619
We have to do a biopsy
now, do you understand?

592
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:44,438
He doesn't need to
know, so just do it, okay?

593
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,674
Mrs. Mika, we won't go through
with this unless he knows.

594
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,059
I won't do that to him.

595
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,437
Sweetie...

596
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,939
Zack...

597
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:08,345
Sweetie, I... I've got
to tell you something.

598
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,901
I'm going to let
the doctor tell you.

599
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:16,103
I...

600
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,115
Zack, you may have
a form of... of cancer.

601
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:29,450
You know what cancer is?

602
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:34,471
Yeah. My dad had
cancer, and he died.

603
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,590
Am I going to die, too?

604
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,520
We don't think so,
but you're gonna have

605
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:39,743
to go through some tests,

606
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,278
and that's gonna hurt a little,

607
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,714
and then you're gonna
have to take some medication

608
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:44,948
and that's gonna make you

609
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,149
feel really sick.

610
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,351
Am I always going to be sick?

611
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,621
No. I think when it's all over,

612
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,456
you're going to be okay.

613
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,357
Well, what kind of tests?

614
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,827
Okay, well, we're gonna

615
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,330
put a needle in your
leg today, a little one.

616
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,166
Are you going to do it?

617
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,667
No.

618
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,401
Will you come with me?

619
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,021
Sure.

620
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:12,259
So... so let's go
do it then, okay?

621
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:14,862
Okay, kiddo.

622
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:16,847
Let's do it.

623
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,817
49-year-old woman presented
with acute stomach pain.

624
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,563
Leukocytosis with a high B.U.N.

625
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,565
Recent diet includes
both seeds and nuts.

626
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,033
Diagnosis: likely
diverticulitis.

627
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,323
Possible surgical candidate.

628
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,258
Okay, so what made
you ask about her diet?

629
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,760
Actually, it was Deb's idea.

630
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,495
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

631
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,797
Well, the next time
Deb has an idea,

632
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,131
let her present it.

633
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,634
Uh... um...

634
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,302
How did you come up with that?

635
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,872
Well, I have a
photographic memory.

636
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,607
It's kind of embarrassing,

637
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,011
but I saw on a page of the
pocket manual in my head:

638
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,730
Stomach pains plus seeds
or nuts could be diverticulitis.

639
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,466
That's right.

640
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,619
You could have
inflammation in the colon.

641
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,572
If it doesn't get
better in the next

642
00:25:58,608 --> 00:26:00,891
couple of hours, you
might have to have surgery.

643
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,926
Dr. Chen will come
back and check on you.

644
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,132
Great!

645
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,152
You holding up?

646
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,654
Uh-huh.

647
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:14,988
What happens now?

648
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,657
Well, Dr. Taglieri's

649
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:20,860
going to mark a
spot on your leg.

650
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,362
This won't hurt.

651
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:23,997
It's just a pen.

652
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:28,201
This is going to
feel a little cool

653
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:30,821
while the nurse cleans it.

654
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,272
Ready for the local?

655
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:33,785
It's going to sting a little.

656
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,620
It's a small needle
with some stuff in it

657
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:37,389
that's going to dull the pain.

658
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:39,546
You okay?

659
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,181
Mm-hmm.

660
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,934
Here's the needle gun.

661
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,664
Ah, this is the thing I
told you about... the gun.

662
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,356
Dr. Taglieri is going to
take a little piece of the tumor

663
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:50,357
out of your leg with it.

664
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,137
You're going to feel
it when it goes in.

665
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:55,162
Okay? You ready?

666
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,529
I'm ready.

667
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,806
That's all she wrote.

668
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:10,027
That wasn't so bad, was it?

669
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:13,297
Never got shot before.

670
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,966
You're going to do okay.

671
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:19,180
Look, this woman
does this for a living.

672
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,605
Are you crazy? I've spent
weeks looking at nursing homes.

673
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,051
Yeah, Well, she's
my mother, too,

674
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,053
and you don't make
these decisions without me.

675
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,237
Why do you keep like this?

676
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:27,839
I mean, this could
be the solution

677
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,174
that we've been looking for.

678
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:30,430
<i>You're</i> looking for.

679
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:31,732
I know the solution.

680
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,244
Okay. So, she goes
to a nursing home,

681
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,180
and you get the house
that we grew up in, right?

682
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:35,936
Oh, please, honey,

683
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:37,371
don't give me that
sentimental crap.

684
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:39,506
You wouldn't get
this house burn...

685
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,841
Hey, don't answer that.

686
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,177
I came all the way
across town to see you.

687
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:46,113
Jackie, I don't want
to see Ma end up

688
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:48,682
in some warehouse for old folks.

689
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:50,184
Look, look, Jackie.

690
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:52,385
This woman will come
three times a week.

691
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,387
I'll look after her
two times a week.

692
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,706
No, you won't, Peter.

693
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,023
You never have before.

694
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,359
And tell me something:

695
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:01,028
Just how do you plan on
paying this physical therapist first?

696
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:03,564
Look, if-if it's three
days, I can swing it.

697
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,581
Three days?!

698
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,878
God, Peter, when
are you gonna accept

699
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,930
that Mommy needs full-time care?

700
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:12,055
Okay. So how are you supposed
to pay for a nursing home, huh?

701
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,090
Her savings.

702
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,642
That's perfect.
You get the house,

703
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:16,977
you get to spend every penny

704
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:18,661
that she and Pop
ever saved, right?

705
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,298
Except what she gave
you for med school.

706
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,699
Jackie, don't even go there,

707
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,851
'cause I'm up to my
ass in debt, all right?

708
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,998
And in a couple of years,
you'll make more money

709
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:29,072
than Walt and I will ever see.

710
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,642
I tell you what, Peter.

711
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,578
Take the damn
house, okay? Take it.

712
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,591
You can even have
your old room back.

713
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,092
We'll clear out of
there tomorrow.

714
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,228
Then you can bathe
her and feed her

715
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,829
and keep her from
taking her clothes off

716
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,064
in front of the damn neighbors.

717
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,821
Look, Jackie, we'll work it out.

718
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,022
Peter!

719
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:49,609
Peter.

720
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,145
Hold on.

721
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,315
Yeah. This is Benton.

722
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,051
He did what? Okay, okay, okay.

723
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:00,298
Look, tell him I'm sorry
and I'm on my way.

724
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,738
I'll be right there, okay?

725
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,401
Yeah, yeah, I'm
leaving right now.

726
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:05,659
Look, Jackie, we can...

727
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,532
I couldn't move the meeting.

728
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,856
You're kidding.

729
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,992
No. But it'll be short.

730
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,694
Anyway, we can still
get out of here 8:00.

731
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:28,231
I hope so, or I'll be
feeling very... unromantic.

732
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,733
Well, if I'm not
here, just page me.

733
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,068
If you're not here,

734
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,249
I'm going to come up to
that meeting stark naked

735
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,206
and drag you out.

736
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,375
I'll see you at 8:00, okay?

737
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,575
I'll see you.

738
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,617
How was your review?

739
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,485
Fine, thank you.

740
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,655
I see you two are
still having a love fest.

741
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,490
I tried to stop them.

742
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,703
Doug? Yeah?

743
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:55,925
Kid's been beaten up.

744
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,206
Look at him. There's
blood all over the street.

745
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,774
They hit him and
they wouldn't stop.

746
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,964
They just kept hitting him,

747
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,793
and the cops wouldn't
even come, you know.

748
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,301
Hey, buddy.

749
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,802
You're pretty banged up.

750
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,304
What's your name?

751
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,671
Terry.

752
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,741
All right, Terry.

753
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,243
Does this hurt?

754
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,744
No.

755
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,380
I don't know why the
cops wouldn't come.

756
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,381
How about this?

757
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,382
No.

758
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,850
You okay, man?

759
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,385
You okay, man?

760
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,386
Does this hurt?

761
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,387
Uh-uh.

762
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,655
Nothing looks broken.

763
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,608
I'm just taking
your temperature.

764
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:29,887
We should've gone
away someplace...

765
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,244
How old are you, Terry?

766
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,630
Eighteen.

767
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,032
Temp: 102. Resp: 24.

768
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,602
You got a fever, Terry.

769
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:39,637
You been sick?

770
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,589
No. I... I got a cough.

771
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:43,723
His lungs are clear.

772
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,158
He's tachycardic.

773
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:48,161
Let's get a C.B.C., Lytes,
A.B.G and a chest film.

774
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:49,579
Terry, this is Haleh.

775
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:50,564
She's going to clean you up,

776
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,844
give you some bandages
and get some X rays.

777
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:55,602
Okay? Can I talk to you?

778
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:58,105
Are you his girlfriend?

779
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,473
No. I'm just his friend.

780
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:02,976
We need to call his family.

781
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,478
Do you... do you
know their number?

782
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:08,331
They live, uh,
someplace in Georgia...

783
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,666
or someplace.

784
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,835
They threw him out
or he... he run away.

785
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,886
I don't know.

786
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:15,355
He's my best friend.

787
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,385
Is he going to be okay?

788
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,959
Where does Terry live?

789
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,243
We don't live no place.

790
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,640
We used to have this
place on the West Side.

791
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:24,665
It got torn down, though.

792
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,466
How old is Terry?

793
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,985
You heard him. He's 18.

794
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,121
How old is he?

795
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,489
Fifteen.

796
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,019
He's got to say he's older,

797
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:37,711
or the cops will pick him up.

798
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:39,012
Okay.

799
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,197
Fine.

800
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,066
Could you just take
care of him... sir?

801
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,701
Sure. Sure.

802
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,839
Hey, bad day?

803
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,309
Pediatrics is fine when
the kids are healthy.

804
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,844
How was the, uh...
review board thing?

805
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:55,990
They crucified Kayson.

806
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,347
I hate to admit it,

807
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,360
but I loved watching him squirm.

808
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,150
So you going to give
Mark a break now?

809
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,151
Does he deserve one?

810
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,286
Can you people help me?

811
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,522
Could you see the nurse
back there at the desk?

812
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,235
Yeah, he deserves...
I know, but...

813
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,469
Um, I've been
waiting 40 minutes.

814
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,394
Yeah, I know, uh,
we're very busy.

815
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,795
Okay.

816
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,797
Okay. Sir. Sir!

817
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,400
Come here!

818
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,469
What is that?

819
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:22,939
Well, what does it look like?

820
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,743
The kids next door were
playing cowboys and Indians.

821
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,745
How did you get here?

822
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,813
I took the bus.

823
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,149
Do you want to just...

824
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,483
Yeah, if you would...

825
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,484
I'll get it.

826
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Mm-hmm.

827
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:44,327
The doctor said he
had five or six years left.

828
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,197
He's not going
to make it, is he?

829
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,700
His lungs are
filling with fluid.

830
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,335
We'll suction them out,

831
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:55,004
but they will fill
back up again.

832
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,292
Eventually, we're going to
have to put him on a respirator.

833
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:01,311
He never had kids.

834
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,313
Said it wouldn't be fair.

835
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,332
He wouldn't be around
long enough for them.

836
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:12,305
Five, six years,
that's a lot of time.

837
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,173
New blood gases.

838
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,742
Not good.

839
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:17,577
PO2 is 50, PCO2, 60.

840
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,446
They brought the little
girl down from the fire.

841
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:22,949
Her mother says she
wants to talk to him.

842
00:33:22,985 --> 00:33:23,950
Thanks.

843
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,952
The versed has him under.

844
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:28,354
He may not be able to hear her.

845
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,856
It's okay?

846
00:33:29,892 --> 00:33:31,190
Sure.

847
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:41,935
What's his name?

848
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,404
Willy.

849
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,422
His name's Willy.

850
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:50,726
Willy, my name's Nancy.

851
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,562
Nancy Potter.

852
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,415
You saved me from the fire.

853
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,234
Can you hear her, son?

854
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,655
Thank you, Willy.

855
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,675
Thank you for getting me.

856
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,149
Good afternoon,
to you, Dr. Benton.

857
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:20,139
I don't want to talk about it.

858
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:21,608
I didn't ask.

859
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,778
You know, for the first time,
I've missed grand rounds.

860
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,613
What the hell do I
tell Morgenstern?

861
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,626
You had something
more important to do.

862
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,749
Yeah, right.

863
00:34:29,785 --> 00:34:32,218
You know, in pediatrics,
you guys got it made.

864
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:35,789
You all go into
private practice.

865
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,124
But surgeons, we
all want to be chief.

866
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,126
If I have another day like this,

867
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,729
I don't have a prayer.

868
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,965
There are more
important things in life

869
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,966
than being chief.

870
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,133
Yeah, right. Like what?

871
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,280
This morning,
I had a little girl

872
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,972
who beat up her mom,
and her mom is dead.

873
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,285
Another kid with osteosarcoma.

874
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:57,077
He's probably
going to lose his leg.

875
00:34:57,112 --> 00:34:59,657
Another one with
cystic fibrosis.

876
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:04,217
It is the middle of winter,
my apartment is freezing,

877
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:08,588
and the woman that I vaguely
thought might stay with me

878
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:12,225
has said that I'm
not the kind of guy

879
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,293
that women marry.

880
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:18,865
So I'm going to
shoot some hoops.

881
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:26,006
Yes!

882
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:31,227
Oh! Hey, you want
to share the court?

883
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,729
Play you one-on-one.

884
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,214
I'm Doug.

885
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:35,215
Jake.

886
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,716
Nickel a point.

887
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,051
A dime. To 21.

888
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:41,087
Okay, dump that.
Let's go, right now.

889
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:42,684
My mom works at the hospital.

890
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,085
Diane Leeds. You know her?

891
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,141
Nope.

892
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,027
Up!

893
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,245
Lucky shot.

894
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,198
What's your mom do?

895
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,700
She's on the seventh floor.

896
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,368
I'm waiting for her

897
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:56,453
to get off work.

898
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,770
Oh! Very fancy.

899
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:59,805
Strains it.

900
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,057
Nice.

901
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,070
I'm going to the Bulls tonight.

902
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,627
Yeah? Who's your
favorite player?

903
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,739
B.J. Armstrong.

904
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,730
Yeah, mine, too. You know why?

905
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,648
'Cause he's short

906
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:11,617
just like I was.

907
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:14,854
You're good for a short guy.

908
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,169
Well, thank you.

909
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:17,890
Jacob!

910
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,392
Damn it!

911
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,893
Jacob.

912
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,362
Hi, Mom.

913
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,364
Hi, kiddo. I'm sorry I'm late.

914
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,993
You got a killer player there.

915
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,550
Yeah, he's a pretty tough guy.

916
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,763
Much longer, I'll be paying
his allowance for the week.

917
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,254
I wish you would.

918
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,689
With video games
alone, I could go broke.

919
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:34,924
Are you ready?

920
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,394
I'm Doug Ross, in
Pediatrics in the E.R.

921
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,881
Oh. Diane Leeds,
Risk Management.

922
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,727
Yeah, we spoke
on the phone once.

923
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:44,895
Dr. Ross... Doug.

924
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:47,020
Before you try any harder,

925
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:50,623
Cindy Sadwick is a
very good friend of mine.

926
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,708
Mm-hmm. How is Cindy?

927
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,910
Well, she can't say your name

928
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,413
without adding a few words I
wouldn't want my son to hear.

929
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,413
Button up, babe.

930
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,426
Well, tell her I said hello.

931
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,167
Right.

932
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,438
I owe you a dime.

933
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,618
Well, you'll win it back
from me next time, okay?

934
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,922
Have fun at the game.

935
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,022
Ah! Rescue 61,
M.I. on the way in.

936
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:25,825
53-Year-old male,
drunk out of his gourd

937
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,393
at Shaw's Crab House.

938
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:28,894
A drunken coronary.

939
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,397
Can you talk
Mark into taking it?

940
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:32,609
Uh-uh. He quit.

941
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:35,112
He's now the house
doctor at Field's.

942
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:36,602
Um, department meeting.

943
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:39,605
Benton's in surgery, and
Mintzer went home sick.

944
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,608
Wish I could go home sick.

945
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:44,521
Susan, we got a chest pain here!

946
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:46,023
Trauma Two. Trauma Two's open.

947
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,347
What do you got?

948
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:49,327
Patient complained of
mid-sternal chest pain.

949
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,828
Diaphoretic, vomited twice.

950
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,480
Sublingual nitro,
two migs morphine.

951
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:53,987
Says he's a doctor.

952
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,254
Sir, are you...?

953
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:56,589
Oh, my God.

954
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,091
Dr. Kayson.

955
00:37:58,126 --> 00:37:59,092
Dr. Lewis.

956
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:00,392
In Two.

957
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,392
This is aspirin,
Dr. Kayson. Can you chew?

958
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,305
Yeah. Well, start chewing.

959
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,961
B.P., 150/100.

960
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,297
O2, 15 liters.

961
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,666
Dr. Kayson, I know
how you feel about T.P.A.

962
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:23,667
Do you want it?

963
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,735
I don't know.

964
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:28,587
They're prepping in the
cath lab for angioplasty.

965
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:30,873
The choice is yours
but make it now.

966
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,658
Run a 12-lead.

967
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:34,327
Where the hell is Steinman?

968
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:35,645
He's in surgery.

969
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,130
Cardiology will be here
as soon as they can.

970
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:40,650
Tachy, 120. Resp, 24.

971
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:41,885
Where is blood results?

972
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,636
What's the E.K.G. say?

973
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:45,855
"S.T. elevation in
the inferior leads."

974
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,040
I'm going to die.

975
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,093
You are not going to die.

976
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,421
B.P.'S crashing, bradycardic.

977
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:53,012
He's in cariogenic shock.

978
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:55,198
Okay, E.T. Tube, 7.0.

979
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:58,234
Whole respiratory down.

980
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,403
Open up the IV.

981
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,807
Bolus one milligram
atropine I.V.

982
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,209
It's falling, Susan.

983
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,994
60/35.

984
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:09,645
Start a dopamine drip.

985
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,949
Tube's in.

986
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,195
Bag him.

987
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,886
All right. He may
need a pacemaker.

988
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,207
Yeah. Let's get
him upstairs now.

989
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:27,847
Haleh, call cardiology.

990
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:29,415
Tell them he's stable.

991
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,950
He needs angioplasty.

992
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:34,186
And see if anyone's
gotten a hold of his wife.

993
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,356
Coming through!

994
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:38,636
Oh, man.

995
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,193
Come on, guys. Let's go.

996
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:43,748
What is this... a convention?

997
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:48,634
Is that a joke?

998
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,836
No.

999
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:54,657
Hey, Terry.

1000
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,059
How you feeling?

1001
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,593
Better.

1002
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:00,529
I want to talk to you
about your condition.

1003
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,298
You've heard of P.C.P.

1004
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,350
Pneumocystis pneumonia.

1005
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:09,972
AIDS, huh?

1006
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,869
We need to confirm
the diagnosis,

1007
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:15,044
but if it's P.C.P., then yes,
you probably have AIDS.

1008
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,114
Angie, don't cry.

1009
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,599
Don't cry, please.

1010
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,650
Come on. Hey...

1011
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,635
Listen, hey...

1012
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:27,639
Would you get my...
my, uh, coat and stuff?

1013
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,242
Please?

1014
00:40:29,277 --> 00:40:31,244
Come on. Come on.

1015
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:33,657
You still working
the streets, Terry?

1016
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,447
Playing it safe?

1017
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:38,801
Look, they don't want
you using rubbers.

1018
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,770
It's not what they
pay for, you know.

1019
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,739
All right, we're going to
check you in, do an HIV test

1020
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,102
and treat the pneumonia.

1021
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:47,059
Thanks anyway, but no thanks.

1022
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:49,195
I just want to get out of here.

1023
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,875
Terry, if you have
sex with people,

1024
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,442
you're going to
infect them, too.

1025
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:53,799
I got to feed myself, right?

1026
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,017
Some of my friends, too.

1027
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,620
Terry, you are sick, and
you're going to get sicker.

1028
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:58,656
Check yourself in.

1029
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,840
We can stop the
pneumonia, and we'll put you

1030
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,202
on a program for AZT.

1031
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,410
Hey, man. I'm okay.

1032
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:05,678
Terry, listen to me.

1033
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,147
You are not going to
get healthier on the street.

1034
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:09,415
Can you go home?

1035
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:11,211
Is there anybody
that'll take you in?

1036
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,653
They threw me out.

1037
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:18,307
They won't be
taking me back now.

1038
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,616
I want you to use these condoms.

1039
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,547
I'll get you a medicine
called Bactrim.

1040
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,184
I want you to take
that every day.

1041
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:36,776
Only time I took medicine
every day was in jail.

1042
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:38,089
Please try.

1043
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:39,696
And use the condoms.

1044
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,530
Terry, use the condoms.

1045
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,851
Here's some
numbers for a shelter

1046
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:48,020
and an AIDS treatment center.

1047
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:49,355
Keep this.

1048
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,641
You're going to need it, okay?

1049
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,926
All right.

1050
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:55,227
Thanks.

1051
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,803
Your wife's on the way.

1052
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:06,706
Dr. Steinman's coming
to take you to the cath lab.

1053
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:08,541
Nod if that's what you want.

1054
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,109
Do you want T.P.A.?

1055
00:42:11,846 --> 00:42:13,045
Hi, Jack. You look great.

1056
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:14,925
We're going to blow
your arteries out.

1057
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,966
Dr. Steinman, he wants T.P.A.

1058
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,268
Jack, I looked at your
echo; you need angioplasty.

1059
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,086
Jack, you're scared.

1060
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,221
Remember we did

1061
00:42:22,257 --> 00:42:24,824
a couple hundred
of these last year.

1062
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,543
And when this is over,
you'd better stop smoking

1063
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,561
and start jogging.

1064
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:29,612
Let's move him.

1065
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,080
You can't do that. What?

1066
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,415
He's my patient.

1067
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,117
He doesn't want
angioplasty; he wants T.P.A.

1068
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,670
Dr... Lewis, this
man's under sedation.

1069
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:39,538
He's in no condition
to make a decision.

1070
00:42:39,573 --> 00:42:40,873
No.

1071
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:44,276
Stop this adolescent behavior
and get the hell out of my way.

1072
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,895
If you take him out of here,

1073
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,875
I'll see you at a
review committee,

1074
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,800
and they will fry
your ass so fast,

1075
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,796
to keep your license.

1076
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,304
Please order the T.P.A.

1077
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:55,587
Get it in here now.

1078
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,327
Wow.

1079
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,362
That was really dull.

1080
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:24,333
I guess I'll have
to try it again.

1081
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,413
Maybe we should use that stuff

1082
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,671
you got in New
Orleans last year.

1083
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,006
Really?

1084
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,752
You still have some of that

1085
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,353
edible massage oil left?

1086
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,811
It gave you a rash.

1087
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:37,058
We could try a different flavor.

1088
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:39,215
Where's my bag?

1089
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,418
My bag? You know,
that little gladstone bag.

1090
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,920
What?

1091
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,287
<i>You</i> had it.

1092
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:49,692
You're joking.

1093
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:51,628
No, I'm not.

1094
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,598
Where is it?

1095
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,068
I brought the bags downstairs.

1096
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:00,903
I stopped to get you.

1097
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:02,138
Yeah?

1098
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:03,506
Oh...

1099
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:06,743
I'll never be able
to go to work again.

1100
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,190
Where did you leave it?

1101
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,514
Admissions.

1102
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,149
Under the desk.

1103
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,424
Mm-hmm.

1104
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:26,479
Doug, you sleeping?

1105
00:44:26,514 --> 00:44:27,846
I wish.

1106
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:32,985
How many kids am I
going to see this year?

1107
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,339
Based on last year...
3,000, give or take.

1108
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:40,326
Hmm.

1109
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:43,429
Feel like I saw them all today.

1110
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:47,182
Baby with croup.

1111
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:49,168
God love the croup.

1112
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:53,038
At least it's
something I can fix.

1113
00:44:54,975 --> 00:44:55,992
You okay?

1114
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:59,311
Yep.

1115
00:44:59,347 --> 00:45:01,180
I'm coming.
