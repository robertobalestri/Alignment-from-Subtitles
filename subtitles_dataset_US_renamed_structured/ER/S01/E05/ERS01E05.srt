1
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,944
Doug... Doug!

2
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:19,879
Come on. Up and at
'em. We're busy here.

3
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,370
No way. I'm on double shift.

4
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:23,550
Yep. So am I. And you
wanted a long weekend. Get up.

5
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:25,374
I was having a terrific dream...

6
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:28,243
Beating my high school
football coach to a pulp.

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,725
Carter, med students don't
sleep at 4:00 in the afternoon.

8
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:33,047
Get up, Carter.

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,462
<i>There's woman in
three with a headache.</i>

10
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:36,618
<i>She thinks</i>

11
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:38,052
it's a brain tumor.

12
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,155
A little kid in five with
chewing gum in his eye.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,601
And there's an
old lady in four...

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,891
She just wants her hand held.

15
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:44,025
I'm really hungry.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,326
Cookies at the desk.

17
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:48,396
Oh. Repeat H & H order
for abdominal pain in two.

18
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,397
Morning, Susan.

19
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:50,732
It's afternoon, Doug.

20
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:51,900
I knew that.

21
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:53,401
Your brain's rotted.

22
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:54,914
At your age, Ryne
Sandberg retired.

23
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,415
At my age, Mozart was dead.

24
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,973
Jen, Jen, Jen, I can't get out.

25
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,241
I have got two residents
on double shifts.

26
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,410
I'll be home before
Rachel goes to bed.

27
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,923
Tell Mark to go see his wife.

28
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,246
Go see your wife.

29
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,915
Why can't you tell
me over the phone?

30
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,249
Hey, Jen. Hang on.

31
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:11,520
Jen? Hey, it's Doug. Can
you hold on a second?

32
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,421
We can survive without you.

33
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:16,090
I'll meet you there,
all right? Bye.

34
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:17,258
Thank you.

35
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:19,594
I know<i> you</i> can
survive without me.

36
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,329
Rescue 51's bringing
in two victims...

37
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:23,598
Motor vehicle collision...
One major, one minor.

38
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:25,099
How soon? Now.

39
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:26,267
Where's Benton?

40
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:27,614
Do I look like his travel agent?

41
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:28,987
Ask his student.

42
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,622
Read books of diseases,

43
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,969
you start thinking
you have them.

44
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,711
Find Benton. Head-on
vehicle, two victims on the way.'

45
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,645
TC, seven months
OB. Vitals stable.

46
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,381
Second victim right behind her.

47
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:40,727
What's your name, ma'am?

48
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:42,050
Sally. Sally Neimeyer.

49
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:44,113
How far along are
you, Mrs. Neimeyer?

50
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,804
Almost seven months.

51
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,505
Second one coming in!

52
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,927
Chest trauma, vitals stable.

53
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,711
Air bag didn't open.

54
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,642
Name's Suarez... gangbanger.

55
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,144
Stole the car, hit
the pregnant lady.

56
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:00,602
Ms. Suarez, is there any pain?

57
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:03,839
I wouldn't have crashed
if you didn't chase me.

58
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,173
Oh, my chest!

59
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,025
Let's move!

60
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,161
CBC, type, cross
and hold four units.

61
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,308
Hook her up to a fetal
monitor. Now, please.

62
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,227
Your baby has a
nice, steady heartbeat.

63
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,584
I'm going to have a boy.

64
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,731
Get a K-&-B. Call
OB for an ultrasound.

65
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:19,054
Does this hurt?

66
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,154
No.

67
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,467
Any pain in your head?

68
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,925
No. That girl, she
just ran right into me

69
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,259
and didn't even stop.

70
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,045
What about me, man!

71
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,596
Push down with your hand.

72
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:31,717
Push against it.
Okay, that's good.

73
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,219
Good. Now push
down on your foot,

74
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,221
like on a gas pedal.

75
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,590
Okay. You're doing great.

76
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,309
All right, gently...

77
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,578
Oh! Oh!

78
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:45,079
What?

79
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,711
You're in labor.

80
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,680
Two centimeters
dilated, 40% effaced.

81
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,482
Can I get somebody
to call my husband?

82
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,306
28 Weeks... that's too early.

83
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,290
You want to stop labor now?

84
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:57,086
I want to buy some
time for the kid's lungs.

85
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,088
What if it's 34 weeks,
and the baby's fine?

86
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,896
Well, it doesn't feel

87
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,080
like 34 weeks to me.

88
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,097
We need ultrasound.

89
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,133
Can, um...?

90
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,801
It's too early.

91
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:06,818
We got to try.

92
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,465
Is my baby going to be okay?

93
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,316
Okay, let's try and stop labor.

94
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,157
Bolus her six grams

95
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,641
magnesium sulfate.

96
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:16,895
Get a fetal lung profile.

97
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,063
Where the hell is OB?
What about me, man?!

98
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,299
Is my baby okay?

99
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,118
It's okay.

100
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:24,286
It's okay.

101
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:25,453
Okay.

102
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,888
It's okay.

103
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:35,614
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

104
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:20,892
That's incredible.

105
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,394
It's terrific.

106
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,396
I still can't believe it.

107
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,065
Why didn't you tell
me on the phone?

108
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,401
It's in Milwaukee.

109
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,736
It's only two hours away.

110
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,072
And a federal clerkship, Mark...

111
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,408
I never dreamed I had a chance.

112
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,720
I thought you wanted

113
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,422
to be a<i> state's</i> attorney.

114
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,945
They haven't made an offer.

115
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,280
The judge had a clerk.

116
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,282
Guy backed out
at the last minute.

117
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,917
That's why I'm getting this.

118
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,697
It's a great break for you.

119
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,931
You deserve it.

120
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,088
Thank you.

121
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,824
You deserve it.

122
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,810
There's lots of
hospitals in Milwaukee.

123
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:59,281
Yeah. I don't know
about chief residents

124
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,950
but, um... we could live here.

125
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:04,306
You could take the train.

126
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:07,989
Four hours a day on a train?

127
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,725
When am I going to
have time to sleep?

128
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,811
I'd never get to see Rachel.

129
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,337
I'll make some phone calls.

130
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:24,932
See what they got up there.

131
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:34,466
I made a lot of
compromises, Mark.

132
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,843
<i>Pistola!</i>

133
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,212
<i>IFue en el pecho!</i>

134
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,792
Doug, they're not stopping.

135
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,561
Contractions two minutes apart.

136
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,867
Doug?

137
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:54,202
I don't like this.

138
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,705
We're looking at
major lung trouble.

139
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,206
Fetal heart rate?

140
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,974
135 and dropping.

141
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,971
We've got 128.
Late decelerations.

142
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,162
Fetal distress, maybe acidotic.

143
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,318
What's wrong? What's
wrong? Is my baby okay?

144
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,969
Breathe deeply.

145
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,306
We're taking care of your baby.

146
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,407
Her water's broken.

147
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,443
All right. We can't stop this.

148
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,961
Let's go for delivery.

149
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,530
Okay, your baby's coming.

150
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:23,831
Call OB. Tell them
we're on the way.

151
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,634
Call Neonatal. Tell them to
expect a preemie, 28 weeks.

152
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,769
Call third floor.

153
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,871
Tell them to send
a team to five.

154
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,107
Mrs. Neimeyer,
we're taking you up.

155
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,943
You're going to deliver
your baby right now.

156
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,545
Let's clear that, please.

157
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,746
There you go.

158
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:41,849
Hey, how's Jennifer?

159
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:44,719
She got a great
job in Milwaukee.

160
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,055
Oh. Can she do it by phone?

161
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,668
I don't think that's what

162
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,570
the federal judge has in mind.

163
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:52,227
Milwaukee?

164
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,702
Don't ask. I don't know.

165
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,778
Miss Suarez, you
hit a pregnant woman.

166
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:00,313
We're not too happy about that,

167
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,937
but we have to take care of you.

168
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,084
Now, you have
to tell us the truth.

169
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:05,940
Did you take any drugs today?

170
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,442
No.

171
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:09,211
170/100.

172
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:10,579
Pulse 120.

173
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:11,779
Do any cocaine?

174
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:13,181
Maybe a little crack?

175
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:14,949
Nah.

176
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:17,018
Yeah, right.

177
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:20,388
CBC, tox screen, and
let's get a chest film now.

178
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,941
Will you look at this board?

179
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:24,942
Don't worry.

180
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,511
It'll get quieter later.

181
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,012
Don't say the "Q" word.

182
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,614
You'll start a stampede.

183
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,227
I'll take the kid in one.

184
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,750
Hey, how's the preemie?

185
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,818
She deliver?

186
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,898
Yeah, right on the elevator.

187
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,099
Baby's in neonatal.

188
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,434
Lungs are bad...
Hyaline membrane.

189
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,424
Mom's okay, though.

190
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,425
Night, Billy.

191
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,427
Dr. Ross?

192
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,440
Can I talk to you for a sec?

193
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,998
Yeah, sure, if you
can keep me awake.

194
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,483
If a patient has, like,
a burning sensation,

195
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,387
does he necessarily have a...?

196
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:54,433
A sexually-transmitted
disease? Yeah. He probably does.

197
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:56,340
You have to do a
culture. You ever do that?

198
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,326
No. No? Okay.

199
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:01,245
First, you got to do
a chlamydia prep.

200
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,914
Then you have to do a gram stain

201
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,100
for gonorrhea.

202
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:06,517
Stick this bad boy in

203
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,319
about a quarter of an inch,

204
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,989
and then you spin it
around about ten times.

205
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,073
Ten times.

206
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,875
Who's the lucky girl?

207
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,978
Uh... uh, Liz.

208
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,579
The girl with the rash.

209
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,099
Mm-hmm. Old
hospital saying, Carter:

210
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,301
"Don't dip your pen
in company ink."

211
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,570
Oh, hey, I hope
you used a condom.

212
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,693
Carol, we got a code
3 from Rescue 63.

213
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:32,861
Full arrest.

214
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,740
They're on their way in now.

215
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,163
Can I take her?

216
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,177
Not till her tests are back.

217
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,267
She's breathing, ain't she?

218
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:44,706
She stole the car,
and hit a pregnant lady.

219
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:47,019
Yeah, but, for all I know,

220
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,121
she could have
an aortic rupture.

221
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:50,990
You want her to die in jail?

222
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:54,649
Frankly, Doc, I
wouldn't lose sleep.

223
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:58,252
Okay, neither would I.

224
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,647
But I'm liable... you're not.

225
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:04,692
Mom... Mom, listen.

226
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,928
I can barely hear you.

227
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,397
Got a heart.

228
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:10,565
Where to?

229
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,635
Trauma two... Last
door on your right.

230
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,336
Susan, we need you.

231
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,504
I got to go. Bye.

232
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,075
Hi.

233
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:22,410
I'm really okay.

234
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:23,578
Are you doctors?

235
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:24,679
I'm Dr. Lewis.

236
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:25,780
Dr. Greene.

237
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,982
I thought this guy
was in full arrest.

238
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:30,335
I was, till they
fried my chest hairs.

239
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,721
Let's get a CBC, Chem seven,
blood gas and coag panel.

240
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:36,156
On my count...

241
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:37,859
one, two, three.

242
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,894
He was in fib.

243
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,095
Shocked him once.

244
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,663
Converted really fast.

245
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,816
Had 100 milligrams of Lidocaine.

246
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:50,383
How'd it feel?

247
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,551
Any pain?

248
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:52,957
I don't remember.

249
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,109
I just sort of passed out.

250
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:56,895
Can we get a monitor?

251
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,182
Do you have a history of
heart problems, Mr. Gasner?

252
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,067
Nothing that a transplant

253
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,069
wouldn't cure.

254
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,071
I was up for a good one.

255
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,223
A kid in a motorcycle
accident. It went to Minneapolis.

256
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,175
Who's your cardiologist?

257
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,677
Mike Dickey.

258
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,962
Great guy.

259
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,874
He's at Saint
Luke's in Cleveland.

260
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,316
I'm in town for the
Builders' Convention.

261
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,651
My wife said

262
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,068
I shouldn't travel.

263
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:24,906
But how could I miss 2,000
construction guys in one...

264
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,141
I don't get a pulse.

265
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,826
Mr. Gasner?

266
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,061
Mr. Gasner!

267
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,880
What? He's not in fib.

268
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,133
Give him an amp of EPI.

269
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,153
Come on.

270
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:40,422
Come on back.

271
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:42,251
I'll call Cleveland
for his history.

272
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,474
Whoa.

273
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,082
I just pass out.

274
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,453
Start a dopamine drip,

275
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,788
400 in 250 D5W.

276
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,322
Ten drops a minute.

277
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,942
My chest feels like
someone sat on it.

278
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,860
Uh-huh. That happens sometimes.

279
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:08,248
Yeah, I know.

280
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,302
You got to give her something.

281
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,470
She can't breathe.

282
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,133
Sandy, just keep
taking deep breaths.

283
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:16,141
Blood gases are back.

284
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,143
Not good.

285
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,644
PO-2's 70.

286
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,962
You taking any medication?

287
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,461
No. It's never been this bad.

288
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,020
Handheld nebs,
Albuterol 2.5 milligrams.

289
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,805
Peak flow, pre and post.

290
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,990
Give her solu-Medrol,
50 milligrams IV.

291
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,309
Can I talk to you
outside just for a second?

292
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:36,694
Sandy? This is Lydia.

293
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,729
She's going to take care of you.

294
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,665
You're going to be fine, okay?

295
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,079
Just keep breathing, honey.

296
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,603
Keep breathing.

297
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,225
Your daughter's having a
very serious asthma attack.

298
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,026
Is she allergic to anything?

299
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,027
I don't know.

300
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,139
I don't think so.

301
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,496
Do you have any pets?

302
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:56,676
This cat... a stray.

303
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,544
Sandy found her in the street.

304
00:11:58,568 --> 00:11:59,778
She just loves her.

305
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,902
You'll have to
get rid of the cat.

306
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,571
We need to do some tests.

307
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,240
It's going to take
about two hours. Okay?

308
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,774
Okay.

309
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,944
All right, Sandy...

310
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,081
<i>Gasner, G-A-S-N-E-R.</i>

311
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,483
First name Samuel.

312
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:19,086
Can you fax us his chart
and have his physician...?

313
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:20,421
Are you a doctor?

314
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,067
They said my wife was
here. Is she all right?

315
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,491
What's your name, sir?

316
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:24,670
Neimeyer. She's pregnant.

317
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:25,904
She was in a car accident.

318
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:26,894
Is she all right?

319
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,229
Jerry, Mr. Neimeyer.

320
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:29,442
Hi. Your wife is fine.

321
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,277
I'll take you up to Neonatal.

322
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:32,267
Neo-what?

323
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:33,446
You had a baby.

324
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,769
Thanks, Jerry.

325
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:37,138
It's Dr. Mark Greene,
with an "e" at the end.

326
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,473
He's chief resident.

327
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,974
This convention?

328
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,859
I got a little tired.

329
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,863
Built 15 houses this year.

330
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,764
I wanted to design them

331
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,968
but, uh, I just build them.

332
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,269
Can you stop
talking just a second?

333
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,743
Old inferior wall M.I.

334
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,578
Low voltage.

335
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,164
Consistent with severe myopathy.

336
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,599
I've been through this.

337
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,601
I know what it says.

338
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,453
It's nothing new.

339
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,689
Am I going to make it tonight?

340
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:15,659
I ask every time.

341
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,163
He's in fib!

342
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,479
Charging.

343
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,385
Ready.

344
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,938
Two hundred. Do it.

345
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,902
Another 50 of Lidocaine.

346
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,392
Start a drip.

347
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:33,327
Two grams in 500.

348
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:37,582
Wow. I don't usually do that.

349
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,455
Could somebody
please call my wife?

350
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,249
That's a big, boggy heart.

351
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,973
Suppose we get a transplant.

352
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,374
Is it too late?

353
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,287
He's been defibrillated twice.

354
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,111
He's in cardiogenic shock.

355
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,813
Keeps going in and out.

356
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,693
Can't be much muscle there.

357
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,516
Jerry, call cardiology
for an echo,

358
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,751
and wake up Dr. Flint,

359
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,620
get him down here
from Lake Forest.

360
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,800
Oh, hey, call the
transplant coordinator

361
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,969
and see if they've
got any hearts around.

362
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,459
Your wife called.

363
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,138
Great. I missed calling Rachel.

364
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,307
Lydia, did you get ahold
of the Gasner family?

365
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,799
I'm trying Cleveland
every ten minutes.

366
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:31,496
Gasner doesn't think he's
going to make it through the night.

367
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,756
Dr. Ross, peak flow's
gone from 190 to 300.

368
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,257
How's her gases?

369
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,759
Much better.

370
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,861
Sandy, you are doing great.

371
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:42,213
She's going to need an
appointment with your doctor.

372
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,632
She's also going to need an
inhaler at home, and a medication

373
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:47,151
called Prednisone.

374
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,320
So you fill this
thing out tonight.

375
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,455
Hospital pharmacy
is open 24 hours,

376
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,174
and it's on the first floor.

377
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:55,976
Okay? There you go.

378
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,950
<i>Thought you were off at 10:00.</i>

379
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,646
I'm on all night.

380
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,248
What are you still doing here?

381
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,738
I'm on a double.

382
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,240
Oh, thank you.

383
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,810
Why is Mark getting messages
from the university hospital

384
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,311
in Milwaukee?

385
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,492
His wife wants to move.
She got a job up there.

386
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,682
Is he going to do it?

387
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,217
I hope not.

388
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,636
Can't imagine he'd
be happy there.

389
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,557
Doesn't he ever go home?

390
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,976
He's waiting for that
gang girl to come

391
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,662
out of recovery.

392
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,997
What's he doing?

393
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,043
Practicing one-handed knots.

394
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,367
He'd do it

395
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,497
with his teeth if he could.

396
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,005
No, I wouldn't. You can't
wear a glove on your teeth.

397
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,109
What are you listening to?

398
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,311
Snoop Doggy Dogg.

399
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,317
<i>Trends in Cardiac
Surgery, Volume 2.</i>

400
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:04,278
Blood pressure's
falling... 80/60.

401
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:07,281
Add a Dobutamine
drip, 250 in 250.

402
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:09,951
4cc's a minute.

403
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,953
I feel crummy...

404
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,632
waiting around for a kid

405
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,122
to smash up his car

406
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,802
so you can get his heart.

407
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:18,960
We're getting great pictures.

408
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:22,115
Frame one for me, will you?

409
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:27,501
How's<i> your</i> heart?

410
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,514
It's in pretty good shape.

411
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:33,975
Want to lend it to
me for the weekend?

412
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,126
Nah.

413
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,330
You got better
things to do with it.

414
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,998
Do them all.

415
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,184
You never know when
you'll get the chance.

416
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,420
Left ventricle, please.

417
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,808
You got kids, Doc?

418
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,403
A daughter. She's five.

419
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,998
My girl's nine.

420
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:04,571
At her age, I... I
shouldn't really travel.

421
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,762
I miss too much of her life.

422
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,915
But what can I say?

423
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,136
I love the job.

424
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,855
How you doing, Mr. Gasner?

425
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,391
To tell you the truth,

426
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:26,210
I felt a hell of a lot
better yesterday.

427
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,897
What's your wife do, Doc?

428
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:31,598
She's a lawyer.

429
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,718
You guys must
have your hands full.

430
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,750
Did I get any tests back?

431
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:39,740
On who?

432
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,242
A patient.

433
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:43,244
Figured that. Does the
patient have a name?

434
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,246
Yeah. It's Carter.

435
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:47,081
I'll watch out for them.

436
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,094
Thanks. And, Jerry, don't
tell anybody the results.

437
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,717
"Secret's" my middle name.

438
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,686
Gasner, Samuel. We called it in.

439
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,922
Look, it doesn't
have to be perfect.

440
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,423
We'll take any heart.

441
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,925
Anything?

442
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,426
Type "A" blood.

443
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:01,639
Negative T-cells
crossmatch, okay?

444
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,342
All right. Keep us posted.

445
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,110
We<i> need</i> a heart. Thank you.

446
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:06,600
He's getting weaker.

447
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,936
I can't pull a heart
out of thin air.

448
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,782
Peter, gunshot
wound to the foot.

449
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,572
The liquor store guy again.

450
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:13,941
He's asking for you.

451
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:15,575
Ivan? What does he do,

452
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:17,828
wear a sign that
says, "Shoot me"?

453
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,766
That hurts.

454
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,386
Ivan, Ivan, Ivan,
who did it this time?

455
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:28,556
Thought you didn't
have a gun. Me. I did it

456
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,091
I could not take no more.

457
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,491
Bought a little Glock.

458
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,826
Oh, God, it hurts.

459
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,746
Let's get a gram of Ancef
and 150 Gentamicin I.V.

460
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,081
Book an O.R.

461
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,416
Last BP'S a little
high... 180/110.

462
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,752
All right. Ten
Procardia sublingual.

463
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,870
In Russia, it's crazy.

464
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:44,883
You need case of
vodka to get good doctor.

465
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,390
God bless America.

466
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,126
Yeah, well, God didn't
bless your neighborhood.

467
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,257
I was showing the gun to Nicky,

468
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:52,591
the dry cleaner, and bang!

469
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:53,926
Off went half your toe.

470
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,332
I'm going to lose it?

471
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,512
You already did.

472
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,153
Let's go.

473
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,905
<i>Still can't find a donor.</i>

474
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,976
There's one in Cincinnati,
but the blood type is "AB."

475
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,545
How hard is it to
find a type "A" heart?

476
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,647
The patient has advanced
dilated cardiomyopathy

477
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,863
with severe mitral regurgitation
and an ejection fraction

478
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,519
of less than ten percent.

479
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,239
This is not the best
news I've heard all day.

480
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:20,508
So, Steve, do you
have an opinion?

481
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:23,405
Dr. Kayson and I
agree on very little,

482
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,013
but we're both happy
not to be Mr. Gasner.

483
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,464
What if we take him upstairs,

484
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,966
put him on a heart-lung bypass

485
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,568
while we look for another donor?

486
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,236
With no muscle left,
I'd say the stress alone

487
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,450
would kill him in
a couple of hours.

488
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,452
I put the transplant
team on call.

489
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,387
You get a heart, we'll put him

490
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,156
on the table in 20 minutes.

491
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,280
Mr. Gasner's wife's on a plane.

492
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,166
She'll be here around 3:00.

493
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,362
Somebody's going to have

494
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,587
to tell them.

495
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,697
Have the desk beep
me when she gets here.

496
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,328
Oh!

497
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,597
Hey, Carter.

498
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,866
Bend over.

499
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:19,967
There we go.

500
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,471
Oh, I'm cooking now!

501
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:26,023
All right. Hold still.

502
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,157
Oh! Good one.

503
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,859
Carter, what is he doing?

504
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,144
I lost a bet.

505
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,712
He's my backboard.

506
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:34,882
Mark,

507
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:35,949
I'm on a roll here.

508
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,384
Here we go. And the shot!

509
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,552
Oh!

510
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,604
You ruined my concentration.

511
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:43,124
Oh! Two.

512
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,274
Dr. Ross?

513
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,259
Yeah.

514
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:46,961
Baby in four.

515
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,033
Seven inches taller,

516
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:55,386
I would have been a contender.

517
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,754
The Bulls, the Knicks.

518
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,873
Any luck with that heart?

519
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:01,509
No.

520
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:15,622
I, uh... I heard your wife
got a job in Milwaukee.

521
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:16,723
Yeah.

522
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,209
She's clerking
for a federal judge.

523
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,381
That sounds exciting.

524
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,948
It is.

525
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:27,801
Are you going to
leave the hospital?

526
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:33,807
I... I don't know.

527
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,993
I thought you were

528
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,310
off at midnight.

529
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:38,812
Uh... yeah.

530
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:40,480
Um... yeah, I am.

531
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:43,601
I just, uh... I just
thought I'd stick around.

532
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,604
You ever have one
like Mr. Gasner before...

533
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,505
One that took so long?

534
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,807
No.

535
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,465
You look like hell, Carter.

536
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,538
Yeah. I'm just waiting
for Dr. Benton to leave.

537
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,375
Mm-hmm. You need some sleep.

538
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,915
Oh, that hurt.

539
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:19,219
Hmm... well, you've taken
a bad fall, Mrs. Fadem.

540
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,323
I'm going to have
to get some X rays.

541
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:24,574
No... no X rays.

542
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,277
They'll hurt my baby.

543
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:29,446
And how long have
you been pregnant?

544
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,782
Six months now.

545
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,817
Well, suppose I promise

546
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,287
that your baby
will be protected.

547
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:40,291
We'll shield you with lead,
and we'll use a real low dose.

548
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:45,462
Just as long as you
promise not to hurt my baby.

549
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,264
I promise.

550
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,239
Lydia, would you mind taking
Mrs. Fadem to Radiology?

551
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,808
Oh, and be careful
of her pregnancy.

552
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,143
Right away.

553
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,245
Her what?

554
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,746
Pregnancy.

555
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,413
You worry too much.

556
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,904
Kayson hates me.

557
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,438
He's a cardiologist.

558
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,706
He's on my review board.

559
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:14,207
I'll need his recommendation.

560
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,353
Why would you want it?

561
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:17,238
The man loses so many patients,

562
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,691
he gets endorsements
from funeral homes.

563
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:20,514
Div!

564
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,232
When I was your age,

565
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,447
I worried about what every
attending thought of me, too.

566
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,565
Forget it. You're a good doctor.

567
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:28,966
You're better than my ex,

568
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,502
and I actually married her.

569
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:33,227
Div, there are a lot of
subjects that interest me

570
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:35,729
and, believe me, your
ex-wife<i> tops</i> my list.

571
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,799
Ah! That's me.

572
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,736
My knife-wielding psychotic
must be up from his nap.

573
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:46,907
Later.

574
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,864
Your wife's on her way.

575
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,667
She'll be a wreck.

576
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,936
He's not putting out fluids.

577
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,273
160 of Lasix.

578
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,210
Hey, Doc...

579
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,011
do I look stupid?

580
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,664
Why don't you tell me?

581
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,667
You versus God...

582
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,669
We know who wins.

583
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,171
I don't think of it that way.

584
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:22,809
Yeah? You don't have to.

585
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:25,513
I'm the one on the table.

586
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,171
We looked at your echo

587
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,373
and, if we don't
find a donor heart,

588
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:40,544
you probably won't make it
through the night, Mr. Gasner.

589
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,388
It's 2:00 in the morning.

590
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:52,923
I'm dying.

591
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,859
So, please...

592
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,563
call me Sam.

593
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,736
This is no time to be formal.

594
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:20,200
Don't forget to check
on Ivan before you go.

595
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:22,536
Can I take the Suarez girl now?

596
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:24,004
The gangbanger?

597
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,216
Aortic rupture.

598
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,807
I forgot to tell you.

599
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,308
She died in recovery.

600
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:29,343
Ah. Well...

601
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:31,145
I'll see you at 7:00.

602
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,479
A.M.? That's five hours.

603
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:34,114
Why bother driving home?

604
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,750
Three hours sleep,
I get to come back.

605
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:39,787
Quinn, Daniel. Hypotensive...
80/70, comatose.

606
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:42,200
Fraternity kid.
Drinking all night.

607
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:44,057
Ever see anybody intubated?

608
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:46,192
Uh... no.

609
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,728
Get Respiratory in here.

610
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:49,530
Carter, set a second line.

611
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:51,531
D-50, one amp, 2
milligrams Narcan.

612
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:53,333
Pam, get an EKG.

613
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:54,668
Mr. Quinn,

614
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:57,304
do you hear me? Daniel?

615
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,323
Respiratory's on the way.

616
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,224
He's cyanotic.
Speed up the drip.

617
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,554
Add dopamine.
Hyperventilate him.

618
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:03,910
Line's in, Susan.

619
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:05,496
BP is 70/40 and falling.

620
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,264
Get a CBC, blood alcohol,
Chem seven and tox screen.

621
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,265
Let's tube him.

622
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,400
Blood SAT's 80.

623
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,002
Do a dextrose stick.

624
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,002
Okay, Carter,

625
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,271
pay attention.

626
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,140
This is where it counts.

627
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,907
Visualize the cords.

628
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,493
You don't want
to miss the trachea

629
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:23,030
and end up in his esophagus.

630
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:25,866
Okay.

631
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:28,668
It's in.

632
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:30,938
Bag him.

633
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,439
Listen to the lungs

634
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:33,690
and the abdomen

635
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,403
to make sure the
tube's in place.

636
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,793
Glucose is normal.

637
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,129
BP is steady, 80/65.

638
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,564
That's nice.

639
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,215
Draw a blood gas now.

640
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,501
Doug, they called from Neonatal

641
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,126
if you want to take a look
at the Neimeyer preemie.

642
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:54,473
He's going to be okay.

643
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:56,129
God smiled on him.

644
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,643
Since when do
you believe in God?

645
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:00,967
I've been contemplating my
insignificance in the universe.

646
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:03,882
I thought you were the
center of the universe.

647
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,205
Not always.

648
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,474
Are you a doctor? I'm
looking for Dr. Ross.

649
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,942
He's in the emergency room.

650
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:10,444
Yeah. I'm Dr. Ross.

651
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,779
Thank you very much!

652
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,497
I can't thank you enough.

653
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,265
You're welcome.

654
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,367
Who are you?

655
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:20,053
Oh, I'm Randy Neimeyer...

656
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:21,971
My wife, my baby.

657
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,002
They said you took her up.

658
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:26,354
My little boy's
going to be okay.

659
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,261
In fact, I'm just on my way up

660
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:30,063
to see your baby right now.

661
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,298
You want to...?

662
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,565
Yeah, yeah.

663
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:33,766
Okay.

664
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:36,936
Yeah.

665
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,407
We're hydrating like crazy,

666
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:42,876
and his blood
pressure's not moving.

667
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,112
Order LFTs, B.U.N.
and creatinine.

668
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:47,981
His friend's here.

669
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:50,517
He says the guy didn't
have that much to drink.

670
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,153
Yeah, and the Cubs are
a shoo-in for the pennant.

671
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:54,988
This is Elliot.
This is Dr. Lewis.

672
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:56,935
Can you tell me how much
Mr. Quinn drank tonight?

673
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,986
We were playing this
game... Whale's Tales.

674
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,555
You say numbers
around the table.

675
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,812
If you can't remember
them, you<i> have</i> to drink.

676
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,364
How much did Mr. Quinn drink?

677
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,566
Listen, his father's
an assistant dean.

678
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,301
If he finds out about...

679
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:10,003
What was he drinking,

680
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,271
and how much?

681
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:13,189
Beer.

682
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,109
Beer and shots of tequila.

683
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:18,512
He must have had 15, 20 shots.

684
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:21,615
Did he do any drugs? No.

685
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,400
Will he be all right?

686
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,715
I hope so.

687
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,802
Blood alcohol's back... 832.

688
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:31,942
Call dialysis.

689
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,344
Let them know we're on the way.

690
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,813
Let's move him.

691
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,785
Mrs. Gasner.

692
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,221
I'm Elaine Gasner.

693
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,788
This is Sarah.

694
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:46,923
Hi, Sarah.

695
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,291
I'm Dr. Greene.

696
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,596
Sit down, honey.

697
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,368
Where's my husband?

698
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,769
Can I see him?

699
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,021
He's sleeping.

700
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:05,792
I need to tell you
about his condition.

701
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,795
His heart muscle is
badly deteriorated.

702
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,598
They said he could
get a transplant.

703
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:13,784
If there was one available.

704
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,618
There isn't one tonight.

705
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,671
He can wait

706
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:19,817
till they find one.

707
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,258
Your husband's heart is failing.

708
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,663
Unless we find a heart donor

709
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:31,017
in the next couple of hours,
I don't believe he'll make it

710
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:32,719
through the night.

711
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,556
I'm sorry.

712
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,033
Sam?

713
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,786
Mark.

714
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:07,866
Your wife

715
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,690
and daughter are here.

716
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,858
I was thinking.

717
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,064
Did you hear the one...

718
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,733
about the guy on
the country road?

719
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,905
Flat tire...

720
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:28,675
doesn't have a jack.

721
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:37,284
Never mind.

722
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,256
You think you can avoid it.

723
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,709
It all counts.

724
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,913
Decisions you don't make.

725
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,151
The real joke is...

726
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:00,090
I'm still going to die.

727
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,929
I guess I'm
getting ready for it.

728
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:15,655
I'm not ready.

729
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,092
Damn it, I'm not!

730
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:24,014
I don't want to leave them.

731
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,652
Sarah needs me.

732
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:55,494
Could you please have
my wife bring Sarah in?

733
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,380
Sure.

734
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,677
Don't say it.

735
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:12,212
What?

736
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:17,328
That I should be
grateful to be alive.

737
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,253
That's not what I was thinking.

738
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:24,557
What<i> were</i> you thinking?

739
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,395
I don't know.

740
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,653
Is there any chance?

741
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:44,911
Type "A", negative
crossmatch, 43 years old.

742
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:47,580
He can handle the surgery.

743
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,595
It just seems that
marriage should be easier.

744
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:52,585
I never heard it called easy.

745
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:54,432
Sometimes I think we did it

746
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:56,601
just to make our parents happy.

747
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,609
You're good at
making people happy.

748
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,943
Not this week.

749
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,912
What?

750
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,892
Well, how soon will you know?

751
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,794
19-Year-old, flatline EEG.

752
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,258
They can't find the
parents to sign a release.

753
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,774
So, what are you going
to do about Milwaukee?

754
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:17,777
I can be a junior resident
at a suburban hospital.

755
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:22,098
That would do
wonders for your career.

756
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,784
It all counts.

757
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,636
What?

758
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,954
Nothing.

759
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:30,957
Oh, Susan, your dialysis
kid's coming around.

760
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:32,976
Good.

761
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,536
Well, can you keep trying?

762
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:45,105
Yeah, I need that heart.

763
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,806
Thanks.

764
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:52,857
Jerry, can you do me a favor

765
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:56,194
and get a hotel for Mrs.
Gasner and her daughter?

766
00:33:56,218 --> 00:33:57,516
Sure.

767
00:33:57,552 --> 00:34:00,486
You okay, Dr. Greene?

768
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:03,422
I'm fine, Jerry. Thanks.

769
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,428
Dr. Ross?

770
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,832
Lydia, what is a
seven-letter word for "dumb"

771
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:14,951
beginning with an "M"?

772
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,403
Moronic.

773
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:18,288
Your asthma patient's back.

774
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,145
She tried to sleep.

775
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,479
Where's the inhaler?

776
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:27,814
I'll check the dose.

777
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:29,149
I didn't get it.

778
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:31,551
Your daughter's
having another attack.

779
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:34,154
I told you to fill out
that prescription<i> tonight.</i>

780
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:35,488
She could have died.

781
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:36,823
You understand that?

782
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:38,491
The medicine cost $30.

783
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:40,160
I don't have the money,

784
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,862
and Medicaid don't come
through for another week.

785
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,369
I'll be back.

786
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,093
Carol, do we have
a spare inhaler?

787
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,428
Just the one.

788
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,958
If he's that bad,
he should come in.

789
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:02,265
What about Proventil samples?

790
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,850
Nope.

791
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,869
We can't diagnose
over the phone.

792
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,204
If that's what you want to do.

793
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,539
Thank you.

794
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,140
Prednisone... any of that?

795
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,459
Plenty. It's on the top shelf.

796
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:16,474
It's going to take
more than this

797
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:17,976
to get her through the week.

798
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,699
You seem awfully interested.

799
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:21,234
She must be very pretty.

800
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:23,069
She's 12.

801
00:35:23,105 --> 00:35:25,772
I'll see what
else I can turn up.

802
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,909
Jerry, I don't get it.

803
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:32,245
I sent that gram stain ages ago,

804
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,247
and it's not back yet?

805
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,927
Who was that for again?

806
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:37,250
Mine. For me.

807
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:38,584
Ah, yes.

808
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,253
Came in about 3:00.

809
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:41,921
Where is it, Jerry?

810
00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:44,323
Bulletin board.

811
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,095
Excuse me.

812
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:51,064
Excuse me.

813
00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,450
You got to do something.

814
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,458
I feel like I'm going

815
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,493
to throw up.

816
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,564
Well, we wouldn't want that.

817
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,265
Not here in the hall.

818
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,069
Come with me.

819
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,604
Hi, John.

820
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:36,325
Hi, puppy.

821
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,322
You're up pretty late.

822
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:40,457
I fell asleep on the plane.

823
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,465
Did you have fun

824
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,117
with Grandma?

825
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:47,287
She gave me a present.

826
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:49,289
Blood SAT's 80%.

827
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:50,623
15 liters O-2.

828
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,904
What did you get?

829
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:56,229
A diary.

830
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:59,082
Grandma made the cover herself.

831
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:02,635
Grandma likes to
make things for you.

832
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,014
My mom says my
dad's going to die.

833
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,285
Yes, he is.

834
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,424
Why can't you fix him?

835
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:04,997
We can't fix everything.

836
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,325
I can breathe now.

837
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,494
We don't have a spare inhaler.

838
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:18,889
Take the Prednisone every day,

839
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:21,347
and you visit the clinic
first thing in the morning.

840
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,760
Tomorrow? I can't go tomorrow.

841
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:24,378
Well, you have
to. It's important.

842
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,629
I got to go to work.

843
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,214
It's only my second week.

844
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,621
Dr. Ross?

845
00:38:28,657 --> 00:38:31,290
There's a kid
throwing up in three.

846
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:33,876
Okay. You're going to
have to take off work.

847
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:34,860
I can't.

848
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,479
Your daughter has to have

849
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,199
the medication. It
has to be done. Okay?

850
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,550
So do it.

851
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:54,247
I know...

852
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,048
I know.

853
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:01,754
I forgot a long time ago.

854
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,498
I was always sure of you.

855
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:15,535
You never let me down.

856
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:19,905
Sam? Sam!

857
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,241
Sam?

858
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:24,222
Please! Please, I have
to tell him one more thing.

859
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:27,012
You have to make him hear me!

860
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:28,948
Sam?

861
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:32,669
Elaine...

862
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,738
Forever, honey.

863
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,473
Forever.

864
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,209
Sarah will be fine.

865
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,948
Remind her I love her.

866
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:51,954
Sam! Sam. Sam...

867
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,324
Mr. Quinn?

868
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,295
Daniel?

869
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,698
I'm Dr. Lewis.

870
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,135
You're on dialysis because
you drank too much.

871
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:10,173
Would you blink if
you understand me?

872
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:14,443
We'll be taking that tube
out of your windpipe soon.

873
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,279
Your kidneys are functioning,

874
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:17,946
your liver's fine,

875
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,583
and you lost a few
million brain cells,

876
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,251
but you can spare them.

877
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,620
Blink if you will
never do this again.

878
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:56,536
Playing one-on-one
against yourself

879
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:57,971
is the easy way.

880
00:40:58,006 --> 00:41:00,039
Here you go.

881
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:01,340
Come on.

882
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,009
Come on, you wussy!

883
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,410
Get by me.

884
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:05,745
I'm the short guy.

885
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,781
But you said you could
have been a contender.

886
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,620
You distracted me.

887
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:15,555
It's the game.

888
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,056
What do you want?

889
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,803
Can I borrow 40 bucks?

890
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:20,793
For what?

891
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:23,149
I got to run an errand.

892
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:29,935
Thank you, sir.

893
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:51,774
Go home, Mark.

894
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:04,346
This will get your daughter
through the next three weeks.

895
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,416
Make sure that she uses
the inhaler every day,

896
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,419
and bring her back if
she's not feeling better.

897
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,822
You bought this yourself.

898
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:21,981
I'll get her to the
clinic, I promise.

899
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,733
Thank you.

900
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,001
You're welcome.

901
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:49,509
Honey...

902
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,176
Hi.

903
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,178
What time is it?

904
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,914
It's 7:30.

905
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:00,352
I was thinking about Milwaukee.

906
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,189
And... I know it will be hard.

907
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,370
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

908
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,461
But, if you want me to go...

909
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:11,497
I'll go.

910
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,871
I'll go.

911
00:44:22,176 --> 00:44:25,711
No. You'd hate it.

912
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:28,313
It's not a big deal.

913
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:30,669
It's only two hours away.

914
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,590
I love you.

915
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,227
Love you, too.

916
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,979
Daddy, you're home!

917
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,268
Hi, sweetheart.

918
00:44:49,303 --> 00:44:50,803
Come on in.

919
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,207
Come here.

920
00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:57,243
Hi.

921
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,382
I am so glad to see you.

922
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:04,684
Daddy, what's wrong?

923
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,454
Nothing's wrong.

924
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,096
Nothing's wrong.

925
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:24,437
Nothing's wrong, okay?
