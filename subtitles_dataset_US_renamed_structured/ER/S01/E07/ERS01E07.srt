1
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,413
Coming through.

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,217
Thank you.

3
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:21,953
Oh, what a day.

4
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,455
E.R.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,124
Yes, I know they're
late, but I can't...

6
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,092
Okay, okay. I'm on my way.

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,495
They're on their way up. Ta-da!

8
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:53,935
Hello.

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,706
No, this isn't E.R.

10
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,375
This is Patrick.

11
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:02,744
<i>¿Habla Espanol?</i>

12
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,332
'Kay. Bye-bye.

13
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,982
Are you the new desk clerk?

14
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,639
<i>Si, senorita.</i>

15
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,973
Yeah, right.

16
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,609
Um... who are you?

17
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,676
Patrick.

18
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,895
Okay, Patrick,
where is everybody?

19
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,618
My dad went to the bathroom.

20
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,587
You need to go sit over here

21
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,184
because you can't sit here.

22
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,274
Patrick...

23
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,009
Patrick, don't turn.

24
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:36,189
Don't...

25
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:37,729
Whoa!

26
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,133
Hi. This is John Carter.

27
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,802
I'm calling about your ad about
the one-bedroom apartment.

28
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:44,970
Got anything to eat?

29
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,037
Thanks.

30
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,038
I'm sorry?

31
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,106
Perfect. Taken.

32
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,340
Okay. Thank you.

33
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,541
I'm starved.

34
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,643
Mr. Carter?

35
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,623
Where did these come from?

36
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,147
Taglieri.

37
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,582
Brought them for
Carol Hathaway, I think.

38
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:04,506
There's a woman
in the suture room

39
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,208
who needs stitches in her face.

40
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,577
The plastic surgery
boys are there already.

41
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:10,078
Why don't you bat clean-up.

42
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,279
Give her a really good scar.

43
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:12,614
Just kidding.

44
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:13,893
Peter, E.M.T.'s at the back door

45
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:15,328
with a 20-year-old
stabbing victim.

46
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,318
Doesn't sound good.

47
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:17,652
All right, notify the O.R.

48
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:18,786
Call the blood bank.

49
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,955
Tell them I need
eight units O-neg now!

50
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,968
Still doing the total
gastrectomy this afternoon?

51
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:25,460
I can't. I've got an interview
with Morgenstern and Bradley.

52
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:26,539
Starzl Fellowship?

53
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,196
Yep.

54
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,965
Did Langworthy say only
third-year residents get it?

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,144
In her dreams. Exactly.

56
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,080
Tell Morgenstern to
meet me in Trauma Two.

57
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:35,237
What have we got?

58
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:36,605
Stab wounds to the neck.

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,740
Pulse 150 and
thready. B.P.'S 50 palp.

60
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,841
Uh-huh. What else?

61
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,909
Couldn't tube him.
Too much blood.

62
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:44,329
This guy's circling the drain.

63
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,708
That's what I love about you.

64
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,031
You're all optimism.

65
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:47,966
Let's take the turn.

66
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,078
Let's get him down here.

67
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,112
Let's move it, people.

68
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,147
Get him in Trauma Two.

69
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,036
Let's not lose him.

70
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,972
Here we go. Follow me.

71
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,557
Dust me. Come on.

72
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,396
All right, unstrap him.

73
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,898
Let's move it.

74
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,300
If we don't need
it, let's lose it.

75
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:07,636
We'll do this like
we always do it.

76
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:09,972
We're going to do
this on my count.

77
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:12,307
One, two, three!

78
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:14,042
All right, let's go to work.

79
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:15,176
Pulse ox?

80
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:17,212
It's only 70, and he's cyanotic.

81
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,114
All right. Let's go.

82
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,582
Here we are.

83
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,168
No airway.

84
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,020
Intubation tray. Move.

85
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,055
7½?

86
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,423
Yes.

87
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,663
Cranks.

88
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:37,165
Come on. Come on.

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,668
I can't see anything
in here.<i> Suction!</i>

90
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:41,603
Come on, I need some suction.

91
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,037
Let's get it in here.

92
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,606
We got a full-out gusher here.

93
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,642
One more minute, he's
going to have brain damage.

94
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:48,860
Let's do a crike.

95
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,694
You sure?

96
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,212
As the day is long. Let's move.

97
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,659
Doing a surgical airway here.

98
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,360
All right, now give
me the numbers.

99
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:55,617
Nice and loud, all right?

100
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,687
B.P. still 60/40.

101
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,021
Pulse, 160.

102
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,523
All right. Trach tube.

103
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:02,936
Thank you, darling.

104
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,359
Syringe.

105
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,294
Come on, honey.

106
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,655
See what we got here.

107
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,623
Uh-huh.

108
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:24,613
I like the way it sounds.

109
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:25,947
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

110
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:27,716
I believe we have
ourselves a breather here.

111
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:30,768
Welcome back, sir.

112
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,103
Can you ventilate him?

113
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,337
Good morning, Peter.

114
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,238
Breathing easy.

115
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,373
What have you got?

116
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,908
A stab wound to the neck.

117
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,976
Unable to intubate
due to bleeding.

118
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,945
Performed a stat
crichothyrotomy.

119
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,113
Airway established,

120
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,782
good bilateral breath sounds,

121
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,149
and patient is stable.

122
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,218
What do you need me for?

123
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,987
Let's get him up to the O.R.

124
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,306
Peter...

125
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,290
excellent.

126
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,692
Excellent work.

127
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:55,794
Sound judgment.

128
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,095
A solid execution.

129
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,279
Excellent.

130
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,515
So, I'll see you at
the Starzl interview

131
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,833
this afternoon.

132
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,419
Right.

133
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:07,873
Pretty cool.

134
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,261
E.R.

135
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,397
Yeah, hold on.

136
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,165
Carter, phone for you.

137
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,967
For me?

138
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,973
Thanks, Jerry.

139
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,776
Hello.

140
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:22,013
Yes, yes, yes. I did call
about the one-bedroom.

141
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,292
No, really?

142
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,361
What about the studio?

143
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,652
Garage?

144
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:31,456
No, I don't think I
want a gara... hello?

145
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,291
Hello?

146
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,960
That's good, huh?

147
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,427
Looking for an apartment?

148
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,174
Yeah. I've been living at home,

149
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,210
and my dad thinks
I'm a freeloader.

150
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,466
Mine did, too.

151
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,479
Finally found my own
place about six months ago.

152
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,814
Yeah? Through the paper?

153
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,471
No, no. Through a patient.

154
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,006
85-Year-old guy
has a heart attack.

155
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,675
He crumped, I jumped.

156
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,427
What are you saying, Jerry?

157
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,762
That he died, and...

158
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:55,263
Dr. Benton?

159
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,249
Dr. Morgenstern called,
and he wanted me to tell you

160
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,252
that your "stertzle"...?

161
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,253
Starzl.

162
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,720
Yeah. The interview's

163
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,038
been pushed to 3:00.

164
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,525
Oh, man... Sh...

165
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,227
Boy with a laceration in One.

166
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,757
Carter's having a light day.

167
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,008
Let him take it.

168
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,199
No. I'd rather you do it.

169
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,258
Carter, see the kid in One.

170
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:26,306
I've got to get up to
Recovery to see a patient.

171
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,762
Oh, Carter.

172
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:30,282
96-Year-old stroke victim
in Curtain Area Three.

173
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,716
Might want to check it out.

174
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,979
Check it out?

175
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:36,805
Yeah. He lives at 1680
North Lake Shore Drive.

176
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Great location.

177
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,057
More sleep.

178
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,947
More sleep.

179
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,551
Say it ain't so, Joe.

180
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:50,985
It ain't so, Joe.

181
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,555
Oh, God. It's 7:00.

182
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,624
My shift starts
in a half an hour.

183
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,293
You're going to be late.

184
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:59,627
I am?

185
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:02,163
Mm-hmm. I called the hospital

186
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,799
and told them you were too busy

187
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,068
having sex with your wife.

188
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,006
And you want me to make
an honest woman of you?

189
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,041
Yes.

190
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,864
Okay, that takes
care of the cut.

191
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,532
I fell off a ladder.

192
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,367
Yeah, I know.

193
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,403
Let's check your elbow.

194
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:29,957
I fell off a stool, but I
didn't hurt my head.

195
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:32,059
It stays on.

196
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,394
See?

197
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,229
Go like this.

198
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,717
Oh, knock, knock.

199
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:40,584
Who's there?

200
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,203
Patrick.

201
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,087
Patrick who?

202
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,407
Me... Patrick.

203
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,876
Okay, I think
it's probably fine.

204
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:50,512
But, just to be sure,

205
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:53,581
I'm going to have
someone take an X ray.

206
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,333
X ray?

207
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,935
It's like a picture.

208
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,015
A photograph of your bones.

209
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,008
Ooh. Can... can I keep it?

210
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,325
Sure.

211
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,279
Oh, thank you.

212
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,199
You're welcome, Patrick.

213
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,387
Okay, I'll be back to
check on you, okay?

214
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,818
Take him up to X ray.

215
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:19,974
Sweet kid.

216
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:21,342
Yeah. Sometimes I think

217
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:23,611
I should be going
out with the patients

218
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,012
instead of the doctors.

219
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:26,981
Doctors... I don't know.

220
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,316
Shrinks aren't so bad.

221
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,818
So the rumors are true.

222
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,052
What rumors?

223
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:33,165
That you've been
going out with Div Cvetic.

224
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,489
Oh, just now and then.

225
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:35,735
Oh, geez. For two months.

226
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,570
What? Was it
supposed to be a secret?

227
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,672
You've been having
lunch with him every day.

228
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,541
Malik, did you get
those blood samples

229
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:42,675
from the lady in Five?

230
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:43,765
Already at the lab.

231
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,366
Great. Thanks.

232
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,246
So everyone knows? Knows what?

233
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,497
That it's your birthday today,

234
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,132
he's taking you out
for dinner tonight,

235
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,767
and asked you to
wear that black dress?

236
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,442
Oh, my God! What did he
do, put it in the newsletter?

237
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:56,077
The bulletin board.

238
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,096
Just kidding.

239
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,432
I will kill him.

240
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:05,103
After dinner.

241
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,549
Jerry, you got anything to eat?

242
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,706
Bagels in the lounge.

243
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,208
Never mind.

244
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,937
Did Linda Farrell come by yet?

245
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:14,045
Linda Farrell of
the pepperoni pizza,

246
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,346
Armani suit,

247
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,331
Novell Pharmaceuticals?

248
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,265
Yes, Jerry.

249
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,217
Haven't seen her.

250
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,991
I'm a little confused.

251
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,626
Is "Slice" your first name

252
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,895
or your middle name?

253
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,391
"Slice" is his street name.

254
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:35,716
Right. "Street name."

255
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,718
And how did this happen?

256
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,570
Cops beat me up.

257
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,333
He put his foot
through a window.

258
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:42,657
Breaking and entering.

259
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:45,326
Hey, who's the nurse
on the phone out there?

260
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,394
That's Nurse Wright.

261
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,996
Lydia Wright.

262
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:49,275
She married?

263
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,499
I have no idea.

264
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:54,752
Okay, this is probably
going to sting a little bit.

265
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,020
What's that?

266
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,139
Oh, that's an EKG caliper.

267
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,626
We use it to measure the
distances on a cardiogram.

268
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,607
What you may not know, of
course, is that a cardiogram measures

269
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,275
the electrical
activity of the heart.

270
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,316
You probably shouldn't
be doing that. Uh...

271
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:18,387
Carter, can you
grab Lydia and Jerry

272
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,444
and meet me at
the ambulance bay.

273
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,512
You bet.

274
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,856
Radial head looks okay.

275
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,180
No fat pad sign.

276
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,260
I think he's in the clear. You?

277
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,128
E.M.T.'s pulling in right now.

278
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,263
Motorcycle versus semi.

279
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,420
Who's on?

280
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,621
Benton and Ross.

281
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:55,129
Surprise!

00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:59,300

I hate this.

289
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:21,906
That's why we did it.

290
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,907
Oh, thank you.

291
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:23,908
Happy birthday.

292
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:24,858
Oh, thank you.

293
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,411
Hey, Carol. Carol.

294
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,079
Happy birthday.

295
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,748
Thank you.

296
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,895
Thought maybe we'd crawl in here

297
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,763
and escape for an hour, huh?

298
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,755
What if they find us in a
compromising position? Then what?

299
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,758
Then how about a
more exotic locale?

300
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,793
I have seven minutes.

301
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,732
Don't know if "exotic"

302
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,835
is the word I would have picked.

303
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,438
I mean, look, we put
the pool in over there,

304
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,607
a little wet bar,
a putting green.

305
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,175
A putting green?

306
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,577
Hey, I'm a doctor.

307
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,078
Golf's an easy game.

308
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,848
I could teach you how
to play this afternoon.

309
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,761
I have to be back
in four minutes.

310
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,019
Maybe there's not
enough time for that.

311
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,921
'Course, if you
moved in with me,

312
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,889
there'd be more
than enough time.

313
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,509
Yeah, you mentioned
something about that.

314
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,461
Yeah, two weeks ago.

315
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,480
The silence of no answer
is getting a little deafening.

316
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:24,368
Oh, God, Tag... So much
has happened, you know?

317
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,471
I know. We've
gotten through that.

318
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,118
I just... I want to move
slowly, and feel sure.

319
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,276
About us.

320
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,178
About me.

321
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,481
I think we have moved slowly,

322
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,699
and I am sure about it all.

323
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,036
I'm a good guy,
Carol, and I love you.

324
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,171
If you have a problem

325
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:47,625
with our being together,
I need you to deal with it.

326
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,200
Knock, knock.

327
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,535
Was that Patrick?

328
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,471
Yeah. As a precaution,
Dr. Lewis has asked him

329
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:20,808
to sit in a wheelchair
until his father gets here.

330
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,477
Some precaution.

331
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:26,146
Ah. Linda Farrell.

332
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,148
Still haven't seen
her, Dr. Ross.

333
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,162
Jerry, do you like your job?

334
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:33,487
However, when I do, I
will certainly track you down

335
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:35,155
no matter where you are.

336
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:36,724
Well! And a good

337
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,693
late morning to you.

338
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:40,895
I had car trouble.

339
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,029
Mm-hmm.

340
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,914
I did. I had car trouble.

341
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,061
How<i> is</i> Jennifer, Mark?

342
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,385
She's, uh... she's great.

343
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,970
Yeah, I'll bet.

344
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,337
What's this for?

345
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:51,906
Later on tonight?

346
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,574
Keep it up.

347
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,129
She's adorable.

348
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,766
Yeah. She's almost 13 now.

349
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,819
Oh, and this
is... this is Ralph.

350
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:07,120
Have you ever seen
anything so cute?

351
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,290
Miniature schnauzers.

352
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,974
Very cute.

353
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,078
Is Mookie down here?

354
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,746
Carter's stitching him up.

355
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,548
Carter? Where's Benton?

356
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,883
Don't know.

357
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,969
That is one sorry paint job.

358
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,539
Yeah. That's because
the hospital likes

359
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:27,875
to save the big bucks
for those doctors' salaries.

360
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:29,543
Actually,

361
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,690
I'm not even
talking about myself

362
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,214
because I'm a resident.

363
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,177
So they don't pay me anything.

364
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,184
You're telling me you're
some kind of freebie?

365
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:39,319
Carter!

366
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,988
Where's Dr. Benton?

367
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,624
He's supposed to be
stitching up this boy.

368
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,776
Palm me off on the freebie?

369
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,228
Not one word out of
you, Mookie James.

370
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:50,765
You have done quite
enough for one day.

371
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,099
How do you two...?

372
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:53,434
Where is Benton?

373
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,447
He had to go to Recovery.

374
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,004
Son of a bitch!

375
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:03,043
You casually mentioned
our dinner to Doug Ross?

376
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:06,046
Yeah. Yeah. What's the problem?

377
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:09,049
He's like Dr. Intercom.

378
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:12,052
Biggest gossip in the hospital.

379
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:15,022
The cafeteria workers
probably know.

380
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,325
But you do look great
in that black dress.

381
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,327
This isn't working.

382
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:21,662
No?

383
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:22,996
No.

384
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,331
Dr. Cvetic?

385
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:25,844
The patient I
mentioned earlier...

386
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,167
He's right over here.

387
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:28,669
Three times, you mentioned him.

388
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:29,837
Three times, I told you

389
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,371
I didn't have time to see him.

390
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,706
What was your name?

391
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,725
Div...

392
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,275
Malik, why don't I just...?

393
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:37,244
Malik! That's right. Yeah.

394
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,314
I told you that three
times, too...<i> Div.</i>

395
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,682
Listen, son, you...

396
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:43,016
Okay, enough. Stop.

397
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:46,019
What are you guys going
to do now, arm wrestle?

398
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,354
No, of course not.

399
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,367
Look, I've had five
admissions today:

400
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,024
two attempted suicides,

401
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,626
two bipolars who forgot

402
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:55,896
to take their lithium,
and a 40-year-old

403
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,716
who walks in off the
street claiming to be dead...

404
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,034
All before lunch.

405
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:03,621
Now, your patient's
simply going to have to wait

406
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,656
for the afternoon shift.

407
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,560
Boat collision out on the lake.

408
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,897
12-year-old caught
in the wreckage.

409
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,220
How long?

410
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:20,399
E.M.T.'s pulling up now.

411
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:21,588
Connie, clear Trauma One.

412
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,990
Notify the O.R. now, please.

413
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,236
His parents are with him.

414
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,893
They hurt?

415
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:28,562
No. Thrown free. But
they came with him.

416
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,242
Oscar, what do you got?

417
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,233
David Adler, 12,
found unconscious.

418
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,734
Please help him.

419
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,816
I'm Dr. Ross. I'm going to
take your son to Trauma.

420
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,450
We'll do everything we can.

421
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,175
He went under so fast,
we couldn't find him.

422
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:42,376
B.P. 70, pulse 140.

423
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:44,806
Jerry will tell you
where you can wait.

424
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,464
Can't we stay with him?

425
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,677
We'll do everything we
possibly can, I promise.

426
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,301
Couldn't start
an I.V. or intubate

427
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,002
so we scooped and ran.

428
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,971
G.C.S 2-4-2.

429
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,406
Pupils mid-range and slagging.

430
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,185
Okay, all right, here
we go, get back.

431
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,443
On three. Hit that buckle.

432
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,010
One, two, three.

433
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,114
All right.

434
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,555
Airway?

435
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,457
You got it.

436
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,091
Hold that.

437
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,329
All right, now give me...

438
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,997
Six and a half.

439
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,365
Yeah.

440
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,870
All right, come on, buddy.

441
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,507
Okay.

442
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,442
Uh-huh.

443
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,051
His heart rate's low.

444
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,881
Give him atropine
and epinephrine.

445
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,205
O-negative's here.

446
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,573
You ordered it?

447
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:46,574
Yep.

448
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:47,874
Internal jugular?

449
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,376
Have to.

450
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,611
His peripheral
veins have collapsed.

451
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:54,167
All right, here we go.

452
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:03,507
Connie, will you move
those people out of the hall?

453
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,131
Perfect.

454
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,033
Yep.

455
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,197
Uh-huh.

456
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:31,985
Okay, here we go.

457
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:34,021
Yeah.

458
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:36,657
All right.

459
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,743
Here it comes.

460
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,045
Put it down.

461
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,049
All right, I think
we got this baby.

462
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,967
O.R.'S prepped.

463
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,519
They can X-ray
his C-spine upstairs.

464
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,205
Let's take him on up.

465
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,324
Paddles.

466
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,659
200?

467
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,260
Yep.

468
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,213
And clear.

469
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:00,364
Again.

470
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,682
300?

471
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,017
Yeah.

472
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:04,552
Clear.

473
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:05,803
Give me 360.

474
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:06,637
Charging.

475
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,038
And clear.

476
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:22,419
Okay, he's stabilized.

477
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,020
Let's go.

478
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,341
All right, people,
let's go. Come on.

479
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,998
He's going to need
at least six units.

480
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,367
We got him. Let's go.

481
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,302
Oh, man.

482
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,283
I think we may have
just pulled that one out.

483
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,440
Yes, we did.

484
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,786
That was like clockwork.

485
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,242
I wish they were all like that.

486
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,556
We haven't done a save
like that in a long time.

487
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,447
So smooth. Seven
minutes, door to door.

488
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,127
You were great. You anticipated
every move, every beat.

489
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,662
I mean it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:54,985
Yeah?

491
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,320
I do.

492
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,021
I do.

493
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,959
I do.

494
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,628
Carol, I'm sorry.

495
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,974
I shouldn't have done that.

496
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,331
Uh...

497
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,502
You didn't do it alone.

498
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:45,018
Listen. I got to go.

499
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,890
All right, Patrick.

500
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,625
You'll be all right.

501
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:56,480
Going home, Patrick?

502
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,965
<i>Si, senorita.</i>

503
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,333
His father's here.

504
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,435
And you're going to take it easy

505
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:04,071
for the next few days, right?

506
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:05,839
Pick a card...

507
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:07,291
any card.

508
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,599
Oh, pick a card, any card.

509
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,068
Here.

510
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,569
Thank you.

511
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,070
You're welcome.

512
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,372
Let's find your dad.

513
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,634
Let's go, Patrick.

514
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:25,559
Yay! Go home.

515
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,278
Go home?

516
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,680
Where am I going?

517
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,564
Uh... Doug, I've
got a three-year-old

518
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,134
with a fever in two, a
six-month-old in four.

519
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,183
His mother says he's not
keeping anything down.

520
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,589
Mm-hmm. Okay.
I'll be right there.

521
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,208
I'm sorry, Dr. Ross.

522
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,520
I still haven't seen her.

523
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,144
Seen who?

524
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,628
Linda Farrell.

525
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:03,497
Oh, right, Jerry.

526
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:05,266
Oh, okay. Thank you.

527
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,770
Michael Carson, age 35, victim

528
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,094
of a five-mile-an-hour
car accident

529
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,129
and not a scratch on him.

530
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,098
No clue why he's comatose.

531
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,966
Results of the C.T.?

532
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,670
Normal. No improvement
with glucose<i> and</i> Narcan.

533
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:28,606
Well, he's nonsurgical.

534
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,140
He's all yours.

535
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,043
The differential
diagnosis of coma, huh?

536
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,211
Good luck.

537
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,197
You, too... on your interview.

538
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:37,531
Yeah.

539
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,735
Well, let's see

540
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:43,781
what we can come up with.

541
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,925
I asked you to take that boy

542
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,393
with the laceration.

543
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,139
Why are you doing in here?

544
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,463
Why didn't you?

545
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,009
Because Carter could handle it.

546
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,143
What's the big problem?

547
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,668
The problem is I
asked<i> you</i> to treat him,

548
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,970
and hoped maybe
you'd talk to him.

549
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,384
I had a patient I had
to go see in Recovery.

550
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:03,641
Oh, the hell you did.

551
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,676
You just didn't
want to be involved.

552
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:06,955
Okay, whoa. Wait a minute.

553
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,073
What am I supposed to be,

554
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,774
the Big Brothers
program or something?

555
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:12,132
I'm supposed to turn every
gang kid that comes in here

556
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,662
into some kind of
Nelson Mandela?

557
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,919
I know you'd never
do that, Peter.

558
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,355
That's why I never
asked you before.

559
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,825
I've known Mookie since he was

560
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,095
four years old, and
he was a sweet kid.

561
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,632
And maybe someone
will get through to him,

562
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,301
and he will be that
again someday!

563
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,904
Probably wouldn't
be half as tough

564
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,973
as getting through to you!

565
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,957
What about metabolic causes...

566
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,659
Hypoglycemia,
diabetic ketoacidosis?

567
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,649
Blood tests rule that out.

568
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,686
It can't be
arrhythmia or an M.I.

569
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,955
Negative C.T. rules out
mass lesion and trauma.

570
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,523
Benton gave him Narcan?

571
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,270
And an amp of D-50.

572
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,626
The blood came back normal

573
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,496
except for a slightly
elevated white count.

574
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,725
Up to 14,500.

575
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,144
Pulse is slowing...
It's down to 50...

576
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,067
And his B.P.'S dropping.

577
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:06,220
All right. Well,
speed up the I.V.s

578
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,700
and give him 300cc
bolus of saline.

579
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,290
What about atropine?

580
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,859
Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:13,404
Point five, I.V. push.

582
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,996
Maybe he had a seizure.

583
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,831
Connie, get a temperature.

584
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,836
Mm-hmm. He's
got a slight abrasion

585
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:24,204
on his tongue,

586
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,117
probably from biting it.

587
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,509
Partially compensated
metabolic acidosis.

588
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:30,088
You see that with seizures.

589
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,112
101.5.

590
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,647
Meningitis?

591
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:35,149
Yeah, could be.

592
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:38,218
We're going to have
to do a lumbar puncture.

593
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:39,719
You ever done one?

594
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,633
No, but I've seen it done.

595
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:44,324
Mm-hmm. See one,
do one, teach one.

596
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,829
Okay.

597
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:08,515
Benton.

598
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,516
Hey, Sarah.

599
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:10,884
You changed clothes.

600
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:13,686
Uh... yeah.

601
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:14,954
Oh.

602
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,456
Who's in there now?

603
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,724
Dalton.

604
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,092
George Dalton?

605
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:20,327
Mm-hmm.

606
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:23,563
Guy can't close a door,
much less an incision.

607
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:25,843
Yeah. I once saw him try

608
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,668
to connect a ureter
to a sigmoid colon.

609
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:30,153
You think that's bad?

610
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,289
I watched him do a beautiful

611
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,158
right fem-pop bypass
on a femoral artery...

612
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,693
The<i> left</i> femoral artery.

613
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,840
Yeah, so what do you think

614
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,943
he said to the patient, huh?

615
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,428
"Sir, there's some good
news and some bad news."

616
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:46,703
"Sir, the operation
was a success."

617
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,306
"But it was the wrong leg."

618
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:57,030
That was terrific.

619
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,515
Thank you, Dr. Dalton.

620
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,150
It was good.

621
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,131
Dr. Benton, you
don't mind if we take

622
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,300
Dr. Langworthy first, do you?

623
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:08,269
She's scrubbing on
a small bowel at 4:30.

624
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,827
No, not at all.

625
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,073
You ready?

626
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,395
Yeah, sure.

627
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,563
Come on in.

628
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,709
Okay.

629
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,413
Insert it between L4 and L5.

630
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:23,257
Uh-huh.

631
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:24,969
Tilt it slightly upward

632
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:27,761
so it's parallel with the bed.

633
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:29,363
Okay.

634
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,309
Advance it slowly

635
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,245
between the vertebrae.

636
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:35,902
Then you'll feel a slight pop

637
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,616
when the tip punctures

638
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,040
the spinal canal.

639
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:44,210
I felt it.

640
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,424
Okay, you're not done yet.

641
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:47,992
Now remove the stylet

642
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,383
from the needle

643
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,938
and check for fluid.

644
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,358
Perfect. Bingo.

645
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:00,639
Perfect on the first shot.

646
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:02,574
Crystal clear, Mr. Carter.

647
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,644
That's one hell of
a champagne tap.

648
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,066
Champagne tap?

649
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,068
Perfect hit the first time.

650
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,071
Resident owes you a
bottle of champagne.

651
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,051
Not the resident. The nurse.

652
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:16,053
Dr. Greene, your
wife called and asked

653
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:18,111
if you could meet
her at Doc's at 4:00.

654
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:20,186
Okay. Thanks, Jerry.

655
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:42,636
Hi.

656
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:44,137
Hi.

657
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:46,306
Couldn't wait till tonight?

658
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:48,241
I wish.

659
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,973
Judge Franklin
called an hour ago.

660
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,475
He said my zoning opinion

661
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,377
wasn't quite what he'd hoped for

662
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,679
from a University
of Chicago graduate.

663
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,002
The guy's nuts.

664
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,365
He's an appellate judge, Mark.

665
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:01,855
So what?

666
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,224
It's the first thing
you've written.

667
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,859
What did he expect?

668
00:29:05,894 --> 00:29:09,730
Something better, which he's
personally going to lead me in

669
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:12,285
at tonight's 9:00 meeting.

670
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:14,218
I called my mom.

671
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,287
She's going to bring
Rachel up in the morning.

672
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,706
I'll have to use the car again.

673
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,074
That's all right.

674
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:23,476
I'll take the el. It's...

675
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,682
Jen, you'll do fine.

676
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:31,284
How do you know?

677
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,254
This is a
make-it-or-break-it job, Mark.

678
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,656
I mean, if I blow this chance...

679
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,579
I wanted to spend
the night with you.

680
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,933
Well, you'll be back Monday.

681
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:48,284
I can't.

682
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,971
Rachel's day care's having
a Halloween party Monday.

683
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,676
What about Tuesday?

684
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,293
I work Tuesday.

685
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,347
Well, maybe you can get off.

686
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,074
Jen, we're going to figure

687
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,542
this all out, okay?

688
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,612
It's just going to
take a little time.

689
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,482
I'll call you when
I get up there.

690
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:19,649
Okay.

691
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:20,917
Okay?

692
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,055
Yeah.

693
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,040
Well, I'll see you
in the morning

694
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,542
on that hemicolectomy.

695
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:46,876
You bet.

696
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,557
Dr. Benton, thank you
so much for waiting.

697
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:49,691
Mm-hmm. You ready?

698
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,014
Good.

699
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,199
Dr. Benton, this
is Dr. Alex Bradley.

700
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:56,236
He's in charge of the
Starzl Fellowship this year.

701
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,604
Yes, sir.

702
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,305
Please be seated, Dr. Benton.

703
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:00,607
Pleasure.

704
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:02,809
Thank you.

705
00:31:02,845 --> 00:31:05,128
It isn't often we entertain

706
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,446
the candidacy

707
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:08,448
of a second-year
surgical resident.

708
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:10,778
Yes, I know. I feel
very appreciative

709
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,947
that you feel my qualifications

710
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,916
are worthy of consideration.

711
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,422
Excellent recommendations.

712
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,224
Obviously solid achievement.

713
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,194
As you know, the,
uh... Starzl Fellowship

714
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:24,531
allows you to study with
surgical transplant teams.

715
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,283
Have you done research

716
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,567
in that area?

717
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:28,919
Well, not directly,

718
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:29,981
but I've done similar...

719
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:32,305
Any, uh...
extracurricular activities?

720
00:31:32,341 --> 00:31:33,790
Uh... yes.

721
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,592
Uh... I believe it says...

722
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:37,589
Excuse me... right there.

723
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:40,480
Uh... the A.O.A. Honor Society.

724
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:42,365
Right. Back in medical school.

725
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,034
Anything more recent?

726
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:47,620
No, um...

727
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,634
Peter has shown superior
commitment and leadership.

728
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,625
His students come
out of the rotation

729
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,639
stronger than any I've seen.

730
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,113
Well, that's very good.
That's very good indeed.

731
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,132
Thank you.

732
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,151
Well, thank you
for taking the time

733
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,287
to go through the
qualifying process.

734
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,122
We won't make a decision
for another two weeks,

735
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,807
but you'll hear from us then.

736
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,661
Uh...

737
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,129
Thank you.

738
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,733
Thank you.

739
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,202
Thank you.

740
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,953
Thanks, Peter.

741
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,276
You did great.

742
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,045
Yeah? Yeah.

743
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,251
Hey, Lydia, will you
give this message

744
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:41,586
to Carter for me, please?

745
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,911
Sure. I didn't know he was
looking for an apartment.

746
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:47,313
There's two available
in my building.

747
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:48,827
Yeah? That makes three.

748
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:50,116
Good night, ladies.

749
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:51,485
Good night, Jerry.

750
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:16,342
I hired Mookie
today... That "gang kid."

751
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:17,677
Mm-hmm.

752
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:19,613
Citikids intern program.

753
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,447
He does volunteer work,

754
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:23,483
they suspend his sentence,

755
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,152
and he stays out
of juvenile hall.

756
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:27,470
Mm-hmm.

757
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,238
He starts next week.

758
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,607
Mm-hmm.

759
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,376
I put you down
as his supervisor.

760
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,780
You sure you don't mind?

761
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:38,960
It's been a long day.

762
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,296
I could actually use
a quiet night at home.

763
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,853
The lecture's on advances
in cardiomyopathy.

764
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,522
A roomful of cardiologists.

765
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:48,458
I could hit my quarterly
quota in one night.

766
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:49,637
Then it's an opportunity

767
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:50,838
that you shouldn't miss.

768
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,662
I'll make it up to
you this weekend.

769
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,979
After last weekend,
I believe you.

770
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,468
Bye.

771
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,139
What?

772
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:06,376
Since when are you
so eager to be stood up?

773
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,545
Even I need rest.

774
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,279
This is the Murdoch chart

775
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,616
that I've been looking
for all afternoon.

776
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,151
Call me crazy,
but the black dress

777
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,537
looks better
without the lab coat.

778
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:18,954
Just shut up, okay?

779
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,491
I can barely sit here
dictating charts like this.

780
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,825
You can in my book.

781
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:26,295

All right. Happy birthday.

789
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,643
Hey, how do you do?

790
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:42,061
Doug, this is my sister, Chloe.

791
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:43,174
Hi.

792
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:44,848
Oh, and this is Billy.

793
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,182
And Billy.

794
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,734
Hi, Billy.

795
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:50,453
Now, we've come to celebrate.

796
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,654
Oh, man.

797
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,534
I know this really cool club.

798
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,436
There's dancing and everything.

799
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,637
You'll love it.

800
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,944
Chloe...

801
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,657
I'm going to go look at these.

802
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,880
Why don't you come with us?

803
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:02,599
I got to work.

804
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,718
Come on.

805
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,750
Congratulations.

806
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,107
Good night.

807
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,150
Jerry said to give this to you.

808
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,746
And there's a couple
in my building, too.

809
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,858
Wow. It's like the perfect day.

810
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:33,279
What else are you
guys on, Chloe?

811
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:34,781
Vodka and what else?

812
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:36,950
Nothing. I just
wanted to wish you

813
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,250
a happy birthday.

814
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:39,752
So you showed up drunk

815
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:42,288
with a guy you probably
met an hour ago?

816
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:43,623
I did not.

817
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:45,291
Billy cares about me,

818
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:47,326
so just leave him out of it.

819
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:49,996
I think he is already out of it.

820
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:52,176
Oh, is he staying
at my place, too?

821
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,579
Did he help you steal the TV?

822
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:56,002
Oh, you shut up.

823
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,971
You just shut up, Susie.

824
00:35:58,006 --> 00:35:59,772
You are just like Mom.

825
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:01,508
You're just like Dad.

826
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:04,744
You're just always
hating everything that I do.

827
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,357
That is not true,
and you know it.

828
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,492
Nothing was ever any
different at home for me

829
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:09,499
than it was for you.

830
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,867
Sure. Sure.

831
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,880
Oh, God. I don't even know

832
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,149
why I'm having
this conversation.

833
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,741
They never thought
I could do anything.

834
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,144
Do you think they thought I
could go to medical school?

835
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,478
Become a doctor?

836
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,948
I had to prove it to them.

837
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,483
Sometimes I still
have to every day.

838
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,953
You don't know
anything about every day!

839
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,621
You don't know.

840
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:35,025
You don't have to worry
about paying the rent!

841
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,826
You don't have to worry

842
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:39,040
about where you're
going to sleep!

843
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,965
You don't have to
worry about getting a job!

844
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:44,800
Chloe... Chloe... Chloe...

845
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:51,457
Chloe, Chloe. Okay,
okay. Calm down.

846
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:52,858
Are you okay?

847
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:54,205
Take it easy.

848
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:55,806
You're going to be okay.

849
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,180
All right.

850
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,215
You're safe here, Chloe.

851
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,583
Do you understand?

852
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,090
Dr. Benton's going
to fix your hand.

853
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,059
And then, if you want,

854
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,462
you and I can talk
through all this.

855
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,996
Okay?

856
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,393
You are pathetic.

857
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,029
What are you doing back?

858
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,030
I thought Jennifer

859
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,364
was in town.

860
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,632
So did I.

861
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:53,235
I thought you had a
date with the drug lady.

862
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,405
She went to a lecture on
cardiomyopathy instead.

863
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,874
Wow, that stings.

864
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,459
Actually, I'm glad.

865
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,795
She might be a
little perky for me.

866
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,797
Perky? I thought
you liked perky.

867
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:06,010
This is true

868
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,401
but lately, I have
found myself attracted

869
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:12,372
to sullen and
withdrawn and confused.

870
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:14,718
Yeah? That's good. You
ought to go out with me.

871
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:16,542
I<i> am</i> out with you.

872
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:18,144
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

873
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:19,845
Come on.

874
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,592
I'm the short guy here.

875
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:24,984
There's nothing wrong
with a little infantile

876
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,821
schoolyard competition
to kind of boost the spirits.

877
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:30,005
Oh, no...

878
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,607
All right. Here we go.

879
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,387
A little game of
one-on-one to 21.

880
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,209
A buck a point.

881
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,523
You're on.

882
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:36,791
All right. Ready?

883
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,180
Mm-hmm.

884
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,750
Through the leg.

885
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:47,574
They're stitching her up now.

886
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:50,376
She can sleep it off
tonight in Room Three,

887
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,779
and Benton said he'd find
somewhere to throw Billy.

888
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:55,493
He ought to find somewhere

889
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:56,949
to lock him up.

890
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:59,452
I told you, I don't
like surprises.

891
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:00,603
I'm sorry.

892
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,749
That's all right.
I'm used to it.

893
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,141
Come on. Let me
get you out of here.

894
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,309
We can still grab some dinner.

895
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,256
No. I don't really feel like it.

896
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,482
I think I'll go up
top, grab some air.

897
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,750
Want some company?

898
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,618
No.

899
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,787
Can I come over later?

900
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:22,742
Uh... maybe.

901
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,544
I don't know, Div.

902
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,929
I'll call you.

903
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,882
Okay.

904
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:31,100
So, uh...

905
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,770
you and Doug were great today.

906
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,105
What?

907
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,708
The 12-year-old
kid... Boating accident.

908
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:39,909
Oh. Thanks.

909
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,522
Yeah. Another ten minutes,

910
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,312
we would have lost him.

911
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,214
I'll see you later.

912
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,027
Doug?

913
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:01,931
Hey.

914
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,933
Come on in.

915
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,535
Word came down from the O.R.

916
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,837
The little kid from
the boating accident

917
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,304
came through really well.

918
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,873
He's going to be just fine.

919
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,009
That's great news.

920
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:16,545
Pretty strange day, huh?

921
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,080
You could say that.

922
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,293
I'll tell you,

923
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:22,518
I could live the whole
thing all over again.

924
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,156
Doug, John asked me

925
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,874
to move back in with him.

926
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:31,944
I just thought I should tell
you that I told him I would.

927
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,867
And did you decide
this this afternoon?

928
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,648
We've been talking
about it for a while.

929
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,183
But did you decide to
tell him this afternoon,

930
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,234
and you're just telling me now?

931
00:40:43,258 --> 00:40:44,406
It doesn't matter, Doug.

932
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,575
What happened with us

933
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,221
this afternoon...
Does that matter?

934
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,922
What happened
today was an accident.

935
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,313
There are no accidents.

936
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,220
Look, it's great.

937
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,689
I mean... really.

938
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,924
It's great.

939
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,829
Thanks for letting me know.

940
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:54,460
I can't find anybody
to drink this with me.

941
00:41:54,495 --> 00:41:56,996
Don't know that I'm
the best candidate.

942
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:59,665
You are the only
one with a birthday.

943
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,967
Oh, please.

944
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:03,080
However, you're not the only one

945
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,803
with a crazy family.

946
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:08,674
My dad says you
should never ever do this

947
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,087
with a bottle of champagne.

948
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,879
Now, if that's not crazy...

949
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:14,947
Okay...

950
00:42:14,983 --> 00:42:16,682
are you ready?

951
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:19,077
I don't think so, but... okay.

952
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,707
Ooh! Ah!

953
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,308
Thanks.

954
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,588
You know, Carter,

955
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:29,790
this is a whole side of you

956
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:31,058
I've never seen before.

957
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:32,381
What do you mean?

958
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,383
I come up here a lot.

959
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,718
You do?

960
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,320
Well, if you were
Dr. Benton's student,

961
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,456
you'd come up here a lot, to.

962
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,258
However, today
was an excellent day.

963
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,527
I performed my
first lumbar puncture.

964
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,606
How was it?

965
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,862
Really scary.

966
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,631
But Dr. Greene
talked me through it,

967
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,199
the patient did have meningitis,

968
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,534
now he's going to be okay,

969
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,453
so I guess that's
worth a little scare.

970
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,666
You know, Carter,
you<i> can</i> call us

971
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,934
by our first names.

972
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:58,758
You call me Carter.

973
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:01,827
Yeah, well...
that's different...

974
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:04,363
somehow.

975
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:06,532
So your sister...
She's really stuck

976
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,567
on this guy with
the greasy hair?

977
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:10,898
I doubt she knows
his last name. Why?

978
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,287
I was going

979
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,789
to ask her out.

980
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:15,040
Who<i> are</i> you?

981
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:18,027
I'm just kidding... Susan.

982
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,813
I get it... John.

983
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:25,451
No. Doesn't sound right.

984
00:43:25,486 --> 00:43:26,786
Okay.

985
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,320
Call me Carter.

986
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:36,663
