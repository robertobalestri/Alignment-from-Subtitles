Towel clip.

Towel clip.

Why are we doing this?

51
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,211
Because sticking his hand
in a bucket of warm water

00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,647
would be juvenile.

Ooh..! Ooh..!

54
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:21,206

Shh. Shh.

56
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,873
And it's a mess out there.

57
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,265
This monster of a storm
began in the Rockies,

58
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,499
crept across the plains,

59
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,601
and landed on the
Midwest this morning,

60
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:36,637
dumping seven inches of
snow on the ground before dawn.

61
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,484
Latest estimates
now put the total

62
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:39,852
at close to nine inches.

63
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,587
That left the morning rush hour

64
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:43,356
looking like a demolition derby.

65
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,913
You thought the Kennedy
construction was bad...

66
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,249
What's a four-letter
word for possessions?

67
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:49,717
Stuff.

68
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,353
That's five letters.

69
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:55,656
Roxanne, temp clerks
do answer the phone.

70
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,859
I thought you were going home.

71
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:59,327
My car's snowed in.

72
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:00,428
I'm stuck.

73
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:01,640
Nurse call.

74
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,443
You know that blue flu

75
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,811
that the cops get sick with?

76
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:08,235
She thinks she caught it.

77
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,742
Bob. Bob, why don't you relax?

78
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,512
It's just going to
get dirty again.

79
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:21,483
All the more reason why
to keep the foot up on it.

80
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:22,917
Leg. Leg up on it.

81
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,219
You want to help

82
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:27,322
put up the Christmas
ornaments instead?

83
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,401
Ornaments?

84
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,757
Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,979
Ack.

86
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,315
He's kind of cute.

87
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,549
Really?

88
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,896
Yeah. He's got beautiful eyes,

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,964
thick hair...

90
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,487
That's a low blow.

91
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,156
What's going on? Nothing.

92
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,036
Nothing. We're

The National Weather Service

96
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,674
says this could turn into
the biggest snowstorm

97
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,942
since January of 1967

98
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,844
when 23 inches fell in 28 hours.

99
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,179

100
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,759

the security camera?

101
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,849

00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,119

00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,918
with one of those
parasol drinks in his hand.

189
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:32,337
Sounds pretty good to me.

190
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,644
What?

191
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,295
You might want to...

192
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,752
I put up.

193
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,938
Never mind.

194
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,968
And it's getting
worse out there.

195
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,294
If you had an alien baby,

196
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,829
would it show up on
the pregnancy test?

197
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,233
And we have late word that
the Eisenhower Expressway

198
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,734
is completely shut down...

199
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,571
E.R.

200
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,807
Whoa!

201
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,675
Calm down, Mr. Blinker.

202
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,012
When is the baby's due date?

203
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,049
Uh-huh. And how far
apart are the contractions?

204
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,021
Call 911 now.

205
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,535
Mrs. Blinker's in labor,

206
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,160
but she doesn't want
to come into the hospital.

207
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,695
She wants to deliver
watching the snow fall.

208
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,399
She'd enjoy the snowfall
more with an epidural.

209
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,468
County General, this is Dispatch

210
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,603
for status update. Over.

211
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,309
Dispatch, County General
is on full open status. Over.

212
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,110
Ten-four, General.

213
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,485
My Lexus just got snowplowed in.

214
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,321
Could I use the phone?

215
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,122
Sure. Just dial nine.

216
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,329
Wow. Marquis cut, two carat.

217
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,730
Probably an F-SI1.

218
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,000
Platinum setting.

219
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,970
That's a $12,000 ring.

220
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:22,030
You are here to work.

221
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:23,197
Get up.

222
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:24,899
No patients, no work.

223
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,569
Thing about work, there
is always some around.

224
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,982
Now, I want you to
empty the wastebaskets

225
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:32,941
into the hopper and re-line
them with plastic bags.

226
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:34,341
I ain't no garbage man.

227
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,543
Child, move. Go on.

228
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,066
Come on, Carol.

229
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,001
County General, how
do you read? Over.

230
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,157
Read you, ten-two.

231
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:51,308
Go ahead, Dispatch.

232
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,361
General, implement
disaster protocol.

233
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,047
Mass casualty alert.

234
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,083
32-vehicle pile-up on the
Kennedy Expressway. Over.

235
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,718
Is this a drill? Over.

236
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,053
Negative, General.

237
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,554
This is not a drill.

238
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,139
18 majors, 29 minors.

239
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:06,641
Fire at scene.

240
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,410
Rescue vehicle access
and communication

241
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,061
limited by weather.

242
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,430
We're calling out
a Plan One. Over.

243
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,577
Roger, Dispatch.

244
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,811
Do you have an estimate

245
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,680
on the number of
casualties? Over.

246
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:18,736
50 To 100. Over.

247
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,072
How many are coming to us? Over.

248
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,591
Mercy's power is down.
Malik, can you turn this up?

249
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:25,627
You may get them all. Over.

250
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,978
This is the scene on
the Kennedy Expressway

251
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,152
south of the Grand
exit, where 28 cars

252
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,720
and three trucks were
involved in a collision

253
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,739
just minutes ago.

254
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,674
According to reports
from the scene,

255
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,825
the accident started
when a single car

256
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,263
went into a 360-degree spin,
hitting everything in its way.

257
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,515
Police say at least
41 people are injured

258
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,600
and others are still
trapped in their cars.

259
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,396
To make matters worse,
emergency vehicles

260
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,838
are having trouble getting
to the scene on the roads...

261
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,174
Oh, boy.

262
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,609
Here we go.

263
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,498
And it's a mess out there.

264
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,579
This way! This way!

265
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,070
Green, walking
wounded. Yellow, urgent.

266
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,251
Red, critical, and
black, D.O.A. Got it?

267
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,407
Got it.

268
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,741
Three O.R. crews in.

269
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,417
I got it. Roger, out.

270
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,744
Blood Bank come in.

271
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,990
This is Ross in E.R. Come in.

272
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,759
Blood Bank. I need
those. There you go.

273
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,327
We need to know
your availability

274
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,884
on fresh whole blood.

275
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,664
What do you have, Camacho?

276
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,889
Trapped in a cab, second-
and third-degree burns

277
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,324
25% body surface.

278
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,993
Let's red tag him to Trauma Two.

279
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,340
Mark, send Benton to Trauma Two.

280
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,997
Uh... out. Roger. Mark.

281
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,499
Yeah, I read you.

282
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,501
All the way to the green room.

283
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,336
Okay, what do you got?

284
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,671
Scalp lac.

285
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,674
Let's green tag him
to the waiting room.

286
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,008
We're losing her.

287
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,843
All right, curtain two.

288
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,679
Malik, what have you got?

289
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,281
25-Year-old, truck
rolled, no seat belt.

290
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,283
He coded in the rig.

291
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,453
Grahek, do what you can
and then move on, okay?

292
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,600
Carter, jump in. Use your head.

293
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,590
Stay supervised.

294
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,625
Okay.

295
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,280
A.L.O.C. and step
deformity at the T4 vertebra.

296
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:33,614
Legs are flaccid.

297
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,728
Okay, we have a cord injury.

298
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:37,117
Gently on three.

299
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,452
One, two, three.

300
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:39,453
All right.

301
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:41,622
C.T.'s prepped for her.

302
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:43,791
C.B.C, type and hold two units.

303
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,026
Who's on neurosurgical backup?

304
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,528
Armstrong.

305
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:51,865
Flaccid paralysis and
areflexia south of T4.

306
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,534
She withdraws to pain.

307
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,035
Bag the C-spine films.

308
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,870
We'll do her spine and C.T.

309
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:57,871
Vitals?

310
00:15:57,907 --> 00:15:59,707
90/62, Pulse 60.

311
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:00,708
Consider spinal shock.

312
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:03,143
Okay, got it. Go, Mark.

313
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:04,645
Hey, what are..?

314
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:05,724
Get out of here!

315
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:06,714
Security!

316
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,716
You can't shoot in here!

317
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,050
Get out of here!

318
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:12,052
What do you think you're doing?

319
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:13,721
I got to take a leak.

320
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,656
Don't move. You could
have a broken neck.

321
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:16,935
That's whiplash.

322
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,593
Or it's a spinal fracture and
you're a quadriplegic for life.

323
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:23,564
<i>Mano, mi mano esta que
paso de la corte mucho.</i>

324
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,898
<i>Esta sangrando.</i>

325
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:26,111
<i>Mi mano.</i>

326
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,301
<i>Es mi mano.</i>

327
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:28,636
What?

328
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,282
Let me see your hand.

329
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:31,289
Where's the cut?

330
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,441
Senor, it's a small
puncture wound.

331
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:36,143
<i>Poquito. Si?</i>

332
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,691
Okay, sir, you
just try to relax.

333
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:40,726
I'm going to turn you
over to Dr. Bradley.

334
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,583
We got 500 cc's
out of the right chest.

335
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,019
18% second-degree, nine
percent third-degree burns

336
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,999
in the chest, abdomen
and right shoulder.

337
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:48,867
You're going to be
in good shape, sir.

338
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,490
Susan, what do you got?

339
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:51,926
Here it is.

340
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:53,405
Neck, chest and
right head trauma.

341
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,661
Ma'am, my name is Dr. Benton.

342
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,396
I don't want you to
worry about a thing.

343
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,998
I'm going to take
care of you, okay?

344
00:16:58,034 --> 00:17:00,167
All right, let's move it!
We've got a move going.

345
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,668
Let's go! Clear!

346
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:03,003
Get her in here.

347
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,171
Right here. Stop.

348
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,506
We need some rays and relief.

349
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,843
Morphine five, I.V. Push.

350
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,177
Here we go.

351
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,511
Ah.

352
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,848
Let's lift her and shift her.

353
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:16,117
All right, cross table C-spine,

354
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:18,119
right hip and pelvis.

355
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,621
Round up a bone
crusher now. Move.

356
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,623
On my count. On three.

357
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,291
One, two, three.

358
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:26,293
We need Ortho in Trauma Two.

359
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:29,380
Ortho in E.R. Trauma Two.

360
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,714
Two fingers.

361
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,383
Now what do you see?

362
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,985
Such a rock. Lucky girl.

363
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,652
Double-patch her eye

364
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,489
and green tag her to the
waiting room now, please.

365
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,324
What? Did I say something?

366
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,443
Uh-uh.

367
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,444
Where's Carter?

368
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,212
Carter, where the
hell have you been?

369
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:46,280
Grab some scissors. Move.

370
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,115
How soon can she go up?

371
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,063
Uh, I get her pictures, have the
orthopods look at her... 15 minutes.

372
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,386
We need the room.

373
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:55,389
The O.R.'s opened up.
Let them see her there.

374
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,902
All right, people.
You heard the boss.

375
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:58,904
Let's heal them and wheel them.

376
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:00,728
Do you need help?

377
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:01,996
No.

378
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,965
B.P.'s fallen
70/40. Pulse is 120.

379
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,299
Skin's cool and dry.

380
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,968
What's your name, sir?

381
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:07,969
Edward Kaplan.

382
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,498
Call me Eddie. You the doc?

383
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,617
Yes, I am. How are you feeling?

384
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:13,169
Haven't been tied up this tight

385
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,559
since last Saturday night.

386
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,305
Thank you for
sharing, Mr. Kaplan.

387
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,029
On three. One, two, three.

388
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,265
E.R., please hold.

389
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,034
E.R., please hold.

390
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,703
Shoot me if I
take this job again.

391
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,706
Give me a gun.
I'll shoot you now.

392
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,242
E.R.

393
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,556
Call Fire Station 23.
The number's right there.

394
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,058
See if they can pick up
these docs stuck at home.

395
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,548
What do you got?

396
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:38,727
Smoke inhalation.

397
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,729
Yellow tag him to curtain two.

398
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,053
What do you got?

399
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,721
I kind of hurt my hand.

400
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,456
Whoa! Where's your thumb?

401
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,791
It's right here.

402
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,125
All right, Malik.

403
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,795
Malik, red tag him
straight to the O.R.

404
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,030
Here's his thumb. Take it.

405
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,137
Mrs. Thui, everything's fine.

406
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,305
Just relax.

407
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,807
She okay?

408
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,141
Yeah. Under control.

409
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,209
Ow!

410
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,482
Found her laying
out in the snow.

411
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,818
No idea who she belongs to.

412
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,152
Go.

413
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,988
Dexter Jones, 25.

414
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,990
Van rolled on him. No seat belt.

415
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,992
Left below-the-knee amputation.

416
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,159
He's shocky.

417
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,162
Rescue Seven's looking
for the rest of his leg.

418
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,831
Benton finished in Two?

419
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,010
Uh-huh.

420
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,667
This is his next patient.

421
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,336
They come at you
with that Foley catheter

422
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,005
run, Jack! Don't walk!

423
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,851
Okay, take him up. O.R.
Two is prepped for him.

424
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,175
When the cross-matched
blood's here,

425
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,543
send it up.

426
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,413
Code in seven! Code in seven!

427
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,006
Run those to Benton
in Trauma One.

428
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,674
Go, Mookie!

429
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:24,655
B.P.'S real bad... 60 by palp.

430
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,457
Put me out!

431
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,792
Call for six units O-neg blood.

432
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,862
Get the lab for a
C.B.C., type and cross.

433
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,208
Come on, bring those in!

434
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,232
Whoa! I got a pumper.

435
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,784
Come on, bring
those pads in here!

436
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,019
Put this on.

437
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:39,253
All hands on deck, lets move.

438
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:40,254
Put it on,

439
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,623
and then put your
hand on the tourniquet.

440
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,125
Come on, Mookie, let's
go. I'll make a surgeon

441
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,094
out of you yet.

442
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,113
97.8.

443
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,716
90/50, Pulse 125.

444
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,050
Pretty darn normal.

445
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,051
Doug.

446
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,087
Yeah.

447
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,392
Gas tank exploded.
Trapped in a car.

448
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,572
All right, D.O.A.

449
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,729
Mr. Ramos.

450
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,897
Multiple contusions
and abrasions.

451
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,744
Does it hurt when I do this?

452
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,067
<i>Le duele?</i>

453
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,237
Auto versus pedestrian!
We're losing him!

454
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,404
Exam three.

455
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,174
Green tag Mr. Ramos
to the doctor's lounge.

456
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,021
Here we go. Move him.

457
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,023
All right, duck your head.

458
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,346
Here we go.

459
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,014
Straight back now, guys.

460
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,950
Straight back.

Patrick, how did you get here?

479
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,537
I... w-w-walked.

480
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,239
Why?

481
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,275
Don't have a d-driver's license.

482
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,344
Oh, okay.

483
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,215
They look better
when they're straight.

484
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,561
Yeah, they do. You're right.

485
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,617
Carol!

486
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,531
Okay. Go to it,
Patrick. Go to it.

487
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,155
<i>Si, senorita.</i>

488
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,559
How we doing in here?

489
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,394
One step ahead of the reaper.

490
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,107
That's all you can ask for.

491
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,431
Thanks for the ride.

492
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,899
Like Edward R. Murrow
back from the dead,

493
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,901
he goes to the media room.

494
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,415
Run it down for me, Mike.

495
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,838
A 40-car pileup on the Kennedy.

496
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,107
We're the major receiving.

497
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,342
18 red tags, ten have gone up.

498
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,644
19 Yellows, 33 greens logged in.

499
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,414
Three D.O.A.s, four
black tags didn't make it.

500
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,483
Six O.R.s are operational

501
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,252
and fire's out
bringing in fresh docs.

502
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,621
Good. Go be a doc!

503
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,959
O.R., Morgenstern. I
need a staff status update.

504
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:54,581
Aliens have implanted
a detector in my nose!

505
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,584
Doctor, hey!

506
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,720
Aliens have implanted...

507
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:01,454
Why today, Regina?

508
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,856
Carol, will you page Cvetic,

509
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,257
get him down here right away?

510
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:07,995
Give her a nice quiet
room, and five of... vitamin H.

511
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,997
That's Haldol! Haldol!

512
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,610
This detects abbreviations!

513
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:13,299
Oh, wow. What a zoo.

514
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:14,801
I'm glad you're here.

515
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,336
Take the officer up
to the suture room

516
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,415
and give him some stitches.

517
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,317
I haven't done stitches
since I was an intern.

518
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,641
It's like riding a bike.

519
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:23,209
I haven't done
that since I was six.

520
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,545
I'm Angela Hicks.

521
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,946
Hi. I'm Dr. Ross.

522
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:28,749
Why don't you
take bedpan detail?

523
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:31,251
It's not very glamorous,
but very necessary.

524
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:32,463
That's<i> Dr.</i> Hicks.

525
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:35,188
I'm the new attending
E.R. physician.

526
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:39,259
Oops. You won't be
needing these then.

527
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,004
I don't want this life!

528
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,474
He's hypoxic. His
pulse ox is falling.

529
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,108
Get him down.

530
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:56,610
Bad news.

531
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,412
PC02's 62. P02's 60.

532
00:24:58,447 --> 00:24:59,880
Let's crash intubate.

533
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,316
Get the sux, Pavulon and Versed.

534
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:03,850
Let's move, people.

535
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:05,386
Hold it tight!

536
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,355
Come on, man. Just calm down.

537
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:09,873
B... B...

538
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:13,210
Dexter? Oh, God. I know
him from the neighborhood.

539
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,411
Let's move.

540
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,780
Don't do no Indiana
Jones on me, B!

541
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:18,399
Versed first?

542
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,035
Yeah. Two milligrams,
then succynyl choline.

543
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,553
Just land the plane, B!

544
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,288
B, put up the net!

545
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,622
Just put me out!

546
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,956
Come on. Shh.

547
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:31,873
I got you, I got you.
Okay? I got you.

548
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,464
Would somebody sign
my time card, please?

549
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,534
It's been eight hours.

550
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,186
Somebody get her

551
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,621
the hell out of here!

552
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:47,277
Where does it hurt?

553
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,712
My chest!

554
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:50,848
You hit the steering wheel?

555
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,627
No. I was trying
to light a cigarette.

556
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,962
That's the cigarette lighter?

557
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,185
Ouch.

558
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,688
Dr. Ross, is that little
Cuban guy Ramos

559
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,758
supposed to be dead?

560
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,226
Mr. Ramos!

561
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,628
He was fine ten minutes ago!

562
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,908
He started complaining
of chest pains

563
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,498
and went out. There's no pulse.

564
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,200
Damn it! Let me in.

565
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,802
Could I get some help, please?

566
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,215
I just fell
cross-country skiing.

567
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,571
I'll get you an ice pack.

568
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,857
How long do I have to wait?

569
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:19,310
I green-tagged him
in the waiting room.

570
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:20,978
He seemed fine.

571
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,379
Come on!

572
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,880
Where we going?

573
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,160
Trauma Two.

574
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:29,553
Damn! Come on. Come on.

575
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:36,060
Hey, Steve, does that
look like a fracture to you?

576
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,095
Yeah. Tri-malleolar. Call Ortho.

577
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,643
If you throw a deep dermal
in there, trim that edge,

578
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,046
it'll line up a lot better.

579
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,369
Yeah?

580
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,703
Yeah.

581
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:47,738
Thanks.

582
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,261
Dietary? We've got an
E.R. full of hungry people.

583
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:55,929
Damn.

584
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,502
E.R. Okay, I'll tell her.

585
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,170
Carlos, Linda from Novell.

586
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:07,041
I need 30 large pizzas
delivered to County General E.R.

587
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:08,808
I<i> know</i> it's snowing.

588
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:12,112
Well, get a move on, and
charge it to my account.

589
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,719
Peek-a-boo!

590
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:24,174
Peek-a-boo... peek-a-boo!

591
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,009
So where's the doctor?

592
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,912
I am the doctor, Mrs. Bozinski.

593
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,043
No, I mean a <i>doctor</i> doctor.

594
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,133
Myra, let her do her job.

595
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,012
Where are you feeling
pain, Mr. Bozinski?

596
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:38,104
I want Dr. Harvey
Stern called this minute!

597
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,284
Perhaps you'd be

598
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:41,925
more comfortable
in the waiting room.

599
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,543
Huh. That's a good one.

600
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,044
<i>You</i> call Harvey, Myra.

601
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,680
A pay phone's just
past the admit desk.

602
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,015
B.P.'S okay.

603
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,600
Pulse is a little high.

604
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,935
120.

605
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,872
I don't know if
this capillary refill's

606
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,373
what it should be.

607
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,775
Let's do postural vitals.

608
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,342
Mr. Bozinski, are you sure,

609
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,561
when I push here,
this isn't hurting you?

610
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,947
I'll run a 300cc
fluid challenge.

611
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:14,891
♪ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ♪

612
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,393
Turn off the music!

613
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,396
♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪

614
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:21,076
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la-la-

615
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,911
Another milligram of atropine?

616
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,312
Another milligram.

617
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,569
He's flatlined.

618
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,115
Move! Let me in there.

619
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:30,541
Let's hook him up to
the external pacemaker.

620
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,643
Mr. Blinker, hang on.

621
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,213
This guy's wife's in labor.

622
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,060
Turn up the damned gain!

623
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,950
It's up all the way.

624
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:43,420
After you broke down the
door, what did you find?

625
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:45,956
You're bigger than her, right?

626
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,869
Then carry her in here yourself.

627
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,227
Guy's wife locked
herself into their bedroom.

628
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:53,163
Stuffed a sock into her
mouth so she wouldn't scream.

629
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:56,433
She really wants to
have that baby at home.

630
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:57,968
Come on!

631
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,056
Anybody here with him?

632
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:05,826
Family's on the way.

633
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,660
Pupils fixed and dilated.

634
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:10,663
Patrick got into the
Christmas tapes.

635
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:11,998
Come on.

636
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,886
Doug...

637
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,790
it's been 30 minutes.

638
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,825
Let's call it.

639
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,561
Damn it.

640
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,117
I green-tagged him by mistake.

641
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,899
He's the last of
them... Mr. Thui.

642
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:47,401
Hi.

643
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:48,902
Thui, Thui...

644
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:50,771
Ah! Mr. Thui.

645
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:53,874
We took very good
care of your wife.

646
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:56,877
She's been sedated, and
she's resting comfortably.

647
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:58,945
I do not understand.

648
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,259
She wasn't in the
accident with me.

649
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,333
She was home.

650
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,319
I call her to come pick me up.

651
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,255
Wait. What?

652
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,219
I missed it.

653
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:26,222
You triaged 70-odd patients.

654
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,958
You're human, Doug.

655
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:30,444
Doctors...

656
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,062
may I?

657
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,830
Yes.

658
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,865
Uh-huh. Yeah.

659
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:50,414
My brother in faith, I entrust
you to God who created you.

660
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:54,351
May you return to the
One who formed you

661
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:58,505
from the dust of this earth.

662
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,507
My brother in faith,

663
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:03,409
I entrust you to God
who created you.

664
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:07,097
May you return to the
One who formed you

665
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,799
from the dust of this earth.

666
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:13,803
Out of the depths, I have
cried unto Thee, O lord.

667
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,439
Lord, hear my voice.

668
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,952
Our Father, who art in heaven,

669
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,610
hallowed be Thy name.

670
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:20,922
Thy kingdom come.

671
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:25,682
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

672
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:29,152
All right, people, let's hook
this up to the suction. Move.

673
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,054
You think the vascular boys

674
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,423
can put Humpty Dumpty
back together again?

675
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,036
They're in for something.

676
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,128
Dexter's always been
a magnet for bad luck.

677
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,264
Hi, kids. I'm Dr. Hicks.

678
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,065
Give me the bullet.

679
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,034
Left B-K amputation.
Estimated blood loss 40%.

680
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,303
Bilateral hemothorax.

681
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,488
750cc's from the
right thoracostomy.

682
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:49,973
Rapid sequence induction.

683
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,407
Versed, succinyl
choline, Pavulon.

684
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,676
Four liters Ringer's,
six units O-neg in.

685
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,346
Cervical spine
cleared, vitals stabilized.

686
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,460
You're Peter Benton,
right? I've heard about you.

687
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:00,450
Oh, yeah? Is that good or bad?

688
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,485
He's in fib!

689
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,197
Charge the defibrillator. 200.

690
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,516
Excuse me.

691
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,308
How much longer am
I going to have to wait?

692
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,943
Clear!

693
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:11,962
Good God! What was that?

694
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,030
His B.P.'s falling
fast. I get 60 palp.

695
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,409
Crit's down. Losing blood.

696
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,000
Run them in fast.

697
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:20,837
Did Dr. Stein ever tell you
you have an aortic aneurysm?

698
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:21,900
I don't feel a femoral pulse.

699
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,423
He had one before.

700
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,542
Oh, my God, Doctor,
please. Do something!

701
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,895
Let's get him

702
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,130
into the O.R. now!

703
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,642
Nobody's available. No surgeons?

704
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,883
There's 22 surgeries
going on up there.

705
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,535
Okay, we'll do it here.

706
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,170
I'll get Benton.

707
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,738
Prep a thoracotomy tray now.

708
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:43,410
I need a surgeon in Three stat.

709
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:45,045
I've got a triple-A
that's about to blow.

710
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,791
Order a laparotomy
setup from O.R.

711
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,893
Call Anesthesia. Get
Dr. Ashe down here.

712
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,095
You ever cross-clamped an aorta?

713
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,652
No.

714
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:53,970
I don't feel a thing!

715
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,350
Call the code. Get some epi.

716
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,141
Open the I.V.s wide.

717
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,204
Morris!!

718
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,712
Morris...

719
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:04,187
Doctors, please. Do something.

720
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,047
Bob?

721
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,667
What are you doing?

722
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,950
Oh, man.

723
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:21,675
What happened?

724
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,876
It was Bob.

725
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,377
Bob?

726
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:25,945
Bob.

727
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:28,948
Bob?

728
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:58,545
Police said that
our baby, Ashley...

729
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,684
Oh, my God.

730
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,920
Ashley.

731
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:09,155
Oh, God.

732
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,592
I love you.

733
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:14,444
Are you okay?

734
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,797
They found the leg.

735
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,131
Vitals?

736
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,500
B.P.'s 110/70.

737
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,101
Pulse is 112 and strong.

738
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:24,103
Pulse ox is good: 95 percent.

739
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:25,505
Great. What's he had?

740
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,553
Eight units packed
cells, four liters Ringer's.

741
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:31,143
We're in a holding
pattern for vascular.

742
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,613
Why don't we fly
this puppy ourselves?

743
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:35,648
Send to O.R. for
a vascular tray,

744
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:38,117
bovie, drapes and
gowns and an ex-fix.

745
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:40,665
You going to do a
reimplantation in the E.R.?

746
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:41,754
Not me. We.

747
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:43,356
Let's get a start on him.

748
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,491
The vascular team
will swoop down

749
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:46,992
when they smell the glory.

750
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:49,106
All right. Now you're
talking. Let's go.

751
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,732
Here's the abdominal,
chest and C-spine film.

752
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,167
His B.P. came
up with four units.

753
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:56,380
Oh, Susan.

754
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,648
Strong piece of work.

755
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:00,273
I've seen chief surgical
residents do worse.

756
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:01,807
Thanks. Have you seen Bob?

757
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,522
Officer, escort this
camera crew out of here!

758
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:05,878
Yo, Dr. Lewis.

759
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,012
Yeah.

760
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:09,360
They need you to
scrub in Trauma One.

761
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:11,016
Do you know where Cvetic is?

762
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,686
His exchange hasn't
been able to reach him.

763
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:15,154
No.

764
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:17,724
Do you know what
we call motorcycles

765
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,058
around here, ace?

766
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,493
No. What?

767
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:21,772
Donor-cycles.

768
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:24,364
Donor-cycles. I like that.

769
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,365
Yeah. You would.

770
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,866
Hurry it up, Carter.

771
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:29,469
You got a million things to do.

772
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:33,774
Hi.

773
00:36:33,808 --> 00:36:35,786
What the hell are you doing?

774
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,843
I'm trying to get this cast off.

775
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:40,324
How the hell do you
change your pants, man?

776
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:42,482
They put it on me as a joke,

777
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:44,450
and now it's starting to itch!

778
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:48,499
Yeah, tell me about it.

779
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,801
Eight casts in six months.

780
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,124
Hog sat on me.

781
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,926
Dropped my Nighthawk.

782
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,680
Oh, yeah.

783
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,250
Relax, Doc.

784
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:02,719
This won't hurt a bit.

785
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,603
Hey!

786
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,305
Hey! Hey!

787
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:10,309
That's Mrs. Ramos.

788
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:12,929
You want me to come with you?

789
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,964
No, thanks.

790
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,287
Mrs. Ramos...

791
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:26,258
I'm Dr. Ross.

792
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,263
Your husband sustained
very serious injuries

793
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:32,799
in the accident.

794
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,171
He was brought here.

795
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:39,673
Um...

796
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:43,276
Despite our best efforts,
we were unable to save him.

797
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,150
He...

798
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,018
he died.

799
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,959
I'm sorry.

800
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:09,101
Good night.

801
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:12,705
Bob?

802
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:17,710
Bob?

803
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,683
Now I will never
be a doctor here.

804
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,592
Uh... were you
planning on being one?

805
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:38,230
In my country, I was a surgeon.

806
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,099
Vas... vas...

807
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:41,534
Vascular?

808
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,936
Yeah.

809
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:44,336
You're a vascular surgeon?

810
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,273
Yes.

811
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,442
Uh...

812
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:50,976
I need to board.

813
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,114
The board.

814
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:58,551
Oh, you have to, uh,
take the board exam.

815
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,952
Yes.

816
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,057
If I not operate, the man die.

817
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,726
But now,

818
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,594
when they find out,

819
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,596
I will never board.

820
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:11,948
Wait a minute.

821
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,866
You operated on somebody?

822
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:18,521
When they find out what I did...

823
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:22,442
Oh, Bob.

824
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:24,277
Did the patient die?

825
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:26,795
No.

826
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,130
Oh.

827
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,767
Well, then, they'll be grateful.

828
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,704
Really?

829
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,275
I'll help you with your
English for the board exam.

830
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,785
You would do it for me, that?

831
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,453
Yeah.

832
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,302
He's cyanotic as hell.

833
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,904
Castro.

834
00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:12,275
How did it go with Mrs. Ramos?

835
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,622
Pulse ox is really bad... 60.

836
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,112
Hemostat.

837
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,959
Check his cardiovascular, Doug.

838
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,350
What is that?

839
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,235
Patrick turned it on.

840
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,538
His pulse is down to 30.

841
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:26,973
Give .5 of atropine.

842
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,058
Guy on the phone... Mr. Blinker.

843
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,794
Says he's only going to
talk to you, Dr. Greene.

844
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,262
Put him on the speaker.

845
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,396
Dr. Greene?

846
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,715
I'm here, Mr. Blinker.

847
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,250
She wants to push.

848
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:41,153
Well, look between her legs
and tell me what you see.

849
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,005
Retract here.

850
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,607
Uh... baby... baby hair.

851
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:46,275
You ever delivered a baby?

852
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,593
I'm a plumber.

853
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:48,844
It's coming.

854
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,647
Okay, we want

855
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,047
to control the head.

856
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,333
When the head is halfway out,

857
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,468
tell your wife not to push.

858
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:59,155
And then gently
ease the skin over it.

859
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,490
What? The head?

860
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,658
Yeah. Like putting on a sweater.

861
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,194
Well, the head's
out. It's turning.

862
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,629
Retract here.

863
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,026
That's what it's supposed to do.

864
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,135
Mr. Blinker, gently pull
down towards the floor.

865
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,547
Seven of Proline.

866
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,138
Oh, my God.

867
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,355
Hey, it's a boy!

868
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,707
Good. Good work.

869
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:20,275
Now place the baby
on your wife's belly.

870
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,411
Get a shoelace and tie the cord.

871
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:26,199
Wrap them up in a blanket
nice and warm and bring them in.

872
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,750
Okay.

873
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,864
Dr. Benton, your friend has

874
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:32,408
his posterior artery back.

875
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,609
Vascular team's here.

876
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:39,445
We've debrided,
re-anastomosed posterior

877
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:41,291
tibial artery and
saphenous vein,

878
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:42,781
confirmed flow by Doppler.

879
00:41:42,817 --> 00:41:43,783
Strong preliminary work.

880
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,095
Get him unhooked, ready to move.

881
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,418
All right, Dex,

882
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:49,138
I'll see you walking
down King Drive.

883
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:01,900
Doug?

884
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,635
Are you okay?

885
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:04,848
About what?

886
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:07,106
About Mr. Ramos.

887
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:09,108
Everything.

888
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:11,877
Yes. I'm glad you're happy.

889
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:13,912
Really.

890
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,683
I'm going to get my stuff
and we can go, okay?

891
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:32,131
You know, Doug
is a fabulous guy.

892
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:36,302
We have lots of
fun, and he's cute.

893
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:38,537
He's great in bed.

894
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,876
Do you think there's
one perfect love?

895
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:46,545
You know, like
<i>Sleepless in Seattle?</i>

896
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,447
Somewhere under the stars,

897
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,883
one perfect person
for everybody?

898
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,587
I don't know. Why?

899
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:58,090
Because, for Doug...

900
00:42:58,126 --> 00:43:00,092
it's you.

901
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:03,329
Hey! Who ordered these pizzas?

902
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:05,998
Pizza's here!

903
00:43:09,437 --> 00:43:11,404
Great job, folks.

904
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:12,838
Excellent.

905
00:43:12,874 --> 00:43:14,106
Very nice.

906
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:18,394
Hey, hey, it's Dr. Bob!

907
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:26,368
Aw, now what?

908
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,066
All right, Patrick.
