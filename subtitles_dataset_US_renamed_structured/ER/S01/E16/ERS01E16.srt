1
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:14,820
She loves me...

2
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:18,161
she loves me not.

3
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:19,497
She loves me...

4
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,234
she loves me not.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,709
I'm not a nurse in training,
I'm a nurse in decorating.

6
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:25,711
Valentine's Day.

7
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:26,713
Can I help?

8
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:28,116
Can't you just do it?

9
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:29,152
Come on.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,559
E.R. Yeah.

11
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:36,067
Carol, can you find
Dr. Ross for Mrs. Hall?

12
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,349
Got to get these to
the desk. Sure. Mrs..?

13
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:39,540
Hall.

14
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:41,478
Dr. Ross. He's the pediatrician.

15
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:42,893
Yeah. What seems
to be the problem?

16
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,484
Tatiana, she's very sick.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,089
Aw, you don't feel well?

18
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:48,093
She has a fever and a cough.

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,830
She just doesn't seem right.

20
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:51,511
Okay. Come right this way.

21
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,070
Thank you.

22
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:56,194
Mark.

23
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,196
It's 10:00.

24
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:58,398
So?

25
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,001
So, you got in at
8:00, remember?

26
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:02,006
You weren't here overnight.

27
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:03,343
I was taking a nap.

28
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:05,559
Is there anything
wrong with taking a nap?

29
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,550
Certainly not.

30
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:07,886
Stomach ache in two.

31
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,623
Bounce back migraine in one.

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,410
Can I give them an E.T.A.?

33
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:19,243
Does that tickle?

34
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,247
Temperature's 100.

35
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:23,386
Does this hurt?

36
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,423
She doesn't speak much English.

37
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,196
She's Russian.

38
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:31,203
I adopted her in St.
Petersburg ten days ago.

39
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:33,218
When did the fever start?

40
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:35,011
I'd waited nearly six months.

41
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:38,018
Finally, all her
paperwork was in order.

42
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,353
Medical certificates.

43
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:40,957
She really seemed fine.

44
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:43,340
How long has she had the fever?

45
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:44,599
Almost a week.

46
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:46,581
Let's start her on
some oral amoxicillin.

47
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,573
She has some upper
respiratory congestion

48
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,877
and an ear infection,

49
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:51,914
which is probably
what's causing the fever.

50
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,120
Don't worry, Mrs. Hall,
we'll take good care of her.

51
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,333
Thank you, Doctor.

52
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:56,892
You're welcome.

53
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:01,268
Wendy, it's nice of you to
volunteer to put those up.

54
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:02,938
I didn't volunteer.

55
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:05,010
Okay.

56
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,149
Happy Valentine's Day.

57
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:09,486
Oh, thanks, Lydia.

58
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:12,492
Oh, and here's another
one for<i> your</i> stash.

59
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:13,696
Thank you.

60
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:15,700
Uh, hello.

61
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,439
Whoa-hoa!

62
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,775
Amy, Brooke...

63
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,111
Hey...

64
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:22,326
Wendy, Patty...

65
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,929
Come on. Who are these women?

66
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:25,521
I don't even remember them.

67
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:26,735
Oh, Carter, you're so cold.

68
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,262
No, I mean, I don't
remember meeting them.

69
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,599
Please! Help! Quick!

70
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:32,470
I hit him.

71
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:34,657
He dashed off the
sidewalk chasing a ball.

72
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:36,462
I tried to swerve the car.

73
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:37,730
We've got an M.V.A.

74
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:38,799
Please!

75
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:39,869
I'll page Benton.

76
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:41,138
Okay, go in here.

77
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:53,264
All right, let's clear
a trauma room.

78
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,431
39-year-old male fell from
a second-story balcony.

79
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:56,488
Watch yourself, ma'am.

80
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,308
Hypotensive, abdomen's rigid.

81
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,229
Mrs. Hall.

82
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:04,707
Mrs. Hall, wait.

83
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:07,022
Jerry, will you let me know

84
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:08,726
when Mrs. Hall
comes back in again?

85
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,753
Sure. Thanks.

86
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,661
I tried to dodge him, you know.

87
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,997
Scalp laceration.

88
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:17,334
I can't hear a thing.

89
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,338
He just came out of nowhere.

90
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:22,010
He's got a fractured
left front radius.

91
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:24,014
Where do you want the I.V.?

92
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,030
Please help him, okay, Doc?

93
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:27,355
All right, give me the bullet.

94
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,792
Car versus canine. Possible...

95
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:30,239
Car versus canine?
Got a fractured

96
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:31,998
left front leg, or
maybe it's radius ulna.

97
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:34,437
Nobody's quite sure
how to take the BP. A dog.

98
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:36,395
You called me
down here for a dog.

99
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:38,680
We called the vet's office.
They're sending someone over.

100
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:39,499
So what do we do now?

101
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:41,519
I think I'll name him Bill.

102
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,668
What, are you crazy?
You don't like the name Bill?

103
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,857
Yeah, well, you can call
him whatever you want to,

104
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,059
but you better do it fast,

105
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,606
'cause little Bill here
has stopped breathing.

106
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:01,029
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

107
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,690
He's one of God's
creatures, for God's sake.

108
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:42,018
I'm not a vet,
Grabarsky. You could try.

109
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:44,188
No, I'll be upstairs trying
to take a gallbladder

110
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:45,859
out of a<i> Homo sapien.</i>

111
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,603
Did I miss anything?

112
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:52,607
You were only gone ten seconds.

113
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,188
Poor little guy.
No collar, no tags.

114
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:55,491
He must be a lost or a stray.

115
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:57,217
I should have taken dog lab

116
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:58,497
instead of pig lab.

117
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,703
Digestive system,
abdomen... whoa.

118
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,005
Look at that spleen.

119
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:03,330
Wow!

120
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:05,179
Could we hurry this up, please?

121
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:06,583
I.V. Goes in what vein?

122
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,055
Uh, try the large one, and
then give him some saline.

123
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,216
Somebody find out
where the hell the vet is.

124
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,614
Okay, here it is... intubation.

125
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:16,358
It's just like with a human
being, except when you

126
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:17,678
push back the tongue,

127
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:19,159
you can see the vocal cords.

128
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:20,886
All right. Get an ambu bag.

129
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,722
Let's intubate.

130
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,333
Pneumothorax right there.

131
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,185
A what?

132
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,666
Collapsed lung. Oh, my God.

133
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,937
Lydia, could you get
a 20-gauge needle

134
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:33,262
on a 60cc syringe

135
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,684
with a three-way stopcock.

136
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,051
Which intercostal
does it go between?

137
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:40,377
Uh, try the eighth,
below the heart.

138
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:41,558
All right.

139
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:42,549
Hold that.

140
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:43,585
Yeah.

141
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,038
Easy, now.

142
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:46,354
Hold it.

143
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:51,703
Bill lives.

144
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:55,109
Oh...

145
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,146
Hey!

146
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,535
All right well, all we have
to do is sew up the lac

147
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,870
and get a cast on
him, and he'll be

148
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,190
chasing squirrels
by the afternoon.

149
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:07,319
Well, Carter, Chen, I think
you can take it from here.

150
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:09,123
Somebody call housekeeping.

151
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:11,093
Tell them to get a hose.

152
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,275
No problem.

153
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:13,599
That was pretty cool

154
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:15,838
the way you gave
it mouth-to-mouth.

155
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:17,274
Yeah? Thank you.

156
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,412
You know, they
say the dog's mouth

157
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:21,551
is the cleanest
part of its body.

158
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:23,899
What do they say about its nose?

159
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:29,462
So, she said nothing
during the exam?

160
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:30,765
Nothing. I don't get it.

161
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,891
She brings in the little
girl, then disappears,

162
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,262
she leaves a fake phone number.

163
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:36,210
Why would somebody
do that? I have no idea.

164
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:39,050
How could somebody do that?
But we don't know the whole story.

165
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:41,377
We know we can't
reach her anywhere.

166
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:44,249
You know what, I'm going to
move Tatiana out to curtain two

167
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:46,788
so she doesn't feel
so alone back here.

168
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,726
Then I guess I'll have to call

169
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:50,630
Children and Family Services.

170
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:52,701
Thanks, Haleh.

171
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,038
Sure.

172
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:55,941
Well, that wasn't

173
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:57,896
so bad, was it?

174
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:00,401
Tatiana.

175
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,205
<i>Eta imya</i>

176
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,162

00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:07,048

My mother's Russian.

180
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,021
How do you say hello?

181
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:22,449
Tatiana, uh... I'm Dr. Ross.

182
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,155
I'm Doug. I'm... I'm Doug.

183
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,993
Okay.

184
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,197
So you do speak
a little English.

185
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,534
Okay.

186
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,604
Okay.

187
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,508
So you don't.

188
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:36,179
You just stay right here,

189
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:37,782
and we're going
to take care of you.

190
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:41,708
<i>Kak tebya zovut?</i>

191
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:44,063
Oh, um...

192
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,036
<i>Zovut Carol.</i>

193
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:54,885
That was normal.

194
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,201
What do you mean?

195
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,592
It's Valentine's Day.

196
00:07:57,628 --> 00:08:00,565
It's like full moons...
All the crazies come out.

197
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:01,602
Ow.

198
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:03,416
What's wrong with your neck?

199
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,509
I slept on the sofa last night.

200
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:06,911
Oh, sorry I asked.

201
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:08,582
Want to tell me about it?

202
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:09,952
Well, it's about five feet long.

203
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,489
It's got little
blue flowers on it,

204
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,340
and there's a spectacular stain
on the right cushion Okay! Okay!

205
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:16,945
Right where Rachel did some
projectile vomiting... Mark...

206
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,371
Mark. Still waiting

207
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,375
on that stomachache
and migraine.

208
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,214
I am going to go
get something to eat.

209
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,887
I'm loving this
semi-foul mood of yours.

210
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,559
Yeah. Well, imagine
if we'd lost the dog.

211
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,561
See you.

212
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:30,563
Bye.

213
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,900
Doug.

214
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:33,504
"Do not steal. Benton."

215
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,975
Is there anything
good to eat in there?

216
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:38,258
Think Susan really
wants this yogurt?

217
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:39,583
No.

218
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,865
So you and Jen
valentining tonight?

219
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,193
She left for Milwaukee
this morning.

220
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:46,264
You? No, no, no. Never.

221
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,170
I always work the night
shift on Valentine's Day

222
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:50,919
to avoid any possible
dating conflicts.

223
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,177
That sounds mature.

224
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:53,725
Believe me, I
learned the hard way.

225
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:56,185
Dr. Ross, an ambulance
is bringing a 17-year-old in.

226
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,224
Crushed legs... Some
kind of train accident.

227
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,961
Dr. Benton said to get you.

228
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,330
Thank you, Wendy.

229
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:05,406
Can you believe
I said thank you?

230
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:07,321
Thank you, Wendy,
for letting me know

231
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:08,646
I get to work on some kid

232
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,151
whose legs have just
been pureed... that's weird.

233
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:14,325
Ah, I thought you'd
like some company.

234
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:15,995
<i>Sobaka! Sobaka!</i>

235
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,098
Is that okay?

236
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,668
We had to clear the
trauma room anyway.

237
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:19,704
Thanks.

238
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,676
Bill?

239
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,013
Bill.

240
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:27,186
Carol, I could use you
in curtain area three.

241
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:29,190
You know how Mark always says

242
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:31,596
Valentine's Day is
like the full moon,

243
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:33,600
all the nut cases come out?

244
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:35,717
I never really thought about it.

245
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,141
Cheerleaders.

246
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,411
Cheerleaders?

247
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,747
On acid.

248
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,752
Sounds like, uh, Mark was right.

249
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,601
Okay, are you Kirk Driscoll?

250
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,924
Sure.

251
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,430
I'm Dr. Lewis. This
is Nurse Hathaway.

252
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,935
All three of these
girls ingested LSD?

253
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:51,105
Yeah.

254
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:53,176
Are you sure it
was straight LSD,

255
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:55,046
not mixed with anything else?

256
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:58,254
Yeah. I got them right
here if you want to check.

257
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,657
You laced chocolates?

258
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:01,027
Pretty stupid, huh?

259
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:02,130
Huh.

260
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:04,028
I only let them eat two each.

261
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:06,890
They could have had a
seizure, kidney damage,

262
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,093
gone into a coma.

263
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:10,180
We're going to have to
keep them here for a while,

264
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:12,518
make sure there's no
dangerous side effects.

265
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:15,269
You don't have to tell the
cops or anything, do you?

266
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:16,661
Yeah, we do.

267
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:19,433
Better yet, we get
to tell your parents.

268
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:26,626
Any Valentine's Day plans?

269
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,763
Nope.

270
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:28,966
No big date or anything?

271
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,956
Nope.

272
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:30,958
So, what was that about?

273
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:32,206
The, uh, you know, the flowers

274
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,543
and the chocolates
in the fridge?

275
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,534
What's that all about?

276
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:35,652
Oh, that?

277
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:36,832
Yeah, that. What's that about?

278
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:38,158
I met this pediatrician...

279
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:40,273
You what?

280
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:41,665
Do what?

281
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,985
What?!

282
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:44,254
Hey!

283
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,624
Hey, Peter, what?

284
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:51,837
What do you got?

285
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:53,841
Michael Clifford, 17 years old.

286
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:56,179
He lost a dare
with a freight train.

287
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:59,019
Leg and head injuries,
hypotensive, 80/60.

288
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:01,190
Fluid resuscitated 2,000cc's

289
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:03,797
brought the pressure up to 100.

290
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:05,979
Blood loss around
three to four units.

291
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:08,557
Someone get on
the horn with O.R.

292
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:10,761
Pulse 130, pulse ox 82.

293
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,735
Start him on some
ancef, one gram, I.V. push.

294
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,249
BP's dropped. 80/40.

295
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,886
Where the hell's
that o negative?

296
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,192
It's coming.

297
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:22,254
Popliteal.

298
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:24,191
No dorsalis pedis on the left.

299
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,861
Let's get an angiogram.

300
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:28,433
Ow! God! He's got my hand.

301
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,513
He's seizing!

302
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:30,617
Help!

303
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:31,768
He's seizing.

304
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,694
He's grabbing!

305
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,696
Calm down.

306
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:35,698
Grab a bite block.

307
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:36,902
He's breaking her hand.

308
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:38,171
He's breaking her hand!

309
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:40,459
Grab a bite block.

310
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:41,678
He's crushing it!

311
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:43,444
Stretch your fingers out.

312
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,688
Ten migs of Valium, I.V. push.

313
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:46,952
Now! Let's move!

314
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:49,563
No! Get him off!

315
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:23,069
Bounce back migraine in Six.

316
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:25,073
I already saw him.

317
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:27,411
No. You saw the one in One.

318
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,450
This is the one in Six.

319
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,367
Don't you guys work?

320
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,457
Want one?

321
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,626
No, thanks.

322
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,796
Hello.

323
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:53,145
Hi. You thought I
was in a bad mood?

324
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:54,470
What?

325
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,711
Ah.

326
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:58,830
Oh, my God.

327
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,166
I got to go.

328
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,535
No. Don't you dare leave me.

329
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:02,604
Dr. Lewis.

330
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:03,752
Dr. Kayson.

331
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:05,411
Will you be mine?

332
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,625
Excuse me?

333
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,037
Happy Valentine's Day.

334
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,384
Still 100.

335
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,920
McGillis is here.

336
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,742
I'll be right back, okay?

337
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,007
Carol, how long is
Sparky going to be with us?

338
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:44,278
Till Grabarsky
gets off duty tonight.

339
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:45,915
One of God's creatures.

340
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,085
Hmm.

341
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,220
Hmm.

342
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:07,542
Hey, Deb.

343
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:12,006
Deb, you all right?

344
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,943
What?

345
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,048
I said are you okay.

346
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:20,089
Yeah, sure.

347
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,559
Very okay.

348
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,024
She left over four hours ago.

349
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:24,326
Does that constitute
abandonment?

350
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,200
It does in my book.

351
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,898
Merits an investigation.

352
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:30,695
She dumps a sick child who's six, speaks
no English, has no clue what's going on.

353
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:32,177
Carol, it's okay. Tatiana needs

354
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,613
to stay here at least 24 hours,

355
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,618
maybe longer if she
doesn't get any better.

356
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,770
And what happens when she does?

357
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,397
Assuming mom's
still out of the picture,

358
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:42,504
Children and Family Services
will find her a foster home.

359
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,103
There's nothing else we can do.

360
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,985
I have a lot of work to do.

361
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:55,649
I'm being released today.

362
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,666
You've made a
remarkable recovery.

363
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,692
I couldn't have done it

364
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:01,096
without you, Susan.

365
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:03,044
May I call you Susan?

366
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,268
Uh, sure.

367
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,818
So, you said there was something
you needed to talk to me about.

368
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:10,159
Every cardiologist ought to
go through what I went through.

369
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:13,890
Lying on that gurney, not
knowing whether you're going

370
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,729
to live or die, and
seeing the face

371
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:19,696
of this lovely young
resident hovering over you.

372
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,694
I can understand how it must
have been very scary for you.

373
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:25,542
Oh, sure, it was
terrifying at first

374
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:27,046
but then exhilarating.

375
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,008
And now I've got a whole
new perspective on life...

376
00:15:30,043 --> 00:15:31,945
My own and my patients'.

377
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,197
That's terrific.

378
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,537
I, uh, I really should get back.

379
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,552
Have you thought
about cardiology, Susan?

380
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:38,844
Uh, well...

381
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,993
Because I think you'd
be an excellent candidate,

382
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:44,857
and I'd like to help you...
Be a... a mentor of sorts.

383
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:47,562
Thank you, Dr. Kayson, but...

384
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:49,250
No, please, call me Jack.

385
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:51,555
I'm still doing my
E.R. residency.

386
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,965
I think I should just
stick with that for now.

387
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,605
I think we should talk more
about this some other time.

388
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,627
Yeah, sure, that'd be fine.

389
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:03,163
Tonight, 8:00?

390
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:04,633
Dinner?

391
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:12,801
How's the pain?

392
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:15,039
I had a fifth of Demerol.

393
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,243
You mean 50
milligrams of Demerol?

394
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,412
Yeah.

395
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:20,529
I see that it's working.

396
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:22,567
Can you wiggle
these fingers for me?

397
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,263
I should stick with decorating.

398
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:29,683
Yeah, this guy crushed
your hand pretty good.

399
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:31,753
You've got three
metacarpal fractures,

400
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:33,223
but I think you'll survive.

401
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:35,127
I'll get somebody
to put a cast on.

402
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,486
How's the boy?

403
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:37,666
Boy?

404
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,002
The one who squeezed me,

405
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:41,864
got hit by that train.

406
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,367
He died...

407
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,670
up in O.R.

408
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,173
Ah, Dr. Greene

409
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,155
dueling meat-packers
coming in...

410
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,622
About five minutes away.

411
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:52,938
Carol.

412
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,207
What?!

413
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:55,210
Whoa.

414
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:56,379
Sorry.

415
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,994
Are we not loving our job today?

416
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,154
I am not loving the
limits of my job today,

417
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:03,394
watching that little girl sitting
out there completely abandoned.

418
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,331
Nothing we can do.

419
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,336
Maybe you need a change of pace.

420
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:09,218
How about a nice, greasy trauma?

421
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:10,877
Sunny-side up or over easy?

422
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:12,781
I think I can offer you both.

423
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:15,120
Okay, but how long
do I have to wait?

424
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:17,425
That's the beauty
of it... You don't.

425
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:20,476
Happy Valentine's Day, Doris.

426
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,946
Likewise, Dr. Greene.

427
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,474
Meet Mr. Lorenzo
Renzetti, 45, sturdy,

428
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,289
aluminum meat
hook firmly imbedded

429
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,558
in his upper left bicep.

430
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,150
How's that feel, Mr. Renzetti?

431
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,487
You can call me Lorenzo.

432
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:32,290
I don't know. It's not so bad.

433
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:35,364
Yeah, well, that's good,
'cause it sure looks bad.

434
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:37,836
Start an I.V. BP is
140/90, pulse 96, resps 16,

435
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:41,009
good distal pulses,
normal cap refill

436
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:44,361
defensive lacerations
on both arms.

437
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:46,020
Okay, Mr. Renzetti

438
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:48,403
we're going to take care of you.

439
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:50,574
People, we got to move him.

440
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,346
All right, on my count.

441
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,803
Watch your back.

442
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,352
Uh, on second thought

443
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,624
why don't you just scoot over.

444
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:59,014
Good. I got you.

445
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,685
You said this was a twofer.

446
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,200
Second guy, second unit.

447
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:03,825
I drove circles around him.

448
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,827
All right.

449
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:07,611
Hang some ancef,
one gram I.V. piggyback

450
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,349
and let's update
Lorenzo's tetanus.

451
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:11,042
I'll start a chart.

452
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:13,123
I already had that. I took my
wife to the Caribbean last year.

453
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:14,098
Oh, yeah? How was it?

454
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,645
It was all right.
It rained a lot.

455
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,716
You want a chest film?

456
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,142
Yep.

457
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:21,090
Call radiology
and get a portable!

458
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:22,560
Okay, Lorenzo, Lorenzo,
just stay down, okay?

459
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:23,551
Just take it easy.

460
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:25,032
I thought Paulie
would be here already.

461
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:26,569
They should have
brought him here first.

462
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:27,705
Who's Paulie? Do you feel this?

463
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:29,058
Sure. Paulie's my stupid kid.

464
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,528
He made a crack
about his mother.

465
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:31,502
I told him to shut up.

466
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:32,659
Okay, move your fingers.

467
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,893
I didn't want to fight him,
but he kept coming at me

468
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:35,895
Now your thumb. Now your wrist.

469
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,142
He kept jabbing me this way,

470
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,116
that way.

471
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,099
You know, you shouldn't
disrespect your mother.

472
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:41,357
Where is the son of a bitch?!

473
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:43,389
I'm sure he's on his
way, Mr. Renzetti.

474
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,227
Well, he better be,
'cause I'm telling you,

475
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:46,551
he's in worse shape than I am.

476
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:48,133
Okay, listen, we're
going to take you upstairs

477
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,659
and take this out in surgery.

478
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,862
There he is!
There he is! Paulie!

479
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:52,966
Hey, Paulie!

480
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,620
Paulie, I'm over here!

481
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:56,290
Your dad's over here!

482
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,910
Hey, Paulie!

483
00:18:57,945 --> 00:19:00,147
Hey, Paulie, you okay?

484
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,216
Son?

485
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,753
Carol, come with me.

486
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,456
Paulie, you all right?

487
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:05,605
All right, CBC!

488
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:06,673
He's in V-fib!

489
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,582
Hold him down!

490
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:09,784
Paulie, I'm right here, son!

491
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:10,804
I'm right here.

492
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,290
Come on.

493
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:13,794
Damn it, is he all right?

494
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:14,930
200!

495
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:15,967
Charging!

496
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,267
Clear! Paulie!

497
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:18,437
Dad's over here!

498
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:19,673
You okay?

499
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:20,927
300!

500
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:21,963
Charging!

501
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:23,297
Hey, is he okay?

502
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,300
Clear.

503
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:25,302
He's okay, right?

504
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,304
Still in fib.

505
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,506
Damn it! 360!

506
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,805
And charging.

507
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:29,795
Hey, Paulie!

508
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:30,931
Calm down.

509
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,953
God!

510
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,188
Paulie!

511
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:35,741
He needs more volume.

512
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,245
Hang the O-neg.

513
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,763
Give me the tray.

514
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,125
Hey, hey, hey.

515
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,995
It's okay.

516
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,036
Okay. Okay.

517
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,090
It's going to be okay.

518
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,493
You'll be fine.

519
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,006
Exam two. Okay?

520
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:30,109
Here we go.

521
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,713
This way, you guys.

522
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:33,517
There you go. All right.

523
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:36,189
We'll be with you
in just a second.

524
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:39,195
Come on. You have to
admit, they're pretty cute.

525
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,133
They have been spray painted

526
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,071
which has given them hives.

527
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:45,543
Children with
hives are not cute.

528
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,148
So, Peter, about
the flower and candy

529
00:20:48,184 --> 00:20:49,752
in the refrigerator...

530
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:51,088
Mm-hmm?

531
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:54,496
Are you going to make
me guess who they're for?

532
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:56,065
They're for my mother.

533
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:57,067
Mm-hmm.

534
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,137
Really.

535
00:20:58,172 --> 00:20:59,339
Oh, yeah!

536
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:04,919
Oh, um, excuse me.

537
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:07,276
Where is Exam Room One?

538
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:18,397
Thanks for moving her.

539
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:19,435
Oh, sure.

540
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,638
She insisted on bringing Bill.

541
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:22,741
Oh.

542
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:24,978
<i>Drivet,</i> Tatiana.

543
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:25,980
<i>Drivet.</i>

544
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:27,584
Hello and good-bye...

545
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,956
That and about ten other words

546
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,760
is the extent of my Russian.

547
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:33,764
They're kind of
perfect together.

548
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:36,738
No idea where they
are or what they're doing.

549
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,210
Neither one of
them seem to mind.

550
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:41,982
Yeah, except the dog gets to
go home with Grabarsky tonight.

551
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,521
Maybe her mom will come back.

552
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:46,342
Mm, I don't think
"mom" is the right word.

553
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:47,344
Carter?

554
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,330
Yeah?

555
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:49,743
Dr. Ross needs you

556
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,205
to help with some
kids. Exam Two.

557
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,810
Okay. Hey, how do
you say good-bye?

558
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,214
<i>Dosvedanya.</i>

559
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,084
<i>Dospen... nana,</i> Tatiana.

560
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,454
Okay.

561
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:13,935
Carter, tell Dr. Ross
I need him now.

562
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:15,371
Okay.

563
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:28,984
Hey, Deb.

564
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:44,853
Are you Wendy Goldman?

565
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,525
Yes... Deb.

566
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,866
Yeah. I'm Deborah Chen.

567
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:52,067
I know that.

568
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:55,542
I had the hardest
time finding you.

569
00:22:55,578 --> 00:23:00,119
Um, I'm going to
be doing your cast.

570
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:07,334
How long was he in the hot tub?

571
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:08,336
Half hour.

572
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:09,450
40 Minutes. Maybe more.

573
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:10,652
Any wine? Champagne.

574
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:11,856
How much? A little.

575
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,847
More than a little.

576
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:13,849
A couple of bottles.

577
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:14,895
It was Valentine's Day.

578
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,298
Eddie wanted something special.

579
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:17,802
He got lightheaded.
Got nauseous.

580
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:18,838
Then he threw up.

581
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:20,161
It was horrible.

582
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:21,377
Then he sank. Like a deadweight.

583
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,679
We went under. Both of us.

584
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,546
Pulled him up. Got
him on the cement.

585
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:25,541
Ran to the house...

586
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:26,888
called 911. Called 911.

587
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:28,124
You did the right thing.

588
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:29,115
Good.

589
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,685
We'll take it from here.

590
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,291
We're going to take
his temperature now.

591
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:34,293
Okay. Okay.

592
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:35,462
Rectally.

593
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,980
You might want to wait outside.

594
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,141
We'll be right back, okay?

595
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:43,513
You still think it's
upper respiratory?

596
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,584
Well, now that she's hydrated

597
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,586
I heard rales.

598
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:48,056
Could be pneumonia

599
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:51,463
or some other foreign virus
that we know nothing about.

600
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:52,867
Fever spiked up to 104.

601
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:55,673
I'm going to put a
rush on that X ray.

602
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,243
You give her acetaminophen?

603
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:58,423
Yeah. 15 per kilo.

604
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,951
God, all the times my mother
tried to teach me Russian.

605
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:03,256
All the times your mother
yelled at me in Russian.

606
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,358
Oh, you deserved it.

607
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:05,439
Hey.

608
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:08,167
Dr. B, Mrs. Hayden,
85, fell and cut her arm.

609
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:11,708
She's in the suture room
and she's a tad senile.

610
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,111
All right, give it to Carter.

611
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:16,084
He's busy taking care
of six small, red children.

612
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,688
All right, well,
where's the other one?

613
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:18,834
Deb Chen? Yeah, her.

614
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,870
Doing a cast.

615
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,361
All right. Have her wait.

616
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:22,932
I have to go to Radiology

617
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,034
Is Dr. Ross here?

618
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,470
Uh, what's wrong?

619
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,941
I'm Jake Leeds.

620
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:29,012
I need to talk to Dr. Ross.

621
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,995
Uh, look, he's
very busy right now.

622
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,463
I can find someone else...

623
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:33,454
Hey, Jake.

624
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:34,457
For you.

625
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:35,459
What's wrong?

626
00:24:35,494 --> 00:24:37,130
My side and my stomach.

627
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,332
It really hurts.

628
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,403
Okay, we're going to take
him over to curtain two.

629
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,174
Do me a favor... call
his mom, Diane Leeds.

630
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,343
She's up in Risk Management.

631
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:44,345
Sure, Dr. Ross.

632
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,413
Carol?

633
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:46,416
Yeah.

634
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:47,619
Come on, buddy.

635
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,289
All right, what's wrong?

636
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:50,524
Where's it hurt?

637
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,740
Here we go.

638
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,002
It started here in my stomach,

639
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:57,808
but now it feels
like it's over here.

640
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:58,888
Mm-hmm.

641
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:00,491
All right, like this?

642
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,417
Yeah. There. It hurts there.

643
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:05,424
Mm-hmm. Any vomiting or nausea?

644
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:06,426
Uh-huh.

645
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:07,763
Right after gym.

646
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,132
Temp's normal.

647
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:11,215
Okay. Let's get
a CBC, urinalysis

648
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,286
and set him up
for an ultrasound.

649
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,311
Okay.

650
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:15,858
All right, Jake, hang tight.

651
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,829
We're going to
check you out, okay?

652
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:20,602
Where are we going to put him?

653
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:22,895
Admitting him.
Straight upstairs.

654
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,300
Haleh, could you
tell those two hookers

655
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:27,438
that their friend Ed
is doing just fine?

656
00:25:27,474 --> 00:25:30,044
I think they'd rather
talk to a doctor.

657
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,650
Could you tell
them I'll meet them

658
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:34,253
in the waiting room?

659
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:36,190
So, what was that with Kayson?

660
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:39,464
What? Oh. Uh, you know,
he just wanted to tell me

661
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,935
that he was fine.

662
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,404
Thank me, you know?

663
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:44,676
Nice try. I saw the bouquet.

664
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:45,745
Oh, God.

665
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,081
Did anyone else?

666
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:48,685
It was so embarrassing.

667
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,887
It's all right.

668
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,691
He just gave you flowers.

669
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:54,998
It's not like he asked
you out or anything.

670
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:56,435
He asked you out?

671
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,549
Dinner, tonight.

672
00:25:57,573 --> 00:25:59,140
What did you say?

673
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:00,421
I said...

674
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:02,748
Oh, uh, Mark,
chopper on the way.

675
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:05,487
Some woman choked
on her Valentine's dinner.

676
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,490
Okay.

677
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,093
I said, no, I couldn't,

678
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:10,766
that I was doing
something with you.

679
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,770
Oh, you dragged me into it?!

680
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,173
Mark, he's married.

681
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,652
Yeah, well, so am I.

682
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,405
You're looking better, Jake.

683
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:23,744
Are you feeling better?

684
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,717
Uh, no.

685
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,756
Uh-huh. Dr. Ross tells me

686
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:31,595
that you're a very
good basketball player.

687
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,898
Yes, I am.

688
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:36,973
I'm probably better than
he is, except he's older.

689
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,544
Is he divorced?

690
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,781
What?

691
00:26:40,817 --> 00:26:43,754
My mom says divorced
people have baggage.

692
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:47,496
Oh. Well, he isn't divorced.

693
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:49,533
Then he doesn't have baggage.

694
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:54,695
Well, I wouldn't
say that, exactly.

695
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,697
He's faking.

696
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:57,701
How can you know that?

697
00:26:57,737 --> 00:27:00,107
Because he has that
moany quality in his voice

698
00:27:00,142 --> 00:27:03,492
like when he wants to stay
home from school to avoid a test.

699
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:04,917
Could be appendicitis...

700
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:06,431
Dr. Ross, he's done this before.

701
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:07,589
Faked illness?

702
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:10,396
No. Tried to set me
up with single men.

703
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:11,398
What?

704
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:12,980
He likes you. I'm his mother

705
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:14,683
and he's stuck with me.

706
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:16,353
He thinks if he can get us

707
00:27:16,377 --> 00:27:18,624
to spend a little time together

708
00:27:18,648 --> 00:27:20,128
then we will
naturally, you know...

709
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:21,119
Well, that's...

710
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,655
Obviously ridiculous.

711
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,762
Obviously...

712
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:27,783
And he's done this before?

713
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:30,656
Oh, yeah. I've been through
five or six departments

714
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,993
in this hospital alone,

715
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:33,741
not to mention hardware stores.

716
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:36,468
Jake feels that I should
either be with a doctor

717
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:39,275
or a man who knows his
way around nuts and bolts.

718
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,683
Mm. So how do you
suggest we handle this?

719
00:27:44,572 --> 00:27:46,039
Let's cut

720
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:47,042
him open.

721
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:48,358
Mm.

722
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:51,067
The kid's faking it.

723
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,642
Dr. Ross, test results back
on that little Russian girl.

724
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:55,778
Okay.

725
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:57,614
Oh, man.

726
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,987
Her white count's at 2,000.

727
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,590
You mean 20,000.

728
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,360
No, two.

729
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:06,100
And she has pneumonia.

730
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:10,309
She's got AIDS.

731
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:25,276
Mrs. Hayden...

732
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,912
Mrs. Hayden?

733
00:28:26,947 --> 00:28:28,059
Uh, yes?

734
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,689
Uh, how did you get in here?

735
00:28:31,724 --> 00:28:35,263
There, uh... there is no starch.

736
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:38,370
No, no.

737
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:39,706
You know what?

738
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,446
We're out of starch.

739
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,219
But I need it for Joe's uniform.

740
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:47,256
Okay. Just sit right here.

741
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,563
Uh, you know what?

742
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:54,238
I'm going to have to take
a look at this arm, okay?

743
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,707
Uh-huh.

744
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:59,148
Now, I don't suppose
you remember

745
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:03,792
if you're allergic to
lidocaine or novocaine?

746
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:07,233
Some of the wives don't bother.

747
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:12,010
Okay. Well, we're just
going to have to jump in here.

748
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:15,417
Joe likes his uniform
and his collar crisp.

749
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:16,820
Mm-hmm.

750
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:27,945
Would... would you like
me to iron<i> your</i> uniform?

751
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:36,063
Yeah.

752
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:37,265
Yeah.

753
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,301
All right.

754
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:40,037
That would be great.

755
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:45,181
I just don't understand how
that woman could do that.

756
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,396
It doesn't matter.

757
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,799
It sure as hell does to Tatiana.

758
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:49,469
The situation is what it
is; we'll do what we can.

759
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:50,672
Yeah, well, it isn't much.

760
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:52,107
I mean, we give
her some antibiotics,

761
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:54,112
we bring down her
fever and we kick her out?

762
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:56,317
Children and Family
Services will find someplace

763
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:58,054
She's got AIDS,
Doug. For her to stay.

764
00:29:58,078 --> 00:29:59,680
She doesn't even
speak the language.

765
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,417
That barely makes
her a good candidate

766
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:02,587
for being a foster child.

767
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:05,003
That's right, so what do
you suggest that we do?

768
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:06,327
Anything else.

769
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:08,343
There isn't anything else.

770
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:10,203
I know.

771
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:12,876
You know, these
patients come in here

772
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,882
for an hour, maybe
two, maybe a day.

773
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:18,287
We treat them as fast as we can.

774
00:30:18,322 --> 00:30:20,157
We barely learn their names

775
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:22,696
and then we send them home.

776
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:25,537
Which is usually what they want.

777
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:29,611
Yeah. Well, they usually
have a home to go to.

778
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:31,148
Uh, Dr. Ross?

779
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:34,155
You still got those
chicken pox in three.

780
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,471
Fine, Jerry.

781
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm sorry that the person
who was with you yesterday

782
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,003
isn't here today.

783
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:16,548
And I'm sorry that none of
us will be with you tomorrow.

784
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:25,300
And I'm glad you
can't understand

785
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:27,337
what's happening to you.

786
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,330
Neither can I.

787
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:57,786
Malik, move these hearts.

788
00:31:57,821 --> 00:31:58,988
Let's go, let's go.

789
00:31:59,024 --> 00:32:01,194
We're going to Trauma Two.

790
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:02,797
What have you got?

791
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:03,999
Anaphylaxis.

792
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:05,336
She's allergic, my wife.

793
00:32:05,372 --> 00:32:07,352
You know, to shrimp and
scallops and all that stuff.

794
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,944
Susan, this is Mr. Goodwin.

795
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:10,414
Mr. Goodwin, this is Dr. Lewis.

796
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,285
We didn't know. I
mean, we didn't order it.

797
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,490
It must have been an appetizer.

798
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:16,894
Okay, we're going to take
care of your wife, Mr. Goodwin.

799
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:17,997
You need to wait outside.

800
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:20,012
It happened once before,
at a wedding reception

801
00:32:20,036 --> 00:32:22,118
and her throat swelled
up, but nothing like this.

802
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,476
One, two, three.

803
00:32:24,814 --> 00:32:27,585
Lydia, show Mr. Goodwin
where he can wait.

804
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,954
Come on, Mr. Goodwin.

805
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,594
Upper airway
obstruction with stridor.

806
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,900
She's hypotensive.

807
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:36,237
BP's 45 palp.

808
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:37,640
I'll intubate.

809
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:41,314
Haleh, get a 6.5 and
prep for a crike just in case.

810
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,655
Epi, one to 10,000,
2cc's I.V. push.

811
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,203
Oh, man, this is hopeless...
Throat's completely swollen.

812
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:52,538
Let's crike her.

813
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:53,859
Grab a trach tube.

814
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,972
Benadryl I.V., 50 milligrams

815
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:02,610
and Cimetidine
I.V. 300 milligrams.

816
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,681
Okay.

817
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,051
All right.

818
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:12,047
Pressure's stabilizing, 100/80.

819
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:14,470
Pulse ox 96.

820
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:15,572
Nice.

821
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:16,992
Thank you.

822
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:19,814
Start an epi drip,
one milligram in 250

823
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,417
at 10 mics per minute.

824
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:25,777
Keep her on antihistamines
until the swelling comes down.

825
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:27,916
Oh, God, oh, God. Mark!

826
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:32,358
What the hell happened?

827
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:35,014
Lydia, get her
husband in here,<i> now.</i>

828
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,328
Pressure's crashing.

829
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,605
We got to scope her.

830
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,908
Okay.

831
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,697
Did I perforate the esophagus?

832
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:43,849
No, you couldn't have.

833
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:44,852
What'd I do wrong?

834
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:45,855
Nothing.

835
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,090
Get a CBC,

836
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,161
type and cross six units.

837
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:50,358
Lytes, LFT's, amylase.

838
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:51,684
Oh, my God.

839
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,186
What happened?

840
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:54,368
What happened?

841
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:56,227
Lydia, call for o-neg.

842
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:58,231
Mr. Goodwin, has your
wife been vomiting recently?

843
00:33:58,267 --> 00:33:59,368
No.

844
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:01,087
Does she have
any history of ulcer?

845
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,385
No. No.

846
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:04,511
She has bleeding
varices. SB tube.

847
00:34:04,547 --> 00:34:06,967
Varices? What the hell<i> is</i> this?

848
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:09,272
Mr. Goodwin, is your
wife an alcoholic?

849
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,768
Is she?!

850
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,888
Yes.

851
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:18,519
All right, get the
catcher's mask.

852
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:20,145
Let's roll her over.

853
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,230
Okay, inflate the
balloon to 200cc's.

854
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:32,639
It's in the stomach.

855
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:36,348
Okay, inflate the esophageal
balloon to 40 millimeters.

856
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:46,219
It's stopped.

857
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:49,158
Great pickup, Susan.

858
00:34:57,746 --> 00:34:58,913
Okay.

859
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:00,717
Well, her fever's
back down to 100.

860
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:02,455
You're feeling
better, aren't you?

861
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,592
Jerry, will you keep
an eye on her for me?

862
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:05,962
Sure. Thanks.

863
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,180
I should have gone
into real estate.

864
00:35:09,204 --> 00:35:10,505
That bad, huh?

865
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,521
I can't believe I got
off two hours ago.

866
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:14,848
Carol, can I borrow a pen? Yeah.

867
00:35:14,883 --> 00:35:16,284
We got to do something, right?

868
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:18,623
I don't want Kayson to
think that you're a liar.

869
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,025
Carol, you want to come?

870
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,640
Oh, thanks, but I'm on tonight.

871
00:35:21,664 --> 00:35:23,332
Sorry. Bye.

872
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:46,332
She's very ill.

873
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:49,606
I know.

874
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:52,085
You can't take her home tonight.

875
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,886
I know.

876
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,292
After this morning, I'm not sure

877
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:01,465
you'll ever be able
to take her home.

878
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:07,212
I don't want to.

879
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:27,873
Mrs. Hayden?

880
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:36,960
Mrs. Hayden?

881
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:47,168
I guess you found
the starch, huh?

882
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:57,538
When I found out that
I could adopt Tatiana,

883
00:36:57,573 --> 00:37:00,343
I bought a
Russian-English dictionary.

884
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:03,717
Never got much beyond
hello and good-bye.

885
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:04,987
Mrs. Hall...

886
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,492
Can you imagine
anything worse...

887
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:10,865
than abandoning
a child with AIDS?

888
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:13,823
No.

889
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:17,447
She was diagnosed last
Thursday at St. John's.

890
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:20,202
Look, Mrs. Hall, or
whatever your name is,

891
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,742
I'm not exactly sure
why you're here,

892
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,958
but I'm not all that interested

893
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:28,120
in listening to you
say how sorry you are.

894
00:37:29,558 --> 00:37:32,530
My husband died three years ago.

895
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:35,670
It was... long and slow.

896
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:37,608
You know, I was young.

897
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:40,430
You get through, you go on.

898
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:43,603
I never really felt that
loss until last week.

899
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:46,911
I never allowed
myself to feel it

900
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:48,982
until I...

901
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:53,425
I looked at Tatiana

902
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,430
and I said...

903
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:57,836
"There it is."

904
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:03,047
I cannot...

905
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:07,156
I will not let myself get
that close to someone

906
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:09,560
and lose them again.

907
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:16,559
I brought her things.

908
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:49,630
I forgot how to say good-bye.

<i>Dosvedanya.</i>

910
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:13,817
Ma?

911
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,379
Ma?

912
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,632
Ma?

913
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,454
Ma?

914
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:55,924
Ma.

915
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:18,624
Happy Valentine's Day.

916
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,630
This is fun?

917
00:40:31,654 --> 00:40:33,356
<i>This</i> is fun.

918
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:35,360
It's 20 degrees out.

919
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,498
Okay, this is fun.

920
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:39,904
Did I tell you that Morgenstern

921
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:42,309
offered me a job as
attending next year?

922
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:43,723
What?! No, you didn't tell me.

923
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:46,116
Oh, that's right.
It was last week.

924
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,120
You weren't talking to me then.

925
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,937
So? You were talking to me.

926
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,495
What'd you tell him?

927
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,500
That I had to think about it.

928
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,647
Oh, please.

929
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:57,240
Well, you know, I mean,
there's Jennifer to consider,

930
00:40:57,276 --> 00:40:58,845
which I<i> didn't.</i>

931
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,648
What'd she say?

932
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:02,854
What do you think she said?

933
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:05,493
That "I'm happy for you, Mark,

934
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:07,931
because I know this is
what you really want"?

935
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,937
The, uh, "this is what
you really want" part?

936
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,174
That's right.

937
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:13,510
Sounds bad.

938
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:14,829
It was.

939
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:17,212
So, what are you going to do?

940
00:41:17,236 --> 00:41:20,776
I... am going to skate.

941
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,426
Whoa!

942
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,239
Help! I need a doctor!

943
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:30,629
Is there a doctor?

944
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:47,233
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wendy.

945
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:49,905
I understand that you
did it perfectly on the dog.

946
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,308
We'll fix it tomorrow.

947
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:53,713
I think I'm going to
stay home tomorrow.

948
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:55,250
Hang in there.

949
00:42:00,347 --> 00:42:02,483
Good night, everyone.
