1
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,863
Good morning.

2
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,330
I wouldn't go that far.

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,677
You're not allowed to be crabby.

4
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,941
You were off yesterday.

5
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,135
I got a call from Morgenstern
about Vennerbeck.

6
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,444
That M.I. that crumped?

7
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,772
Kayson claims I presented
the case incompetently.

8
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,008
Morgenstern wants me
in his office in an hour.

9
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,910
I want to throw up.

10
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:47,813
Yeah, well, Kayson's
just trying to cover his ass.

11
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,214
Morgenstern knows that.

12
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,448
Hey, maybe I'll get lucky

13
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,350
and Kayson will
fall in front of a bus.

14
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,619
Ix-nay on the ayson-kay.

15
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,888
Morning, Dr. Greene.

16
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,656
Morning.

17
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,699
Carol, have you seen Carter?

18
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,567
Took a D.B. to four.
Pathology's backed up.

19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,803
Yeah, well, what else is new?

20
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,471
Oh, sorry.

21
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,544
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

22
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,146
Dr. Benton?

23
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,148
Carter.

24
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,593
Carter!

25
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,917
What are you doing?

26
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,319
I'm sleeping.

27
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,865
Okay, well, you sleep
when I tell you to sleep.

28
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,355
Now, come on, get up.

29
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,434
I got a new student I
need you to break in. Yo!

30
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,708
Yo!

31
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:33,959
Come here.

32
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,377
What's your name?

33
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:36,545
Deb.

34
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:37,924
Yeah, right, well,
this is Carter.

35
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,025
He's going to show you around.

36
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:40,227
All right, she's all yours.

37
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:41,794
Uh, Dr. Benton, you're
not going up to the...

38
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:42,962
Yes, I am, and no, you can't.

39
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,197
I've got wall-to-wall surgeries

40
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,599
with a prima donna from Boston.

41
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:48,063
And the last thing I
need to do is baby-sit you.

42
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,727
Is he really dead?

43
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:55,964
Five bucks gets you
Super Lotto and Insta-pic.

44
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,043
Timmy?

45
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,099
Pass.

46
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,178
Carol? Oh, why not?

47
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,202
Morning, gang.

48
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,703
Timmy, what do we got?

49
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:04,539
Our specials for today
are suicidal junkie in four.

50
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:05,540
Going once...

51
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:06,609
I'll take it.

52
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:08,510
I could use a
little cheering up.

53
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:11,279
Hamster versus finger
in the suture room.

54
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,381
Ross took it.

55
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,717
HIV-positive kid with
a busted tooth in one.

56
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:16,786
Lots of blood.

57
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
What's an "L.L. Owie"?

58
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:19,554
That's a scissors
in the left leg.

59
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:20,689
It's a medical term.

60
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,268
Ubaldo's back, stinky as ever.

61
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,324
Oh, man.

62
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,403
He's drunk, possible seizure.

63
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:25,605
I could use a hand.

64
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,095
Double-glove time.

65
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,165
So, is this the perp?

66
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,267
His name is Royden B.

67
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,882
I thought you might want
to check him for rabies.

68
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,338
Oh, well, the only way

69
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,440
that Royden B. Could have rabies

70
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,776
is if he's been bitten
by a wild animal.

71
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,812
And given his lifestyle,
that's pretty unlikely.

72
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,079
The finger's infected.

73
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,993
It's probably because
Lucy's been sucking on it.

74
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:48,017
But we'll clean it up.

75
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,518
We'll give her some antibiotics,

76
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,252
and then your
daughter is going to be

77
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,254
good as new.

78
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:53,255
Niece.

79
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,373
Niece. Sorry.

80
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,492
There was a family resemblance.

81
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,522
You go to the fifth
street gym, don't you?

82
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,212
No, I've never been.

83
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,281
Mmm...

84
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,932
My mistake, but

85
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,384
you work out, though.

86
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,733
I can tell.

87
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,082
Excuse me.

88
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,338
Uh, well, you know,

89
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,874
um, I play a little
basketball now and then.

90
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,342
Bulls fan?

91
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,544
Yeah, I'm a Bulls fan.

92
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,561
I have a friend

93
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,548
who can get tickets, courtside.

94
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,898
That is, if you're interested.

95
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,453
You know, I have tickets

96
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:28,489
so maybe I'll just
see you there.

97
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,613
Care for a drink?

98
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,800
After you.

99
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:41,281
So you get away for the weekend?

100
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,571
Yeah, Tag and I rented a cottage

101
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,974
in Door County,
right on the lake.

102
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,309
Went ice fishing.

103
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:48,988
That was a highlight?

104
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,946
The one I can tell<i> you</i> about.

105
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,792
Have you guys set a date yet?

106
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,050
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

107
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:56,601
I mean, what's the big rush?

108
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,103
Sorry I asked.

109
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,572
No, it's just I feel like I've
finally gotten my life in order

110
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,708
and now it's all
shaken up again.

111
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,076
You having doubts?

112
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,611
Well, it's a big step.

113
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,764
I mean, it's natural to
have some doubts, right?

114
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,699
Maybe it's the forever part.

115
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,001
You know, it's like infinity.

116
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,586
It's hard getting a handle...

117
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,923
What?

118
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,224
Oh.

119
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,483
Bye-bye.

120
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,051
That was more than an invitation

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,286
to a basketball game.

122
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,455
I know, I've been invited
to basketball games.

123
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,534
Yeah, so what?

124
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,824
So I want an explanation.

125
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,326
Mark, grow up.

126
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,961
Does this mean that you
and Linda are that serious?

127
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,874
Serious? Our longest
phone conversation is

128
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,009
"get over here."

129
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,800
Yeah, so, then, what
happened in there?

130
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:35,801
Hey.

131
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:36,879
Hey, I've been summoned.

132
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,136
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

133
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,539
I'm just curious how
<i>you</i> can turn down

134
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,307
practically guaranteed sex

135
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,009
with an undeniably
attractive woman.

136
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,979
If that's all there is,
I'd rather play tennis.

137
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,665
This is disappointing
coming from you.

138
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,729
Nine times I've been stuck

139
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,464
and never caught
so much as the flu.

140
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,587
I've been lucky so far.

141
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,888
This makes five for me.

142
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,267
Isn't the chance of getting HIV

143
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,169
from a needle stick
like one in a hundred?

144
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,627
One out of every 250
if the patient's infected.

145
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,006
Well, when Ubaldo wakes up

146
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,842
I'll try and get a
consent from him

147
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,042
so we can test him.

148
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,944
And I'll get his t-cell
count regardless.

149
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:09,901
Thanks, Lydia.

150
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,469
Says here, to be safe,

151
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,838
you shouldn't have
unprotected sex

152
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,619
until<i> after</i> the
follow-up in six months.

153
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,075
Thanks, Wendy.

154
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,033
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

155
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,379
Serena. U.S. Customs Service.

156
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:27,602
Yeah, we're going this way.

157
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,870
What's the problem?

158
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,749
We picked him up at O'Hare
coming in from La Paz.

159
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,285
Source I.D.'d him
as a body packer.

160
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,876
He's got half a kilo of cocaine
in his belly wrapped in condoms.

161
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,055
Here. Sit right here.

162
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,545
<i>Sientese.</i>

163
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,047
What's your name?

164
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:41,065
Jorge. He doesn't speak English.

165
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,084
He's been retaining the
evidence, so to speak,

166
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,819
since we picked him
up eight days ago.

167
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:46,321
Eight days?

168
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,433
That sounds like one for the<i>
Guinness Book of Records.</i>

169
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,501
Well, you can't
blame him for trying

170
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:49,924
He's facing 20 years.

171
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,893
No obvious signs of toxicity.

172
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,223
The condom must still be intact.

173
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,324
If you can give him a laxative

174
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,615
it'd make my job easier.

175
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,795
Uh, I can't give
him any medication

176
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,063
without his consent.

177
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,686
Can I borrow a pen?

178
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,932
We'll work him up, x-ray him,

179
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,067
hope that nature
takes its course

180
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,424
before a condom breaks.

181
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:11,129
Jorge,<i> si un</i> condom
<i>con coca romper</i>

182
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,364
uh,<i> sera muy mal.</i>

183
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,402
Uh,<i> tu voy, a morir muy rapido.</i>

184
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,338
<i>Entiendo?</i>

185
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,617
<i>Si.</i>

186
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,575
Where'd you learn Spanish?

187
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,742
Here.

188
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,771
<i>We work Benton's hours, sleep</i>

189
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,124
when he sleeps, which
is practically never.

190
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,459
We've been on call
since yesterday morning

191
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,415
and he hasn't even sat down yet.

192
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,183
This is one of four I.V. carts.

193
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,329
Most patients get an I.V.

194
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,764
the second they
come through the door.

195
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,833
Angio cath, 16-needle
large bore, if they're bleeding.

196
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,167
You know how to
start an I.V., right?

197
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,123
Yeah. Oh, actually, no.

198
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,470
I thought you were third year?

199
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,327
Carter, we got a
body packer in four.

200
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,096
Work him up... K.U.B.,
drug screen, urinalysis.

201
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,331
Ever do a urinalysis?

202
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,399
Uh-uh.

203
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,366
Carter? Yeah?

204
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,367
Do a rectal.

205
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,102
This is your lucky day.

206
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,555
Can you ventilate him?

207
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,102
Yeah, as long as I get a seal.

208
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,370
I'm going to get...

209
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,661
What do we got?

210
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,196
Came in with
respiratory distress.

211
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:03,842
We were taking vitals
when he crashed.

212
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,866
Went from bradycardic
at 35 to flat line.

213
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,435
Temp's 104, blood culture sent.

214
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:09,148
Sounds like septic shock.

215
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,372
Let's give him an amp
of epi, a meg of atropine

216
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,308
and 1.5. of each
erythro and cefataxime.

217
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,508
What's going on?

218
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,509
Are you his father?

219
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,744
Yes.

220
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:17,990
We're giving him drugs
to stimulate his heart.

221
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,158
Epi and atopine on four.

222
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:20,214
Here's the epi.

223
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,493
Any heart sounds? Negative.

224
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:23,129
All right, let's piggyback
an isuprel drip.

225
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,585
This ever happened before?

226
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,332
Once, when he was
hospitalized for pneumonia.

227
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:27,288
Cerebral palsy?

228
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:28,500
No, he's brain damaged.

229
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:29,524
Got a pulse.

230
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,304
All right, heart is back.

231
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,277
He's in v-tach.

232
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,633
What the hell?

233
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,170
All right, hold the isuprel
now and give him Lidocaine.

234
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,317
50 Milligrams I.V. push.

235
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,484
What's happening?

236
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:46,618
His heart is racing.

237
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:47,575
Why?

238
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:48,754
I don't know.

239
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,356
Let's get the 12-lead in there.

240
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,958
I need to see what's going on.

241
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:53,442
Move that. Mm-hmm. Move it.

242
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,199
Stop the...

243
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,035
I tried to convince Kayson

244
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,605
that this kind of
finger-pointing

245
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,408
runs contrary to the spirit
of a teaching hospital.

246
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,476
Juice?

247
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,544
No, thank you.

248
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,446
He failed to see my point.

249
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,848
He's bringing disciplinary
charges against you.

250
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,277
What does that mean exactly?

251
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,019
You'll come before the
committee next week,

252
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,422
defend yourself, we'll
make a determination,

253
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,490
and steps will be
taken accordingly.

254
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,170
Dr. Morgenstern,
I want you to know

255
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,305
that I tried to present

256
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,439
Mr. Vennerbeck's history.

257
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,940
Dr. Kayson cut me off Susan...

258
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,592
and ordered him
released. Susan...

259
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,032
the specifics don't concern me

260
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,568
nearly as much as your
inability to assert yourself.

261
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,887
Excuse me?

262
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:35,473
You allowed Kayson
to intimidate you...

263
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,841
Not the first time.

264
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,120
I seem to recall a similar
incident with Benton

265
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,911
about a retrocecal appendix.

266
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,846
I was right about that.

267
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,409
But you deferred to<i>
Benton's</i> judgment.

268
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,632
That's my point.

269
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,234
You seem to lack the authority

270
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,014
to put forward
your<i> own</i> opinions,

271
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:50,922
to act as an aggressive
advocate for your patients.

272
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,357
I guess...

273
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,043
I have to work on that.

274
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:57,027
Yes, you do.

275
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:04,085
Confidence...

276
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:05,453
composure under pressure,

277
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,666
assertiveness.

278
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,817
These are the
requisite qualities

279
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,391
of a good E.R. Specialist.

280
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,411
I'm willing to give you the
chance to develop them.

281
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,280
If you don't, we're going
to have a future discussion

282
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,217
about which specialty might
best match your temperament.

283
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,706
Peaked t-waves, unstable rhythm.

284
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:26,708
Got to be his potassium, right?

285
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:27,787
Are his lytes back?

286
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,288
Not yet. Can't wait.

287
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:30,790
All right, let's give him
Calcium gluconate, 15 mils.

288
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:32,013
It could kill him.

289
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,192
Just do it.

290
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,766
Asystole.

291
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:35,978
All right, repeat
epi and atropine.

292
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:36,935
Doctor?

293
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,069
Sir, it looks like

294
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,314
your son's
potassium is too high,

295
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,604
probably from renal failure.

296
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,618
We're going to do everything
we can to bring it down.

297
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,802
I think I got a pulse...

298
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:44,826
Weak, but it's there.

299
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,261
B.P.'s 35 palp.

300
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:47,645
I'll take it.

301
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,091
His lytes are back.

302
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,326
Potassium's high... 7.5.

303
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,828
All right, we're
on the right track.

304
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,262
Stand by with
glucose and insulin.

305
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,152
Is he going to live?

306
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,581
It looks like he's
going to make it.

307
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,947
Carol, I heard you
got stuck again.

308
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,416
What is it, number four?

309
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,506
Count 'em.

310
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,986
Five. Wow, I've only got three.

311
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,387
Timmy, why don't you put me down

312
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,955
for emptying the
sharps containers.

313
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,259
I need to catch up.

314
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,847
Don't tempt the fates.

315
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,860
So you and Tag set a date yet?

316
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,117
Not yet.

317
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,689
Hey, how did it go?

318
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,935
How'd it go?

319
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,370
Well, it's... it's
hard to describe.

320
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,787
Timmy, where's
Petrofsky's chart?

321
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,329
Why, what happened?

322
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,375
You know, if I
told you right now,

323
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,679
I think I'd lose it.

324
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,920
Go down to exam two.

325
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,534
And you live at the
Marymount home?

326
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:50,102
For the emotionally disabled.

327
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,770
That's what society
has labeled me.

328
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,893
Timmy, what's open?

329
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,402
Trauma room.
Everything else is full.

330
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,530
Thanks.

331
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,432
When did this
shortness of breath start?

332
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,645
About a month ago, but
this week it got worse.

333
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,035
Are you on any medications?

334
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,015
Uh, yes. This is
my medical binder.

335
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,240
I've kept it since I was 14.

336
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,752
Medications are in orange...

337
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:09,088
Well, actually it'd be
more of a pumpkin.

338
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:12,847
And you take lithium,
depakote and synthroid.

339
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,415
Yes, I've taken these.

340
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,785
Um, my allergy section,
these pages are mauve,

341
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:19,787
vaccinations are gray,

342
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:22,457
doctors' names and
numbers are plum,

343
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,793
and past medical records
are in various shades of red

344
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,795
from vermillion to puce.

345
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,464
Very colorful.

346
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:30,798
Thank you.

347
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,800
And you're dressed all in blue.

348
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,469
Yes. It's Monday.

349
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,036
Ah.

350
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:42,577
Come on in, Alan.

351
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,346
I can't.

352
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:46,481
Why not?

353
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,082
It's green.

354
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:50,718
Is that bad?

355
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,904
Very.

356
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,580
He asleep?

357
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,915
Yeah.

358
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,250
I went and got a
few of his things.

359
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,429
Ben's pretty sick, Mr. Gaither.

360
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,797
He's got a bad case of pneumonia

361
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,298
which caused his heart
problems earlier today.

362
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,568
Hopefully, the antibiotics
will turn him around.

363
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,959
The last time, the doctors
put him on a ventilator.

364
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,304
Well, we may have to do that

365
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,907
if his blood gases
don't improve.

366
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:18,963
When will you know?

367
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,592
We'll check in an hour or so.

368
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:29,190
He likes rhythm.

369
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:31,859
You know, before the accident,

370
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:34,562
he was taking trumpet lessons.

371
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,130
Used the metronome to practice.

372
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,600
I don't think he remembers.

373
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,871
The kid had a hell of a bat.

374
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,941
Now if that picture isn't
there when he wakes up,

375
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,910
he gets his look.

376
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,696
What happened?

377
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:58,887
He's riding his bike to school

378
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:02,556
and this 85-year-old man
waves Ben across the street

379
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,927
then gets confused between
the brake and the accelerator.

380
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:09,313
Look, I got a job interview.

381
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,772
You got kids?

382
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,774
I have a son.

383
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,442
How old?

384
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,111
He's eight.

385
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,845
That's a nice age.

386
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,847
Okay, Deb, as we say
around here, quite often,

387
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,471
glove up and dig in.

388
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,473
Carter, isn't that your job?

389
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,019
Deb's got to learn.

390
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,976
Um, exactly what
am I looking for?

391
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,673
Ah, obstructions, masses,

392
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:42,630
anything out of the ordinary.

393
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,599
But I don't have
anything to compare it to.

394
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:47,468
Mm-hmm. You will soon.

395
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:51,806
Um, Mr. Jorge, could you
turn on your side, please?

396
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,808
<i>A tu lado.</i>

397
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,810
Thank you.

398
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,145
Ai!

399
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,479
I'm sorry.

400
00:14:58,547 --> 00:14:59,814
Ai!

401
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,816
Everything okay?

402
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:06,020
Well, he seems
a little... tense.

403
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,890
Show him who's boss.

404
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,625
Sorry.

405
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:12,960
Ai, Santa Maria!

406
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,897
<i>Ayudame, por favor!</i>

407
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:17,209
How's it going in there, Deb?

408
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,500
Um... I'm stuck.

409
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,470
Deb?

410
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,505
Yes?

411
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,373
Did you use any lubricant?

412
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,742
Was I supposed to?

413
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,078
Breathe.

414
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,181
Fever's 101.

415
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,061
Have any of your
doctors ever told you

416
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,796
you have a heart murmur?

417
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,187
Uh, I don't think so.

418
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,189
I could check my book though.

419
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:44,236
Have you had a cough lately?

420
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,526
Yes.

421
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:47,573
Loose cough? Bringing up sputum?

422
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:48,862
Yes.

423
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:50,531
What color?

424
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,536
Well, sort of a sulphur
yellow with saffron mixed in.

425
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:56,915
Kind of like these tiles here,

426
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,172
but more of a yellow...

427
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,874
these are more of a
yellow-beige, I do suppose.

428
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,610
Alan's into colors.

429
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,977
I see.

430
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,580
Alan, I want to run some
tests, do a chest X ray.

431
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:07,682
All right.

432
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,960
Did you have red
hair as a child?

433
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:10,201
No.

434
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,337
I thought I saw a touch
of russet in your hair.

435
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,756
It was probably
ketchup from lunch.

436
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,539
Zeidenberg's going
to a lecture series

437
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,673
in Detroit all next week.

438
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:23,898
You want to cover for him?

439
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,166
Sure.

440
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,168
You have to take over
all the scheduling...

441
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,770
Risk management
B.S., shift reports.

442
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,750
No problem; it'll
be good training

443
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,941
for when I'm chief
surgical resident.

444
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,910
That's what I like
about you, Peter...

445
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:38,212
Naked ambition
tempered by arrogance.

446
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:40,493
Dr. Benton, you have
an emergency phone call.

447
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:41,727
Your brother-in-law.

448
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,129
Telling him I'm
scrubbing in for surgery.

449
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,064
He said your mother's missing.

450
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,288
Go. I'll get
Schneider to scrub in.

451
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,092
Peter, go. It's your mother.

452
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:53,272
Okay, I'll, uh... I'll be
back this afternoon

453
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:54,728
in time for the pheo.

454
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:00,717
Uh, hold on.

455
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,070
Dr. Lewis, you took care

456
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,666
of Miss Callahan who
went up to O.B., right?

457
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,606
Mm-hmm.

458
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,269
Dr. Bernardi, upstairs, for you.

459
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,427
Her chart still around?

460
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,161
Yeah, um...

461
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,663
Yeah, this is Dr. Lewis.

462
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,765
Uh, yeah, we gave her...

463
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,367
Thanks.

464
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,704
Magnesium sulfate,
a six gram bolus

465
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,340
right before we sent her to you.

466
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,141
Uh-huh.

467
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,976
Yeah, no problem.

468
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,823
Hey, Timmy, any idea
why Mark signed this chart?

469
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,179
Uh-uh.

470
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,475
Where's Greene?

471
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,026
Exam room four.

472
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,417
Ah, there must be at least
a hundred of them in there.

473
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,496
Are they moving along?

474
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,653
Not really.

475
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:53,899
Well, how long is
this going to take?

476
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:56,691
Well, you're going to
have to ask Jorge that.

477
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,226
Why are you
co-signing all my charts?

478
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,828
Excuse me.

479
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:03,997
Every chart I worked on today
has your signature on it. Why?

480
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,098
Morgenstern told me to.

481
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,712
You think I'm incompetent?

482
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,046
You think you need to
oversee every decision I make?

483
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,102
No, of course not.

484
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,348
Did you tell Morgenstern that?

485
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,305
Well, he didn't ask my opinion.

486
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:12,306
He just told me to do it.

487
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,319
Why didn't you stand up for me?

488
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,987
You seem to forget that
a patient died, Susan.

489
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,244
Your patient.

490
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:19,246
I know it could have
happened to any of us,

491
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,380
but it happened to you.

492
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,649
And now there's a lawsuit,

493
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:24,668
and an inquiry, and
because I'm chief resident

494
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,403
it becomes my problem, too.

495
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,073
So, if Morgenstern wants
me to co-sign your charts

496
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,674
I'm going to do it.

497
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,305
You knew what he was
going to say to me today,

498
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,609
didn't you?

499
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,332
Yes.

500
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,677
You talked about me.

501
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,267
I have conversations
with Morgenstern

502
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:41,602
about every resident down here.

503
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,003
What'd you say?

504
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,850
I told him Kayson gives
you a hard time. And...?

505
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,952
And the way he rides you,
it's no wonder this happened.

506
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:48,053
And...? And when you go

507
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:50,094
head-to-head with
strong-willed guys

508
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,797
like Benton and Kayson
you tend to back down.

509
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,451
Son of a bitch.

510
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,065
Hey, Ben. How are you?

511
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,005
I got it.

512
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,768
Dr. Ross?

513
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,481
Hey, Wendy, look who's up.

514
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,771
O-2 sats' falling.

515
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,139
To be safe, let's get
him on a ventilator.

516
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,641
You better look at this.

517
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,780
"Do not resuscitate"?

518
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,181
His father did this?

519
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,933
Mm-hmm.

520
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:02,817
Wendy, give Mr. Menkens
350 milligrams a minute

521
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:03,885
of dopamine.

522
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,998
Uh, I think you
mean "micrograms."

523
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,654
That's what I said, isn't it?

524
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:08,655
No.

525
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:09,756
Oh.

526
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,274
Have Ubaldo's
t-cells come back yet?

527
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,009
Not yet. Lab's backed up.

528
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,700
Get this little smidge
out of my face.

529
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:20,879
What's wrong with him?

530
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,136
Who cares?

531
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:23,816
Uh, Carol, can you
get a chart going?

532
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,972
Sure.

533
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,218
What did you do to her?

534
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,209
Questioned her
sexual orientation.

535
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:29,321
Oh, well, that's rude.

536
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:30,377
No malice intended.

537
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:31,489
Did she do this?

538
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:33,458
Uh-uh. Newsstand
guy on Rush street.

539
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,548
What did you say to him?

540
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:35,760
A few derogatory comments

541
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,095
about his Middle
Eastern heritage.

542
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,297
It didn't take much.

543
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,065
Do you have any other
injuries anywhere else?

544
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,666
I think I've got a cracked rib.

545
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,690
Yeah? Newsstand guy?

546
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:44,002
Florist in Wicker Park,

547
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:45,704
sensitive about his hair weave.

548
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,272
Malik, why don't you
give me a hand here.

549
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:48,606
We'll take him to
the suture room.

550
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,730
What do you do?

551
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,143
You go around the
city insulting people

552
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,466
until they hit you?

553
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:55,502
Uh-huh. I'm a sociologist
at the University of Chicago

554
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,037
specializing in violence.

555
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:58,372
I select a subject

556
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,219
ask two questions to
probe for insecurities,

557
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:02,254
then use the information
to antagonize them

558
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:03,358
until they assault me.

559
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:04,745
Sounds like dangerous work.

560
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:06,146
Tell me about it.

561
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:08,360
My insurance company
charges me the same premiums

562
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:09,716
as NASCAR drivers.

563
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:21,996
We'll be moving him
to intensive care soon.

564
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:23,697
I see that you've
made a decision.

565
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:26,134
Mr. Gaither,

566
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,219
Ben's blood gases are not good.

567
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,254
He's not getting enough oxygen.

568
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:33,157
If he's not put on a
ventilator, he could die.

569
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:34,925
When?

570
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,193
It's difficult to say.

571
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,378
It could be a matter of hours.

572
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:45,419
With the proper care,
he could live a long time.

573
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:46,653
Are...

574
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,591
Are you sure that
you want to give up?

575
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,858
I can't believe Mrs. Lookee.

576
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,337
That woman shouldn't
have taken my money

577
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,206
if she was too
senile to do the job.

578
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,108
Myatt kid saw someone, it
could have been your mom,

579
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,397
down here at the corner.

580
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,777
I can't believe she
waited two hours to call us.

581
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,801
She didn't call<i>
us,</i> she called<i> me.</i>

582
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,281
I mean, she made
me look like an idiot...

583
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,107
Look, look, Peter, I left a station
full of cars needing service.

584
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,507
All of this because you insisted

585
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,710
on hiring some old woman
to take care of your mom

586
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,178
instead of putting
her in a home.

587
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,025
She's not going in a home.

588
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,481
Oh, like hell she isn't.

589
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,161
Wh-whoa, don't go
telling me what to do.

590
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,284
Look, I'm telling you, man,

591
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,931
I'm not letting you
put me and your sister

592
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:36,987
through this anymore.

593
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,576
Now, I'm sorry if it
makes you feel sad

594
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:39,790
but there's no other choice.

595
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,136
She's my mother, so who are you

596
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,437
to tell me how to handle this?

597
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,762
I'm the man who's paid
for her food, her clothes

598
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,164
and her care, for
the last six years.

599
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,144
And-and she let you
live in her house...

600
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,500
Yeah, who pays
the damn mortgage?

601
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,835
Who pays the bills?

602
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,015
You don't get
anything out of it, huh?

603
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,785
How many high school
student dropouts do you know

604
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,142
have a $100,000 business

605
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,222
just dropped in their lap?

606
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,679
High school dropout.

607
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:06,349
I cared for your
family for six years.

608
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,253
I carried your
family for six years.

609
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,522
I'm responsible for
your mother, your sister

610
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,524
the house and the station.

611
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,361
The only one that Peter
is responsible for is Peter.

612
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,098
I'm going to look
by the firehouse.

613
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,819
Okay, Mr. Desmond,

614
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,989
I'm going to clean
your abrasions.

615
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:31,498
We will start with your wrist.

616
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:33,326
It may sting a little.

617
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:34,995
That's a big engagement ring.

618
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,496
Isn't it?

619
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,832
Kind of ostentatious,
don't you think?

620
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,094
No, I-I don't.

621
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,535
Can I ask two questions?

622
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:42,604
All right.

623
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,621
Excuse me.

624
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,773
What does your fiancé do?

625
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,192
He's a doctor.

626
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,194
So, you're going
to be a doctor's wife.

627
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,362
When's the date?

628
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,364
We haven't set one yet.

629
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,366
Why not?

630
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,534
Your two questions are up.

631
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,802
What's the matter?

632
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,371
Somebody can't commit?

633
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,855
Based on the ring,

634
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,658
I don't think it's
him, so... what is it?

635
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,526
Think you're too good for him.

636
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:08,912
Scared of spending
the rest of your life

637
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,398
with someone who doesn't
quite meet your standards.

638
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,679
Got a pretty high opinion of
yourself, don't you, princess?

639
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,530
"Sure, I'll marry you.
Just don't tie me down

640
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,987
to anything
definite like a date."

641
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,535
That stings. Really?

642
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,457
Yes, it does.

643
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,959
Oh, God!

644
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,995
21-second P.A.I.

645
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:29,099
Puts you in the top
percentile in the hostility index.

646
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,701
P.A.I. is...?

647
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,719
Provocation-to-assault interval.

648
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:35,022
You're good.

649
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,723
My God, you're good.

650
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,493
John, what's this?

651
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,842
It's a laryngoscope.

652
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,175
No, no, second
shelf from the top.

653
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,483
Hey, can you teach
me how these work?

654
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:47,818
Some other time.

655
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:48,997
Carter...

656
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,521
we need this crash cart in four.

657
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,902
Body packer popped a condom.

658
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,425
Got it? Let's go.

659
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,529
Out of the way.

660
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,331
Give me some room, huh?

661
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,666
Here you go.

662
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,112
Stay here and try
not to get in the way.

663
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,903
Can't you cut him open
and pull out the coke?

664
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,839
We got to stabilize him first.

665
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,435
We got a multi-focal P.V.C.'s.

666
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,792
Yeah, okay, Lidocaine,
150, I.V. push.

667
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,795
He's in fib. Paddles.

668
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,981
Oh, my God!

669
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,550
What was that set on?

670
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,368
Two hundred.

671
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,520
Oh, he should be okay.

672
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,705
Okay... thank you.

673
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,791
Why don't you
check on him, okay?

674
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,953
All right, clear. Clear.

675
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:31,145
Oh, that's not good.

676
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,146
Let's go again.

677
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:33,494
Three hundred.

678
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:34,814
<i>No, no, por favor.</i>

679
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:36,078
Clear.

680
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,585
Normal signs.

681
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:39,586
Let's take him upstairs.

682
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:40,749
Notify the O.R.

683
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,539
Let them know they
got a laparotomy.

684
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,018
We got to get these
condoms out of him.

685
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,692
Don't worry, honey,

686
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,012
he just bumped his head.

687
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:51,965
Alan, the guy with the colors?

688
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:55,002
His films came back. Radiology

689
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:56,871
had a bunch of them
from a few years ago, too.

690
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,740
Susan?

691
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,502
I could stay in
this room all day.

692
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,470
It's warm like flannel.

693
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,439
I wish I could wear it.

694
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,502
Alan, when you gave me your
medical history this morning

695
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,187
you didn't tell me
you had cancer.

696
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:23,213
What's nice about
this room is that...

697
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,916
it's not... it's not too bright.

698
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,397
When yellow's too
bright, it's not welcoming.

699
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,965
Alan,

700
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,624
you have a tumor in your chest

701
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,226
encasing your heart
and infiltrating your lungs.

702
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,445
On the other hand,

703
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:42,215
if yellow is too pale, it
feels cold and... and clammy.

704
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:44,718
There are treatments, Alan.

705
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:46,319
Chemotherapy, radiation...

706
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:48,988
Dr. Lewis and I think you
should see an oncologist.

707
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:50,318
I'll tell you one thing,

708
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,076
whoever made this room
sure knew his yellow.

709
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,219
Could I be alone, please?

710
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,737
Sure.

711
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,393
Oh, that's good.

712
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:15,983
Look out, look out!

713
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,719
Yeah, I'm all right.

714
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:29,430
Ma...

715
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,577
Ma, what are you doing up here?

716
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:33,934
Who is that?

717
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,037
Peter?

718
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:38,672
Yeah, Ma, it's me.

719
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,007
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

720
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,077
Ma, I work at a
hospital, remember?

721
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,612
I'm a doctor.

722
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:47,214
I know that.

723
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:53,120
Why do I feel I don't
get a chance to see you?

724
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:58,591
Well, because they
keep us pretty busy.

725
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,872
But we see each other
sometimes, don't we?

726
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,246
So serious.

727
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,550
I remember you sitting

728
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,120
in that green chair
by the window

729
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,688
reading your books.

730
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,891
So serious.

731
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:21,265
You know, Ma, um...

732
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,837
with Jackie at work all day

733
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,907
and the kids at school,

734
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,776
we worry about you being alone.

735
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,411
Oh, I don't like it
that way, either.

736
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,812
I like a full house.

737
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:39,499
Well, that's why we...
we were thinking maybe...

738
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:41,813
well, maybe you'd be happier
in a place where there...

739
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:44,071
you know, there's...

740
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,438
with other people your age,

741
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:48,992
people that could
take care of you.

742
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,261
I used to bring Jackie

743
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,097
to take skating
lessons right here.

744
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,966
And your father and I

745
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,137
watched you in the...
in the Little League

746
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,305
right on this field.

747
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,473
Remember?

748
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,176
Yeah, I remember.

749
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,030
Your father's dead.

750
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,667
Yeah...

751
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:18,171
yeah, he's dead.

752
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,440
Uh... Peter...

753
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:30,516
I don't want to go
into a nursing home.

754
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,026
All right... all right.

755
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:41,628
Shh.

756
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,300
It's all right. It's all right.

757
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:50,920
Spin a crit,

758
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,822
type and cross-match four units

759
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,424
and get some O-negative
down here now!

760
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,703
Man, you got to do something.

761
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,727
Out of the way!

762
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:57,872
She didn't do nothing.

763
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:58,828
Out of the way.

764
00:29:58,897 --> 00:29:59,829
Stay here.

765
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,126
We're going to take care of her.

766
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,161
Somebody call radiology.
Set up a two blood lyte.

767
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:04,134
B.P.'s 40 palp.

768
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,235
Someone call a surgeon.

769
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,514
I see the entrance.
Who sees the exit?

770
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,649
Here on her back.

771
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:08,705
Cop said

772
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,440
it was a drive-by;
she was a bystander.

773
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,275
Yeah, her brother's a banger.

774
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,660
Look at his clothes.

775
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,040
What have we got?
Gunshot to the chest.

776
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,241
Looks like it's
through and through.

777
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:17,491
She's hyper-resident.
Tracheal shift

778
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,464
to the left.

779
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:19,483
She needs a chest tube.

780
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,567
I'll do it.

781
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:21,234
Okay.

782
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:22,302
I.V. is flowing.

783
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:23,514
Yeah... heart sounds funky.

784
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:25,738
Let's get a
cardiologist down here.

785
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:30,087
Damn it, where's
all this coming from?

786
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,611
Pressure's crashing.

787
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,892
She's taching. Bullet must
have tumbled into the heart.

788
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,560
Okay, let's crack her.
Clamp the bleeder.

789
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,533
Thoracotomy tray!

790
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,467
I'll do it.

791
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,468
Okay.

792
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:39,318
What's the problem?

793
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:40,464
We have bleeder.

794
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:42,188
It sounded like a murmur.

795
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,039
Better open her quick.

796
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,457
Give her O-neg; wide open.

797
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,288
Damn it!

798
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,573
I need suction.
I can't visualize

799
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,264
the lungs.

800
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,394
Six and a half? Yeah.

801
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:53,350
Hurry up!

802
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,419
How about now?

803
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,285
I can't see the pleura.

804
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,631
Her cut's not deep enough.

805
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,371
Susan?

806
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,423
Yes, the cut is deep enough.

807
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,358
I... I just can't see anything.

808
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,671
Okay, calm down. You'll get it.

809
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:06,713
She's bleeding out.

810
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,432
She's going to make it...

811
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,162
How much longer are
you going let her do this?

812
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:12,519
Susan? More suction.

813
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:13,403
We're losing her.

814
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,752
She can't do it.

815
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:20,660
Damn it, I can't see
anything. You try.

816
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,314
Scalpel.

817
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,112
Okay, I'm in.

818
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,857
Yeah, I see the bleeder.

819
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,887
Pulmonary artery. Clamp.

820
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:37,191
Stabinsky.

821
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:45,201
Got it. Let's get her to O.R.

822
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,653
Good job, Dr. Greene.

823
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:51,931
Okay, let's go.

824
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,344
Peter, we've got

825
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,846
a possible appendectomy in six.

826
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,648
All right, call the floor...
See who else is on.

827
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,952
I'm late for a pheo.

828
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,989
You got his picture in there?

829
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,090
It's in there.

830
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,625
How about the
metronome? He likes that.

831
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,460
It's there. We can take
him from here, Dr. Ross.

832
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,950
It's okay. I'm going
to take him up.

833
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:43,026
I didn't know you had a son.

834
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,661
Well, we're not exactly close.

835
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,463
What's his name?

836
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,576
I don't know, Wendy.

837
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,800
I've never seen him. Here we go.

838
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,020
Watch yourself.

839
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:56,990
Mm-hmm.

840
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,202
The DNR sticker's on there.

841
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,559
Thanks.

842
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,220
Are we doing an anterior
abdominal approach

843
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:28,399
or are we excising
the adrenal laterally?

844
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,934
Whoa, Peter there's
no need to scrub in.

845
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:32,337
I couldn't wait, so
I asked Schneider

846
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:34,172
to assist Dr. Kenner and me.

847
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:35,428
Hey, Peter, how's it going?

848
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:37,030
Do you take the Eisenhower in?

849
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,343
Uh-huh.

850
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:39,944
Did you notice that piano
showroom near Halsted?

851
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:41,412
Yeah. I got my wife's
harpsichord there.

852
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,603
Wait. You've been inside?

853
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:44,770
Oh, Yeah.

854
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,351
They've got a Steinway
collection in there

855
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,551
that would knock your socks off.

856
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,053
How long ago did
you notice this place?

857
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:50,917
Two years ago. Two years ago?

858
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:09,809
Where is he?

859
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:12,198
We took Ben up
to intensive care.

860
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:16,469
Intensive care.

861
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:18,015
They're aware of your
decision. You okay?

862
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,305
Yeah.

863
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,475
I just got offered a job

864
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,311
managing a recycling
plant in Detroit.

865
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,661
I got to pick up and move.

866
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,008
Coming back, I just
couldn't help thinking

867
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,577
how much easier it
would be if Ben were dead.

868
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,350
What kind of a
man thinks like that?

869
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,357
What kind of a father
prays for his own boy to die?

870
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:01,331
And for two years, it's
been just me and Ben.

871
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,133
There's been no work...

872
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,701
no friends...

873
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,471
nobody.

874
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:14,144
He needs me 24 hours a
day to turn him and feed him...

875
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,316
and sing to him when he cries.

876
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,108
I love my boy.

877
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:37,917
I've given Ben two years...

878
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:40,320
two years.

879
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:47,560
I just can't give anymore.

880
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:54,751
I need for this to end.

881
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,054
I need for this to end.

882
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:01,625
To end... oh, God...

883
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,641
Mmm.

884
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,510
Well, well, look who's back.

885
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,825
Oh, my head.

886
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,180
You took quite a fall,
Carter, but don't worry,

887
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:25,559
Deb's been taking care of you.

888
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,463
She worked you up real good.

889
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,924
"Blood pressure 90/60.

890
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,904
"Respiration...
'guiac negative stool."

891
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:37,972
"'Guiac negative stool?"

892
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,145
You gave me a rectal?

893
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:41,080
Well, Haleh thought it
would be good practice.

894
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:42,349
Good practice? Good practice?

895
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,816
Oh, now, settle down, Carter.

896
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:46,052
She has to learn, doesn't she?

897
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,598
Oh, Deb, another thing: Mmm?

898
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,040
The proper term isn't
"average" male genitalia.

899
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,042
It's "normal" male genitalia.

900
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,044
What? Where does it say that?

901
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,249
Oh, you guys are just kidding?

902
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,751
So you didn't...?

903
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,886
Uh-uh.

904
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:03,954
You didn't...?

905
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,722
Told you we'd get him.

906
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,744
Um... uh...

907
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,364
Do you know where
you are, Mr. Parnell?

908
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,366
Yeah. In the chump cellar.

909
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:20,437
Three knockout
losses in a row. Damn!

910
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,206
And I had him
against the ropes too...

911
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:26,709
before I stepped
into that cross.

912
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:29,612
I thought you might like
some company, Mr. Desmond.

913
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,083
This is Mr. Parnell.

914
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,484
Hello.

915
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,298
What happened to you?

916
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:40,323
Don't want to talk about it.

917
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,292
Huh.

918
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,696
Can I ask you two questions?

919
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:03,012
I should have warned
you about Morgenstern,

920
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:05,582
and I should have
been more up front

921
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,770
about the co-signing business.

922
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,096
I didn't know how to tell you.

923
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,140
Susan, no one could
have done that thoracotomy

924
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,765
under the circumstances,

925
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,811
with Kayson breathing
down your neck

926
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,580
and the hearing next week...

927
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,937
Are you trying to
make me feel better?

928
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,675
I'm trying to apologize.

929
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,977
So you can feel better yourself?

930
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,955
Some of us are going to
Doc Magoo's after work.

931
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,690
If you want to come...

932
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:14,933
Alan?

933
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,160
You know, my buddy, Max,

934
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:22,052
moved out of the
home last summer,

935
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:23,209
got an apartment.

936
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,261
Been trying to get
me to split the rent.

937
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,498
Problem is, the bathroom.

938
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,783
Celadon green.

939
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,685
I asked him to retile.

940
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:37,590
Now I'm thinking...
what the hell?

941
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:41,143
Sometimes you got to
take the plunge, you know?

942
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,932
Well, you don't want
to forget your book.

943
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,201
There's a section missing.

944
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:52,922
Guess which color?

945
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,092
Green.

946
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,227
If you're trying to get
those wheels to go...

947
00:39:58,296 --> 00:39:59,640
Lydia, you going to Magoo's?

948
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:00,897
I'll be over in a few minutes.

949
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,098
Anyone seen Carol?

950
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,100
Oh, just went upstairs.
I'll let her know.

951
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:06,247
Try and see if you
can get Susan to come.

952
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,203
What a day.

953
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,272
Yeah.

954
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:14,510
That answers your two questions.

955
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,897
And, Lydia, somebody should
probably check on Mr. Desmond.

956
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:29,753
I don't care.

957
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:31,555
I am not drinking
anything with a worm in it.

958
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:32,645
Who's got the tequila?

959
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:34,057
All right, give me
your glass, Dr. Ross.

960
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,492
Onion rings, extra
greasy? Right here.

961
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,449
Ooh, thanks, Timmy.

962
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,117
No, no, no, no.

963
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,153
You have to sit at the
counter with what's-her-name.

964
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:42,422
I'm not kidding.

965
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:45,542
They just announced
the $40 million jackpot

966
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,044
went to a dry
cleaner in Winnetka.

967
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,847
Aw, man. I was counting
on that money too.

968
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,092
You didn't even kick in.

969
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,427
You get a second
chance with the Insta-pic.

970
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,461
You just rub the spot.

971
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,679
Did you hear about Carter's

972
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,953
unscheduled electroshock?

973
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,165
I'm sorry I missed
it. Guess how many

974
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,689
condoms he had in his belly?

975
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:00,758
How many? 50?

976
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,169
A hundred and eighty-five.

977
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,475
And he lived?

978
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,877
Hey, B.

979
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:08,014
I got your double burger,
double cheese right here.

980
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:10,082
Keep your
lard-burgers to yourself.

981
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,262
All right, everybody, Listen up.

982
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:12,513
Carol has an
announcement to make.

983
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:13,964
Oh, it's no big deal.

984
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,588
Just keep May 18th open.

985
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:17,190
That's when Tag and I

986
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:18,538
are getting married.

987
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,610
All right.

988
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:23,846
Whoo!

989
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,292
Susan coming? Couldn't find her.

990
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,316
Lydia, it's for Carol.

991
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,694
What's this? Your lotto ticket.

992
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:28,751
Dr. Benton,

993
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,398
how's your mother? She's fine.

994
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:33,372
How was your rectal?

995
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:34,958
Hey, I won ten bucks.

996
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,509
Oh, great, you can
pick up the check.

997
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:37,705
What are the odds?

998
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,078
How can you tell?

999
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:40,646
Just flip it over.

1000
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,492
Let me get a fruit plate.

1001
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:43,466
Let's see.

1002
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:44,862
$10 win... one in 250.

1003
00:41:44,886 --> 00:41:45,896
Sounds familiar.

1004
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,120
Ah, don't even think about it.

1005
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:48,921
What are the odds
you're going to win $10

1006
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,156
set a wedding date

1007
00:41:50,224 --> 00:41:52,291
<i>and</i> get HIV on the same day?

1008
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,993
You got yogurt?

1009
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,728
A bran muffin?

1010
00:41:56,998 --> 00:41:59,415
Okay, hey, everybody, I
want to propose a toast.

1011
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,185
To Carol.

1012
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,321
Shh. What's he doing?

1013
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:09,492
May your upcoming marriage
bring you laughter and happiness

1014
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,761
and kids, and most of all, love.

1015
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,331
God knows, you
deserve all of those things.

1016
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,626
Hear, hear!

1017
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,718
Cheers.

1018
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,202
Congratulations, girl.

1019
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,591
Thank you. To Carol.

1020
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:25,742
Long time have to wait.

1021
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,309
Where's the stripper?

1022
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:30,930
I had a May wedding.

1023
00:42:30,998 --> 00:42:32,532
What month did you divorce?

1024
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:34,934
Hey, B,

1025
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:36,747
look like you put
on some weight.

1026
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:38,821
I wouldn't say that
and smile, brother.

1027
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,975
Lydia and I also have
an announcement.

1028
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,443
We got married...

1029
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,399
So...?

1030
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:35,061
