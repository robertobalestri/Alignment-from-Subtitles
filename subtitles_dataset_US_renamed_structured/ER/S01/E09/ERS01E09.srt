1
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:38,670
Rage, agitation

2
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,306
angry outbursts at
patients and staff...

3
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:46,778
obsessional negative
thoughts about work

4
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,814
the, uh... the hours

5
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:52,117
ludicrous staff meetings

6
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:56,288
the stink of the halls
and the patients...

7
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,323
the patients.

8
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,159
You find yourself
searching for ways

9
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,495
not to hate them.

10
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:07,533
You know, little
tricks like, um...

11
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,536
she shares a birthday
with your mother

12
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,872
or he looks like a
brother of a friend.

13
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,043
It doesn't work.

14
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,514
You feel nothing.

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,385
Every drop of pleasure
has drained from your life.

16
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,856
You can't sleep

17
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,374
you can't think, you
can't concentrate...

18
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,864
Trouble sleeping?

19
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,067
Oh... Well, I was just...

20
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,236
catching up on some work.

21
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,879
I worry you're not
getting enough sleep.

22
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,548
Are you okay?

23
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,150
Fine.

24
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,152
What are you working on?

25
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,554
Um, a patient history.

26
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,025
Div...

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,894
Listen, you go
back to bed, okay?

28
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,602
It's late.

29
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,011
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

30
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,412
Who is it?

31
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,581
Do you think I could, maybe...

32
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,949
Come in?

33
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:41,937
Thank you.

34
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,438
Rain stopped.

35
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,033
It's going to be
a beautiful day.

36
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,889
Have you seen my razor?

37
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,479
I don't think so.

38
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,281
Sorry about the mess.

39
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,850
I'm just always amazed

40
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:57,953
how much stuff women
can fit in their overnight bag.

41
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,622
Just the bare essentials.

42
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,625
"Hydrating Eye
Mask Number Four."

43
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,627
Takes five years off.

44
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,629
Really?

45
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,297
Are you all packed?

46
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,299
We're going to
be rushing tonight.

47
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,646
Yeah, except for my razor.

48
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,971
Good. Oh, Mister
Button missed a hole.

49
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,639
Come here.

50
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,641
I'll pick you up after work.

51
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,643
We'll be in Nassau by morning.

52
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,747
And the next three
days... you're mine.

53
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:27,649
Sounds good to me.

54
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,662
I got to tell you, I feel funny

55
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,998
about you paying for everything.

56
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,321
Oh, please.

57
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,657
We both know you
don't make any money.

58
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,325
You're a resident...

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,994
a pediatric resident.

60
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,664
You know what?

61
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,001
I think that blue Armani
shirt that I got you

62
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,103
would go better with this tie.

63
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:50,138
Happy Thanksgiving.

64
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,019
Hey, Malik, Happy Thanksgiving.

65
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,354
You, too.

66
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,688
Hey, nice shirt, doc.

67
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,056
Thanks.

68
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,395
Hi.

69
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,931
Uh, excuse me.

70
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,266
Um, what's your name?

71
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:19,734
Bob.

72
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,735
Happy Thanksgiving.

73
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,415
Happy Thanksgiving to you, Bob.

74
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,417
Uh, these are
Halloween decorations.

75
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,751
We just took those down.

76
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:29,744
No, I... put up.

77
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,347
See?

78
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:34,049
Yes, I see.

79
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,583
Carry on.

80
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,057
Ah, Dr. Ross.

81
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,970
Hi, Jer. What's the good word?

82
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:47,062
Well, got a little interoffice
minutiae for you here.

83
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,065
Is this your contribution
to the potluck dinner?

84
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,733
It's pecan pie.

85
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,735
I bought it myself.

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,303
Don't be shy, Jerry.

87
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,072
Just help yourself.

88
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,407
Thanks.

89
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,076
Dr. John, what do
you got over there?

90
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,077
I'm practicing sutures.

91
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,629
What is that?

92
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,964
Huh? Oh, it's a pig's foot.

93
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,179
The elasticity is
comparable to human skin.

94
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,469
It's great for practicing.

95
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,820
I've got about half a dozen

96
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,617
of these in my freezer at home.

97
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,958
Carter, are you
snacking between meals?

98
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:19,260
See what's holding
up the blood gases

99
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,228
on that wheezer in three.

100
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:21,362
You got it.

101
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:22,430
Hey, Doug.

102
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,432
Morning, Carol.

103
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,000
So, you still going to Bermuda

104
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:27,702
or can you work Saturday night?

105
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:29,782
The Bahamas, and forget it.

106
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,139
I'm gone.

107
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,735
Jen and Rach coming down?

108
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,959
And her folks.

109
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,678
Dinner with the Reverend.

110
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,647
Kid with the croup in three.

111
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,083
Thank you, Lydia.

112
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:51,938
Terrific.

113
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:53,161
I got it.

114
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:55,675
When things slow down,
I need to talk to you.

115
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,431
Oh, okay.

116
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,765
All right.

117
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,436
Carol...

118
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,738
Thank you.

119
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,740
Who put this here?

120
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,587
I believe it was Bob.

121
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,578
Can we move it somewhere?

122
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:12,080
<i>We</i> can certainly try.

123
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,417
Thanksgiving.

124
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:17,752
What a farce.

125
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:20,255
I mean, what do we got
to be grateful for, huh?

126
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,558
Rwanda? Flesh-eating bacteria?

127
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:24,637
<i>Entertainment Tonight?</i>

128
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:25,893
Mr. Luck, quiet.

129
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,262
Piss off.

130
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:30,031
That's ironic coming from
a man with no kidneys.

131
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,132
Labs are back.

132
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:32,345
He's uremic.

133
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,801
Blood alcohol's 250.

134
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:36,437
And the media...
Brainwashers, all of them.

135
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,589
Just filling the kids'
heads with filth.

136
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,560
"I love you, you love
me, we're a happy family."

137
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,196
Mr. Luck, how long has it been

138
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,547
since you were dialyzed?

139
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:49,417
Those Nazis at the clinic
won't let me in the door.

140
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,436
Apparently, Mr. Luck
as been banned

141
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,871
for repeatedly
abusing the staff.

142
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,906
I got a right to my
opinion, don't I?

143
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,676
Mr. Luck, you're in
end-stage renal failure

144
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:58,922
but don't worry.

145
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,456
We're going to save your life...

146
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,780
such as it is.

147
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,059
Prep him for dialysis.

148
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,827
I'll get the portable machine.

149
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,963
You know what really gets me?

150
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,989
All of this talk about an
information superhighway.

151
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,825
Ha! 500 channels of crap.

152
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,362
You know, the more I see
of people, the more I like pigs.

153
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,978
42-year-old woman
lost control of her car

154
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,435
and hit a bridge abutment.

155
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,902
She's alert and oriented.

156
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,438
Vitals are normal.

157
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,017
So, should I bring
anything for tonight?

158
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,307
Tonight?

159
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,608
Thanksgiving dinner.

160
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,243
Your mother invited me.

161
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,280
Carter, my mother isn't
in control of her faculties.

162
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,316
So, I'm not invited now?

163
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,163
Don't your parents
want you at home?

164
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,287
Actually, my parents
are in Switzerland

165
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,421
visiting my sister.

166
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,257
Switzerland, huh?

167
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,114
Have you seen
Mookie this morning?

168
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,115
No.

169
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,783
Hi, Mrs. Carleton.
I'm Dr. Benton.

170
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,885
We're going to look you
over and just make sure

171
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,732
that you don't have any
serious injuries, okay?

172
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,289
Carter, take a look at the head.

173
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,539
This isn't going to hurt a bit.

174
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:11,232
Okay, do you feel
any pain here, ma'am?

175
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,066
No.

176
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:13,301
Okay. What about here?

177
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:14,302
No.

178
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,581
No blood in the canals.

179
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:16,885
Excuse me.

180
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,125
Oh, we've got a deep lac here.

181
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,755
About ten centimeters.

182
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,640
Don't worry... there
won't be much scarring.

183
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,192
Penetrating lac
on the right side.

184
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:28,583
Ma'am, we're going to
have to remove your clothes.

185
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:29,584
Carter.

186
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,703
Okay...

187
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,422
if you could just turn
on your side, please.

188
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,524
Okay.

189
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,443
Lower back looks good.

190
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,447
Upper back looks
good, a few scratches.

191
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,449
Contusion to the left scapula.

192
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,151
Uh... Dr. Benton?

193
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,385
Abrasions along T-3.

194
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,820
We seem to have a new
piece of information here.

195
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:54,242
Superficial bruises along
the cocc... cocc... coccyx.

196
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:59,364
Could somebody
please get me a gown?

197
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,169
Mr. Carleton...

198
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,387
I go by "Miss."

199
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:07,839
Big trauma coming. M.V.A.

200
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,067
Three people. All critical.

201
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:10,141
All right, uh...

202
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,660
Carter, take her next
door and sew her up.

203
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,796
Um... okay.

204
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,798
Uh... by myself?

205
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,482
High speed collision.

206
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,484
Two teenage males in one car.

207
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,498
Both unrestrained,
thrown from the vehicle.

208
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,466
This one's unconscious...
Massive head injuries.

209
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,456
Vitals?

210
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,969
No vitals. Looks like a loser.

211
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,304
Doug, we need your help.

212
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,795
What do we got?

213
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:33,609
You guys take this one.

214
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,598
Connie, talk to me.

215
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,711
Traumatic full arrest.

216
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,346
Here comes the second one.

217
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,480
Clear the way!

218
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,238
He's conscious.

219
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,339
Broken right femur.

220
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,674
Pressure 90/60,
pulse 110. Let's go.

221
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,820
Someone call ortho.

222
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,810
It hurts!

223
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,811
Where does it hurt?

224
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,046
My gut.

225
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,030
What happened?

226
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,843
Ran a red at high speed,
hit a 22-year-old girl.

227
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:51,533
Is he the driver?

228
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,467
Don't know.

229
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:54,147
Car belonged to
a... Larry Parks.

230
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:55,670
Are you Larry Parks?

231
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:57,104
No, Andy.

232
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,340
That must be the girl.

233
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:00,341
That ain't her.

234
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:01,342
They left her at the scene...

235
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:02,658
decapitated.

236
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,601
Okay, Andy. Andy,
tell me where it hurts.

237
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,002
Here? Here?

238
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,237
Everywhere!

239
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,152
Carol, we need to hold him down.

240
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,953
You gotta stay still.

241
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,143
It hurts!

242
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,289
Can we give him
something for the pain?

243
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,741
Yep. 50 milligrams of Demerol.

244
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,242
All right, let's
prep for lavage.

245
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,944
I need a catheter. I got it.

246
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,170
Any heart sounds?

247
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,354
Negative.

248
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,709
Give him another
milligram of atropine.

249
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,004
We got a lot of
gray matter here.

250
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,127
Oh, God.

251
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,128
Is he salvageable?

252
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,408
Call neuro.

253
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,000
All right, let's get the
saline and tube ready.

254
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,519
I'm not giving up yet.

255
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,275
What are you doing?

256
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,609
Andy, relax.

257
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,289
They gave you an anesthetic

258
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,263
so you won't be in pain.

259
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,231
Why are they cutting me?

260
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:58,527
Listen to me. My name is Carol.

261
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,446
And I'll tell you what's
happening, all right?

262
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,654
The doctor's made a
little nick in your belly

263
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,656
so they can fill your
abdomen with fluid.

264
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:10,145
Once it's full, they'll watch
as the fluid drains out.

265
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,579
If blood comes out, that means

266
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,475
you have injuries
inside, and will need

267
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,779
to have surgery.

268
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,739
What do you think?

269
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,221
All right. Call the OR.

270
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,912
Tell them we're on our way up.

271
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,263
You're going to surgery now.

272
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,298
God!

273
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:50,368
Larry!

274
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,104
Time of death, 9:33.

275
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,239
Oh, God.

276
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,573
Let's roll.

277
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,278
I'll make sure we got a room.

278
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,214
We got him, Carol.

279
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,448
Carol, it was me.

280
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,561
What was you?

281
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,251
I was driving Larry's car.

282
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,252
It's my fault.

283
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,721
I killed him.

284
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,023
Oh, God, I killed him.

285
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:54,949
The space shuttle...
Now there's a bright idea.

286
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,917
Let's spend $50 billion

287
00:13:56,953 --> 00:14:00,255
so six guys can sit in a
tin can and test the effect

288
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,335
of weightlessness
on fruit flies.

289
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,603
The kid who went up...
Is he going to make it?

290
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:05,893
I think so. One out of three.

291
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,061
What a waste.

292
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,608
Every time I see a
kid go up there, I think,

293
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:09,875
"There, but for
the grace of God..."

294
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:10,865
Tell me about it.

295
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,411
When I was in high school,

296
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,780
we used to race this guy's
TR-7 up on River Road.

297
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:17,304
Pin the speedometer at 120.

298
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,140
We used to climb
those giant TV antennas

299
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,374
all the way up to the top.

300
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,742
Must have been 200-300 feet.

301
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,143
You did that?

302
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,480
Otto Jevtich... his dad
was a demolitions expert.

303
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:28,232
So we used to steal boxes
of dynamite and play chicken.

304
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,213
I don't believe you guys.

305
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,215
The worst thing Howie
Dolan and I ever did

306
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:36,073
was Chinese fire drills
at the Velvet Freeze.

307
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,475
I guess you and Howie
were born to be wild.

308
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,359
Did I miss something?

309
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,733
No. I'm just being
publicly ridiculed.

310
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,931
Oh. So how about some coffee?

311
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,154
Sure.

312
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,458
Hey, Doug.

313
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,405
John, hey, listen, I'm
glad you showed up.

314
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,440
This kid's got an elbow the size

315
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,829
of a grapefruit.

316
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,332
Sure. Just give me
one second, huh?

317
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,519
Yeah. I'll just go
through my mail.

318
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,687
Hey.

319
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:08,255
Hey.

320
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,590
Sorry, Lydia.

321
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:11,759
Don't be. That's the best kiss

322
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:13,744
I've experienced in months.

323
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,591
So, did you find somebody
to cover your shift?

324
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,597
Not yet. Keep trying.

325
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,210
Mom's not going to
start supper till 7:00.

326
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,244
She's really looking forward

327
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:20,445
to spending some time with you.

328
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:21,469
I'll try.

329
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,787
I gotta go, but, uh...

330
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:24,923
I'll see you.

331
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,958
Bye.

332
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,470
All yours.

333
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,627
Yeah.

334
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,828
Hey.

335
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,298
So, what's your name?

336
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,933
My name is John Carter.

337
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,091
You've grown awfully
quiet, John Carter.

338
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,910
Oh, I see.

339
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,165
I had a friend once.

340
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,203
We would go to lunch,
Happy Hours, shopping.

341
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,042
Over drinks one night,
I told her about myself.

342
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:04,294
She stood up, left the table

343
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,770
and never spoke to me again.

344
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:11,852
I used to feel those
things made me stronger

345
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,105
more sure of who I was.

346
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,457
These days...

347
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,125
I spend three hours

348
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,128
putting on my face
before I dare go outside.

349
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,847
Plucking and waxing...

350
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,584
and even then,
someone always notices.

351
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,720
I can see by the
look in their eyes.

352
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,324
The disgust.

353
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,795
Maybe they're right.

354
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,300
Maybe I am disgusting.

355
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:49,256
Can you turn your head
back the other way, please?

356
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,558
Thank you.

357
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,611
Hey, Lydia.

358
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,046
Hey, Al.

359
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,230
Whatcha got?

360
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,732
Guy needs to be
cleared for booking.

361
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,402
He's bleeding all
over my squad car.

362
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,215
Doctor Ross. Got a patient.

363
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,139
I'm not a grown-up doctor.

364
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,607
We all know that

365
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:09,143
but there's no
one else available.

366
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,012
What happened?

367
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,981
He was attacked by a turkey.

368
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,060
A turkey.

369
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,161
What's open?

370
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:17,318
Trauma one.

371
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,520
See, Francis here is
an animal-rights nut.

372
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:20,787
Activist!

373
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,856
Whatever. There's this
Thanksgiving display

374
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:24,325
at one of the shopping malls...

375
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,060
You know, dried corn, straw,
guys dressed like pilgrims.

376
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:30,464
They've also got this real,
live, big mother of a turkey.

377
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,167
They were exploiting the
bird for commercial gain.

378
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,335
It was disgusting!

379
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,415
So, Francis here
decides to steal the bird.

380
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,700
To rescue it!

381
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,818
You grabbed the bird,
you threw it in your car

382
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:41,020
and you took off.

383
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,676
That's stealing.

384
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:43,644
It was being abused.

385
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,028
Now comes the good part.

386
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,914
During the getaway,
the turkey attacks him...

387
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,612
Starts clawing and pecking

388
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,779
at his head.

389
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,665
So what does Francis do?

390
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,790
He breaks the bird's neck.

391
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:02,646
And the upshot of it is

392
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,115
you guys get a fresh
bird for your party.

393
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,084
Oh, my God!

394
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,947
Al, maybe you better
take that outside.

395
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,322
Is that a Narragansett tom?

396
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:14,292
It sure is!

397
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,828
Hey, he's a big fellow, too.

398
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:20,181
I kind of doubt if Dietary
will want to prepare it.

399
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:21,265
Heck, I'll do it.

400
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,011
I used to pluck birds
all the time as a kid.

401
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,869
This one's a beaut.

402
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,567
No, there's no question.

403
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,035
He was listing all the symptoms

404
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,102
of a major depression.

405
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:32,726
That would explain a few things.

406
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,072
Look, I know you've
never liked Div,

407
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:35,340
but he's been
really sweet to me,

408
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,374
so I'd appreciate it

409
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,076
if you wouldn't run
him down in front of me.

410
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,066
Sorry.

411
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:41,735
It just hurts to
see him like this.

412
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:43,737
I don't know what to do.

413
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:46,908
If he's clinically depressed,
he needs psychiatric help.

414
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,242
I know, but I don't want

415
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:50,505
to back him into a
corner if he's not ready.

416
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,807
Well, someone's
got to say something.

417
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:52,796
If he's really that bad,

418
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,152
he shouldn't be
treating patients.

419
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,935
You know, your concern
for Div is really touching.

420
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,181
Thanks for the advice.

421
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,771
I just think he
should see someone.

422
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,086
I got that.

423
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:07,578
You should have seen
the condition of his cage.

424
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,780
It was like a cell.

425
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,682
His water dish was dry.

426
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,334
That's no good.

427
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,188
People forget that we share
the same biological heritage

428
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,035
as every creature on the planet.

429
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,693
That first lizard who
crawled out of the ooze

430
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,706
is a distant cousin to us all.

431
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,630
I never really thought about it.

432
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,150
You don't keep your cousin
in a cage with no water!

433
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:32,085
You don't eat your family!

434
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,220
Oh, my God.

435
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,906
Could you...

436
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,843
could you please shut the blind?

437
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,277
Sure, Francis.

438
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:50,254
Francis, are you okay?

439
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,692
Doctor, can I tell
you something?

440
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,780
When I was under attack...

441
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:03,751
my most primitive fight-or-
flight instinct kicked in.

442
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,420
And, in that moment,
I was a beast,

443
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,089
and when I grabbed
the bird's neck,

444
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,444
and when I heard it snap...

445
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,514
there was a part of me that...

446
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,699
that secretly enjoyed it.

447
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,940
Is your father still living?

448
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,307
Yes, he is.

449
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:30,989
I didn't really know my dad

450
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:33,380
until just a few years ago.

451
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:36,450
I hadn't seen him
for ten years when,

452
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,730
out of the blue, he called.

453
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,899
Said he wanted to see me.

454
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,390
He had no idea.

455
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,926
So I put on a jade green,

456
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:49,730
short-sleeved silk dress,

457
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:53,734
and that's how I
answered the door.

458
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,002
You know

459
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:56,987
what he said?

460
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,907
He said, "Are you
Henry's girlfriend?"

461
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:04,178
I said, "No, Dad.

462
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:05,979
It's me."

463
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,448
He said...

464
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:12,153
"You look just
like your sister."

465
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,138
Then he said the reason

466
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,424
he came to see me was
because he was dying.

467
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:21,895
Before he died, he said, "Henry,

468
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:25,332
"you may wear a dress,

469
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,668
but you're still my son."

470
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,422
Okay, I'm done.

471
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,624
You should probably stay here

472
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,426
for about a half hour

473
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,029
so we make sure there's
no reaction to the antibiotics.

474
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,197
Dr. Greene.

475
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,532
Morning, ma'am.

476
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,900
What kind of thread you using?

477
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,102
Four-oh absorbable sub-Q.

478
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,473
Nice apposition,
well-spaced. Good job.

479
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,641
Thanks.

480
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,812
Bravo.

481
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,159
Thank God.

482
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,795
God? There is no God, lady.

483
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,415
When can I get
the hell out of here?

484
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,432
Very soon.

485
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,900
It took some doing,

486
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,936
but I talked the clinic
into taking you back.

487
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,450
Wha...? Who asked you?!

488
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,940
You have an
appointment next Tuesday.

489
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:28,078
Yeah? Well, I ain't going.

490
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:32,449
Mr. Luck, if you don't
go, you'll come back here,

491
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,019
and neither one of us want that.

492
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,202
Shove it.

493
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:37,204
Excuse me?

494
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,906
What, are you deaf, too?

495
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,142
I said shove it,

496
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:43,617
you little pinhead puke.

497
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,146
Oh...

498
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:51,819
Excuse me.

499
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:53,821
I'm trying to find my son.

500
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,066
What's his name?

501
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,590
Andrew Bohlmeyer.

502
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,825
Andy.

503
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,626
Yes. Is he all right?

504
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:01,829
Your son was taken to surgery.

505
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,730
They're removing his spleen.

506
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:04,832
Oh, my God!

507
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,199
I'll take you up.

508
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:07,501
Please.

509
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,339
Edie!

510
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:13,941
I went by the house.

511
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,542
I was at the store.

512
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:16,743
Where are they?

513
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:18,745
Where's the other
boy... Larry Parks?

514
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:20,391
Are you Larry's mother?

515
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:21,548
Yes.

516
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,383
Where is he?

517
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,052
What?

518
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,737
Mrs. Parks...

519
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,606
your son was brought in

520
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,941
with severe
injuries to his head.

521
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,593
Are you telling me...

522
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,706
His heart wasn't beating.

523
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,030
He's dead?

524
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:37,597
Yes, he is. I'm sorry.

525
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,811
I am not a baby!

526
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,058
For God's sake,

527
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:55,715
can't you just put
it in my mouth?

528
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,717
Hospital policy, Mr. Luck.

529
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:59,719
I'll be back in ten minutes.

530
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:02,706
Wait a minute! How
about a little privacy here?

531
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:09,280
What's so funny?

532
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:13,283
You people never seen a guy
get his temperature taken before?

533
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:21,958
Andy.

534
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,840
How are you doing, honey?

535
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,631
Tired.

536
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,810
Numb.

537
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,479
Not in any pain?

538
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:31,613
Not really.

539
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,803
The girl...

540
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,305
is she okay?

541
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
No, she's not.

542
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,509
How did it happen, honey?

543
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:43,246
Larry ran a red light.

544
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:46,983
He was trying to beat it.

545
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,419
I told him to stop, but...

546
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,521
he said he could make it.

547
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:54,124
Oh, Andy.

548
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,999
Sweetie...

549
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,421
thank God you're all right.

550
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:14,694
I never said you were boring.

551
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,196
You implied it.

552
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:18,543
Mark, I think that you're an
extremely dynamic individual...

553
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,367
Especially in those glasses.

554
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:22,214
What's wrong with my glasses?

555
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:23,382
They're perfect.

556
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:24,538
Going to surgery.

557
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,784
Back in college,
every Friday night

558
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:28,820
I used to go to the Rathskeller

559
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:31,178
and drink beer...
Lots of beer. Pitchers.

560
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,757
You're right. I'm boring.

561
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,982
I've never done anything
irresponsible in my life.

562
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:37,984
Trust me. "Irresponsible"
is overrated.

563
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,531
I've never been arrested.

564
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:41,299
I've never gone out
and spent money

565
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:42,734
on something that I didn't need.

566
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,824
And I have never been to Bermuda

567
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,626
with a horny drug saleslady.

568
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,228
It's the Bahamas.

569
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:50,475
Trust me, I wouldn't be
going if she weren't paying.

570
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:51,631
She's paying?!

571
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,311
Everything... dinner, clothes...

572
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,514
I'm beginning to
feel like a kept man.

573
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:57,337
I've never been a kept man.

574
00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:59,973
Dr. Greene, she came
in with chest pain...

575
00:26:00,008 --> 00:26:01,975
Collapsed in the waiting room.

576
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,511
How long have you
been in pain, ma'am?

577
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:06,525
An hour. I was in the
kitchen, cooking dinner,

578
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:09,015
and the pressure
started right here.

579
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,362
Is it a heart attack?

580
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:11,518
I'm not sure.

581
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:13,353
Have you been sick recently?

582
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:15,856
I was diagnosed
with lupus last year.

583
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:17,536
She's been in remission.

584
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,926
Call Cardiology.

585
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,861
We need to get a consult.

586
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:23,864
Get an EKG, cardiac
enzyme and a chest film.

587
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:26,044
Sir, you're going to
have to wait outside.

588
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,534
No! I want him here.

589
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,213
All right, all right.

590
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,049
There we go. Sit down.

591
00:26:31,073 --> 00:26:32,372
Lie back.

592
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:33,685
Just relax.

593
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:34,853
Breathe easy.

594
00:26:34,877 --> 00:26:37,377
We're going to take care of you.

595
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,407
He<i> told</i> you he was driving

596
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,431
and you didn't tell anyone?

597
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,444
Who am I supposed to tell?

598
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,435
The police, for one.

599
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,605
Carol, the... the kid
committed manslaughter.

600
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,941
He killed two people.

601
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,943
I'm not sure it's my place.

602
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,945
Well, you know how it is.

603
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,381
Patients come in here,
scared, thinking they're dying,

604
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:01,117
and they tell us
things they wouldn't tell

605
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,787
their husbands or
wives or their priests.

606
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,958
This kid unburdened
his soul to me.

607
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,994
I just don't feel
right passing that on.

608
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:14,815
Please, honey, make sure

609
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,785
you tell the kids
not to eat all the...

610
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:23,791
Mark.

611
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:26,810
You guys moonlighting
as cardiologists?

612
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,890
Gurunian and
Bell are in surgery.

613
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,360
Kayson's on his way
from Highland Park.

614
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:33,194
Until he gets here, we're it.

615
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,018
Patient's 40. History of lupus.

616
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,519
Treated with Prednisone.

617
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,155
Presented with chest pain.

618
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,556
Heart rate's 112.

619
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:40,757
Pulsus paradoxus.

620
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,459
EKG shows an ST elevation.

621
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,261
You think there's an effusion?

622
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,395
I do. Sarah?

623
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,992
There's a silhouette sign.

624
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:48,781
Her blood pressure's dropping.

625
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,661
She needs a pericardiocentesis.

626
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:51,651
You ever done one?

627
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:52,669
Lots of times.

628
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:53,720
She's unconscious.

629
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,800
Move her to Trauma Two.

630
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:56,301
We can't wait for Kayson.

631
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,936
Peter, I'll need an
18-gauge PC needle

632
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,942
and an alligator clip.

633
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,444
What's happening?

634
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,357
There's a very thin
sac around the heart.

635
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,658
It's called the pericardium.

636
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,293
Your wife's is
filling with fluid.

637
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,695
It's squeezing the heart
so it can't beat properly.

638
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,630
We're going to insert
a needle in the sac

639
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,066
and drain the fluid out of it.

640
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,389
Stick a needle in her heart?

641
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,551
<i>Near</i> her heart.

642
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,076
You know, Sarah, I've
never had an opportunity

643
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,744
to do one of these procedures.

644
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,546
Since you've done a lot of them,

645
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:20,547
I was wondering...

646
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:21,882
You want to do it?

647
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,216
Do it.

648
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:24,951
I'll back you up.

649
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,944
Hey.

650
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,282
Oh.

651
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,284
That's funny.

652
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,952
I was just thinking about you.

653
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,954
Pleasant thoughts?

654
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,357
Very pleasant.

655
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,392
Have a seat.

656
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,698
Um... actually...

657
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,032
Whew!

658
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,018
I, uh...

659
00:28:58,053 --> 00:29:00,703
I feel like I owe
you an apology.

660
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,707
Um... I know that
lately I've been difficult,

661
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,709
to put it mildly.

662
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,680
And uh... I'm-I'm... I'm
sorry if I've embarrassed you.

663
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:13,333
You haven't embarrassed me.

664
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,168
I'm worried about you.

665
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:20,140
Well, I've been, um...
I've been pretty depressed.

666
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:26,045
Have you thought about...
talking to someone?

667
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,731
A therapist?

668
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,335
Things are starting
to fall into place.

669
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,171
I... I wouldn't worry too much.

670
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:37,023
So, are we still on for dinner?

671
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:39,559
With your sister
and her new beau?

672
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:41,411
I wouldn't miss it.

673
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,708
Maybe we can talk afterwards.

674
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:45,849
I'd like that.

675
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:59,345
Mrs. Parks?

676
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:02,816
Can I get you anything?

677
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:04,150
Call you a ride?

678
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,653
What? Um... no.

679
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:09,656
If I, um... could just sit down.

680
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,157
Sure. Sure.

681
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:13,660
I just saw my son.

682
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:16,529
He was so cold.

683
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:26,623
I looked at his face,

684
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,108
and all I wanted to do

685
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:31,978
was to slap him.

686
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:36,900
To hit him, and to say

687
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,853
"You stupid boy!

688
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:44,141
"How could you do this...

689
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,126
"to yourself?!

690
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:48,127
"That poor girl...

691
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:52,131
how could you leave me?!"

692
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:56,303
Oh, dear God.

693
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:59,172
What's wrong with me?

694
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,566
You seen my patient?

695
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:10,934
Middle-aged...

696
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,246
She-male?

697
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,403
Mm-hmm.

698
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,106
Must have gone
to the ladies' room.

699
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,313
Insert the needle
at about 45 degrees,

700
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,182
gently aspirating as you go.

701
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,284
When you reach the pericardium,

702
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,086
you'll begin to draw fluid.

703
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,623
The EKG will let you
know if you touch the heart.

704
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,293
I got to be getting close.

705
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,764
Anything?

706
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,265
No.

707
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,778
Pull back.

708
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:45,252
You've hit heart muscle.

709
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:46,586
What's going on, Sarah?

710
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:48,321
Nothing's coming out.

711
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:50,474
The pericardium
must be infected.

712
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:51,975
The fluid's too thick

713
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,326
for the needle.

714
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:55,011
She's fibrillating.

715
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,585
Clear!

716
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:04,821
Sinus.

717
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,105
We got a pulse.

718
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,441
We should crack her.

719
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:09,910
Crack her chest, and
morbidity goes through the roof.

720
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:12,189
If we don't release the
pressure in 30 seconds,

721
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,814
Do a window.
This lady could die.

722
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,417
Make an eight-centimeter
cut at the xyphoid. Do it now.

723
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,919
Okay.

724
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:23,039
Now open the diaphragm and
cut out a window of pericardium.

725
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,408
Maybe two inches...
Not too big... or her heart

726
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,476
will jump out.

727
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,311
You can do it, Peter. Do it.

728
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:31,832
That's it.

729
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,416
Keep going.

730
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,635
Keep going.

731
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:39,389
All right.

732
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:40,790
That's it. Suction.

733
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:45,445
Okay, here it comes.

734
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,213
We got fluid.

735
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:48,598
We got a beat.

736
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,283
Oh, man.

737
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,717
Pressure's back.

738
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:54,637
Throw a couple of
stitches around the tube.

739
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,407
I think you can take
it from here, Peter.

740
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,754
Andy?

741
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,495
How are you?

742
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,964
I'm okay.

743
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,000
The police talk to you yet?

744
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,587
They will.

745
00:33:27,622 --> 00:33:33,593
Andy, I heard what
you told your mother

746
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,495
and I understand why.

747
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,597
You're in a lot of pain,

748
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,933
and you don't want
to bring on any more.

749
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:47,440
Do you think it's fair to
let Larry's mother believe

750
00:33:47,476 --> 00:33:48,942
he killed that girl?

751
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:51,093
I know you feel guilty, Andy,

752
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,280
but it's only going
to get worse.

753
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:56,616
I know.

754
00:33:56,651 --> 00:34:01,621
I've kept things from people,
and it makes you hate yourself.

755
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:04,273
It makes it hard to
live with yourself.

756
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,428
Ever kill anyone before?

757
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,666
No.

758
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:20,973
But I've done things
to hurt people...

759
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:22,558
People close to me.

760
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,061
And you told them?

761
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,763
Not everything, no.

762
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:31,467
It's not so easy...

763
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,486
is it?

764
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,886
What's going on, Jerry?

765
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,544
Jumper on the roof.

766
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,128
Some lady.

767
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,098
Looks like she's going to go.

768
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:46,466
Oh, God!

769
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,271
Excuse me.

770
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,973
She's my patient.

771
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,144
Miss Carleton, please.

772
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,411
Please.

773
00:34:58,446 --> 00:34:59,512
Don't come...

774
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:01,197
Don't come any closer.

775
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,716
Okay. Okay. Uh...

776
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:06,669
uh...

777
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,489
Miss Carleton, I know
you must be feeling

778
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,792
really terrible right
now, but, uh... but...

779
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:14,594
but there's people...

780
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,281
there's people in the
hospital that can help you.

781
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,318
I can't pass for a
woman anymore.

782
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,791
That's all I've
ever wanted to be.

783
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,060
Could you just look at me?

784
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,935
Just look at me and talk to me?

785
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,815
We can talk about it.

786
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:40,920
Carter.

787
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:42,772
Oh, thank God.

788
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,374
Would you like to introduce me

789
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,026
to your friend?

790
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:50,880
Miss Carleton, there's a
doctor here who can help you.

791
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,083
Is it okay

792
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:53,749
if he talks...?

793
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,651
No, don't!

794
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,337
Oh, God!

795
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:17,223
Mmm. That looks good.

796
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,724
This is really good.

797
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,725
Hey!

798
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:20,726
Stop it.

799
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,727
Party time!

800
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,996
All right!

801
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,181
Hey, Haleh, pass
the yams, please?

802
00:36:30,205 --> 00:36:32,738
It's a buffet.

803
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,674
Get your own yams.

804
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:38,011
Hi.

805
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:39,012
Hi.

806
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,325
You heard about the...?

807
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:41,481
Yeah. Awful.

808
00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:42,949
Any luck getting off?

809
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:44,550
No.

810
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:47,887
Can we take a walk?

811
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:49,755
Sure.

812
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,923
Great.

813
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,883
You ready, sweets?

814
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,352
Ready as I'll ever be.

815
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,020
Okay. Here's your ticket.

816
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,121
Yeah.

817
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:08,191
Oh, my God. These are coach.

818
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,692
Hold on, huh?

819
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,496
Oh, to be a kept man.

820
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,109
Not one complaint out of you.

821
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,433
Because, in an hour,

822
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,446
you're going to
be sitting at a table

823
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,404
with your beautiful wife
and your beautiful daughter

824
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,051
and your family all around,

825
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,119
and I'm going to
be at 30,000 feet

826
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:28,111
sucking down vodka gimlets
with a woman who dresses me.

827
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,325
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are?

828
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,748
If you don't want
to go, don't go.

829
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,501
A little late for that.
Shut up. Here she comes.

830
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:37,103
All fixed.

831
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:38,437
Okay.

832
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:39,772
The limo's waiting.

833
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:40,974
Well, happy Thanksgiving.

834
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,375
Okay. Happy Thanksgiving.

835
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,476
Thanks.

836
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,577
Bye.

837
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:08,501
So, is this good news or bad?

838
00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:12,705
Oh, boy.

839
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,675
I need to talk to you
about something.

840
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,611
What?

841
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:22,549
During the time that
we've been going out,

842
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:26,052
I slept with Doug Ross.

843
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:31,458
When?

844
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:33,759
Last winter.

845
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:36,862
Before you took the pills?

846
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,499
Yeah.

847
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,470
Since then?

848
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:48,741
No.

849
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:51,978
But, two weeks ago...

850
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:54,514
he kissed me and I let him.

851
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,300
Tag, wait.

852
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:04,690
Just go to hell,
okay? Just go to hell.

853
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:06,992
Just because you
try to kill yourself,

854
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:08,495
I'm supposed to
sit back and smile

855
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,029
while you screw
your old boyfriend?

856
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:11,664
What more do you
want from me, Carol?

857
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:13,366
I've been patient.
I've been faithful.

858
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:15,668
Should I treat you like
garbage like Doug Ross does?

859
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:17,003
Is that what you want?

860
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:20,507
No. I want you.

861
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:23,354
Why would you tell me
something like this anyway?

862
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:26,679
Because I've been dishonest,
and I need for you to know.

863
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:29,026
Okay, great. Now I
know, okay? I know!

864
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,961
What am I supposed to do now,

865
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:32,502
okay?

866
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,254
Tag!

867
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,028
Hey, Sarah.

868
00:39:43,064 --> 00:39:44,564
Yeah?

869
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,932
The, uh... heart
lady is doing fine.

870
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,236
She's going to be home
with her family tomorrow.

871
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:51,738
Good.

872
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:54,407
So, uh... you
start the fellowship

873
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:55,975
next week, huh?

874
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,577
I leave tomorrow.

875
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:58,745
Yeah.

876
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,247
Well, I'm sure
you'll be just great.

877
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:02,415
Probably.

878
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,816
See you.

879
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:06,719
Uh... Sarah? Um...

880
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,454
I, um...

881
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:16,061
Thanks, you know, for, uh...
letting me do the procedure

882
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,308
and, uh... you know...

883
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,250
backing me up when
things got crazy today.

884
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,602
This is a teaching
hospital, Peter.

885
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:27,240
Helping those under you,
looking out for each other...

886
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:29,909
That's what it's
supposed to be about.

887
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,543
Yeah.

888
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:33,579
Peter?

889
00:40:33,615 --> 00:40:35,515
It was a great save.

890
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:40,887
I'll see you in the spring.

891
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:07,212
Carter...

892
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:10,783
if anybody's
responsible, it's me.

893
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:12,919
She came in here

894
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:17,823
because she crashed
her car into a bridge.

895
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:21,060
Now, I should have
recognized that

896
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,345
as a suicide attempt,

897
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,332
but I didn't.

898
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,033
So, next time,

899
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,504
we'll<i> both</i> be more attentive.

900
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,968
Come on, Carter. Let's go.

901
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,188
What?

902
00:41:49,223 --> 00:41:51,557
My family... they're
holding dinner until 7:30.

903
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,659
If we hurry up, we
can catch the prayer.

904
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:55,595
Thank you, Dr. Benton.

905
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,764
I think I just want to be alone.

906
00:41:57,799 --> 00:42:00,216
Carter, you promised
my mother, didn't you?

907
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,717
What are you going to do?

908
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,647
You going to back out?

909
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:04,820
Come on.

910
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:05,988
Grab your coat.

911
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,473
Let's go.

912
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:11,026
Let's go, Carter.

913
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,054
Come and get it!

914
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,322
Ronnie, come on.

915
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,257
Turn off the damn TV.

916
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,360
I guess we shouldn't
wait for Div any longer.

917
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,028
You snooze, you lose.

918
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,663
I'm starving.

919
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,771
Chloe, how long did
you cook this turkey?

920
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,274
I don't know. A couple hours.

921
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,743
A turkey this size
needs at least six hours.

922
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:04,013
Try some. It tastes good.

923
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,625
It's teeming with bacteria.

924
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,294
I'm putting it back in the oven.

925
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,229
If we're lucky, we
can eat at 10:00.

926
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,864
Maybe Div will be here by then.

927
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,005
Wait a minute. You
got to be kidding me.

928
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,624
What's the matter? You
can't read a cookbook?

929
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,110
Why don't you shut up?

930
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:18,410
All you did all day

931
00:43:18,446 --> 00:43:19,862
was sit on your
ass and watch TV.

932
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,408
That's what I always
do on Thanksgiving.

933
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,493
That<i> is</i> Thanksgiving to me.

934
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,178
Besides, who
bought the groceries?

935
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,812
Who bought the beer?
Did it just walk in?

936
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:26,919
With<i> my</i> money!

937
00:43:26,954 --> 00:43:28,766
Shut up, both of
you. You act like

938
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:29,889
two-year-olds.

939
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,603
Come on.

940
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,741
Come on. Come on! Come on!!

941
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:19,472
