1
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:16,122
Carter.

2
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:17,458
Morning, Dr. Benton.

3
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:19,139
Did you pick up my labs?

4
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,296
Right here.

5
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:21,476
Where's Deb?

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,646
She's sick.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,815
Who said she could
be sick? What is that?

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:24,805
Two feet of necrotic bowel.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,807
And what are you doing with it?

10
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:26,809
I am taking it to the desk.

11
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:27,811
Research is picking it up.

12
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:29,058
Soon, I hope.

13
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:30,817
Guy infarcted. Needed
a crash hemicolectomy.

14
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:31,997
When?

15
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:33,154
Couple of hours ago.

16
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,657
Who did the procedure?

17
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:35,726
Jagman.

18
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:36,906
Jagman? Damn!

19
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,910
Why didn't you admit the
woman with pressure sores?

20
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,613
Because her problem
isn't surgical. Carter!

21
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:41,748
She needs to be debrided.

22
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:43,485
If we don't admit her,
she's not going to heal.

23
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,254
Look, she's diabetic. Maybe
medicine will take her home,

24
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,492
but she's not coming
on my service.

25
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:49,218
Hey, Peter, those
Dale Carnegie classes

26
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:50,553
are really starting to show.

27
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:52,469
He's been on for 48
hours straight. Really?

28
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:54,393
Traded a couple of shifts
with people last week

29
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,164
so he could be with
his mom, and now it's...

30
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:57,344
Payback time. Yeah.

31
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,704
Carter, there's a
code brown in two.

32
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,842
Find a nurse. Clean
it up now. Move.

33
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:04,146
Unfortunately,
payback rolls downhill.

34
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:10,558
Did I miss her breakfast?

35
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:12,227
We're just starting.

36
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:14,410
The family development
person came by

37
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,202
and stayed for three hours.

38
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:17,438
Ms. Brown called.

39
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:19,854
She said you passed
with flying colors. Really?

40
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:22,080
They're expediting
your application.

41
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,761
Oh, Helen, I can't
thank you enough.

42
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,086
How's she been?

43
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:27,791
Fever's gone, but I
think she's homesick.

44
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:34,637
<i>Dobreya utro.</i>

45
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:36,240
<i>Ti</i> okay?

46
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:43,002
<i>Botchemu.</i>

47
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:45,023
<i>Ya skuchayu za Inga.</i>

48
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:46,341
Ah.

49
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:49,798
She misses the nurse
she was close to in Russia.

50
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:53,622
Can I ask her if she
wants to come live with me?

51
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:54,974
Sure.

52
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:01,086
<i>Tatiana, ti hochyesh

53
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,007
<i>Ew tayba doma?</i>

54
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:05,144
<i>Da, ew meenya.</i>

55
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,500
<i>Ew teyba est VCR?</i>

56
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:11,189
Yes, I have a VCR.

57
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:16,699
Hey, Doug.

58
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:21,041
Hey, is that Mark Greene,
the future E.R. attending?

59
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:22,377
You found out?

60
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:24,180
Not from you, schmuck.

61
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,985
I didn't want it to
get out, you know,

62
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,223
till Morgenstern made
the announcement.

63
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:30,392
Word's out. Congratulations.

64
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:32,062
Thanks.

65
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:33,731
What did Jen say?

66
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:37,038
She signed on for
another year with the judge.

67
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,387
In Milwaukee? Oh, no.

68
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:42,714
It's been awful, but
if I can make this shot

69
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,086
there's still hope
for my marriage.

70
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,424
There's hope.

71
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,527
When did the rash appear?

72
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:51,732
Two days ago with a fever.

73
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,736
It started on your chest?

74
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,238
Yeah. Then it spread.

75
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:56,673
I think I'm allergic

76
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,078
to one of the
medications I'm taking.

77
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:00,581
What are you taking?

78
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,151
Here.

79
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:07,094
"P-43B, ZX-7."

80
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,831
I've never heard of these.

81
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:11,435
They're experimental.
I'm a test subject.

82
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,441
You know, answer those
ads in the school paper:

83
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,110
If you suffer from asthma

84
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,225
nicotine addiction,
panic attacks,

85
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:20,380
call this number,
earn extra cash.

86
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:21,370
They pay you?

87
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:22,372
Oh, yeah.

88
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,077
I'm doing this one
where they inject...

89
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:28,662
radioactive isotopes
into my brain.

90
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,320
That one pays real well.

91
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:33,410
Well, I guess we call the
numbers on these vials

92
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:36,081
to see which drug is
causing your reaction,

93
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:38,921
but for now, your test
subject days are over.

94
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:41,192
Oh.

95
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:43,395
How much you make a year?

96
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,251
Did you stick Mr. Penny
for his blood gases?

97
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:47,253
Stuck him. Well, all right.
Discharge the abscess.

98
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:48,633
Just need your signature.

99
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:50,993
Dr. Hicks, a bowel infarction
came in this morning.

100
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:52,328
I wasn't called.

101
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:54,466
You've been
trading shifts again.

102
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,814
That's irrelevant. I
was the resident on call.

103
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:58,174
And as a result, you've
been on for 48 hours straight.

104
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,745
I don't see what
that has to do with it.

105
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,947
Have you slept at all, Peter?

106
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:02,949
Look, I require
very little sleep.

107
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,296
I am perfectly capable
of handling my patients.

108
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,654
I didn't think so.

109
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,753
You shouldn't be treating
patients in your condition,

110
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:08,810
much less doing surgery.

111
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,726
I've never done
a bowel infarction.

112
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,828
Jagman has done two.

113
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,687
Oh, for God's sakes,
Peter, this isn't a competition.

114
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:16,953
Oh, no? Then why are
we required to keep logs

115
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:18,512
of every procedure that we do?

116
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:20,515
As a record, not a scorecard.

117
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,864
Oh, yeah. Right. You're
keeping score, and you know it.

118
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,189
That's enough.
I'm concerned that

119
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:26,744
your fatigue is
impairing your judgment.

120
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,291
Find a room. Lie down two hours.

121
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:29,582
That won't be necessary.

122
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:30,951
This isn't a suggestion.

123
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:34,357
You will not see another
patient until you've slept.

124
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:35,426
Got it?

125
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:44,794
Captioning sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

126
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,508
Are you kidding, Susan?

127
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:28,822
We don't have time to
sort through these drugs.

128
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:30,213
Turf the kid to medicine.

129
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,549
I tried.

130
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:32,729
Got into a screaming
match with Warner.

131
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:33,898
She won't even come
down for a consult.

132
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:36,157
Screaming doesn't
work with Warner.

133
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,072
You have to use
the soft sell. Observe.

134
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,009
Morning, Jer. What do you got?

135
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,735
Uh. Full house. Take your pick.

136
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,272
Dr. Ross, Diane Leeds
in risk management

137
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:45,608
just called for you.

138
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,788
Oh, yeah? What'd she want?

139
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,215
She said she wants
to go out with you.

140
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,216
What?

141
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:51,385
Just kidding.

142
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:52,934
I think it was
something about that guy

143
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,058
you decked the other day.

144
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,727
Jerry, did I ever I tell you

145
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:57,576
you're my least favorite clerk?

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,700
I am not a clerk.

147
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,235
I'm an emergency
service coordinator.

148
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,251
Doug, we've got a
burn in one. Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,510
Carter, here. Write these labs.

150
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:06,526
I'll take the knee lac in five.

151
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,518
You know, I noticed
exam four is open.

152
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:09,854
What?

153
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,893
In case you wanted to lie down
and take a nap or something.

154
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,879
It was a great catch, Joyce.

155
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:19,840
I never would have
thought of sickle-cell...

156
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:23,513
Yes, you do.

157
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:25,851
Anyway, I do have a favor.

158
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,924
This kid on experimental
meds is getting worse.

159
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,795
Susan Lewis can't
make heads or tails of it.

160
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:35,235
Could you<i> please</i> come
down here and bail her out?

161
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:37,853
Ah. Thank you.

162
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:40,556
Here you go. She's
on her way down.

163
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,814
Thanks.

164
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,150
Ow! Ow!

165
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,054
It's okay. How'd this happen?

166
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,389
It's my fault.

167
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:48,861
The plastic knob came off
the radiator in the kitchen

168
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:50,865
and she grabbed the metal part.

169
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,814
Bonnie, can you wiggle
your fingers for me?

170
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:53,803
Just wiggle them.

171
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,373
Are you okay?

172
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:57,377
It's my fault. Ow! Ow!

173
00:06:57,412 --> 00:07:00,115
She's got a second-degree
burn, Mrs. Howe.

174
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:03,621
I don't think it's going to
affect the use of her hand.

175
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,494
We're going to clean
it up with some saline.

176
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,812
Okay, Bonnie, you
hang in there, okay?

177
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:11,414
I've never seen

178
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:13,680
a star-shaped
radiator knob before.

179
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,513
Nope. I'm going to call
around to other hospitals,

180
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:19,030
see if she's been
seen anywhere else.

181
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,286
Excuse me. Can you help me?

182
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,488
Excuse me.

183
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:24,979
Malik, get a gurney.

184
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:26,315
Excuse me.

185
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,650
What happened?

186
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:29,321
He was sitting
in the restaurant.

187
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:32,058
Just finished breakfast
when he keels over,

188
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:33,261
starts shaking and shivering.

189
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,263
His eyes roll back in his head.

190
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:35,410
What is it?

191
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:36,678
Sounds like a seizure,
grand mal type.

192
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,019
Curtain two's open.

193
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:39,356
No tongue abrasions.

194
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,770
No signs of incontinence.
Are you related?

195
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,228
No, no. I manage the restaurant.

196
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:43,630
Thank you for bringing him in.

197
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:44,867
We'll take it from here.

198
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:47,015
Just a second.
Look, if he's okay,

199
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,606
have him call me, okay?

200
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,204
Well, I know this sounds bad,

201
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:53,132
but he didn't pay the check.

202
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,397
He had the champagne brunch...

203
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:56,472
Steak and eggs.

204
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:57,807
It was a $35 meal.

205
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,290
<i>Neighbor heard a crash,
found him at the bottom</i>

206
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,849
of the stairs.

207
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,117
Vitals?

208
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:04,453
80/60. Heart's racing at 128.

209
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,122
Did you get any I.V. in?

210
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,793
No. I couldn't find a vein.

211
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,496
All right. Haleh,
prep for a central line.

212
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,149
Okay, people.

213
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,474
Let's get him in.

214
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,789
Let's get him
across on my counts.

215
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,283
Now, listen, we're going
to do this nice and gentle.

216
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:22,064
Do you hear me?
One, two, three, go.

217
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:23,054
Here we go. Here we go.

218
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,056
Watch the line.

219
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:25,392
Here we go.

220
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,229
Capillary...

221
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:28,281
Betadine.

222
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:29,283
All right, the old
guy's got a G tube.

223
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,598
Does anybody know his name?

224
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:33,023
Joseph Klein.

225
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,875
Hypotensive, B.P.'s 50 palp.

226
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:35,722
Pedal edema.
Congestive heart failure.

227
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,176
No breath sounds.
Trachial shift.

228
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,166
Lung's collapsed.

229
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:39,280
Must have broken a rib.

230
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,604
This guy's a train wreck.

231
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,218
Let's get a chest tube tray now.

232
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:43,387
Can I have more? Yeah.

233
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:44,328
Can you understand
me? Talk to me.

234
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,226
Carter, he can't.
Look at his neck.

235
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,329
No voice box.

236
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,237
He's in pain.

237
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:50,433
Can we give him something?

238
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:52,760
Stand by with morphine.

239
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:56,200
Here we go. All right,
Carter, 28 French. Move.

240
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,703
Start lasix.

241
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,558
80 milligrams I.V. push.

242
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,123
Let's get some
restraints in here.

243
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:05,295
He wants the morphine now.

244
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:06,731
Come on. Over here, now. Move!

245
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,501
Line's in.

246
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,877
Load the dopamine

247
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:11,507
400 milligrams. 250, D5w.

248
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:12,347
We're going to take care of you.

249
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:14,668
Everything's going to be okay.

250
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,599
Pressure's 120/80. Not bad.

251
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,924
Reflexes are normal.

252
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,629
I don't see any signs
of a seizure, do you?

253
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:22,445
No. He has an
irregular heartbeat.

254
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:24,871
Hey, he just opened his eye.

255
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:25,889
Really?

256
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:26,926
Yeah.

257
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,369
Hello in there.

258
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,574
I know you're busy
having a coma.

259
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,912
Do you want to
tell us why, Mr...

260
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,314
Do we have a name?

261
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:41,062
Actually, we have several.

262
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:43,267
Art Moss, Sam Hart
and Gene Finch.

263
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,524
Hello. Me again.

264
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,595
I just want to let you know

265
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,166
that you actually do
have a medical problem.

266
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:51,437
We're going to have to go in.

267
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:52,806
Rib spreader.

268
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:00,020
Hell of a way to
get a free meal.

269
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:01,006
Okay, can you get bloods?

270
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,007
B.P.?

271
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,388
Still low. 60 palp.

272
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:06,032
Increase the dopamine
ten mics per minute.

273
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,562
You got a number ten blade?

274
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:09,071
Hang in there, Mr. Klein.

275
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:10,506
Let's have it.

276
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,978
He came in with
congestive heart failure,

277
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,158
tension pneumo.

278
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,829
He's on high-dose dopamine.

279
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:17,832
Peter's putting in a chest tube.

280
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,357
Okay, I'll take it from here.

281
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:20,542
I got it.

282
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:22,563
I'll take it from here.

283
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:24,846
Either get some
sleep or go home.

284
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,536
I won't tell you again.

285
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,695
Mr. Klein's old chart came up.

286
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,531
Can I see it?

287
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,137
Check to see what meds he's on.

288
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:45,923
Chest tube's in.

289
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,460
We got breath sounds.

290
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,648
Pulse ox up to 90 from 82.

291
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,319
Train is back on the tracks.

292
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:54,055
Nice job, everybody.

293
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,992
Mr. Klein has terminal cancer

294
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:59,732
and the last time he was here,
he signed a paper requesting

295
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:03,105
that no heroic measures
be taken to prolong his life.

296
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,815
You and Jen are going to
go another year like this?

297
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,008
I guess we're going to have to.

298
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,010
Hey, Dr. Greene, congrats

299
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:24,456
on that new attending gig.

300
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,427
Thanks. Jen is adamant about
keeping her job in Milwaukee?

301
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:27,819
She wants me to move there.

302
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,923
I can't give up this
job as attending...

303
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:30,991
Can I help you?

304
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:32,160
Dr. Greene, right?

305
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:33,229
Yes. John Koch, M.I.T.

306
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:34,910
Sloan school of management.

307
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,202
What can I do for you?

308
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,570
They didn't call you?

309
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:38,706
No.

310
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:39,886
I made arrangements

311
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,488
to observe your department.

312
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:43,159
I'm doing research
for the Andover project,

313
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:44,394
which you may have heard of.

314
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:45,731
Uh... White House
press conference,

315
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:46,721
profile on CNN?

316
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:47,923
Must have missed it.

317
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,427
In a nutshell, we're
building a new hospital

318
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:53,032
for the 21st century,
scrapping the old model

319
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:54,647
with its competing factions

320
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:57,107
in favor of a more
collaborative paradigm.

321
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:58,342
Like a team approach?

322
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:00,358
Yes, but on a
comprehensive scale.

323
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:02,918
We're re-conceptualizing
the hospital...

324
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,400
Architecturally,
organizationally, ergonomically.

325
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,804
We hope to build the model

326
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,397
on which all future
hospitals will be based.

327
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:12,770
So you'd like to watch us to
see how it shouldn't be done?

328
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:14,084
On the contrary. This place
has a superior reputation.

329
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,844
I want to keep what works
and change what doesn't.

330
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,647
Well, feel free to look around.

331
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:19,795
Great. Oh, uh,

332
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,363
I couldn't help overhearing.

333
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,925
I may have a solution
to you and your wife's

334
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,095
uh, geographic
impasse. Excuse me?

335
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,667
Kenosha. Midway between
Chicago and Milwaukee.

336
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:30,749
Commute's less than
an hour each way.

337
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:32,251
You can live under one roof,

338
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:33,742
both keep your jobs.

339
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,484
Huh.

340
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:47,184
Mr. Klein.

341
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,722
Mr. Klein, I'm John Carter.

342
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:53,029
You might remember
me from earlier.

343
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,066
I brought a pad and pen

344
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:58,039
in case you want
to say something.

345
00:12:58,074 --> 00:13:01,845
I'll just put them here on
the end of the table here.

346
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,020
Mr. Klein, I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

347
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:08,269
Your blood pressure's
still pretty low

348
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:09,827
so I contacted your H.M.O.

349
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:12,398
and they're going to
send an ambulance over

350
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:14,147
to take you to their hospital

351
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,075
once you've stabilized,
but that might be a while.

352
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,649
So... there's no next of
kin listed in your chart.

353
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:24,154
Is there anyone I can call?

354
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:29,648
Can you understand
me, Mr. Klein?

355
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:35,742
Okay.

356
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,108
Mr. Klein?

357
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,502
I'm sorry, I didn't under...

358
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,191
Roger.

359
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:18,656
Roger. Roger, that's a...
is he a family member?

360
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,578
I-is it your son?

361
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,405
Do you know his
telephone number?

362
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:34,186
Blooming... B-Bloomington?

363
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:36,284
He lives in Bloomington?

364
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,255
He lives in Bloomington

365
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,693
and his name is Roger Klein?

366
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:42,752
Okay. Okay, great.

367
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:47,123
I will be back in a little bit.

368
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:56,744
Hey, Lydia, any interest
in becoming charge nurse?

369
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,791
Me? Yeah.

370
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:58,781
Not on your life.

371
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,486
Oh.

372
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:01,799
Why do you ask?

373
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:05,194
Because Tag and I are
going to be foster parents

374
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,265
to that little Russian girl.

375
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,634
The one with AIDS?

376
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:09,903
Tatiana. I want to spend

377
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:11,506
as much time as I can with her,

378
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,309
so I'm cutting
back on my shifts.

379
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:15,580
Really.

380
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,965
What?

381
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,547
Well, it just seems
like a tough way

382
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,871
to start off a marriage.

383
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:21,759
You think it's a bad idea?

384
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:23,072
No, I, uh...

385
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,141
Oh, look, Carol,

386
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:26,345
it doesn't matter what I think.

387
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:28,972
I'm certainly no
expert on marriage.

388
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:31,176
Forget I said anything, okay?

389
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,409
Carol, Mercy General's

390
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,682
calling you back.

391
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,698
Something about a
kid with a burned hand.

392
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,008
Okay. I'll be right back.

393
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,526
Sorry. I didn't
mean to wake you.

394
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,517
You didn't.

395
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,097
Came for a blood gas kit.

396
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,389
Any traumas come in?

397
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:57,793
Yeah. Two-car
accident, lacerated liver,

398
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,028
went up to the O.R.

399
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:00,141
Who's doing it?

400
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:01,679
Jackie. Never
mind, don't tell me.

401
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:02,848
Uh, half hour to go.

402
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:05,085
Carter, uh, keep
an eye on the charts.

403
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,122
Anything surgical,
bring it to me.

404
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:08,246
Can I do that?

405
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:10,349
I thought we were
just supposed to wait

406
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:12,287
until we were
called for a consult.

407
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:13,891
Carter...

408
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,727
just do it, all right?

409
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:17,095
Okay.

410
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:22,974
Mrs. Howe, can we
see you outside, please?

411
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,944
I will be right back.

412
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:26,480
Okay.

413
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:28,896
What? What is it?

414
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,857
Your daughter was
seen at another hospital

415
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:35,096
with a star-shaped burn,
and we'd like to know

416
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:36,265
what's going on.

417
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,080
She touched the radiator.

418
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:40,640
This is not a
radiator burn, ma'am.

419
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,543
Now, what really happened?

420
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:43,690
It's personal.

421
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:46,717
Maybe I can talk
with Mrs. Howe alone.

422
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,071
Sure.

423
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,723
Mrs. Howe, I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation

424
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:53,893
for what's happening,
but if you want me

425
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,297
to help Bonnie, you
have to let me know

426
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:57,333
what's going on.

427
00:16:57,357 --> 00:16:59,270
It's okay to tell me the truth.

428
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:02,597
Most people don't understand.

429
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:05,220
I'm pretty understanding.

430
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:08,926
You promise you
won't tell the doctor?

431
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,664
Yes.

432
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:17,593
She touches
herself... down there.

433
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:19,596
I tell her not to.

434
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,235
I give her three chances

435
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:25,675
and then I use the paperweight.

436
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,261
The paperweight?

437
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,748
I put it on the stove.

438
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:32,387
I didn't mean to hurt her.

439
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,892
I guess I just
left it on too long.

440
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:40,469
It's not as bad as it
sounds, you know?

441
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:45,846
My mother did the
same thing to me.

442
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,570
Okay. The doctor is going
to want a plastic surgeon

443
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:52,943
to see Bonnie's hand,
so you need to stay here

444
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:54,145
a little longer.

445
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,932
All right.

446
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,208
K-l-e-i-n, first name Roger.

447
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:02,712
I don't know the street.

448
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,715
Jerry, I need a $20 taxi voucher

449
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,518
to send Mrs. Von Avery home.

450
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:09,223
I'm out of vouchers,
but I have petty cash.

451
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:11,796
Hey, Carter, when is
somebody going to come

452
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,198
and pick up this bowel?

453
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,667
I don't know, Jer.

454
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,909
Uh, let's see...

455
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:20,022
twenty.

456
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:21,279
Thank you.

457
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:23,417
Excuse me, could you change a 20

458
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:24,986
for the vending machine?

459
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,133
Sure, sure.

460
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:28,827
One, two, three, four, five

461
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:31,098
five is ten, 15 and 20.

462
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:34,136
Actually, could I have a
ten for two of the fives?

463
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:36,875
Uh, okay.

464
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:38,545
Right there.

465
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:41,868
Here you are.

466
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:45,307
Uh... you gave me 19.

467
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:47,012
19? You're an honest man.

468
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:48,458
You want to get that? I got it.

469
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:50,050
Actually, I have ones here.

470
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,054
Why don't I give you a buck?

471
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,389
That'll make 20.

472
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,963
You can give me the
20 back that I gave you

473
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:58,031
and that'll

474
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,317
make us even.

475
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:00,319
Okay.

476
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:02,156
Thanks, boy.

477
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,126
Jerry, when did
this one come in?

478
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:05,596
Uh, couple of minutes ago.

479
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:07,098
Great.

480
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:10,638
<i>Patient's a 52-year-old
male with a history</i>

481
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:12,203
of calcium oxalate stones.

482
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:14,774
Intravenous pyelogram showed
a six millimeter kidney stone

483
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,569
in the calyx, consistent
with obstructive uropathy.

484
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:20,174
Lithotripsy unsuccessful,
urology's been paged.

485
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,176
We started an I.V.

486
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:22,644
for hydration, and gave him

487
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,882
five milligrams of
morphine for the pain.

488
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,063
And it ain't working!

489
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:27,498
Mr. Furst, I'm Dr. Benton.

490
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:29,001
When did the pain increase?

491
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,004
Been getting worse
for two days. Ah!

492
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,106
My internist, Dr. Feldman, said

493
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,128
if the stone didn't
pass this morning

494
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:35,485
I should get it cut out.

495
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,701
All right, well, I
couldn't agree more.

496
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,171
Let's move him. Let's get
him up there. Here we go.

497
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,161
Oh!

498
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:43,534
Oh, boy! Oh..!

499
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:44,815
Peter, hold up.

500
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,839
That's my patient.

501
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,341
Where are you taking him?

502
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:48,454
Up to the O.R.

503
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,224
He's got an obstructed stone.

504
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:51,292
Wait a minute. What?!

505
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,218
I haven't examined him yet.

506
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:54,220
Yeah, well, I have.

507
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:55,356
You're supposed to wait

508
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:56,758
until I call for a consult.

509
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:58,491
Please, doc, let him
go! I'm dying here.

510
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:00,393
All right, you want
to examine him?

511
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:02,019
Here, go ahead, examine him.

512
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,349
Don't pull this crap again, huh?

513
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:12,756
It's all so unnecessary.

514
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,158
Excuse me?

515
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,339
This territorialism...

516
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:17,175
The friction between
departments.

517
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,802
It's all part of an outdated
patriarchal system

518
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:21,049
based on confrontation

519
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:22,936
where he who yells
the loudest wins

520
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,874
even though he
may be totally wrong.

521
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:26,331
Yep. That's
how it is, all right.

522
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,594
Doesn't have to be.

523
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:30,156
Picture this: a hospital
without departments

524
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:32,404
where every floor
is staffed by a team

525
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:34,508
comprising their
various specialties.

526
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:36,161
No time wasted on battles

527
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,232
about your service, my service.

528
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:40,959
They've been replaced by
a more evolved, harmonious

529
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:42,461
if you will, feminine model

530
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:44,376
in which the patient
belongs to us.

531
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,035
Sounds good, but does it exist?

532
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,182
It will.

533
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,492
I'm building it.

534
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:50,811
And you are again...?

535
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:56,471
John Koch, M.I.T., Sloan
School of Management.

536
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:02,249
We have a problem.

537
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:04,920
She doesn't want to wait
for the plastic surgeon.

538
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:06,491
She wants to take her home.

539
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:07,993
Where's the social worker?

540
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:09,362
I paged her three times.

541
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,642
What about the police?

542
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,702
They're supposed
to be on their way.

543
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,204
Okay, you follow my lead.

544
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:18,847
Mrs. Howe, we
apologize for the delay.

545
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:20,595
The plastic surgeon wants to do

546
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:22,499
some more tests
on Bonnie's hand.

547
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:25,592
Nurse Hathaway is going
to take her up to radiology.

548
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:26,727
Can I go with her?

549
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:29,082
I'm sorry, hospital policy.

550
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:30,864
I want to stay with my mommy.

551
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,266
It's okay, honey.
It's okay, sweetheart.

552
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,592
Come on.

553
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:34,894
I want my mommy!

554
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,563
Wait, I don't want her to go.

555
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:37,264
This is her.

556
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,368
No! No! You liar!

557
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:40,905
Give me back my baby!

558
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,552
Give me back my baby!

559
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:43,509
Mommy! Mommy!

560
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:45,563
You lying bitch!

561
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:46,643
You lying bitch!

562
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:47,734
Mommy! Mommy!

563
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,241
All right, people, let's move.

564
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,509
Let's get him prepped.

565
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,081
Oh, God, please, Doc,
knock me out, will you?

566
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:56,762
Okay, Mr. Furst,
Mr. Furst, just take it easy.

567
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:58,098
Help is on the way, okay?

568
00:21:58,122 --> 00:21:59,401
Yeah. All right, here we go.

569
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:01,877
Oh!

570
00:22:01,913 --> 00:22:04,315
Cripes, Peter, I
haven't put him out yet.

571
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:05,485
I didn't cut him.

572
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,381
What's going on?

573
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,735
Well, folks, we
can all scrub out.

574
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,873
The stone hath passed.

575
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:19,928
Oh, thank God!

576
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,322
How are you feeling?

577
00:22:38,097 --> 00:22:39,231
You know, I saw

578
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:41,335
in the social
history in your chart

579
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,940
that you used to teach
high school English.

580
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:45,443
Was that here in Chicago?

581
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:47,358
You know, the hospital
has a pretty good library.

582
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:50,535
I could bring you
some books if you'd like.

583
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,940
Maybe some Conrad.

584
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:56,431
I, uh, I spoke to three

585
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:58,935
Roger Kleins in the
Bloomington area.

586
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,838
None of them...

587
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:03,143
were your son.

588
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:04,946
And I, I had the phone company

589
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:06,917
check all the unlisted numbers.

590
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,185
I couldn't find him.

591
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,323
Is there anyone
else I could call?

592
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:16,167
How long has it been
since you spoke to your son?

593
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:20,693
Ten years.

594
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:25,735
O-oh, 20, 20, 20 years.

595
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,706
I'm sorry.

596
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:41,258
Oh! Sorry.

597
00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:42,382
Excuse me.

598
00:23:42,418 --> 00:23:43,919
My fault. You're okay?

599
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,255
Yeah, fine.

600
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:49,496
Six lousy bucks.

601
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,137
I've got it.

602
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:54,405
Where's the vial?

603
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:55,775
Here.

604
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:00,150
Quick, he's coming.

605
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:11,321
What?

606
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:20,855
You people have too
much time on your hands.

607
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:26,332
You should have
heard that little girl.

608
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,371
She cried for her
mother for 45 minutes.

609
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:32,510
When the social worker
took her, she was still crying.

610
00:24:32,545 --> 00:24:33,947
She's better off.

611
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:36,085
What? Growing up
without a mother?

612
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,721
Her mother's a monster.

613
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,657
I don't believe that.

614
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:42,362
I think she was
damaged a long time ago.

615
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,867
I hope, with some therapy,
she can straighten out

616
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,437
and get her kid back.

617
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:49,408
Well, you're more hopeful
than I am, thank God.

618
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:54,418
So I hear you're
fostering Tatiana.

619
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:57,157
You going to try
and talk me out of it

620
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:58,559
like everybody else?

621
00:24:58,594 --> 00:25:00,975
No, I think it's a wonderful
thing, what you're doing.

622
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,200
Really?

623
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:03,669
Absolutely.

624
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,018
I always said you'd
make a great mother.

625
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,076
Doug?

626
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:08,678
Yeah?

627
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:10,849
A 16-year-old
G.S.W. to the neck.

628
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,218
E.T.A. seven minutes.

629
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:13,532
Okay.

630
00:25:13,556 --> 00:25:15,057
Thanks.

631
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,262
Please, no dead kids today.

632
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:27,698
How is he?

633
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:30,737
B.P.'S falling,
respiration's down.

634
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:33,709
I don't think he'll
make it till morning.

635
00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:35,479
Thanks.

636
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:39,486
Hi.

637
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:43,194
I didn't know what you'd
like, so I brought a few.

638
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:48,536
Not a fan of Melville, I see.

639
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:58,823
Mm-hmm.

640
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,185
Oh, God.

641
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,489
Excuse me for a second.

642
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:24,337
Did you do the
history and physical

643
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,108
on the leg pain in two?

644
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:28,813
Not yet. I was about to,
but I thought I'd spend

645
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,460
a little bit more
time with Mr. Klein.

646
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:33,055
Well, that woman's
been waiting half an hour.

647
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,869
Why are you wasting
time on a D.N.R.?

648
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,295
Because he's dying
and he has no family.

649
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,508
Mm-hmm. Carter, this

650
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,112
is your surgical rotation,
not pastoral care.

651
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:42,772
It's not your job to
become this man's family.

652
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:45,076
Dr. Benton, I think
there's more to patient care

653
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:46,379
than just cutting them open.

654
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:49,001
Mm-hmm, and that's
what nurses are for, so...

655
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:52,140
do the H & P on the leg pain
and renew everyone's meds.

656
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:56,080
I've got a drunk to stitch up.

657
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,402
Better go stitch him up.

658
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:03,389
It's interesting how
modern medicine

659
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,317
systematically dismantles
the rituals of death.

660
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:10,006
We do everything we can to
make it routine, a non-event.

661
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:12,378
People don't die
here, they code.

662
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:14,448
We can do better.

663
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,039
I can't believe I
didn't think of it before.

664
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:28,409
Kenosha!

665
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:29,744
Kenosha?

666
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:32,715
Kenosha. We can live there,
be a family and commute.

667
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,297
Never actually been to Kenosha.

668
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,688
Oh, it's great.

669
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:37,537
It's right on the lake,
they've got great schools,

670
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:39,195
the birthplace of Don Ameche.

671
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,375
Well, there it is.

672
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,901
Looks like our next
lucky contestant.

673
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:45,840
Who is this Diane
Leeds who keeps calling?

674
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:49,314
A very desirable woman
who will never go out with me.

675
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:50,916
Why not?

676
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:54,290
One of her friends
is one of my exes.

677
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:55,726
Oh, turned you down?

678
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,640
No, I never bothered
asking her out.

679
00:27:57,664 --> 00:27:59,378
You telling me you're
afraid to ask her out?

680
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:00,802
Nobody likes rejection.

681
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:02,238
What've you got?

682
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:04,943
A .38 Caliber clipped
him in the neck.

683
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:07,081
He's bleeding profusely,
the B.P.'s 60/40.

684
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:08,750
How'd it happen?

685
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:10,286
He was robbing a store.

686
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,823
A cop shot him.

687
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,092
Turn him over to me.

688
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:15,029
I got it. Here we go. Let's go!

689
00:28:15,064 --> 00:28:16,031
What's his story?

690
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:17,434
He's the cop.

691
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:19,231
We need to intubate him now.
Get me a blood on pressure bag.

692
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:20,456
Cross and type for six

693
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,727
and get me an intubation tray.

694
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:24,096
The bag's dry.

695
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:25,699
Hang another liter of saline.

696
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:27,781
Squeeze it fast,
he's bleeding out.

697
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:29,105
He's bleeding like crazy.

698
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,992
Load up on the O-negative.

699
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,162
No breath sounds.

700
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:34,344
I have to clamp this bleeder.

701
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:36,001
Where's Benton?

702
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:37,204
Anybody seen Benton?

703
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,571
Hey.

704
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,319
Hey, hey.

705
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,070
Hey!

706
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:13,772
I'll be back.

707
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:14,774
I'm not getting a pulse.

708
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,561
Blood-Y tubing.

709
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:19,344
Oh, God. He took it straight
to the heart... thoracotomy tray.

710
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:20,914
I thought they were
supposed to wear vests.

711
00:29:20,938 --> 00:29:22,172
Yep, they're supposed to.

712
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,719
I need some help in here.

713
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:24,976
Coming. Susan, you got this?

714
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:25,978
Yeah, I got it. Where's Benton?

715
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,225
Go get the one in
there with towels.

716
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:29,363
Got a lot of blood
coming out of his mouth.

717
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:30,988
Bullet holes in his chest?

718
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:32,090
Tube's in.

719
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:34,144
No, just the neck.

720
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:35,898
He's bleeding in his lungs.

721
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:37,000
How you doing, Carol?

722
00:29:37,035 --> 00:29:38,563
If I press any harder,
he's going to stroke out.

723
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:39,649
All right, what have we got?

724
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:42,043
16-year-old, bullet
to the carotid artery

725
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:44,080
thready pulse,
blood in his lungs.

726
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,426
We're going to
need to clamp him.

727
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,629
All right, and what's
going on over there?

728
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:47,932
Cop took a bullet
into his heart.

729
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:49,791
Susan's cracking his chest.

730
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,260
Dr. Benton?

731
00:29:51,296 --> 00:29:52,841
Wait a second. Get
somebody else down.

732
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:54,616
I'm going to go help Susan.

733
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:55,746
Okay. Suction.

734
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,249
I need some elbow
room. Scalpel. Thank you.

735
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:59,710
His lungs are full of blood.

736
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:01,179
Suction, right now. Here we go.

737
00:30:01,214 --> 00:30:02,292
All right, retractor here.

738
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:03,951
This kid's not getting

739
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:05,620
any blood to the brain.

740
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:07,006
Yeah, well, he's young.

741
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,912
He's got enough collaterals
to keep him perfused.

742
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:11,081
Okay, vascular clamp.

743
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:13,335
Right now. Come
on, Carol, right now.

744
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,604
Thank you.

745
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:15,839
Okay, lungs are clear.

746
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:17,860
Okay. And he is clamped.

747
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:19,262
Move him right now.

748
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:20,932
Get him out.

749
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:23,738
Rib spreader.

750
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:25,274
Hanging more O-neg.

751
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:26,943
Okay, now let's see.

752
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:28,992
What do we have in here?

753
00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:30,985
A hole in the ventricle.

754
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,421
Give me suction,

755
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,125
three-o proline on
an atraumatic needle.

756
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,929
Now.

757
00:30:36,964 --> 00:30:38,605
Call the O.R.

758
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:40,086
We might have a save here.

759
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,921
Where the hell is Carter?

760
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:44,037
He's missing out on a
valuable education here.

761
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:45,239
Okay, I'm going to do

762
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:48,101
a horizontal mattress,
take two bites, twice

763
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:49,937
go into the coronary artery

764
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:51,735
both times so I
don't obstruct it.

765
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,045
You want to do it quick,
Peter. His pressure's dropping.

766
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,092
I hear that.

767
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:57,251
Okay, now listen
up, boys and girls.

768
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:59,421
The trick here is

769
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,593
to plug up the hole

770
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:04,932
without closing
off the artery...

771
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:07,804
which...

772
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,741
is what I've just done.

773
00:31:09,777 --> 00:31:10,988
Peter?

774
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:13,515
A bullet through the
ventricle, I stitched it.

775
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,129
Who clamped the kid who went up?

776
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:16,421
I did.

777
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:18,001
I'm getting a pulse.

778
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:19,026
Nice job, Peter.

779
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:22,031
Looks like that rest
did you some good.

780
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,767
Take him up.

781
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,167
Well, what a way
to end the day, huh?

782
00:31:32,202 --> 00:31:33,202
You taking off?

783
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:34,270
Yeah.

784
00:31:34,305 --> 00:31:35,640
See you tomorrow.

785
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,409
All right, I'll see you.

786
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:41,795
I don't believe you.

787
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:43,220
Me?

788
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:45,269
I just finished
the file on the guy

789
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:47,039
you attacked last week
and then I get a call

790
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:48,509
that you've had
another altercation,

791
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,644
this time with a woman.

792
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:51,202
This time, I was the attackee.

793
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:52,415
Are you all right?

794
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,540
It's not the first time

795
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:54,920
I've been clawed
by a hostile female.

796
00:31:54,944 --> 00:31:56,990
You're finally
paying for bad karma.

797
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,114
You have no idea.

798
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,164
I don't know what
legal's going to say

799
00:32:00,188 --> 00:32:02,268
about the fact that I have
to defend you a second time.

800
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:03,503
You defended me the first time?

801
00:32:03,527 --> 00:32:04,672
That's my job.

802
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:07,833
I need you to write
out a statement<i> again.</i>

803
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:09,704
Huh. Don't take so long getting

804
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:11,807
it back to me
this time, all right?

805
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:13,244
Listen, Diane?

806
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,417
Can we get some dinner sometime?

807
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:19,055
I don't think
that's a good idea.

808
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:27,904
I guess you were right.

809
00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:31,111
I'm...

810
00:32:31,146 --> 00:32:32,291
I'm right.

811
00:32:32,315 --> 00:32:33,960
You got a minute?

812
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:36,003
Dr. Greene,
endocrinology on six.

813
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,040
I'll take it at the
nurses station.

814
00:32:38,076 --> 00:32:39,221
I won't keep you.

815
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:40,423
I just want to make
sure that bleeding varices

816
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:41,826
gets presented next week.

817
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,049
You won't be there?

818
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,330
Nope. I'll be in
Boston. Oh, yeah?

819
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:47,825
I'm taking over the residency
program at the Brigham.

820
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:49,974
It's Greene here.
Can you hold on?

821
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:50,964
Harvard?

822
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,968
Always an ambition of mine.

823
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,015
Well, congratulations.

824
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,050
Thanks. I couldn't be happier.

825
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,927
As far as your becoming
an attending next year

826
00:32:57,962 --> 00:32:59,263
I took care of it.

827
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:00,928
I gave my recommendation
to the chief of staff.

828
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:03,372
You're the guy... no
need to look any further.

829
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:04,585
Thank you. Appreciate it.

830
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:05,876
It's almost a lock.

831
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:07,111
Oh.

832
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:08,358
Of course, you know,
the new guy is going

833
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:09,762
to have approve it,
but don't worry about it.

834
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:11,898
Listen, I'm in my office
another two weeks.

835
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,044
Come by. We'll have a drink.

836
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:21,205
"Sailing these
seas or on the hills,

837
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,411
"or waking in the night,

838
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:28,953
"thoughts, silent
thoughts of time and space

839
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:31,691
"and death, like waters flowing,

840
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:34,930
"bear me indeed as
through the regions infinite

841
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:36,567
"whose air I breathe,

842
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:39,172
"whose ripples hear,

843
00:33:39,207 --> 00:33:41,108
"lave me all over.

844
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:43,513
"Bathe me, o God, in thee,

845
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:48,121
"mounting to thee, I and my
soul to range in range of thee.

846
00:33:55,104 --> 00:33:57,807
Oh, thou transcendent,
nameless..."

847
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:08,443
Carter, did you do notes
on all your patients?

848
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:09,780
I'm doing them now.

849
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,618
They're supposed to
be in by end of shift.

850
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:14,567
Looks like you've just begun.

851
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:18,462
I'll have them first
thing in the morning.

852
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:20,666
You'll be up all night.

853
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:23,472
That's what happens
when you spend

854
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:26,343
too much time with one patient.

855
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:28,982
I consider it time well-spent.

856
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:30,585
He, um...

857
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:32,623
he died ten minutes ago.

858
00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:42,073
Carter, why did you put in
for a surgical sub-internship?

859
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:44,061
Because I want to be a surgeon.

860
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,691
You're wasting your time.

861
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:48,736
You don't think like a surgeon.

862
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:51,290
Why? Because I
don't think like you?

863
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,434
I'd like those notes
first thing in the morning.

864
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:05,885
Cat. "C."

865
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,856
<i>Da.</i> "C" is for "cat"

866
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:09,191
and "Carol."

867
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:12,531
Carol, Ms. Brown from
family development

868
00:35:12,566 --> 00:35:13,933
is here for you.

869
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:15,202
Oh, okay.

870
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:16,773
<i>Ya viernoose.</i>

871
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:18,375
Okay.

872
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:22,984
Hi.

873
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:24,419
Hi.

874
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:28,227
Carol, something came up
in your background check.

875
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:30,699
You attempted suicide last year.

876
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:33,971
Uh-huh.

877
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,309
I wish you had told us sooner.

878
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:39,716
I'm afraid we can't
place Tatiana with you.

879
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:42,587
There's no way the
state would approve it.

880
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:44,102
But I'm fully recovered.

881
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:46,628
If it had happened
three years ago, maybe.

882
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:48,599
But one year... we just can't.

883
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:51,003
I'm sorry.

884
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:29,992
Hi.

885
00:36:30,028 --> 00:36:31,306
Hi.

886
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,601
I'm working on
it, uh, right now.

887
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:38,576
How about next Friday?

888
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:42,049
You're asking me out?

889
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:45,289
No, I'm responding
to you asking me out.

890
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:47,793
That was three hours ago.

891
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:49,897
You change your mind?

892
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:52,002
No, I don't think so.

893
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:55,892
So, we're on?

894
00:36:57,898 --> 00:37:00,868
If it means that
much to you, okay.

895
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:02,338
I don't think

896
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:05,276
I like the way this
date is starting out.

897
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:07,113
It'll get better.

898
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:08,448
We'll see.

899
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:16,180
Hey, my man's on time.

900
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:17,415
Hey.

901
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:21,368
Where's everybody at, Walt?

902
00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:24,695
Jackie and the kids
went up to the lake early

903
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:26,233
and mom went to bed.

904
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:28,102
Oh, Jackie said to remind you

905
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:31,743
that your mother wakes up
bright and early, 6:00 a.m.,

906
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:34,020
and she'll be
wanting her medicine.

907
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:36,285
All right, I'll set the alarm.

908
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,056
So, uh, you really
going down on the ice?

909
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:42,429
Well, it's that or spend the
day in a three-room cabin

910
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:45,067
with your sister,
the kids and no TV?

911
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:47,706
Hell, yeah, I'm
going out on the ice.

912
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:51,724
What time y'all coming back?

913
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:53,683
About 8:00 tomorrow night.

914
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,220
Look, man, thanks a lot.

915
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:56,990
I really appreciate this.

916
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:58,304
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.

917
00:37:58,328 --> 00:38:01,365
There's some leftover
meat loaf in the fridge.

918
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:02,478
Mm-hmm.

919
00:38:02,502 --> 00:38:03,680
Hey, Walt.

920
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:05,606
Catch me a walleye, huh?

921
00:38:05,642 --> 00:38:06,943
Yeah, right.

922
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:08,278
Later, man.

923
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:09,314
Yeah.

924
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:43,928
All right.

925
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:51,826
Hi.

926
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,162
Carol.

927
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,365
Can I?

928
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,601
Yeah.

929
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:57,136
Yeah, come on in.

930
00:38:59,142 --> 00:39:00,442
What is it?

931
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:01,778
I lost her.

932
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,280
I've been in therapy.

933
00:39:03,316 --> 00:39:05,552
I've worked hard for nine months

934
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:07,055
and it doesn't matter.

935
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,060
All they care about is
that I took some pills.

936
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:11,229
Who?

937
00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:13,099
Ms. Brown...

938
00:39:13,135 --> 00:39:15,103
foster care.

939
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:16,606
Tatiana?

940
00:39:16,642 --> 00:39:19,110
They won't let me have her.

941
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:20,447
Oh, Carol.

942
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:22,985
It's like I'm defective
or something.

943
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,621
No, no, no.

944
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:29,464
I'm so...

945
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:30,934
I mean, God...

946
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,939
I'm kidding myself, you
know, that I could do this.

947
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:35,576
It's so stupid.

948
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:37,078
You're ice cold.

949
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,082
You should have seen her, Doug.

950
00:39:39,117 --> 00:39:41,219
I mean, she's seven years old.

951
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,356
I tried to explain it to her...

952
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:44,826
Carol, listen to me.

953
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:46,328
It's not your fault.

954
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:47,810
You hear me?
It's not your fault.

955
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:49,702
But I promised her I'd be there

956
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:51,806
and now I'm not
going to be there.

957
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:53,688
How could you have known?

958
00:39:53,712 --> 00:39:55,513
God...

959
00:39:57,652 --> 00:39:59,120
Maybe...

960
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:00,589
Maybe I...

961
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,811
I shouldn't have
thought about doing this.

962
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:06,851
No. You were exactly
what she needed.

963
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:13,329
You're the only
person who thinks that.

964
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:16,552
Well, I know you.

965
00:40:18,574 --> 00:40:20,226
Can I stay here?

966
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:26,254
Has Tag heard yet?

967
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,059
He never wanted her.

968
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:32,632
Carol, no.

969
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:33,834
Please.

970
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,081
Why don't I drive you home?

971
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:50,282
I know.

972
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:53,154
Oh... oh, God.

973
00:40:55,226 --> 00:40:56,995
The design's been approved.

974
00:40:57,031 --> 00:40:59,867
We've set a construction
start date for June

975
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:02,639
and we've recruited
world-class physicians

976
00:41:02,674 --> 00:41:04,175
like Borges and Folkman

977
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,611
to our advisory board.

978
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:07,014
That's impressive.

979
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,951
Well, they know
we're onto something.

980
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:11,421
The high profile's
attracting resources

981
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,527
and I'm approached daily
by exceptional doctors

982
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:16,132
about joining the staff.

983
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,500
Are you interested?

984
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:18,536
Me?

985
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:20,139
From what I've observed

986
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:22,209
your expertise, your temperament

987
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:24,814
auger a very promising
medical career.

988
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,217
Well, I'm flattered.

989
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:28,154
And, yes, I am interested.

990
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:29,156
Excellent.

991
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:30,591
There he is.

992
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:32,595
Marty, we were
worried about you.

993
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,699
Why do you got to do this?

994
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:36,135
Do I know you people?

995
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:37,137
Marty, please, be good.

996
00:41:37,173 --> 00:41:38,139
I brought the restraints.

997
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:39,141
Don't make me use them.

998
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,143
This is almost amusing.

999
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:41,712
This is a mistake.

1000
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:43,177
This is Dr. Koch
from M.I.T., Sloan...

1001
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,228
Sloan School of Management.

1002
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,121
Yeah, I know.
It's his latest thing.

1003
00:41:46,156 --> 00:41:48,292
Mm-hmm. A few months
ago, he passed as an O.B.

1004
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:50,724
and delivered two babies
before we caught him.

1005
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:52,248
He's real smart. Reads a lot.

1006
00:41:52,285 --> 00:41:54,163
Wait a minute. You're
telling me you're not...?

1007
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:55,650
Susan, it'll get sorted
out, it'll get sorted out.

1008
00:41:55,674 --> 00:41:56,936
I just...

1009
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,796
was planning to observe
the psych ward anyway.

1010
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:01,112
Come on.

1011
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:04,237
Come on, Marty.

1012
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,478
Ho!

1013
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:11,852
Hey.

1014
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:14,424
I didn't expect you.

1015
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,730
Where's Rach?

1016
00:42:17,765 --> 00:42:19,734
I didn't bring her.

1017
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:21,504
We need to talk.

1018
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,543
Yeah.

1019
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:26,078
Yeah, we do.

1020
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,066
I can't do this anymore, Mark...

1021
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,862
Not living together and
never seeing each other.

1022
00:42:34,897 --> 00:42:37,167
I know, so let's stop it.

1023
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:40,105
You're willing to
leave the hospital?

1024
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,441
A compromise.

1025
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:42,710
We can live

1026
00:42:42,745 --> 00:42:44,781
between Chicago and
Milwaukee... Kenosha.

1027
00:42:44,816 --> 00:42:47,286
It's just an hour
in each direction.

1028
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:48,967
We can be a
family again. Mark...

1029
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:50,124
What? It can work.

1030
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,672
You want me to commute

1031
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,031
two hours a day so
you can take a job?

1032
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:56,603
So we can all be together again.

1033
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,889
That's two hours
less for Rachel.

1034
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:04,618
My God, it's bad enough she's
not growing up with her father.

1035
00:43:04,653 --> 00:43:06,589
Whose fault is that, huh?

1036
00:43:06,624 --> 00:43:09,361
It was your idea
to go to Milwaukee.

1037
00:43:09,396 --> 00:43:11,910
Would you rather
I leave her here

1038
00:43:11,934 --> 00:43:13,401
with you?

1039
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:20,525
Do you know that, in seven years

1040
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:23,220
you've never given
anything up for me?

1041
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:25,224
Why are you so intent

1042
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:30,000
on making me give up a job
I've spent years trying to get?

1043
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:32,277
You do what you
want, when you want

1044
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:33,801
and you just expect
me and Rachel

1045
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:35,727
to be there for you

1046
00:43:35,762 --> 00:43:38,284
when you have time for us.

1047
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:50,755
Jen, come on.

1048
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,090
I don't think

1049
00:43:52,126 --> 00:43:54,328
we're going to make it, Mark.

1050
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,098
We're going to make it.

1051
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,701
No, this isn't working.

1052
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,104
So, we'll make it work.

1053
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,475
We went a year.

1054
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:02,994
We can go another year.

1055
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,996
Mark...

1056
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:05,132
I'll do better, okay?

1057
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:06,301
I'll come up more often.

1058
00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:07,448
Rachel, she can come down here.

1059
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:09,441
You're not listening.

1060
00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:10,943
I am. I'm listening.

1061
00:44:10,978 --> 00:44:13,080
I'm leaving you.

1062
00:44:19,577 --> 00:44:22,648
I'm sorry.

1063
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:34,971
Freezing rain West of us at
this hour yesterday morning

1064
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,277
but that really didn't
amount to much of a problem.

1065
00:44:38,313 --> 00:44:41,884
Skywatch 5, our live camera,
we'll take a look outdoors...

1066
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:44,890
Jackie? I need my medicine.

1067
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:47,528
Peter?!

1068
00:44:49,032 --> 00:44:50,534
Peter!

1069
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,473
Petey...

1070
00:45:01,924 --> 00:45:03,692
Oh...

1071
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:08,100
Mom?!

1072
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:13,744
Okay.

1073
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,192
Dr. Benton.

1074
00:45:15,216 --> 00:45:16,517
Dr. Benton's mother.

1075
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:18,352
75 years old, history of CVA.

1076
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:20,256
She fell down the stairs.

1077
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:21,692
Possible hip fracture.

1078
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:23,028
B.P.'S 90/60.

1079
00:45:23,063 --> 00:45:24,364
Heart rate 110.

1080
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,836
Legs shortened and
externally rotated.

1081
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:29,874
I got an I.V. of
normal saline going.

1082
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,246
O-2 by nasal cannula,
ten liters, C.C.S. 354.

1083
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:33,247
L.O.C. at the scene.

1084
00:45:33,282 --> 00:45:35,117
Got her I.V. Okay.

1085
00:45:35,153 --> 00:45:36,119
She's waking up now.

1086
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:37,856
All right...

1087
00:45:37,892 --> 00:45:39,359
let's move her.

1088
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:40,862
Careful of her hip.

1089
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:42,877
On three. One, two, three.

1090
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:45,839
Call radiology and
get neuro down here.

1091
00:45:45,874 --> 00:45:49,043
Carter, check her pupils
and response to pain.

1092
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,547
Dr. Benton, what happened?

1093
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,049
What happened?

1094
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:53,385
Mrs. Benton?

1095
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,855
Can you hear me?

1096
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:59,029
If you can hear me,
squeeze my hand.

1097
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:01,200
Carter, you try.

1098
00:46:01,235 --> 00:46:03,538
Mrs. Benton?

1099
00:46:03,573 --> 00:46:04,874
I'm John Carter.

1100
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:06,087
We're going to take care of you.

1101
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:07,244
Can you understand me?

1102
00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:08,493
Peter, what happened?

1103
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:09,617
Mrs. Benton?

1104
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,319
Can you understand
me? Talk to me?

1105
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:12,989
Peter?
