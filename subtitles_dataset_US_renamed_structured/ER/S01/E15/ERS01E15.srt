1
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:14,040
What do they need us for?

2
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:17,265
A lady's been trapped
in a car for over an hour.

3
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,968
We can't move her
until we intubate her.

4
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:21,915
They always drive this fast?

5
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:22,871
Yep.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,350
They ever hit anybody?

7
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:25,607
All the time.

8
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:27,654
How can you eat through this?

9
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:28,944
I'm hungry.

10
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:30,579
All right, we're here.

11
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:32,948
Grab the O-neg, stay close.

12
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:37,719
Cherokee missed the runway,

13
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,454
slammed into a car
on the access road.

14
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:40,655
Guy in the plane is toast.

15
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:42,223
The other victim's already out.

16
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,009
There's a lady
pinned in the backseat.

17
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:46,122
Fire's been trying to
get to her for 50 minutes.

18
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,423
The plane's been leaking fuel,

19
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,225
so they haven't been
able to use the jaws.

20
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,582
I'm freezing.
Anybody got a coat?

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,894
Get the doc a coat, will you?

22
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,519
I.V.s. B.P.'s 70/30.

23
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,454
Golden Hour's almost over.

24
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,022
Head trauma, A.L.O.C.

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,556
We've been bagging her,

26
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,126
but she's been biting
down and gagging.

27
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,694
Husband and two kids

28
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,607
already at the hospital.

29
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,243
Carter, follow me in.

30
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,111
Get that O-neg going, all right?

31
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,946
If we don't get her out of here

32
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,514
in the next couple of minutes,

33
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,915
she's not going to make it.

34
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,219
Start with Pavulon.

35
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:18,560
Next, Versed

36
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:21,329
to sedate.

37
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:24,416
Cricoid pressure.

38
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,886
I got it.

39
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,504
Finally...

40
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:30,455
succinylcholine.

41
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,090
What the hell is that?

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,458
It's aviation fuel.

43
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,693
I wouldn't smoke if I were you.

44
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,796
You think gasoline
comes out of camel hair?

45
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,716
Can we get in here?

46
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:41,984
Two seconds.

47
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:42,984
Tube's in.

48
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:44,263
New coat?

49
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,386
Christmas.

50
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:46,532
Nice.

51
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,024
It was.

52
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,329
Release pressure.

53
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:57,032
All right, clear out.

54
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,034
Slide out, Carter. Come on.

55
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,385
Keep bagging.

56
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,432
Start the chopper.

57
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,484
Let's move! Let's move!
They're coming out.

58
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:06,358
Move it! Move it fast!

59
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,261
Thank you.

60
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,595
May I?

61
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,796
Yeah.

62
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,131
Thanks.

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,332
Watch out.

64
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,302
So, you decided
on a specialty yet?

65
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,704
My folks are set on cardiology.

66
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,751
Yeah? Well, hat
are you thinking?

67
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,609
I'm thinking this
is pretty exciting.

68
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,077
Yeah, it's not bad.

69
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,780
Stress, late nights,
hard work, low play.

70
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,282
It's hard to beat.

71
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,783
Watch her head.

72
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,663
Let's go, guys.
Move her. Move her.

73
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:37,355
Both femurs broken,
possible spinal cord injury.

74
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,690
Pressure's 80.

75
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,091
We'll notify the O.R.

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,793
before we get there.

77
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,295
You fly before?

78
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,723
Oh, yeah. Lots of times.

79
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,466
What's the M.A.R.?

80
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,034
County General.

81
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,537
Faster!

82
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,187
She going to make it?

83
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,976
She is now.

84
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,446
All right, guys, we're
going to mover her on three.

85
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,816
Ready? One, two, three.

86
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,851
No room.

87
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,454
Can't go. Stay
here, grab our stuff,

88
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,023
then ride back with
the paramedics.

89
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:45,373
It's a hell of a life, isn't it?

90
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:46,608
What?!

91
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,327
It's a hell of a life.

92
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:52,880
I said I want to have
sex with your wife.

93
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:56,622
God, he's in a foul mood.

94
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:57,912
Today is a good day.

95
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,658
You finish your
trauma presentation?

96
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,315
Not yet. I was
going to try and grab

97
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,951
a couple of minutes
this morning.

98
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,285
What about you? You do much?

99
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,598
Really, I am so far behind,

100
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:06,665
I may not even finish.

101
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:07,900
Benton's going to kill me.

102
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:09,724
Don't worry about
it Just do your best.

103
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,303
How does he expect us to prepare

104
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,995
when we're following him
around on 36-hour shifts?

105
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,831
Ms. Chen, if this surgical
rotation is too much for you,

106
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,532
there's always dermatology.

107
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,903
48-Year-old MBA,
fractured right femur,

108
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:23,404
pressure 60/40,

109
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:24,753
abdomen's rigid.

110
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,452
All right. Let's get
some O-neg going...

111
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:28,187
Wide open. Already did it.

112
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,706
What's your name, sir?

113
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,229
Bill McClintock.

114
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,564
Mm-hmm.

115
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,966
Mr. McClintock,
is it tender here?

116
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,253
Were you wearing a seat belt?

117
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:39,354
No.

118
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,733
You will the next time, I bet.

119
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,123
Peritoneal lavage.

120
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,536
Carter, look at his abdomen.

121
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,004
Either he's bleeding out

122
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,395
and he needs to go
to the O.R. immediately

123
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,675
or he's giving birth
to a basketball.

124
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,210
Haleh, call up to O.R.

125
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,250
I already called.

126
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,485
Dr. Benton, head trauma in one.

127
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,022
All right, I'll be right there.

128
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,591
Ms. Chen, get a
Foley catheter started.

129
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,777
Ever do one before?

130
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,596
You're in for a treat.

131
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:10,102
Carter, since when does it take
two students to start a Foley?

132
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,769
Let's move.

133
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,338
Clean it with Betadine,

134
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:19,143
put KY on the
catheter, and thread it in.

135
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,962
Give it to me.

136
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,499
42 years old, collapsed
playing handball

137
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,045
pressure crashing, 40 palp,

138
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,547
tachycardic 110, resps 30.

139
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:29,549
Two liters NS in, 15 liters 0-2.

140
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:30,983
Name's Jonathan Weiss.

141
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,240
Man, it hurts.

142
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,175
Am I having a heart attack?

143
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:37,011
Do you have a history
of cardiac trouble?

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,213
No.

145
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:40,092
I'll get a CBC, Chem
seven, enzymes

146
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,960
coag panel and chest film.

147
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,318
He's very pale.

148
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:44,836
He's not oxygenating.

149
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,487
Pressure's still 40 palp.

150
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:48,005
What do we got, Susan?

151
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,190
Possible M.I.

152
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,858
I don't want to die.

153
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,621
We don't want you to die,

154
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,724
so you do your part,
and we'll do ours.

155
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,093
His breathing's not
improving with oxygen.

156
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,944
Could be a pulmonary embolism.

157
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,235
What?

158
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:01,798
A blood clot in your
lungs, Mr. Weiss.

159
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,454
Have you had surgery

160
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,472
recently?

161
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,335
Car accident? Any trauma?

162
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,644
Spend a lot of time
traveling? Sitting?

163
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:11,246
EKG?

164
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,580
T-wave inversions.

165
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:13,915
I'm thinking heart.

166
00:07:13,984 --> 00:07:15,264
I'm not. V-Q scan.

167
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:16,801
He has no risk factors,

168
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,937
and mid-sternal chest pain.

169
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,321
I need that chest film.

170
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,157
And I need an echo.

171
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:25,260
All right, well,
that can't hurt.

172
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,608
Let's do it.

173
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:30,131
Mr. Conally?

174
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,832
Yes?

175
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:33,201
Where are you?

176
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,314
Right here, under the sheet.

177
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,605
Why are you under the sheet?

178
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,652
I've been dead for two days.

179
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:44,179
Okay, but you are still
suffering from headaches.

180
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,980
Oh, boy, am I ever.

181
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,551
And what precipitates
these headaches?

182
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:50,659
Death.

183
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,223
What was that?

184
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,852
Nervous tic. I've
had it for years.

185
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,827
Ow! Ooh!

186
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:03,281
Blood gases are back.

187
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,616
P-O2's low; 50.

188
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,962
Where the hell
is the chest film?

189
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,536
Behind you, Dr. Greene.

190
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:10,805
Pulmonary artery's enlarged.

191
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:11,956
Perfusion scan?

192
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:12,924
V-Q mismatch.

193
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,253
You were right.

194
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:15,955
1.5 million units streptokinase.

195
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,613
Forget the streptokinase.
Let's get him to Trauma.

196
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:20,392
We need a fluoroscope down here.

197
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,461
Somebody get Morgenstern.
Get his pants off.

198
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,485
Rolando, we got a trauma room?

199
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:25,834
Yeah. Two's open.

200
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,167
You're going to do
an embolectomy?

201
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,125
Yeah. First time for everything.

202
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:31,459
What the hell's going on?

203
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,006
A saddle embolus.
Mark 's going in.

204
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,674
He's doing an
extraction in the E.R.?

205
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,131
Mr. Smitrovich is in four.

206
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,833
CBC, Chem seven,
blood gases, I.V. started.

207
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:42,336
Luchesse's in Six...
abdominal pain, vomiting blood,

208
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,238
N.P.O., a nasogastric tube...

209
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,590
Dr. Benton?

210
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,876
What is it, Carter?

211
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,656
We... I would like to observe
Dr. Greene's embolectomy.

212
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,764
All right. Well,
who's stopping you?

213
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,747
Go.

214
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:54,816
Thanks.

215
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,128
You want to go, too? Go. Go.

216
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,751
What's the matter with you?

217
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,897
Luchesse.

218
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:01,089
Vomiting blood,
NPO, nasogastric tube,

219
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:02,290
gastric lavage.

220
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,270
You ordered a gastric lavage?

221
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,593
No. I wrote it down.

222
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,228
You still have to sign it.

223
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,674
I write my own orders.

224
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:09,698
Nurse...

225
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:11,699
If you're having
a problem today,

226
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,567
don't take it out on me.

227
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,204
I write the orders,
you carry them out.

228
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,172
Understood?

229
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,273
Nurse...

230
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:20,675
What?

231
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,910
Isoproterenol's going.

232
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,247
Okay, ease the
catheter in slowly,

233
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,467
and thread it up to
the pulmonary artery,

234
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,654
being very careful not to
puncture the vena cava.

235
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:36,474
How's Mr. Weiss doing?

236
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,625
Resps are up

237
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:38,710
to 45.

238
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,512
Pulse ox down to 63.

239
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,241
Hang in there, Mr. Weiss.
You'll be feeling better

240
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:44,348
before you know it.

241
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,911
Carter, Chen, why don't you

242
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:48,415
get over here so you can see?

243
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,138
See that?

244
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:54,058
I'm in the right ventricle.

245
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,662
Is that cool or what?

246
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,942
Carter, you see the embolus?

247
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,215
Yeah. It's huge.

248
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,935
Position the cup
against the clot.

249
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,073
Good. Now, start
your syringe suction

250
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,993
and aspirate the embolus

251
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,744
into the cup.

252
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,567
Got it.

253
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,003
Now, work it back down.

254
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,242
Just like snaking a drain.

255
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,529
Well, folks, I got a date

256
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,863
with a bile duct.

257
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,864
Carry on, one and all.

258
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,394
Pulse ox up to 85.

259
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,019
Resps are coming down.

260
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,554
How you feeling

261
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,021
Mr. Weiss?

262
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,391
I can breathe.

263
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,827
I can breathe.

264
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,493
Okay, Harold, so,
something bit you, huh?

265
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,782
Pet snake.

266
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,796
Oh, yeah? I used to keep frogs.

267
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,186
Frogs are amphibians.

268
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,554
My snake eats frogs.

269
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,883
What kind of snake?

270
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,373
Yellow eyelash pit viper.

271
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,653
You have a pet pit viper?

272
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,177
Is it poisonous?

273
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,195
Very.

274
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,030
I'll call poison control.

275
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,144
Are you feeling weak, Harold?

276
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,633
Nauseous? Any chills?

277
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,035
No. Not that kind of stuff.

278
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,471
Can you tell if it's
poisonous just by looking?

279
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,819
I don't think so.

280
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,708
'Cause I got him
right here in the bag.

281
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,622
We're going to keep
him in the bag, Harold.

282
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,080
No. He's cold-blooded,

283
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,515
and I had him on the El all day.

284
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,020
He was here a minute ago.

285
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,286
<i>You shouldn't have
contradicted me</i>

286
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,844
in front of the nursing staff.

287
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,323
I wasn't contradicting you.

288
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:38,825
We disagreed on a diagnosis.

289
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:40,247
I'd appreciate your showing

290
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,316
a little more
restraint in the future.

291
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,818
The man was dying.

292
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,954
Are you going to
give me respect?

293
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,800
I wasn't being disrespectful.

294
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:49,056
Yes or no?

295
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,558
I respect you, Susan.

296
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,759
Thank you.

297
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,761
Try to show it once in a while.

298
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,307
I'll get Animal Control in here.

299
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,209
Doug, what is going on?

300
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,500
Dr. Ross in E.R.

301
00:11:58,568 --> 00:11:59,901
Pit viper got loose.

302
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,102
A snake?

303
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,604
A big snake.

304
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,906
36-Year-old woman
with breast cancer.

305
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,441
E.M.T.s brought her
in from Dignity House.

306
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,489
Two modified
radical mastectomies.

307
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,357
It's spread to her lymph nodes.

308
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,647
Who are you?

309
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,983
I'm Anita Risberg, a
nurse over at the hospice.

310
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,796
Mark Greene. Is she on chemo?

311
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,397
Tamoxifen, but
it's metastasized.

312
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,701
Pelvis, spine.

313
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:21,222
You got her on morphine?

314
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,035
120 milligrams, just to sleep.

315
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,972
But, the last couple of
days, it's just not enough.

316
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,007
I got worried, if I
upped the dose,

317
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,832
it would cause further
respiratory depression.

318
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,249
You're right. It would.

319
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,618
What's her name?

320
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,019
Grace. Grace Holsten.

321
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,437
Hi, Grace.

322
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,988
I'm Mark Greene.

323
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,002
We're going to try and make you

324
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,737
a little more comfortable.

325
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,794
Doctor, please let me die.

326
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,596
Please.

327
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,465
Let me die.

328
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,924
Animal Control guy

329
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,622
believes it's a tree snake.

330
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,958
He thinks it'll crawl up
someplace high where it's warm.

331
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,415
Sorry, Doc.

332
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,850
Terrific. I'll spend
the rest of my day

333
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,419
on my hands and knees...

334
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,188
Lydia, Doug, come over here.

335
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,457
Okay. Okay. It took
about six months

336
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,892
and a couple thousand
requisition forms,

337
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,260
but I finally did it.

338
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,195
Guess what's under the sheet.

339
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,533
Come on, guys. Guess.

340
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,679
We don't want to guess.

341
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,787
Oh, come on! Please!

342
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:27,922
New daybed for the lounge?

343
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:29,907
Nope.

344
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,509
New vending machines?

345
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,610
Nope.

346
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,479
Ta-dum! New crash carts!

347
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,283
How did you get those?

348
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,729
Well, Cardiology wanted
them, but I was relentless.

349
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,886
Dr. Benton, you got

350
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,165
an abdominal pain
in Curtain Three,

351
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,533
and you got a gunshot
victim coming in.

352
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,675
Now, no raiding off the
new crash carts, okay?

353
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,144
Everything on these
carts stays on the carts.

354
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:51,979
Thank you.

355
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:57,818
Dr. Benton...

356
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,721
about this afternoon's
trauma presentation...

357
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,357
uh... I'm not quite
fully prepared yet.

358
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,026
You've known about it for weeks.

359
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,639
Yes, sir. I know that,
but I was hoping...

360
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:07,929
Don't call me "sir," Ms. Chen.

361
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,263
Yes, sir.

362
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:10,665
I mean, Doctor.

363
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,933
I'm sorry.

364
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,101
I only need a half hour or so.

365
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,566
And what about you, Mr. Carter?

366
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,268
Do you also need more time?

367
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,075
No. I'm all set.

368
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:22,893
Well, Ms. Chen,

369
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,523
when you find you have the time

370
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,107
to rejoin us, please do so.

371
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,134
84-year-old man

372
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,003
complaining of abdominal pain.

373
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,282
Where's his chart?

374
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,438
In the rack...

375
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,858
at the desk.

376
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,330
Carter, go get his chart.

377
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,482
I'll need a CBC,

378
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,450
Chem seven, coag panel,

379
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,430
and drop a nasogastric tube.

380
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,748
You going to write this down?

381
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,706
I'm not comfortable
taking<i> verbal</i> orders.

382
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,675
I think you better
write everything

383
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:55,943
down for us.

384
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,496
<i>Us?</i>

385
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,081
The nurses.

386
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,849
Here's his chart.

387
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,938
Start writing.

388
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,248
Grace...

389
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,583
we've added Fentanyl
to the morphine.

390
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,785
See if that helps.

391
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,521
If it doesn't work, we
have three choices:

392
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,189
We can insert a catheter

393
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,108
into your spinal cord to
deliver the morphine...

394
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,627
No.

395
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,829
Or we can surgically
cut the spinal tracts

396
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:35,066
that carry the pain
from your legs and back,

397
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,284
or we can increase
your morphine.

398
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,022
But your dosage is already
so high, it might depress

399
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,223
your breathing.

400
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:44,075
Can you stop this pain?

401
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,576
I'm not sure.

402
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,128
We're trying.

403
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,713
Try harder.

404
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:57,923
Resps?

405
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,235
Fourteen.

406
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,126
Let me know if her
breathing gets any worse.

407
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,527
Okay.

408
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,767
Don't even ask.

409
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,202
Mark, keep me company.

410
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,604
Good call on that
pulmonary embolism.

411
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,106
Thanks.

412
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,652
Oncology saw him...
Found a small polyp.

413
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,176
Probably, if he
hadn't tossed a clot,

414
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,111
who knows how far that
thing would have gone

415
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,679
before baring its
ugly little head.

416
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,925
What's all this?

417
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,116
Some kind of tree
snake got loose.

418
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,196
Really? I was really
impressed this morning

419
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,300
about your concern for
the medical students...

420
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,600
Making sure that they
were involved and learning.

421
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,169
You're a fine teacher, Mark.

422
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,838
You given any thought as to
what you're going to do next year?

423
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,528
Start repaying med school loans.

424
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,063
I've sent out a few letters,

425
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,531
but haven't really started.

426
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,562
I'd like you to give thought
to joining the staff here.

427
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,453
As an attending?

428
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,449
Of course, you won't
make as much money

429
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,484
as the cowboys at
the private hospitals,

430
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,853
but there are other rewards,

431
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,197
ephemeral as they may be.

432
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,890
Well, think about it anyway.

433
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,298
No. No. I'd be honored. Really.

434
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,550
Ah. Here's my bus.

435
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,886
Thank you.

436
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,205
No. Thank<i> you.</i>

437
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,772
You earned it.

438
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,341
12-Year-old male.

439
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,526
Multiple gunshots

440
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,144
to the legs and abdomen.

441
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,445
We scooped and ran.

442
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:13,614
I.V.'S wide open...
Had two liters.

443
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:14,949
No palpable pressure.

444
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,895
All right, people,
let's look alive.

445
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,619
Let's go!

446
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,087
O-neg. Let's move!

447
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,521
Grab me that dynamap!

448
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,036
Is that I.V. infiltrated?

449
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,992
Ready? Lift.

450
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:26,088
Come on.

451
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,222
No pulse.

452
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,679
He's still breathing.

453
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,014
We tried to apply pressure.

454
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,348
He was a sieve.

455
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,817
His name is Yummy Jackson.

456
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,885
Drive-by?

457
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,031
Drug deal gone bad. Gang thing.

458
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,221
At 12 years old?

459
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,656
Kid had a Tech-9
and a Ruger on him

460
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,841
when we found him.

461
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,493
Get in here now!

462
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,178
Watch that line.

463
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,110
She's still in a lot of pain.

464
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,533
Okay.

465
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,236
Grace, I'm sorry the
Fentanyl isn't helping much.

466
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,637
It's helping a little.

467
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,707
Anything we can do to
make you more comfortable?

468
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,026
You can shoot me.

469
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:03,364
I'm sorry. I didn't bring
my gun to work today.

470
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,585
I don't think it's safe

471
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,782
to up the morphine any higher.

472
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:11,272
Afraid it'll kill me?

473
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,591
It might.

474
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,895
There's not a lot more

475
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,030
that the E.R. can
do to help you.

476
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,184
Uh... Do you want me to
admit you to the hospital?

477
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,788
Can I go back to the hospice?

478
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,290
Yes, you can, but they're
going to need to bring you

479
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,994
back here for a higher dosage.

480
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,830
Can I take a little
while to decide?

481
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,667
Sure.

482
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,238
Can I help you?

483
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,742
Excuse me. Can I help you?

484
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,345
You can't be back here.

485
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,414
You must go now.

486
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:39,971
Son of a bitch!

487
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,329
Get out the way!

488
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:47,735
You're too late.

489
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:52,923
He's already dead.

490
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,253
It's madness.

491
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,425
You can clearly see

492
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,793
the posterior
dislocation of the knee

493
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:49,129
consistent with
this sledding injury

494
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:53,234
which occurred when the impact
of the sled applied direct force

495
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:56,370
to the anterior tibia
while the knee was flexed.

496
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,719
I'm really nervous.

497
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:58,773
Don't worry about it.

498
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,151
I picked too easy a topic.

499
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,454
I should have worked up
something more difficult.

500
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:05,011
Relax. Dr. Benton doesn't
expect that much from you.

501
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,279
It's your first rotation.

502
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,232
Should be attempted
using analgesia

503
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:12,803
with horizontal traction
and realignment of the joint.

504
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,240
Angiography should be considered

505
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,542
with attention
paid to the five P's:

506
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,861
Pain, pallor,

507
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,063
paresthesias,

508
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:26,866
pulselessness and paralysis.

509
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:28,835
All right, who's next?

510
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,237
Carter.

511
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:45,019
While attempting a
rollerblading maneuver,

512
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,688
this 12-year-old male

513
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:50,691
fell on his
outstretched right hand,

514
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,693
resulting in a...

515
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,696
Salter-Harris Type
II epiphysial fracture

516
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:57,698
of the proximal humerus.

517
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:59,383
To avoid damage

518
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:00,717
to the growth plate,

519
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,787
the humeral head, which
is in varus angulation

520
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,755
and external rotation,

521
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,712
must be reduced by abducting,
and externally rotating, the arm

522
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:15,282
and then slowly
bringing the arm down.

523
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:19,252
If the reduction is
not accomplished,

524
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:22,255
then the arm must
be maintained in a cast

525
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:25,459
in the Statue of
Liberty position.

526
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,110
Is that it?

527
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,065
Any questions?

528
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,649
Ms. Chen.

529
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,223
You're going to do great.

530
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,013
Here.

531
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:49,783
Um... facial fractures.

532
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,852
You'll find an outline

533
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,207
and recent research articles.

534
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,109
Would you pass it down?

535
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,714
Here we see examples

536
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:09,603
of a depressed fracture
of the left frontal bone

537
00:23:09,672 --> 00:23:12,840
with disruption
to the orbital rim,

538
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:16,861
both the result of
blunt force trauma

539
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,047
when the patient's face
intercepted a tire iron.

540
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:23,983
John, if you would
please, the projector?

541
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,606
Thank you.

542
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,952
Orbital rim and
frontal sinus fractures,

543
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,621
along with other fractures
to these facial bones,

544
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,708
often result in
concomitant C.N.S. injury.

545
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:51,895
Diagnosis is established
with radiographic studies

546
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,809
and computerized tomography,

547
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,767
preferably using a
three-dimensional image

548
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,802
of the patient's skull.

549
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,422
As you can see,

550
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:06,193
the frontal sinus and
orbital rim fractures here

551
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:08,428
are easily appreciated.

552
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,433
How's her breathing?

553
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:14,835
Depressed but okay.

554
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:16,169
She's finally out.

555
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:18,216
Maybe we got the balance right,

556
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,185
and she can get some sleep.

557
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,508
Kathy.

558
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:24,678
Kathy...

559
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,413
Who's Kathy?

560
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:27,914
Her little girl.

561
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:30,767
Does she know she's here?

562
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,753
She lives out west somewhere
with Grace's ex-husband.

563
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:35,222
Seattle, I think.

564
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,559
Grace gave up custody
when she entered the hospice.

565
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,226
She lost her child?

566
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,863
She entered the hospice to die.

567
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:45,382
Life goes on.

568
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,818
Then, again,
sometimes it doesn't.

569
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,338
Old hospice joke.

570
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,674
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God...

571
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,676
The Fentanyl's wearing off.

572
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,025
It hurts!

573
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,346
Lie down.

574
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,015
Her resps are too low.

575
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,417
I can't give her
any more morphine.

576
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:04,766
I can't stand it!

577
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,353
I'm so sorry.

578
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,532
It hurts.

579
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:08,800
Please, Doctor...

580
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:10,690
There's nothing else I can do.

581
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,726
Please, kill me.

582
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:14,656
Please. Please. Please.

583
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,363
Shh! Relax. Relax.

584
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,782
Please. Please.

585
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,567
Shh!

586
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:23,687
What do we got?

587
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:24,989
53-year-old male.

588
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,635
Grabbed his chest and collapsed.

589
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,158
Hypotensive, 80/60.

590
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,760
Tachycardic at 120.

591
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,996
Hypertension treated
with Altace and Tenormin.

592
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,296
What are those? Skates?

593
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,598
Guy's a hockey ref.

594
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:35,799
Collapsed during a game.

595
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,702
Some of the kids
followed us in a van.

596
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,303
He's had eight migs morphine.

597
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,571
He's diaphoretic.

598
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,251
Get an EKG and enzymes.

599
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,541
End of the line, guys.

600
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,877
You've got to wait
in the waiting room.

601
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:48,094
He going to be okay?

602
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:49,479
We don't know yet.

603
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,942
Malik, can you take
them to Waiting?

604
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,043
Yeah. Be there in a minute.

605
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,650
We'll do everything we can.

606
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,812
Come on, guys.

607
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:01,742
He's in fib.

608
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,444
Crash cart.

609
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,665
Where's the cart?

610
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,166
Right here.

611
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,334
Where's the new cart?

612
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,753
Paddles.

613
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,904
I put one in here
less than an hour ago.

614
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:18,108
I can't believe somebody
already stole one of my new carts.

615
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,809
Clear.

616
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,134
Hey, is Jake around?

617
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:30,314
Oh, he went to get a soda.

618
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,638
Nice digs.

619
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,640
This how the other half lives?

620
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:36,777
I could do with a little
less glass, actually.

621
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,428
There's no blood on the carpet,

622
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,130
so it's a step up from the E.R.

623
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,465
Mind if I sit?

624
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,850
I've had my shots.

625
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:45,652
Cindy was right. You
are kind of charming.

626
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,672
Is that bad?

627
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:49,756
Depends.

628
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,443
Jake's a great kid.

629
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,927
He is a great kid.

630
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:56,396
Hope you don't mind if we
shoot hoops now and then.

631
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,410
I promise not to pass
along any misogyny

632
00:26:58,434 --> 00:26:59,916
with these basketball tips.

633
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:03,487
Don't worry. If misogyny's
genetic, he's inherited plenty

634
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:04,816
from his father.

635
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,440
Does he see his dad much?

636
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:08,442
They communicate by check...

637
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:10,026
when it comes.

638
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,864
You know, if you don't like
me, you don't have to hide it.

639
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,533
You can just come
right out and show it.

640
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:17,745
I didn't know I
was being subtle.

641
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,269
Hey.

642
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,405
Hey, yourself. Dr. Ross
has come to see

643
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,440
if you want to play
some basketball.

644
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,429
We'll be about
half an hour, okay?

645
00:27:25,494 --> 00:27:26,838
And put the jacket on.

646
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,962
I'll make sure he wears it.

647
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:41,759
D5 NS, 100cc's per hour,

648
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,728
NG tube,

649
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,764
gastric lavage, CBC,

650
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,000
Chem seven and amylase.

651
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,370
Call the O.R., book a room.

652
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,708
Dr. Benton, what does this say?

653
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,511
NG tube.

654
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:04,147
And by that, you would
mean a nasogastric tube?

655
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:05,482
Yes.

656
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,817
And this?

657
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,385
Dextrose 5, normal saline.

658
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:09,848
An I.V., in other words?

659
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:11,038
Yes, an I.V.

660
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,601
I've examined the patient.

661
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:16,460
Frankly, I believe she needs
a fine surgical hand like yours

662
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,506
to get an I.V. going properly.

663
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,381
I'll have Carter do it.

664
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,450
And the nasogastric tube?

665
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,620
You'll notice she has
a deviated septum,

666
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,290
and I don't feel
comfortable putting one in.

667
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,629
I'll do it myself.

668
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,426
Tell the cath lab his
coag panel's cooking.

669
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,583
Here are his chest films.

670
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:41,062
See if you can find
those hockey kids

671
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,365
and tell them he's going to
be okay, will you? Thanks.

672
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,621
Susan. Susan!

673
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,055
Susan.

674
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,091
Susan, come on, please.

675
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,059
I'm busy, Mark.

676
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,062
I need to talk to
you about a patient.

677
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,009
End-stage breast cancer.

678
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,467
Bone mets to her back and legs.

679
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,469
Morphine's not working.

680
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,372
Neither is the Fentanyl.

681
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,140
Susan, she's in agony.

682
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,810
There's nothing I
can do to help her.

683
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,878
Spinal morphine
therapy? Cordotomy?

684
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,847
She refused both of them.

685
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,516
She just wants to die.

686
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,529
Sounds like she's going to soon.

687
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,153
She wants me to help her.

688
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,155
Her resps are down to 12.

689
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,825
If I give her a little
more morphine,

690
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,493
her breathing will stop.

691
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,195
What would you do?

692
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,830
Uh... I don't know.

693
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,178
I got to go.

694
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,967
How long you going
to keep this up?

695
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,681
You weren't there for me, Mark.

696
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,304
It was professional,
not personal.

697
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,332
We're not married.
We work together.

698
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:37,841
Professional<i> is</i> personal.

699
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,943
I miss you.

700
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:44,960
You could have told me

701
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,794
you were doing facial fractures.

702
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,663
And that thing
with the computer?

703
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:49,987
I looked like an idiot.

704
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,654
No, no. Keep irrigating that.

705
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,763
I can give you the
graphics program.

706
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,058
It's easy to use.

707
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,043
That's not the point.
The point is that

708
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:59,746
I need a good recommendation
from Benton if I'm going

709
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:01,364
to get a surgical residency.

710
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,483
Vertical mattress, 4-O nylon.

711
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,834
You want to go into surgery?

712
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,703
Yeah. Why do
you say it like that?

713
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,790
No, I mean, I think
you'd be great.

714
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:11,808
No, you don't. You
just sounded surprised.

715
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,410
I do know surprise
when I hear it.

716
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,862
You just... she just... you
just sounded surprised.

717
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:18,281
You really want
to go into surgery?

718
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,233
I don't know. I might.

719
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:25,271
Well, look, John, I've seen
my mother's surgical residents

720
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,618
and the ones around here,

721
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:27,669
and it just doesn't

722
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:28,836
seem like you.

723
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,928
What do you mean,
your mother's residents?

724
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,779
Your mother's a
surgical attending?

725
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:35,983
She's a chief of surgery.

726
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,134
Could I get some more 4 x 4s?

727
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,019
Chief of surgery?!

728
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,588
Where? What hospital?

729
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,306
Saint Bart's.

730
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,936
Why even bother
coming to school?

731
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,761
You're not going to have
any trouble getting a residency.

732
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,840
It's not like that.

733
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:50,108
She won't help me at all.

734
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:51,309
She didn't even want me

735
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,399
to go into medicine.

736
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,345
Just don't say anything
to anyone, okay?

737
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,114
They always jump to conclusions

738
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:59,083
and I end up having to
prove myself all over again.

739
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,775
Okay? Please?

740
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:03,726
John?

741
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,846
Found the snake.

742
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:15,054
Billy...

743
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,624
Billy...

744
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:22,195
Don't, please.

745
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:30,003
Mark, we need you in
Two to rule out an M.I.

746
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,923
Don't...

747
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,809
Don't.

748
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,530
Billy, please.

749
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,915
Mark?

750
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:55,428
I love you.

751
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,631
Cardiology would
steal our crash carts?

752
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,332
They steal everything.

753
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,446
Are you sure they're up here?

754
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,236
They were two hours ago.

755
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,373
Okay. Okay, Connie and Bob,

756
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,841
you stay with the carts.

757
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,270
You guys come with me.

758
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,398
I think we're in
the ladies room.

759
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,112
Ow!

760
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,680
Ow!

761
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,383
Ow!

762
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,118
Oh, man...

763
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,966
Dunphy's there.

764
00:34:13,035 --> 00:34:14,668
What do we do?

765
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:16,703
Sheri Dunphy?

766
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:18,838
Not a problem.

767
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,736
Sheri?

768
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:33,837
Doug, hi.

769
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,115
How have you been?

770
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,172
Good. You look great.

771
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,340
You lost some weight.

772
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,220
I got married last
year, remember?

773
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,994
Believe me, I'm
still in mourning.

774
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:42,745
Mm-hmm. What are
you doing up here?

775
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,230
Is the cath lab still up here?

776
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,766
Yeah, it's right where
it's always been.

777
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,936
If you could give me a
hand, really, just quickly.

778
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,115
Nope, I can't.

779
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,216
I'm out of here.

780
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,906
I've got a patient,
six-year-old:

781
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:55,475
Tetralogy of Fallot.

782
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:58,745
Yeah. Okay.

783
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,613
All right.

784
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,818
He's unbelievable.

785
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:07,665
And you wonder
why I slept with him

786
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:08,732
on the first date?

787
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:09,822
Really? First date.

788
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:11,024
You're kidding.

789
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:12,736
Yeah. He rang the doorbell,

790
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,871
next thing I knew

791
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:15,773
we were on the kitchen floor.

792
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:16,797
Kitchen floor?

793
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,366
Geez, I got to
start dating again.

794
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,870
Kids are having fun.

795
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:44,006
Yeah. They're the hockey players

796
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:45,208
from my M.I.

797
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,577
Haven't been picked up yet.

798
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,923
How did he do?

799
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:51,681
He's not dead, if
that's what you mean.

800
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,804
No. That's not what I meant.

801
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:03,709
He's going to be fine.

802
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:05,345
How is she?

803
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:09,495
She died a couple
of minutes ago.

804
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:15,188
Respiratory failure?

805
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:21,627
I was listening to
those kids playing,

806
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:24,397
and watching the snow fall.

807
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:28,868
You know, if you
stand right here...

808
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,115
Just... just right over here...

809
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:33,384
You can see the El from here...

810
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,853
Faces looking out the windows

811
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,510
into the darkness...

812
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:41,781
Life goes on, Mark.

813
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,854
Do you want to get
something to eat?

814
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:53,092
I can't.

815
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,539
Uh... Jennifer and
Rachel are in town.

816
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:56,896
Another time maybe.

817
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,731
Susan?

818
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,284
Mm-hmm?

819
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,021
Thanks.

820
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,191
See you tomorrow.

821
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,929
Stop now! Stop!

822
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,130
Where are they parents?

823
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:37,103
Carol...

824
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,237
Yeah?

825
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:39,417
I'm having problems with Haleh.

826
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,540
So I heard.

827
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:42,086
I'd like you to reschedule her

828
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,088
so that we don't have to
work together anymore.

829
00:37:44,112 --> 00:37:45,512
From what I hear, you're the one

830
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,091
who needs to be rescheduled.

831
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,593
So what does that
mean? You won't do it?

832
00:37:48,617 --> 00:37:50,595
No, I won't. The nursing
schedule is my prerogative.

833
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:51,551
Even if that situation

834
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,052
is endangering patient care?

835
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:54,666
You work every day
and every third night.

836
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,933
Haleh's got four
kids to support.

837
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:57,134
When is she supposed to work?

838
00:37:57,158 --> 00:37:58,770
The woman refuses to
follow my instructions.

839
00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:00,571
Why should she? You're
still in training. Remember?

840
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:02,028
She already graduated.

841
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:03,874
Oh, come on, Carol. Don't
give me that. We are not equals.

842
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:05,493
She may not know how
to cross-clamp an aorta,

843
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,745
but Haleh's been working
in emergency medicine

844
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:10,564
for 20 years, and if you
would ever hop off that pedestal

845
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,466
you've put yourself on, you
might see that the nurses

846
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,010
make this place work, not you.

847
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:25,185
I smell food.

848
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:27,119
I'm actually cooking.

849
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:30,490
You mean, like, from
scratch, and everything?

850
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:33,259
Yeah. Who knows?

851
00:38:33,328 --> 00:38:35,928
It might become
an annual tradition.

852
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,630
I don't know.

853
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:40,900
I remember you cooking
something last summer.

854
00:38:40,968 --> 00:38:43,135
I think it was meat loaf maybe.

855
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:45,605
Definitely, it
was... it was brown.

856
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:46,917
Semiannual then.

857
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:48,107
When did you get home?

858
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:49,875
7:00 or so.

859
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:51,344
Traffic was awful.

860
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,745
Where's Rach?

861
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:55,214
She's in the bathtub.

862
00:38:56,218 --> 00:38:57,584
Mmm.

863
00:38:57,652 --> 00:38:58,951
God, what a week.

864
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,130
I'm exhausted.

865
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:01,887
How was your day?

866
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,389
Great, and awful.

867
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,735
Tell me great.

868
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,859
I'm too tired for awful.

869
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,363
Morgenstern offered me a job

870
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:14,400
as attending
physician next year.

871
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:18,538
And what did you say?

872
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,573
I said yes.

873
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:23,142
Without discussing
it with me first?

874
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:25,378
An attending.

875
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,979
I figured

876
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:28,968
I'd be spending
nights and weekends

877
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,183
at some community
hospital in Winnetka.

878
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,489
Is this a problem?

879
00:39:36,558 --> 00:39:37,823
Can you tell Morgenstern

880
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:40,360
you need more
time to think about it?

881
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:42,094
I don't need to think about it.

882
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:43,663
This is a great opportunity.

883
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:46,299
Well, I'm not going
to know until March

884
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:50,403
if Judge Franklin needs me
to clerk for him again next year.

885
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,071
Whoa. You're considering

886
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,917
spending another
year in Milwaukee?

887
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,120
If he wants me to, yes.

888
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,209
Well, I assumed...

889
00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:00,079
Exactly. You assumed
things would be

890
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,515
the way you want them to be.

891
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:05,050
For the last six months,
things have not been

892
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,836
exactly the way
that I want them...

893
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,841
Living by myself,
without my wife,

894
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,275
without my daughter...

895
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,477
<i>My</i> wife?<i> My</i> daughter?

896
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,345
Mark, it's only been six months.

897
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,392
What about the
last six years, huh?

898
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,083
What about medical school
and rotations and residency?

899
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,552
Who was a paralegal

900
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,331
so we could put
food on the table?

901
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,033
Who was in night
school for years

902
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,267
trying to finish college?

903
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,469
Was that you?

904
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:29,993
No, that was me.

905
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:34,330
So, now, I want it to be
about me for a change.

906
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,332
Not you.

907
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:55,568
How are you doing, Mr. Conally?

908
00:40:55,637 --> 00:40:57,069
Are you still dead?

909
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:59,372
Oh, yeah. Very.

910
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:00,818
My head feels better though.

911
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:02,041
Oh, well, that's good.

912
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:03,175
You just let us know

913
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:05,445
if we can get you
anything else, okay?

914
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:07,046
Okay.

915
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:10,616
Night.

916
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,151
Night.

917
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:36,589
You're late.

918
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:37,777
It's almost 10:00.

919
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:40,013
Yeah. I got held
up at the hospital.

920
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,747
Where's Walt and my sister?

921
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,644
Something at
your niece's school.

922
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,302
Look, if you say you're
going to be here at 8:00,

923
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,748
I need you to be here at 8:00.

924
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,692
I've got an early
shift tomorrow.

925
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:52,658
Okay.

926
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,610
How was your first day?

927
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,679
How long ago was
your mother's stroke?

928
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,714
Eight months.

929
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,648
It was a right parietal C.V.A.?

930
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,483
Yeah.

931
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,002
Well, she's still suffering

932
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:04,270
from left hemiparesis.

933
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:06,573
Has she had any
physical therapy at all?

934
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:08,841
Of course she has,
in the beginning.

935
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,412
Look, my mother doesn't have
any problems getting around.

936
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,613
That's the problem.

937
00:42:13,682 --> 00:42:15,782
I mean, she's
always wandering off.

938
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,133
She's masking well,

939
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,835
but she has limited use
of her left arm and leg,

940
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,405
and she's got bruises
all over her left side

941
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:24,601
from running into things.

942
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,127
And you should have warned
me about the incontinence.

943
00:42:28,195 --> 00:42:30,463
Yeah, well, that's, uh...

944
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:34,133
That's just a sometime
thing, you know?

945
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,402
Not tonight, it wasn't.

946
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,694
Can you help my mother?

947
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,879
Well, I can't make her younger,

948
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:49,748
but I can probably
improve her mobility.

949
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,150
She's a great lady.

950
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:54,520
I wish I would have
known her before the stroke.

951
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:56,684
Sure heard a lot about you.

952
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:59,909
She wouldn't stop
talking about her Petey.

953
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,360
I'm sorry about that.

954
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:04,263
No, hey, you're the
baby in the family, right?

955
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:09,552
I'm the... youngest
in the family, yeah.

956
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,221
Uh-huh. My baby sister, too.

957
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,291
My mom just loves her to death.

958
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,593
It still pisses me off.

959
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:19,295
Good night.

960
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:03,889
