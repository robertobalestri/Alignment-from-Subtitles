Dr. Greene?

00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,135
Dr. Greene!

4
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:22,204
What is it?

5
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,606
Patient for you, Dr. Greene.

6
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:26,758
Can't the intern take it?

7
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,443
No. It's for you.

8
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:30,112
What time is it?

9
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,946
5:00.

10
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:37,352
All right.

11
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,006
Can't the intern take it?

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,241
It's Dr. Ross.

13
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,195
Dr. Ross.

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,913
I'll be right there.

15
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,861
We got some up on Four
South to take care of, too.

16
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:29,070
Come on, Doug.

17
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:30,572
Marky, boy.

18
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,073
Yeah.

19
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:33,575
Did I wake you up?

20
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,077
Yes, you did.

21
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:36,661
You are a real friend.

22
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,363
I want you to know that.

23
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,231
Getting out of bed for me.

24
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,594
Room Three is free.

25
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,084
Room Three is free.

26
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,353
Three is free.

27
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:45,937
Free for three. There we go.

28
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,384
Come on, Doug. I got you.

29
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:52,093
♪ But come ye back when
summer's in the meadow... ♪

30
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,045
Hi.

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,730
Ow! Oh, man.

32
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:57,599
I got it.

33
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:00,869
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, Mark.

34
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:02,404
Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,540
I'm a little under the weather.

36
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,041
Here you go.

37
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:07,543
I know. Yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,611
All right.

39
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,867
D5, NS. I need the dextrose.

40
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,847
Give him 600 of ASA.

41
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,255
Aspirin. I almost
forgot aspirin.

42
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,141
So, anyway...

43
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,343
she says to me...

44
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,745
She says, "I didn't know

45
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,832
that pediatricians
could be so sexy."

46
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:35,287
And I said, "Honey, you
ain't seen nothing yet."

47
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,788
Ow! All right.

48
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,824
All right. Give me a fast drip.

49
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,342
I need the hydration.

50
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,843
Don't worry, Doug.

51
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,345
Just lie back.

52
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,846
Ho, ho!

53
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,582
How's your beautiful
wife? How's Jennifer?

54
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:49,017
She's fine, really.

55
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:50,519
You two settle your problems?

56
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:52,254
Yeah, everything's okay.

57
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,890
Hate to lose you in
the ER, You know.

58
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,958
Lie back.

59
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,326
I am.

60
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:03,114
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

61
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,851
Really do.

62
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,468
Here's your aspirin.

63
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,424
Give him 2,000cc's
in a fast drip.

64
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,472
Keep an eye on it.

65
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:11,707
Don't let it run dry.

66
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:13,053
Does he always do this?

67
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,642
Only on his nights off.

68
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,546
I'm going to bed.
Wake me at 6:30.

69
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,343
Dr. Greene.

70
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,677
Dr. Greene?

71
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,212
Mark!

72
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,331
What is it?

73
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,994
Can I give Mrs. Williston
some more Demerol?

74
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:38,984
She's complaining of pain.

75
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,969
50 Milligrams IM.

76
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,338
Thanks, Mark.

77
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,388
Dr. Greene?

78
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,562
What is it?

79
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,680
6:30, Dr. Greene.

80
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,038
Hey, Timmy.

81
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,107
Good morning, Dr. Lewis.

82
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,609
Oh, Dr. Lewis?

83
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,277
Yeah?

84
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,012
Thank you.

85
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,514
Morning, Dr. Benton.

86
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,015
Hey, Jerry.

87
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,418
This was the scene
at 6:15 this morning

88
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:17,221
in the Loop where a building
collapsed during construction...

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,425
You got any estimate
on the injuries?

90
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,093
How long before they arrive?

91
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,163
Has left at least 12 people
injured and two dead.

92
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,433
Oh, yeah? That soon?

93
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,068
Hey, what's up, Timmy?

94
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,570
Hey, Dr. Benton.

95
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,071
Notify Trauma.

96
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,285
They got an
accident in the Loop...

97
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,420
12 injuries, seven critical.

98
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,828
It's a good day for us surgeons.

99
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,847
Mrs. Williston, in Room
Four, needs a CBC.

100
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,382
The man in Five
is a rule-out MI,

101
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,684
waiting for cardiac enzymes
and another 12 lead.

102
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,519
Dr. Ross, he's in
Three, sleeping it off.

103
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,822
Why don't you wake him
and get him out of there?

104
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,501
Nine, I need a uric acid.

105
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,003
Do you know what this is about?

106
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,338
Building collapsed in the Loop.

107
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,872
They're sending us
a dozen hot ones.

108
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,862
Yeah? Well, who's on?

109
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,331
Just us.

110
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,244
Okay, forget all that.
Call Susan Lewis.

111
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,778
Call the seventh
and eighth floor.

112
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,513
Tell them we need
anybody they can spare.

113
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:05,665
Why don't you do that now?

114
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,858
Take him to Trauma Room Two.

115
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,327
What's your name, sir?

116
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,979
Can you tell me your name?

117
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,254
Next to Three. That way.

118
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,347
Which way?

119
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,510
That way.

120
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,102
Huh?

121
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,249
Surgical One, down
to the end on the right.

122
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:24,417
Last door on the right.

123
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,585
What's your name, sir?

124
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:27,008
Edward Wilson.

125
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,461
What is your address?

126
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,063
40... 47...

127
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,649
Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson?

128
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,668
Okay, people. Let's go.

129
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,436
Let's bring him in.

130
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,088
And on my count.

131
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:42,441
On three. One, two, three!

132
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,276
How you doing, sir?

133
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,779
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

134
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,864
Sorry about your suit.

135
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,009
So, was it just your hand?

136
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,283
Well, let's have a look. Light.

137
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,735
Light! Let's move.

138
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,448
Have nice, pleasant thoughts.

139
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,004
Everything will be fine, sir.

140
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,339
Let's have a CBC,

141
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,291
type and crossmatch.

142
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,326
We got a pre-op here.

143
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,245
Notify the OR. Get us a room.

144
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,298
Call Vascular and
call Orthopedic.

145
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,366
Tell them to come down here<i> now.</i>

146
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,135
This is their lucky day.

147
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,570
Mr. Wilson, your hand is
still attached... not by much...

148
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,406
But it's going to be okay.

149
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,008
EKG, and X ray of his
chest, wrist and hand.

150
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,871
Can you feel
anything in your hand?

151
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:20,328
No.

152
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,341
We're going to save your
hand. Don't worry about a thing.

153
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,232
Clear!

154
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:27,068
Mr. Jackson, where does it hurt?

155
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,270
Where does it hurt, Mr. Jackson?

156
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,839
In my chest...

157
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,974
Does it hurt when
you breathe in?

158
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,343
Have you been
coughing up any blood?

159
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:37,345
Okay, let me take a listen.

160
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,448
Dr. Lewis!

161
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,001
Okay, where we taking him?

162
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,674
I just want to check this, okay?

163
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,910
Do you have any
pain in your head?

164
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,244
No.

165
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,262
Your neck?

166
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:55,312
No.

167
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,014
All right.

168
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,700
What I want you to do...

169
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,871
Tell me if it hurts
when you breathe.

170
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:03,821
Uh... no.

171
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,323
I don't get a BP.

172
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,026
Start two large-bore
IVs saline, wide open.

173
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,928
Type and cross for ten units.

174
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,846
Four units "O" negative stat.

175
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:15,016
Drop an NG. Tube and
get Dr. Benton in here.

176
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,552
This is no place
for a pediatrician.

177
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:20,555
No sensation, radial,
median or ulnar. No pulses.

178
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,657
Color and
temperature as you see.

179
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,260
He's gotten 500cc's
saline. Crits 32.5.

180
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:28,029
Type and crossmatch
sent. X rays waiting.

181
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:31,032
OR says they'll have
a room in ten minutes.

182
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,733
Okay. Let's get him out of here.

183
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,135
You think you can save the hand?

184
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,714
Looks pretty good. I think so.

185
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,540
I told him you could,
so he's counting on you.

186
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:39,985
Peter, you're a smartass.

187
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,338
You'd love to do this case
yourself, wouldn't you?

188
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,961
Yeah. I'm ready. I'm strong.

189
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,463
Yeah. I could do it.

190
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,931
You're a resident.

191
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,984
You're years from
a case like this.

192
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,848
How many fingers?

193
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,005
Three.

194
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,184
What's your name?

195
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,274
Jeff Barr.

196
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,453
Where are you?

197
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,943
Cook County General.

198
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,122
What's today?

199
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,680
St. Patrick's Day.

200
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,526
You're fine. Get a
set of facial bones.

201
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,895
You're going to be
just fine, Mr. Barr.

202
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,330
You're beautiful,
Doc. Thank you.

203
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,564
You married? No. I'm a doctor.

204
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,721
Well, then, listen...

205
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,334
Take it easy, Mr. Barr.

206
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,469
You wouldn't want
to fall on your face

207
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,826
twice in one day.

208
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,140
How much did she vomit?

209
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,776
A couple hundred
cc's, all over Dr. Ross.

210
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,244
Ma'am, would you
please take a deep breath?

211
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,530
Good. Now another.
Any pain there?

212
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:25,519
No.

213
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,033
How about here?

214
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:28,239
Okay. It's okay.

215
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,223
Call the OR. Get a room.

216
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,125
What is her crit?

217
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,642
23.

218
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,563
Whoa, wait a minute!
Here we go. No pulse.

219
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,098
She's coding. Code
blue! Call the time.

220
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,433
It's 8:37.

221
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:40,468
That's a shockable rhythm.

222
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,670
Let's go.

223
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:44,122
Nice and easy.

224
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,157
Clear!

225
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,262
Okay, give me an amp
of epi and 100 Lidocaine.

226
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,015
Let's move, now. Here we go.

227
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,833
Okay, what do we got here?

228
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,669
Where are the paramedics?

229
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,754
Come on. Get his clothes off.

230
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,155
Give me something.

231
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,556
I can't stand it!

232
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:03,752
We'll give you
something for the pain.

233
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,993
Just hold on.

234
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,162
Notify the orthopods we
have an open fracture.

235
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:09,992
Give him tetanus and
five of morphine right away.

236
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,216
Does it hurt anywhere else?

237
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,016
My knee!

238
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,750
Need help?

239
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,385
Yeah. Check his knee.

240
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,720
Okay, there we go.

241
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,188
Here we go.

242
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,174
Dr. Benton, we got patients

243
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,476
on Surgical Two and Three,
and one of them looks bad.

244
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:25,274
This woman's heart
stopped, and she needs it

245
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,014
pretty badly. Call the AR.

246
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,110
The residents are in Surgery.

247
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,144
Get them<i> out</i> of Surgery.

248
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,468
Can't you see I'm busy? Time?

249
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,119
Two minutes.

250
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,754
Come on, sweetheart.

251
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,856
You're making us
a little nervous here.

252
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,269
Okay, paddles. Let's go.

253
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,459
Clear!

254
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,594
Okay.

255
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,379
Is that a blip?

256
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,231
Recharging.

257
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,015
There it is!

258
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,602
Come on. Come on back to us.

259
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:48,953
Keep it pumping.

260
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,288
Keep it pumping!

261
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,000
I think she's coming back.

262
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,641
Bring her back for me, baby.

263
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,810
Come back to us.

264
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,112
Come on, baby. Yes!

265
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:00,008
That one's in Trauma Three.

266
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,367
That's down the
hall and to the left.

267
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,868
Call Pathology.

268
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,147
We've got a customer

269
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,472
who isn't going to
be charged services.

270
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,790
The name's Canelli.

271
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,876
I'm looking for relatives
of Robert Canelli.

272
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,377
Right here.

273
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,213
I'm his son.

274
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,715
Hi. I'm Mark Greene.

275
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,383
My father, he's, uh...

276
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,719
Your father was in
an accident today.

277
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,220
You know that?

278
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,056
Come with me, please.

279
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,558
No. Just tell me.

280
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,053
He's here, right? Just tell me.

281
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:32,680
Mr. Canelli, your
father had a heart attack

282
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,351
and we were
unable to revive him.

283
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,353
I'm sorry. I'm...

284
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,588
Bastard... you bastards!

285
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,876
You're sorry?

286
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,508
Through here.

287
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,060
The morphine should
make you feel a little better,

288
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,284
and we'll have you in
the OR in no time, okay?

289
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,222
Any others?

290
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,556
No. That's it.

291
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,058
That's it?

292
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,227
Yeah. The last two were DOA.

293
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,229
Well, that's it.

294
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,297
Yeah, for now.

295
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:41,266
Orderly, please bring a
wheelchair to Admitting.

296
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,901
Orderly, please bring a
wheelchair to Admitting.

297
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,403
What happened to Ross?

298
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,871
He went to change.

299
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,073
Somebody threw
up on him. That lady.

300
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,075
The lady who arrested?

301
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,221
She make it? Yeah.

302
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,011
We got her going again.

303
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,209
She's got a junctional
rhythm, but she's going.

304
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,199
What about that guy's hand?

305
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,878
They're still in surgery.

306
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:01,747
They're going to be working

307
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,449
all day on that one.

308
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,284
Anybody want any coffee?

309
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,608
Yeah, I do.

310
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,243
How do you take it?

311
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,955
Same as yesterday
and the day before that.

312
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,779
And they call me a smartass.

313
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,626
You get any sleep last night?

314
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,715
About an hour.

315
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,066
Oh, damn it!

316
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,980
The nurses have been in
here raiding the coffee again.

317
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,248
Why don't they
just make their own?

318
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,905
I'm going to tell...

319
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,620
Never mind. Never mind.

320
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,178
Okay. Never mind.

321
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,497
Aren't we supposed to be getting

322
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,499
some new students today?

323
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,645
Yeah. I think so.

324
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,968
I hope they're good.

325
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,285
The last two were
really hopeless.

326
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,512
Is something wrong?

327
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:45,713
Oh, you bet there is.

328
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,148
We're out of coffee again

329
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,350
because the nurses
have been taking it.

330
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:50,518
That's what's wrong.

331
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:51,919
So make some more.

332
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,638
Make some more?

333
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:57,257
We work 36 hours on, 18
off, which is 90 hours a week,

334
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:59,593
52 weeks a year.

335
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:03,447
For that we are paid
$23,739 before taxes,

336
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,433
and we also have
to<i> make</i> the coffee?

337
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:07,868
My heart is breaking.

338
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,658
Where are the filters?

339
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,159
In the refrigerator.

340
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,630
Dr. Greene, your wife
is waiting in the cafeteria.

341
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,498
Oh, damn it.

342
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,637
Everything's fine.

343
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,042
Morning, Dr. Greene.

344
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,731
Morning.

345
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:47,749
Hey, Mom, look.

346
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,743
Two more bites, baby, please.

347
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,112
Then you're done.

348
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:54,215
Hi, Rachel.

349
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,050
Hey, Dad, look.

350
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,052
Oh, look.

351
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,388
A grilled cheese
sandwich for breakfast.

352
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,458
I gave in. What can I say?

353
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:04,959
You're late.

354
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,295
Sorry. We had a big one.

355
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,779
Building collapsed.

356
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,043
Mommy's reading about tarts.

357
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,367
Torts.

358
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:15,769
Are you getting any sleep?

359
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,421
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

360
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,957
You look tired.

361
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,492
Yeah, Dad. You look tired.

362
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,960
Oh, I do, do I?

363
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:24,828
Are you going

364
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,964
to finish that?

365
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,499
You mind if I eat it?

366
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,937
Dr. Harris' office called
to confirm your meeting.

367
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,157
Oh, geez, that... that is today.

368
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,108
You can still go, right?

369
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,261
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

370
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,463
You're not going to
forget or get too busy?

371
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,148
I'll go.

372
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,270
What's so funny?

373
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,773
You know you're
going to hate it.

374
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,291
Maybe not. At least, there,

375
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,743
the patients don't
throw up on you.

376
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:56,844
Who threw up?

377
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,946
Who threw up?!

378
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,647
Nobody threw up.

379
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:05,219
It's just that, between
your hours and my studying,

380
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:09,073
I feel like we never get to
see each other anymore.

381
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:13,344
I'll go meet Harris today, okay?

382
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,914
Okay.

383
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,499
I just hope you like it.

384
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,986
Oh, no. Would you

385
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,638
look at this?

386
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,618
That's the first
tailored white coat

387
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,192
I've ever seen.

388
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,526
Isn't he lovely?

389
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,878
Lovely.

390
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,841
Think he knows anything?

391
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,515
He knows how to dress.

392
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,562
Well, he's my student.

393
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:38,019
I'll find out.

394
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,050
John Carter?

395
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,206
Yes, sir.

396
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,707
Peter Benton.

397
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,554
You the surgical student?

398
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,877
Yep. Third year.

399
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,158
Good. We're going to be
spending a lot of time together

400
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,160
so let me show you
around so you'll be oriented.

401
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,416
This is the admitting desk.

402
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,930
If you need someone paged or
a chart called up, you do it here.

403
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,253
This is Timmy.

404
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,322
Don't shake his hand.
He's afraid of disease.

405
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,623
This is the way to the lab.

406
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,869
We do crits, counts, spindowns.

407
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,438
Chemistries are
marked with these slips

408
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,694
and left at the front desk.

409
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,541
Mark everything "stat"
whether you want it fast or not.

410
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,009
The chem lab is 7022.
The heme lab is 6944.

411
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,549
Memorize it.

412
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,663
Everybody gets an IV the
minute they walk through the door.

413
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:11,897
Use an angiocath
with a 16 needle.

414
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,566
You need a large bore
in case they're bleeding

415
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,700
and you need to transfuse them.

416
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,834
Do you know how to start an IV?

417
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,157
Actually, no.

418
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:18,726
I thought you were third year.

419
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:21,674
I am, but all I've done are
dermatology and psychiatry.

420
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,347
The well-dressed
specialties, huh?

421
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,227
Well, you'll find that
surgeons actually

422
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,229
try to help people,
not just bill them.

423
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,148
Now the best way to do
this is to pull the skin tight

424
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:30,549
so the veins don't
roll and go in low.

425
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,551
Once you're in, pull the gizmo
out and hook it up to here.

426
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,937
This is Carol Hathaway,
the head nurse. John Carter.

427
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,205
Hi. Hi.

428
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,423
She's terrific, isn't she?

429
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:38,757
She goes with an
orthopod that used

430
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,609
to be a Big Ten tackle
and looks like King Kong.

431
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,045
Now, what you want to
do is you want to tape it.

432
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,368
Moderate flow,

433
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,381
two or three drips per second.

434
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,638
That's it.

435
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,818
That's all there is to it.

436
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,809
Okay?

437
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,678
Uh... um... okay.

438
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,349
All along here you have
the medical examining rooms.

439
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,054
This is where the pill
pushers kill their victims.

440
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,890
But this... this is
the surgical room.

441
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,592
This is where
the real action is.

442
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:14,298
We use this phone
to call the OR... 6440.

443
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,967
X Ray is around the corner.

444
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,301
They're a bunch of idiots.

445
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,971
They scare the patients
and make them wait too long.

446
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,638
So whenever you can

447
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,941
make sure you go with
the patients to X Ray.

448
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,610
Don't let them get scared.
Don't let them get hurt.

449
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,280
Now, here's Dr. Morgenstern.
He's the head of ER.

450
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,426
Watch out. He eats
students for lunch.

451
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,917
David Morgenstern. John Carter.

452
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,363
When did that
severed hand go up?

453
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,797
Vascular took it up an hour ago.

454
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,266
I just hope they
can do it right.

455
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,556
Dr. Benton is one of the
best residents we have.

456
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,370
You learn everything
you can from him

457
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,810
except attitude.

458
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:44,762
He didn't mean that.

459
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,097
Yes, he did.

460
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,176
Your room will be down here.

461
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,510
That's where you'll
sew people up.

462
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,544
Do you know how to suture?

463
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,868
Uh... No.

464
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,536
Okay, I'll teach you.

465
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,872
Do we have anyone to sew up?

466
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,540
How would I know?

467
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,687
You know, I love this
great spirit of camaraderie.

468
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,155
Everyone wants
to help, you know.

469
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,790
Okay, Here's the
suture room. Let's see.

470
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,114
Good morning, ma'am.

471
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,448
I'm Dr. Benton.

472
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,816
This is Dr. Carter.

473
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,818
Good morning.

474
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:08,898
Okay, let's have a look.

475
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,165
How did you do this?

476
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,156
Broke one of the
breakfast dishes.

477
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,490
Well, don't worry.

478
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,727
We'll have you
fixed up right away.

479
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,740
Now, can you feel this?

480
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,047
Yes.

481
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:20,864
Can you move your finger?

482
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,850
Of course. It's just a cut.

483
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,563
Dr. Benton, we have
a policeman coming in

484
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:26,331
with a gunshot wound
to the lower extremity.

485
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,155
Put him in Room Two.

486
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,335
Notify X Ray.
I'll be right there.

487
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,825
Now, here's all your stuff.

488
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,828
Ask the patient if she's allergic
to the locals or any drugs.

489
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,498
Now, this is lidocaine,
but call it novocaine.

490
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,000
They've heard of that.

491
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,846
Ma'am, are you
allergic to novocaine?

492
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,236
My teeth are okay.

493
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,266
No reactions, rashes, anything?

494
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,023
No, of course not.

495
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,321
Now, you inject both sides of
the wound, expelling as you go.

496
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:52,124
Then you have to put on
surgical gloves by yourself.

497
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:54,059
You know how to
do that, don't you?

498
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,383
Great.

499
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:56,751
Here we go.

500
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,936
Hey.

501
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,605
Here you go, Dr. Ross.

502
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,974
Thank you, Nance.

503
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,476
Dr. Ross.

504
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,028
Hi, Tracy Young.

505
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,278
I'm your third-year student.

506
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,442
Well, hello, Tracy Young,
it's nice to meet you.

507
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:11,543
Listen, for the next few days,

508
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,045
we'll be working
very closely together.

509
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,903
Well, not that closely, Dr. Ross,
but I'll do my best to help you out.

510
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:18,122
So, if you tell me what to
do, I'd like to get started.

511
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,201
Just trying to be friendly.

512
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,792
I've got all the
friends I need. Thanks.

513
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,494
Shall we get started?

514
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:26,313
Yeah.

515
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:30,996
Now evert the wound
edges and space them

516
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,565
because the tissues will be
swelling over the next 48 hours.

517
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,167
Space them the way
that you see here.

518
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:36,969
Dr. Benton, the
policeman's here.

519
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:38,292
Okay, I'm coming.

520
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,994
Here. You finish.

521
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,157
Okay, this isn't
going to hurt at all.

522
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,975
Now, can you tell me
what happened, Billy?

523
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,098
His school sent him home.

524
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,033
They said he vomited blood.

525
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,836
Can you tell me how
it happened, Billy?

526
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,499
He's a very high-strung child.

527
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,874
Always has been very
tense, very nervous.

528
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,020
Mrs. Logan, maybe you better
wait outside while I examine your son.

529
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:12,993
Why?

530
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,088
It's just a procedure.

531
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,512
Well, I think I should be here.

532
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,175
I'm worried about
Billy. He needs me.

533
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,799
Please wait outside.

534
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:20,595
Look, Doctor, I don't
know who you think you are

535
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,464
but this is my son, and I want
to be here when he needs me.

536
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,553
He's very high-strung.

537
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,967
Mrs. Logan, you're
absolutely right.

538
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,974
You love your son, and you want

539
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:29,143
to see him treated

540
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:30,339
as soon as possible

541
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,174
so it's best if you have
a seat outside here

542
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,342
and we'll be right with you,

543
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,976
Doctor... and we'll
be right with you.

544
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,334
It's okay.

545
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,293
Hey, kiddo.

546
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,963
All right, did you
vomit blood, Billy?

547
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,749
Do you have any pain?

548
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,985
Okay, can you point to the pain?

549
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,405
Right in here.

550
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,041
Have you vomited blood before?

551
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,476
Many times?

552
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,979
Okay.

553
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:08,516
That's okay.

554
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,887
First eight-year-old
ulcer patient I've seen.

555
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,153
You still here?

556
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,343
What do you think you're doing

557
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,812
the Sistine Chapel?

558
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,025
Finish her up.

559
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,793
Start an IV in Room
Two. Bye, ma'am.

560
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,129
Nurse, could you bandage
this for me, please?

561
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,885
Thank you, Doctor.

562
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,671
You're very welcome.

563
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,351
When do I come to have
my stitches come out?

564
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,875
Oh, uh... three weeks.

565
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:37,962
When my son had stitches
in his foot, they said ten days.

566
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,330
Really? Well, ten
days, three weeks...

567
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,932
Any time in there, okay?

568
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:46,119
Hey.

569
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:51,358
We need an
anesthesiologist to ICU.

570
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,861
Please report to the ICU stat.

571
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,123
250 milligrams rocephin IM

572
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,591
for the gentleman in room four

573
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,394
and remind him he has to come
back in two days. Thank you.

574
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,884
Right.

575
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,531
Hey, Carol, are we
out of oral ampicillin?

576
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,267
Yeah, we ordered some
yesterday. Call down again.

577
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,668
Hey, Carol, Dr. Greene
wants to know

578
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,258
if we have any more lasix.

579
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,571
We were out an
hour ago. Check it.

580
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,562
Hey, Carol, Dr. Ross wants to
know if we have any PKU cards.

581
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,998
Tell him no.

582
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,044
He's going to have to try to
get a blue top from the baby.

583
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,379
He says he can't get one.

584
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,870
Carol, are you sure
that you don't have

585
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,438
a PKU card tucked away

586
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,540
in that special stash of yours?

587
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,194
Like this?

588
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,029
I can always count on you

589
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:32,299
even if you do
prefer football players.

590
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:33,701
You had your chance.

591
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:35,135
I was young.

592
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,720
I was a fool.

593
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,488
You're still a fool.

594
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,108
Do you happen to know
what is the worst-paying

595
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:42,326
medical specialty?

596
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,210
Pediatrics?

597
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,346
You were right the first time.

598
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,666
Hey, Carol, did that
lasix come up yet?

599
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,868
'Cause we need it now.

600
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,353
Good morning.

601
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,654
I'm Dr. Carter.

602
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,600
What seems to be the problem?

603
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,990
What's it look like?

604
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,626
I shot myself in
the freakin' leg.

605
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:17,794
Oh.

606
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,940
Well, uh...

607
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,176
we'll have you
fixed up in no time.

608
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,133
Yeah, you guys keep saying that.

609
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,702
But first, we have
to start a little IV.

610
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,271
Just hurry it up, okay?

611
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,638
Yes, sir.

612
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,875
Hey!

613
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,077
Excuse me, sorry.

614
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,080
Okay.

615
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,165
I tell you, I wanted to belt her

616
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,934
right in the mouth.

617
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:41,101
I really did.

618
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:42,936
Uh-huh.

619
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,832
Then I go and shoot
myself in the leg.

620
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,140
These things happen.

621
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,474
I bet you see a lot

622
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,376
working in a place like this.

623
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:50,710
Yeah, oh, yeah.

624
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:51,889
All the time.

625
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:53,880
Uh, okay.

626
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:04,458
Look, Doc, you don't mind

627
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,944
my asking... Have
you done this before?

628
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,296
Officer, I'd hate to tell you
how often I've done this before.

629
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,560
You're going to feel

630
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,811
a little needle.

631
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:14,318
Ow!

632
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:17,154
Come on, that wasn't that bad.

633
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,689
But we missed the vein.

634
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,843
We're going to have to
try this one more time.

635
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,462
My wife is not that bad.

636
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:27,197
We don't argue that
much, just once in a while.

637
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,344
I mean, in this case, it's
lucky I didn't kill her, right?

638
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,867
Oh, man.

639
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,919
I'm afraid we missed again.

640
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,016
We have to try one more time.

641
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,092
You have very tough veins.

642
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:40,894
My wife is

643
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,746
a very beautiful woman.

644
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:43,964
Uh-huh.

645
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:46,110
I mean, I'm not proud
of beating up any woman

646
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:48,569
even when she's asking
for it, but just sometimes...

647
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:50,615
In this case, it's
lucky I didn't throw her

648
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:52,167
through the wall
and break her neck!

649
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,691
I got it.

650
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,659
Don't move.

651
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,995
Don't move. It is in the vein.

652
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,991
Just do not move at all.

653
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:01,214
There you go.

654
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,450
Officer, you got yourself an IV.

655
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:06,270
And everything's
going to be fine now.

656
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,188
Can I move?

657
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:09,901
Yeah, sure. Move
around. You're fine.

658
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,537
Well, that's about all I can
do for you for the moment.

659
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:13,843
They're going to be coming in

660
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,923
to take you down to X
Ray and then to surgery.

661
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,697
Surgery?!

662
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:22,035
Yeah, but believe
me, the worst is over.

663
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,865
This happen when you woke up?

664
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,522
Yes, when I got out of bed.

665
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,135
And are you seeing double now?

666
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,292
No.

667
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,993
How many fingers? Three.

668
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,006
Have you had any trouble
with your eyes before?

669
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,497
No, never.

670
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,460
Did you have any pain while
you were seeing double?

671
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:36,628
Headache? Trouble
with your balance?

672
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:38,196
Funny taste in your mouth?

673
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,364
Flashing spots before your eyes?

674
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:40,548
Weakness in your

675
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,600
arms and legs?

676
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,623
No. None of those things. Never.

677
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,392
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Ervin

678
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:47,794
I can call a neurologist
to go over you

679
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,963
but that'll cost
you another $200.

680
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,710
If you don't have
any symptoms now

681
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:52,978
I'd leave well enough alone.

682
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:55,080
Come back if you
have any further trouble.

683
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:56,331
Who's next?

684
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,589
You're just saying
that because I'm black.

685
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,802
Just trying to save
you money, Mr. Ervin.

686
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,538
I know you don't have insurance.

687
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:06,463
Uh-uh. You wouldn't talk
like this if I wasn't black.

688
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,065
You're Jewish, right?

689
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,245
Call a Neuro
consult for Mr. Ervin...

690
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,736
Cc: transient
diplopia... And bill him.

691
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,282
Hello, somebody, hello!

692
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,983
What is it?

693
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,319
I got a lady pregnant
in my cab outside.

694
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,454
Why'd you do that?

695
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,755
Hey.

696
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,540
We don't do deliveries
here, I'm sorry.

697
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,442
You have to take her up to OB.

698
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,077
She's going to have a baby

699
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:39,563
whether you deliver 'em or not!

700
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,709
Hey, you busy?

701
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:41,832
No.

702
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,678
Why don't you come with me?

703
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,402
Get us an OB nurse.

704
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,906
Okay, okay, ma'am. Come on.

705
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,808
Let's get out, okay?

706
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:51,870
You're going to be fine.

707
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:53,410
When did it start snowing?

708
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,011
Come on, Doctor.

709
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,713
Give me a hand.

710
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,048
All right, ma'am.

711
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,382
Up on the gurney.

712
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:00,584
There you go.

713
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,319
Is this your first child?

714
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,487
No, no?

715
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:04,688
Okay, let's go.

716
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,158
Ooh... it's starting.

717
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,193
It's coming.

718
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,210
Hold the head in.

719
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:11,856
We don't want to
deliver in the hallway.

720
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,512
What?

721
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,781
Put your hand

722
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:15,349
between her legs

723
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,717
and hold the head in.

724
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:18,162
Keep breathing, ma'am.
Blow through the pain.

725
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:19,319
Get me anesthesia.

726
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:20,754
Call the pediatrician.

727
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:22,288
Hook up those stirrups.

728
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:24,190
Are you doing an episiotomy?

729
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,759
I don't have any time.

730
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:27,394
She's already crowning.

731
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,462
Blow through the pain, ma'am.

732
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:31,042
Blow through the pain, blow
through the pain. That's right.

733
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,098
What shall I do?

734
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:33,374
Just what you're doing, Doctor.

735
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,968
Is it snowing out there?

736
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:36,469
When I'm done scrubbing

737
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,605
I'll take over, and
you can scrub.

738
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,334
Where's the OB Resident?

739
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,402
They're all called, Doctor.

740
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,709
You want a gown?

741
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,211
I don't think I'm
going to have time.

742
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,747
I have to catch this
one any way I can.

743
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:47,681
No kidding.

744
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:48,960
All right, dear.

745
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:50,528
You're going to be just fine.

746
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:52,770
You just have to
blow. Okay? Blow.

747
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:53,865
Is it snowing?

748
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,021
Yeah, it's snowing.

749
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,674
It's snowing on March 17.

750
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,075
This is unbelievable.

751
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,242
It's okay, ma'am.

752
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,194
You are going to be just fine.

753
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:02,746
Okay, okay, let me take over.

754
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,147
There we go.

755
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:08,685
Okay, ma'am, we're going to
push on the next one, okay?

756
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:12,940
One, two, three...

757
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,205
Okay, one more. This
is it. This is the one.

758
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,012
And push... push

759
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,347
push, push, push, push.

760
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:23,367
Okay, one more push.

761
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,118
We're going to get him out.

762
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:27,321
Here we go. One,
two, three, push.

763
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:28,322
Push, push.

764
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:30,991
Good, good, shoulders are clear.

765
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:34,505
You have

766
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:36,079
a beautiful little boy.

767
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,549
Clamp.

768
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:42,252
Okay. There you go.

769
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,707
God...

770
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,586
He's a cutie pie.

771
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:00,820
Yes, he is.

772
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:03,123
You did a good job there.

773
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,476
Dr. Carter, you have

774
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,144
three suture cases
waiting for you.

775
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,846
You're not on the
Medical Services.

776
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,481
These people don't
need your help.

777
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,316
They can botch
things up on their own.

778
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,118
Come on. Let's get cracking.

779
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,789
Patient Martin, Jonathan.

780
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:39,058
Anterior and lateral
right lower extremity.

781
00:29:39,094 --> 00:29:41,027
Femur articulation

782
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,830
patella, tibia, fibula
all appear normal.

783
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,401
There is a radiolucent
density in the soft tissue

784
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:50,304
superficial to the
mid-shaft of the fibula.

785
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,972
A bullet. A bullet is
what it's called, Steve.

786
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,275
There is no apparent
fragmentation

787
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:56,677
of the foreign body.

788
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,680
Distal tibia and fibula
all appear within...

789
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,725
Come on, Steve. Normal limits.

790
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:02,316
Impression: foreign body

791
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:04,217
in the right lower extremity

792
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,386
consistent with possible bullet.

793
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:07,921
Is that it?

794
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:09,100
Thank you.

795
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:10,757
I'll take these.

796
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,993
There's a guy upstairs
with a bullet in his leg

797
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,940
who'd like to go to the OR

798
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:17,244
and have it out.

799
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,851
So, you're not feeling any pain?

800
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,431
No pain here in your back?

801
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,587
No.

802
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,056
Well, you know what?

803
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,758
All you got is a
fracture to your ankle.

804
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,427
Everything else is fine.

805
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,240
Now, what's the story, Doc?

806
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,830
Do I get worker's comp?

807
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,432
The story?

808
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,434
The story is

809
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,479
you're still alive.

810
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,570
Great, but I got
a few bills, and...

811
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,403
All right.

812
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,539
There it is, nice and red.

813
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:49,128
He has otitis media.

814
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:50,308
He'll be fine, he'll be fine.

815
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:52,966
Give him 50 milligrams
of oral amoxicillin.

816
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,869
If he doesn't get any
better by tomorrow morning

817
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:57,003
give me a call.

818
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,750
All right? It's nice to see you.

819
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,851
Bye, tiger.

820
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:02,008
He's very handsome.

821
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,060
He knows it.

822
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,379
That's right. We got
a UA and a sed rate.

823
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:08,381
The patient is Rebecca Morton.

824
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,116
M-O-R... what do you mean?

825
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:12,218
We sent this to you an hour ago.

826
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,265
Don't give me that. It is 1:40,
and it was a stat determination.

827
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,290
What are you guys doing
down there? Picking your noses?

828
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:19,336
Chest pains, two
hours. Question AMI.

829
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,828
I will talk to you any
damn way I want to.

830
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,830
If I send for a stat chemistry

831
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:26,833
I want it within an hour,
not sometime next month.

832
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:29,169
Yeah, we're a
little busy here, too.

833
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:31,337
Wait till they start
going to lunch.

834
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:34,040
Then things will really
start slowing down.

835
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:35,558
Everybody's all sewed up.

836
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,193
What do you want me to do?

837
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,390
Go to lunch.

838
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:40,558
Actually, I'm all right. If
there's something you...

839
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:42,766
Excuse me a minute.

840
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,253
Look, don't be a hero.

841
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:49,568
If I tell you to go
to lunch, you go.

842
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:51,102
It's a long time before dinner

843
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,672
and we may be too busy
then to stop and eat, okay?

844
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:56,841
You never know how long it's
going to be until your next meal

845
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:58,677
so whenever you can, you eat.

846
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:00,411
Now, get the hell out of here

847
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:02,875
and don't take more
than half an hour.

848
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,391
Okay.

849
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,647
Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.

850
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,782
What seems to be the
trouble, Mrs. O'Rourke?

851
00:32:15,818 --> 00:32:18,618
I'm not Mrs. O'Rourke.

852
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,604
Mrs. O'Rourke?

853
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,374
Is there a Mrs. O'Rourke here?

854
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,354
What is it?

855
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,533
Crack dealer.

856
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:39,767
Took five shots from an Uzi.

857
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,036
We need some muscle in here.

858
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,025
He's just a kid.

859
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,187
Thirteen.

860
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,539
Call security. Why?

861
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,474
I think the other gang members

862
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,899
may come and
try to finish him off.

863
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,434
All right, everybody.

864
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,935
Let's keep it calm.

865
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,270
Here we go.

866
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,272
This is Tracy Young in ER.

867
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,441
I need someone in
Trauma Room One.

868
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,776
Thanks.

869
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,944
Strap! Strap!

870
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,032
Surgical Two.
Turn right and down.

871
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,367
Tell the surgeons

872
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,069
we have a motorcycle
accident coming in.

873
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:10,470
The guy wasn't wearing a helmet.

874
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:11,950
Oh, terrific. Those
are the stat labs.

875
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:13,551
I'm going across the
street for a minute.

876
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,286
I promised my wife I'd
go to this appointment.

877
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,726
Can you get Susan

878
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,911
to cover for me? Okay.

879
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:21,047
No! Not there!
Surgical Two! Two!

880
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:08,394
I'm Dr. Greene
to see Dr. Harris.

881
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:15,284
<i>Everyone has a family, Mark.</i>

882
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,737
My wife wants to
shop, kids grow up.

883
00:34:17,772 --> 00:34:20,206
You want a private
school, college.

884
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:22,175
You got to think about that.

885
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,095
Now, the office for
our next associate

886
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,830
is here.

887
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,033
As a junior man

888
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,213
you'll do all calls and weekends

889
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,870
for a year or so.

890
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,217
Compensation: You'll start out

891
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,142
at $120,000 per
year, plus bonuses.

892
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:42,529
Now, the group has a condo
in Jamaica and one in Aspen.

893
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:44,030
Do you ski?

894
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:45,960
No, I haven't had
the opportunity.

895
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,283
Oh, you should.

896
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,618
It's a great sport.

897
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,453
David Morgenstern tells me

898
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,084
you're the sharpest
guy the ER ever had.

899
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,574
But I'll tell you

900
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,710
the ER is a young man's game.

901
00:34:56,745 --> 00:34:58,656
You think you're doing good

902
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,391
but there's a lot to life

903
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:01,848
especially this one.

904
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:05,551
And we find the practice
intellectually challenging

905
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:07,398
so we send our physicians

906
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:09,433
to all the major conferences.

907
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:11,669
Last year, Maui, Paris, Rome.

908
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,392
We're proud to practice

909
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:16,229
the best possible
medicine we can here.

910
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:18,632
It seems great.

911
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,066
You like this?

912
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:22,002
We had Prescott redesign it.

913
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,403
We redesign every
couple of years.

914
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:26,122
Keeps us looking fresh.

915
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,807
Terrific.

916
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,709
Oh, you have time for lunch?

917
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:31,644
We can go to the Crown Club.

918
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
They have a great
porcini pasta. No oil.

919
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,782
I've got to get back. Sorry.

920
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:38,485
Melissa, would you bring
Dr. Greene's coat? Yes.

921
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,036
Maybe next week?

922
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:42,038
Mark, we'd really love

923
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:43,506
to have you.

924
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,774
Thank you.

925
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:47,939
Mrs. McCormick, how are you?

926
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:49,407
There you go, Dr. Greene.

927
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:53,066
I thought the Field
Museum Ball was wonderful.

928
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,834
Well, aren't you sweet?

929
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,569
Thank you.

930
00:35:56,604 --> 00:35:57,903
Thank you.

931
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,439
You're welcome.

932
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,628
Cheer up, Doctor.
It's only 3:00.

933
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:12,685
3:00. What am I doing this for?

934
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:14,020
I must be crazy.

935
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:15,788
That's a very good insight.

936
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,617
When did it start raining?

937
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:37,961
It's raining.

938
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,330
It has been for an hour.

939
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,665
How's your new student?

940
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,600
Very capable. Tough.

941
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,035
Uh-huh.

942
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,904
So, I hear you went
up to Harris's today.

943
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,906
Did he offer you a job?

944
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,154
Yeah. I think I'd have to go

945
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:55,156
to a lot of charity balls.

946
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,013
There are worse things.

947
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,681
I guess.

948
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,183
Must be.

949
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,818
By the way, what's this I
hear about you and that tech

950
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,354
up on surgical four?

951
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,688
I'm a married man.

952
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,023
So?

953
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,658
So whatever you
heard is not true.

954
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,794
Oh. I heard that she
was seriously cute,

955
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,929
but you are
faithful to your wife.

956
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,965
Is that what you're telling me?

957
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,467
Yes.

958
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,902
Why would you do
something like that?

959
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,497
'Cause I'm too tired
to do anything else.

960
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,080
We'll know more when
we have the x rays.

961
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,815
How much do you smoke?

962
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:35,096
Two, three packs
a day sometimes.

963
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,386
Uh-huh. And how long
you been doing this?

964
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,399
Since I was about 14, I guess.

965
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,323
You really should stop that.

966
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,892
Yeah, I know.

967
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,493
Excuse me.

968
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,562
You can put your
clothes back on.

969
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,585
Hello?

970
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,153
Uh... hi.

971
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,190
Listen, I can't talk
at work unless it's...

972
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:58,524
It is?

973
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,059
Well, what...?

974
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:02,695
No, I'm on all night.

975
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,330
Oh, thanks.

976
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,967
I get off tomorrow
night at, uh, 6:00.

977
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:10,936
Paul, I-I thought we broke up.

978
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:13,639
Oh, Paul, come on.

979
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:19,778
Damn. What? No. Not you.

980
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:21,114
It's just, uh...

981
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:23,026
I have to tell a
patient something.

982
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,751
Listen, is everything all right?

983
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:28,787
I'm sorry, but I just...

984
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:31,074
Yeah. Okay. Fine.

985
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,847
We have your x rays, Mr. Parker.

986
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:41,785
You can see there's a density
in the right middle lobe there.

987
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,286
What does that mean?

988
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,488
It means there's
something abnormal

989
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,674
within the structure
of your lung.

990
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,753
There's something in my lung?

991
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:52,445
Yes, that's right.

992
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,147
What is it?

993
00:38:54,182 --> 00:38:55,459
Well, it could be
any number of things.

994
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:57,161
It could be an infiltrate,
a dense area of tissue

995
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:59,151
from an old infection.

996
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,787
It could be an
inhaled foreign body.

997
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:02,522
It could be a
granuloma of some sort.

998
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:04,724
It could be a lot of things.

999
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,704
Well, what do you think it is?

1000
00:39:06,728 --> 00:39:08,460
There's no way to know.

1001
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,763
You'll have to undergo
a bronchoscopy

1002
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:12,765
and possibly exploratory surgery

1003
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,584
before we know for sure.

1004
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,018
I understand, but...

1005
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,032
what do you think in
the meantime? Just...

1006
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,341
I think in the meantime,
you could consider it

1007
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:23,275
a potentially serious finding.

1008
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,480
So, you're saying I got cancer?

1009
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:28,764
I'm not saying that.

1010
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,717
I'm saying we don't
know anything for sure.

1011
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:33,364
Doctor, let me explain something
to you, okay? I'm 40 years old.

1012
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:34,899
I have a wife. I
have three children.

1013
00:39:34,923 --> 00:39:36,400
I have a house
that is not paid for.

1014
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:38,435
I have a mother who has a house

1015
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,570
that isn't paid for.

1016
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,438
I have a lot of
responsibilities.

1017
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,506
So I need to know.

1018
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,208
I need to know what you think.

1019
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:46,232
I think you should
regard your condition

1020
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:47,750
as very serious

1021
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,936
but should await a
final determination.

1022
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,916
I don't understand the problem.

1023
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,240
Is it so hard? Are you
afraid to tell me the truth?

1024
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,945
Your history of coughing blood

1025
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,030
weight loss, and this x ray

1026
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,765
is suggestive of cancer

1027
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,368
but the diagnosis has
not been confirmed

1028
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,854
and it may very well
be something else

1029
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:10,923
and none of us should
jump to any conclusions

1030
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,425
until we know.

1031
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:14,009
That's what I think.

1032
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,983
How long do I have?

1033
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,960
Six months to a year.

1034
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:42,955
Well, do I have six
months for sure?

1035
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:46,142
No, not for sure.

1036
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:53,399
Okay. Yeah, I was just wondering

1037
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:56,553
because I always wanted
to take my wife to Nassau.

1038
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:58,782
We talked about it a lot...
We always talked about it...

1039
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:00,368
But we never did
it, so I just figured

1040
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:01,674
spring's coming.

1041
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,654
It's getting too late
to go to Nassau

1042
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:06,145
and she always wanted
a... suntan in the winter

1043
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,748
to show off to the neighbors
and stuff, you know.

1044
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:10,316
I understand.

1045
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:12,918
Yeah, yeah.

1046
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,821
So, I guess I better go.

1047
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:17,435
Summer's going to be
here before you know it.

1048
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:19,453
So I guess I better
go pretty soon, huh?

1049
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,288
Doctor, I want to thank you.

1050
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,457
I want to thank
you for your help

1051
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,182
and thank you for
being straight with me.

1052
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,817
I really appreciate it.

1053
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,489
I guess I don't have
to quit smoking.

1054
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:58,414
Mr. Parker, if there's one
thing you learn in my job

1055
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,066
it's that nothing is certain...

1056
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,102
Nothing that seems very bad

1057
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:05,654
and nothing that
seems very good.

1058
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,890
Nothing is certain.

1059
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,126
Nothing.

1060
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,516
I'm sorry.

1061
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,694
Oh...

1062
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:58,473
Good evening.

1063
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,976
How's it going
tonight, Mrs. Raskin?

1064
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:04,613
Timmy, I have a problem
that requires medical attention.

1065
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:05,948
See Dr. Greene.

1066
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,482
He's on duty tonight.

1067
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,984
Oh.

1068
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,821
Dr. Greene. How nice.

1069
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:14,891
And... Good evening

1070
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,158
Dr. Greene.

1071
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,511
He says he doesn't drink...

1072
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:21,547
I require medical
attention, Dr. Greene.

1073
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,583
Give me a minute, Chris.

1074
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:25,663
What is it, Mrs. Raskin?

1075
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:29,321
Well, I have this troublesome...

1076
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,489
hangnail.

1077
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,757
Mrs. Raskin...

1078
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,259
I'm afraid it may be infected.

1079
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:34,605
Mrs. Rasking, if we treat you

1080
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:36,307
it's going to cost you $180.

1081
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:37,408
You do know that.

1082
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:39,115
Oh, I wish you'd do it

1083
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,182
for me.

1084
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,051
You're such a nice young doctor

1085
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,269
and I do appreciate

1086
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:45,004
your taking the time.

1087
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,206
Okay.

1088
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,276
We'll handle this in the lab.

1089
00:43:51,312 --> 00:43:52,911
The lab?

1090
00:43:52,947 --> 00:43:55,214
Oh, gracious.

1091
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:57,650
I had no idea how
complicated it was.

1092
00:43:57,685 --> 00:44:00,219
I'll be excising Mrs.
Raskin's hangnail.

1093
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:01,554
I'll stand back.

1094
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:02,888
Well, at my age

1095
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:04,568
you can't be too careful.

1096
00:44:04,592 --> 00:44:06,692
Please, have a
seat, Mrs. Raskin.

1097
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,761
Thank you.

1098
00:44:08,796 --> 00:44:11,397
Dr. Greene, you look tired.

1099
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:12,798
How have you been?

1100
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,132
Fine, thanks.

1101
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:15,468
And your wife?

1102
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:18,070
Is she still studying
for her bar exams?

1103
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:19,149
Next month.

1104
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:21,218
We won't see much of each other.

1105
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,503
This alcohol may
feel a little cool.

1106
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,078
Hey, Mark, you
got time for coffee?

1107
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:28,798
Maybe in a half an hour.

1108
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,132
She's very cute.

1109
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,234
She work here at the hospital?

1110
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,014
She's a medical resident.

1111
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:37,590
Did I tell you my
sister got remarried?

1112
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:38,808
No.

1113
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,776
Well, how long has it been

1114
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:42,328
since I've seen you?

1115
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:45,431
Hmm... just a week or so.

1116
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:46,999
Here we go.

1117
00:44:47,035 --> 00:44:48,884
Don't make such a fuss.

1118
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,739
Thank you, Dr. Greene.

1119
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,790
Now...

1120
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,742
you be a good boy

1121
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,612
and go home to your wife.

1122
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,367
Another day, another dollar.

1123
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:05,701
Good night, Timmy.

1124
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,203
See you, Wendy.

1125
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:08,382
Good night, Connie.

1126
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:09,472
Hey, Rick.

1127
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:10,672
Hey, Tim.

1128
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,852
How you doing?

1129
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:13,009
I'm good.

1130
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,176
Yeah?

1131
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,478
Yeah. Ready to work.

1132
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,626
Hey, Carol, can you get...?

1133
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,949
Sorry. I'm off.

1134
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:22,296
Oh, I forgot. See you later.

1135
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,560
In three, the lady with
pulmonary edema...

1136
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,855
She gets lasix and
a nitroglycerin drip.

1137
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,190
In four, there's some kid.

1138
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,669
Dr. Ross is looking after him.

1139
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,860
Five, there's a question
pulmonary embolism.

1140
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,095
Labs are coming.

1141
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:35,431
Can I get two grams
of chloramphenicol?

1142
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,434
Sorry. You're going to have
to get it from the next shift.

1143
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:42,371
See you tomorrow.

1144
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,705
Good night.

1145
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,409
Malik needs two grams
of chloramphenicol.

1146
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:47,988
Coming right up. All right.

1147
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,412
Good night.

1148
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:50,579
See you.

1149
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,448
See you guys tomorrow.

1150
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,451
ER.

1151
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,631
Come on. It's not that bad.

1152
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,900
It's a very minor cut.

1153
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,234
Three stitches.

1154
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,736
It's not the cut.

1155
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,738
It's the car.

1156
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,507
I smashed the car.

1157
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:20,075
Oh.

1158
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,579
I wasn't supposed to drive it

1159
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:28,450
and I took the keys,
and I smashed it up.

1160
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,020
And it was brand-new.

1161
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:33,689
My father loves that car.

1162
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:38,427
Well, it might not be
as bad as you think.

1163
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,395
Oh...

1164
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:43,899
it was a brand-new Cadillac...

1165
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:46,468
with power steering...

1166
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,038
and... air conditioning.

1167
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:52,541
Oh, God, he'll kill me.

1168
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:56,712
It was the first new
car he ever had!

1169
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,085
Ow!

1170
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,170
Suzanne!

1171
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,038
Daddy...

1172
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,106
Suzanne...

1173
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:09,708
Oh, my...

1174
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,109
Oh, my God.

1175
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:12,578
Oh, Daddy.

1176
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,665
Uh, uh, could we
not move, please?

1177
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,335
Is she going to be all right?

1178
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,037
Yeah, she's going to be fine.

1179
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,639
Oh... oh, honey.

1180
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,342
Daddy?

1181
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,343
Yeah?

1182
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:28,877
I trashed the car.

1183
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,212
That's all right.

1184
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,215
The important thing
is that you're okay.

1185
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,234
Oh... oh, Daddy.

1186
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,937
What car?

1187
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,527
You mean the Caddy?

1188
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:46,962
Oh, Daddy, I am so sorry.

1189
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,542
You totaled my new Seville?!

1190
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,533
Suzanne!

1191
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,371
God!

1192
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,039
Oh, God...!

1193
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,859
My Cadillac!

1194
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:02,311
Oh...

1195
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,062
It doesn't matter.

1196
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,466
It doesn't matter.

1197
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,115
Dr. Carter, you have six
in backup. That's not good.

1198
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:29,299
Look, this is St. Patrick's Day.

1199
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,968
The worst is yet to come.

1200
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,019
Let's move.

1201
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:33,075
Okay.

1202
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,080
Who was that idiot?

1203
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:40,967
Why did he do it?

1204
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:42,301
I don't know.

1205
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,647
He just got his hands
on it and he swallowed it.

1206
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,171
Jimmy, why did you do it?

1207
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:46,138
Because.

1208
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:47,640
You see? He's impossible.

1209
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,207
Here's the KUB.

1210
00:48:49,243 --> 00:48:50,475
Mm-hmm.

1211
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,329
There it is all right.

1212
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:54,958
You mean, that's where
it is? It's in his stomach?

1213
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:57,015
You said he swallowed it.

1214
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:58,517
What do I do now?

1215
00:48:58,552 --> 00:48:59,763
Check his stools, Mrs. Edmunds.

1216
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:00,847
He'll probably pass it.

1217
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,322
That's not what I mean.
How do I get into my house?

1218
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,573
I'm locked out.

1219
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,807
You...

1220
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,544
you don't have another key?

1221
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:09,611
It's not funny.

1222
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,880
I'm sorry.

1223
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:18,671
You know, it is possible
to become pregnant

1224
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,472
without actual penetration.

1225
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:22,008
I mean, just by fooling around.

1226
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,153
I'm not pregnant.

1227
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:24,304
It's very important
you tell me any reason

1228
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,978
why you think you
might be pregnant.

1229
00:49:26,014 --> 00:49:27,145
No reason.

1230
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:28,297
Because If you are pregnant

1231
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,466
you might have what we
call an ectopic pregnancy.

1232
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,918
In which case, you'd have
to be operated on right away.

1233
00:49:32,954 --> 00:49:34,086
It's very serious.

1234
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:35,888
It could be a matter
of life and death,

1235
00:49:35,923 --> 00:49:37,473
and I'm not exaggerating.

1236
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:38,807
I'm not pregnant.

1237
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:39,875
Okay.

1238
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,411
Excuse me for one second.

1239
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,395
How old?

1240
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,630
She's 13.

1241
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:47,566
And she's got a pain in
her lower left quadrant

1242
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:49,101
and she's not pregnant?

1243
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:50,102
Mm-mm.

1244
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:51,470
Okay, let's see.

1245
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:55,791
Hello, Miss Murphy.

1246
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,992
I'm Dr. Benton.

1247
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:59,561
Can you tell me
how long has it been

1248
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,030
since you've had
your last period?

1249
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,233
I don't know.

1250
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,318
Well, just think back.

1251
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:07,853
Tell me roughly.

1252
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,640
It was after Christmas.

1253
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,641
Okay.

1254
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,393
So, it's been a few months?

1255
00:50:15,396 --> 00:50:16,529
I guess so.

1256
00:50:16,564 --> 00:50:17,774
I haven't really

1257
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:19,214
paid attention.

1258
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,450
And you've had
sexual intercourse?

1259
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,439
Yes.

1260
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,609
Dr. Carter...

1261
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:33,211
what you have is
an ectopic pregnancy

1262
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:35,781
and she needs to be scheduled

1263
00:50:35,816 --> 00:50:39,217
for ultrasound and
surgery right away.

1264
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,871
How'd it go?

1265
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:49,728
You've been to Harris's office.

1266
00:50:49,764 --> 00:50:51,263
You know what it's like.

1267
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,498
It's like a nightclub
or something.

1268
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:54,767
He offered you a job?

1269
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,334
Yeah... but I don't know.

1270
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:57,848
You don't want to do it?

1271
00:50:57,872 --> 00:51:00,405
It doesn't seem like
real medicine to me.

1272
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,840
So what's the problem?

1273
00:51:01,876 --> 00:51:03,776
You know what the problem is.

1274
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:04,777
Jennifer?

1275
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:05,844
Yeah.

1276
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,345
You can't live your life

1277
00:51:07,381 --> 00:51:09,425
the way someone
else wants you to, Mark.

1278
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:10,482
I know.

1279
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:11,817
Especially a lawyer.

1280
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:13,085
She's not a lawyer yet.

1281
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,419
You know what I mean, Mark.

1282
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:15,988
It's got to be your life.

1283
00:51:16,023 --> 00:51:17,072
It is.

1284
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,407
She just keeps talking

1285
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,353
about how she doesn't
see me anymore.

1286
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,611
Well, she probably never does.

1287
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:23,957
I mean, I never see Paul.

1288
00:51:23,981 --> 00:51:26,048
I thought you guys broke up.

1289
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,362
Well, we did, but... you know.

1290
00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:30,369
Yeah.

1291
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,389
Well...

1292
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:40,195
Dr. Greene.

1293
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,533
Yeah, yeah. Right away.

1294
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,501
Come on. We got to go.

1295
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:47,502
What?

1296
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:48,904
We got to go.

1297
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,272
Mark, what?

1298
00:52:04,138 --> 00:52:05,437
Did you hear?

1299
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:06,772
Yeah.

1300
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:08,885
Yeah, yeah, she's on her way.

1301
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:11,143
It's incredible.

1302
00:52:11,179 --> 00:52:14,980
I don't know how
this happened...

1303
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:17,683
to her, of all people.

1304
00:52:19,687 --> 00:52:21,387
I don't know.

1305
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,992
Okay, people, come on.

1306
00:52:27,027 --> 00:52:28,477
Let's break it up.

1307
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,812
Lots to do.

1308
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:32,597
Let's get back to work.

1309
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,339
Come on. What do
you expect to see?

1310
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,528
Hey, let's get back to work!

1311
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,030
We're going in here.

1312
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:50,265
We're going in here, head first.

1313
00:52:52,887 --> 00:52:56,939
Oh, my God, it is Hathaway.

1314
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:04,164
All right, move her on
three. One, two, three.

1315
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:07,649
Come on, people.
Let's get her clothes off.

1316
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,685
Let's go. Let's go.

1317
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,427
Let's go.

1318
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:21,713
Call respiratory.

1319
00:53:21,748 --> 00:53:23,715
We may need to intubate.

1320
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:25,951
Do you know what she took?

1321
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:28,231
I don't know. She just went
into the medicine cabinet.

1322
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:29,637
We've got a lot of stuff around.

1323
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,491
So you have no idea
what she has taken.

1324
00:53:32,526 --> 00:53:35,243
I want a drug screen right away.

1325
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,846
Two milligrams of Narcan
and an amp of d-50.

1326
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:38,580
You want to pump her?

1327
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:39,698
Yep.

1328
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:47,472
Malik, call Neuro, call
the nursing supervisor.

1329
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:49,157
Did you call her family?

1330
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,371
I don't know her family. We
were only roommates three weeks.

1331
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,562
Why did she do it?

1332
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,408
It doesn't matter
why she did it.

1333
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,432
We don't ask that
about any other OD

1334
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,017
that comes through these doors

1335
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:01,136
and we don't ask
it about this one.

1336
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:29,414
I want blood gas
and electrolytes.

1337
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:31,044
How hypotensive is she?

1338
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:32,551
80/60.

1339
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:33,902
She have anything to drink?

1340
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,420
She had a scotch.

1341
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:36,371
More than one?

1342
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,339
I don't know.
Maybe. I don't know.

1343
00:54:39,393 --> 00:54:42,077
What are you people
standing around for, huh?

1344
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,012
Do the arterial stick.

1345
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,514
She got a Babinski?

1346
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,649
Yeah. Positive.

1347
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:53,021
How's the oxygen?

1348
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,496
15 liters and running.

1349
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,954
Morgenstern's on his way.

1350
00:55:08,989 --> 00:55:10,422
Her serum barb is 45.

1351
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:12,106
Is that a mistake?

1352
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,875
It was repeated twice.

1353
00:55:18,665 --> 00:55:20,482
Malik, close the curtain.

1354
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:21,677
This isn't a show

1355
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:23,802
over here, people.

1356
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,480
ER.

1357
00:55:34,515 --> 00:55:36,115
Yeah.

1358
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,283
And what's the nature of the...?

1359
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,684
I see.

1360
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,320
Call Dr. Benton.

1361
00:55:41,355 --> 00:55:44,923
We got a shotgun wound
to the chest coming in.

1362
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:47,125
What a night.

1363
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,078
Gas distension distal to
the duodenum is apparent

1364
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,481
with fluid levels in
the proximal ilium.

1365
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,049
Impression... acute
small bowel obstruction.

1366
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,796
This is a surgical candidate.

1367
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,553
Oh, you guys are incredible.

1368
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,422
What would we do without you?

1369
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,391
It's nice to see you, Peter.

1370
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:06,178
A man of many
talents... All unproven.

1371
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,934
We got a new
barbiturate level yet?

1372
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,735
It just came back.

1373
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,938
Still 45.

1374
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:22,044
Pupils mid-range and sluggish.

1375
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,528
90/70.

1376
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:26,198
We just got her
barbiturate level.

1377
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:28,817
It's 45 micrograms
per milliliter.

1378
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:31,503
She's intubated. We're
alkalinizing her urine.

1379
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:34,006
We're getting her
ready for hemoperfusion.

1380
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:35,752
But if she's decerebrating...

1381
00:56:35,776 --> 00:56:37,354
you know the question, Mark.

1382
00:56:37,378 --> 00:56:39,689
Should we be trying
any of this at all?

1383
00:56:39,713 --> 00:56:41,146
It doesn't look hopeful

1384
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:43,615
but I think for the
morale of the unit

1385
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,150
we got to do everything.

1386
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:46,751
I mean, she was...

1387
00:56:46,787 --> 00:56:49,888
<i>is</i> very popular.

1388
00:56:54,428 --> 00:56:56,828
The unit's looking to you, Mark.

1389
00:56:56,863 --> 00:57:00,065
You set the tone.

1390
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,100
Yeah.

1391
00:57:02,136 --> 00:57:03,546
She was one of us.

1392
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,587
We loved her, we worked with her

1393
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,856
and now something's
happened to her.

1394
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,586
It makes us feel guilty.

1395
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,120
It makes us feel angry

1396
00:57:11,144 --> 00:57:13,206
and scares the hell out of us

1397
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,549
but we take care of her, and
then we go on with our jobs.

1398
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:20,234
Yeah.

1399
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,137
You set the tone, Mark.

1400
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,173
You get the unit through this.

1401
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,592
I'm fine.

1402
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:29,945
Okay.

1403
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,347
Call me if anything happens.

1404
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:36,885
Anything at all.

1405
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:54,052
Boy, she really
did it, didn't she?

1406
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:55,248
Yeah, she did.

1407
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:56,755
She seemed okay today.

1408
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,256
Yeah. She seemed fine.

1409
00:57:58,291 --> 00:57:59,791
She was making jokes.

1410
00:57:59,827 --> 00:58:01,259
Everything was great.

1411
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:02,627
She was funny.

1412
00:58:02,663 --> 00:58:04,429
She was joking like always.

1413
00:58:04,465 --> 00:58:06,698
She was great.

1414
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,610
Go get some coffee, Doug.

1415
00:58:16,943 --> 00:58:20,929
We need a scrub nurse in OR Six.

1416
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:24,382
Scrub nurse, report to OR Six.

1417
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,333
Come on. Let's get him up.

1418
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,734
Let's get him up.

1419
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:00,880
All right. Good, good.

1420
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,104
Whoa! Knife wound.

1421
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:05,490
I thought it was supposed
to be a gunshot wound.

1422
00:59:05,525 --> 00:59:07,091
Excuse me. I feel ill.

1423
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,771
Oh, that's okay. I
didn't need you anyway.

1424
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,805
Listen, notify the
OR. Let's get us room.

1425
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:11,006
Come on. Let's go. Move him out.

1426
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,264
Here we go, buddy.

1427
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:18,637
Jerry, can you hold that?

1428
00:59:37,124 --> 00:59:39,124
Feeling better?

1429
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,159
Yeah.

1430
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:43,028
I'll be okay in a minute.

1431
00:59:43,063 --> 00:59:45,463
It just got to me
all of a sudden.

1432
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,765
Keep your head down.

1433
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:51,236
There's no rush. Just relax.

1434
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:52,971
Ah, it stopped raining.

1435
00:59:57,561 --> 01:00:00,495
I thought I was
going to be sick.

1436
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:01,980
I'm sorry.

1437
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,381
Don't ever say

1438
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:04,683
you're sorry.

1439
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:06,979
See, there's two
kinds of doctors.

1440
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,148
There's the kind

1441
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,338
that gets rid of their feelings

1442
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:12,419
and the kind that keeps them.

1443
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:13,520
If you're going

1444
01:00:13,544 --> 01:00:14,987
to keep your feelings

1445
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,689
you're going to get sick

1446
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,012
from time to time.

1447
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,792
That's just how it works.

1448
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:22,084
Keep your head down.

1449
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,207
People come in here

1450
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:32,944
and they're sick,
dying, and bleeding

1451
01:00:32,979 --> 01:00:37,048
and they need our help

1452
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,523
and helping them is more
important than how we feel.

1453
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,475
But it's still a pain in
the ass sometimes.

1454
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:54,315
You know, sometimes I just
want to quit and do something else.

1455
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,955
Yeah.

1456
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:07,691
Why don't you, uh,
take a few more minutes.

1457
01:01:07,715 --> 01:01:09,798
By the way

1458
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:13,719
I was in medical
school with Benton

1459
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:17,456
and he used to
get sick all the time.

1460
01:01:17,491 --> 01:01:20,742
So don't let him
give you any crap.

1461
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,778
You're going to be fine.

1462
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:11,609
What's the score?

1463
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,328
DePaul is down.

1464
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:17,265
You okay?

1465
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,366
Yeah.

1466
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,351
Good.

1467
01:02:19,386 --> 01:02:20,386
Don't worry

1468
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,036
about what happened out there.

1469
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:26,757
Just don't make a habit of it.

1470
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:30,645
Okay.

1471
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:50,081
She's been on
dialysis for three hours.

1472
01:02:50,116 --> 01:02:51,211
She's still comatose
and unresponsive.

1473
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:52,378
She must have taken
short-acting agents.

1474
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:54,581
She knew exactly
what she was doing.

1475
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:56,371
Has the family been notified?

1476
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:58,218
I don't know. I think so.

1477
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:01,075
Is she fully covered
on the hospital policy?

1478
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,744
As far as I know, yeah.

1479
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,213
Has anyone talked
to the press office?

1480
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:07,682
Let's face it: this
is bad publicity.

1481
01:03:07,718 --> 01:03:09,195
Some damn TV
network will get ahold of it

1482
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,352
and try to make

1483
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,720
a sentimental movie about her.

1484
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:12,520
I'm going to get on it.

1485
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:13,521
Anybody know why she did it?

1486
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:14,489
No one has any idea.

1487
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,336
Her fiance didn't
know anything either.

1488
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,880
Supposed to get married in June.

1489
01:03:25,752 --> 01:03:27,218
Who's next?

1490
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:28,787
I am, doctor.

1491
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:35,860
Now lean forward.

1492
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:36,995
Uh-huh.

1493
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,596
You feeling any pain?

1494
01:03:38,632 --> 01:03:41,365
It's better when I
lean forward, yeah.

1495
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,401
Okay, okay.

1496
01:03:42,435 --> 01:03:45,537
Uh, Lydia, can I
borrow your pen?

1497
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:49,206
Mr. Lawkowski, I'm going
to admit you to the hospital

1498
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,809
and start you on
a medical regimen.

1499
01:03:51,845 --> 01:03:53,878
There's some question in my mind

1500
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,947
as to whether that's necessary

1501
01:03:55,982 --> 01:03:58,883
but I think it's better
to be safe than sorry.

1502
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,897
Oh, God!

1503
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,955
Mr. Lawkowski, what is it?

1504
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:08,859
What's the matter,
Mr. Lawkowski?

1505
01:04:08,895 --> 01:04:11,846
I know the truth. You don't
have to hide it from me.

1506
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,014
The truth.

1507
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,882
I know you're being nice to me

1508
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,217
but you can tell me, it's okay.

1509
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:17,685
I want to know the truth.

1510
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:19,187
Mr. Lawkowski,

1511
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,690
you have a duodenal ulcer
with complicating pancreatitis...

1512
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:25,660
Rather mild pancreatitis,
judging from the lab figures.

1513
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,244
That's all you have.

1514
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,914
Come on. You
can tell me, please.

1515
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:33,684
You don't have
cancer, Mr. Lawkowski.

1516
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:37,038
Geez! Oh, I knew it!

1517
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,540
I knew it!

1518
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,074
It's cancer!

1519
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:41,943
And you were hiding it!

1520
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:44,929
Oh, God!

1521
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:48,299
Mr. Lawkowski, every person
that comes into this hospital...

1522
01:04:48,334 --> 01:04:51,102
Whether they have a
heart attack or a skin rash...

1523
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,271
Everybody's
worried about cancer.

1524
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,823
You don't have cancer.

1525
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:56,257
I swear to you.

1526
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,259
You do not have cancer.

1527
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:03,848
It's not cancer.

1528
01:05:03,883 --> 01:05:04,965
No.

1529
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,467
You have an ulcer

1530
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,069
which flared up today

1531
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,206
because you went to a
party and drank and smoked

1532
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,525
both of which

1533
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,928
you're going to have to quit.

1534
01:05:16,963 --> 01:05:18,941
Quit smoking and drinking?

1535
01:05:18,965 --> 01:05:20,464
Yeah, that's right.

1536
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,478
Quit smoking and drinking?

1537
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,742
What, are you kidding me?

1538
01:05:43,923 --> 01:05:47,591
Uh, we're going to have to get
some x rays on him right away.

1539
01:05:47,627 --> 01:05:48,804
Right away, Doctor.

1540
01:05:48,828 --> 01:05:51,062
How did this happen?

1541
01:05:51,097 --> 01:05:53,415
He fell out of his crib.

1542
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,049
Okay, okay.

1543
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:58,086
He fell out of his crib.

1544
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,484
And he, he was crying all
night, so I brought him here.

1545
01:06:01,508 --> 01:06:03,319
I bet he's been crying.
When did he fall?

1546
01:06:03,343 --> 01:06:05,843
I don't know. I don't
want to get into trouble.

1547
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,857
Ma'am, your son has multiple
contusions. He's not my son...

1548
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,292
Whatever, whatever
your relationship is.

1549
01:06:09,316 --> 01:06:12,067
I'm his baby-sitter.

1550
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:21,909
This child has been beaten.

1551
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:29,300
I'm going to call Children
and Family Services.

1552
01:06:29,336 --> 01:06:30,301
Please!

1553
01:06:30,337 --> 01:06:31,469
It's the law.

1554
01:06:31,504 --> 01:06:32,648
But I'll get into trouble!

1555
01:06:32,672 --> 01:06:34,322
Stay here.

1556
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,957
Yes, Doctor.

1557
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,299
I don't believe this.

1558
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,301
You want to make a guess

1559
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,703
on the diagnosis of this one?

1560
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,544
I burned my legs.

1561
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,597
I see.

1562
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:00,731
It's not funny.

1563
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,195
Um, well, if you'll just
come with me, Miss,

1564
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:03,684
I'll take your name.

1565
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,581
<i>You're a college student?</i>

1566
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:08,022
<i>Uh-huh. Sacred Heart.</i>

1567
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:09,673
And how'd this happen?

1568
01:07:09,709 --> 01:07:11,753
I was pouring some
hot water into the sink

1569
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,944
and it splashed onto my legs.

1570
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,948
Well, it's not bad...
Just first-degree burns.

1571
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:18,550
There's no blistering

1572
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:20,496
and there won't be any scarring.

1573
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,120
It's very sensitive skin.

1574
01:07:22,155 --> 01:07:23,621
Uh-huh.

1575
01:07:23,657 --> 01:07:25,423
Your touch is nice.

1576
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,841
This medication

1577
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,211
will make you feel a lot better.

1578
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,480
Your fingers are very long.

1579
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,098
Mm-hmm.

1580
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,267
Long and strong.

1581
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:37,969
Hmm.

1582
01:07:38,004 --> 01:07:40,938
I wanted to change first and
put on some new underpants.

1583
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,440
Hmm.

1584
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:45,960
I knew you'd be
seeing my underpants...

1585
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,645
and touching them.

1586
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:53,317
You're going to want to
keep these bandages very dry

1587
01:07:53,353 --> 01:07:55,086
for a day or so.

1588
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:57,299
Um, don't take any
showers or baths.

1589
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,040
Just, uh, sponge bath.

1590
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:01,359
Why is that nurse in the room?

1591
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,777
Hospital policy.

1592
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:06,809
Well, she's not doing anything.
She doesn't have to be here.

1593
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,384
Are you afraid of me?

1594
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:13,421
You're going to be
just fine in a few days.

1595
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:24,682
Thanks, Lydia.

1596
01:08:32,925 --> 01:08:34,425
Okay.

1597
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,106
After dinner?

1598
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:51,019
Yeah, right after dinner

1599
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,189
I... I, I felt this
little aching

1600
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,090
this burning, you know?

1601
01:08:55,114 --> 01:08:56,581
Low?

1602
01:08:56,616 --> 01:08:58,982
And you have an aneurysm?

1603
01:08:59,018 --> 01:09:02,753
Yeah. They're going to
operate on me next month.

1604
01:09:02,788 --> 01:09:05,723
Okay, Mr. Harvey,
uh, we're just waiting

1605
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:08,359
for your old film, so
you just rest easy.

1606
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,572
We'll have you
fixed up right away.

1607
01:09:09,596 --> 01:09:10,606
We'll take care of him, ma'am.

1608
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:11,907
Thank you, doctor.

1609
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:12,730
Okay, thank you.

1610
01:09:12,765 --> 01:09:14,343
This guy's leaking
blood into his belly.

1611
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,333
He could go any minute.

1612
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:17,000
Who's on the floor?

1613
01:09:17,036 --> 01:09:19,737
Ashley and Jimmy are
doing the appendectomy.

1614
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:21,505
Gill and Levine will be
another couple hours

1615
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:22,406
with the knife wound.

1616
01:09:22,442 --> 01:09:23,407
They pulled Ed and his intern

1617
01:09:23,443 --> 01:09:24,920
off the floor to do the
lady with the small bowel.

1618
01:09:24,944 --> 01:09:26,338
Where's the vascular team?

1619
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:27,328
They're in Minneapolis,
that conference.

1620
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:28,830
Right, okay, where's Baker?

1621
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:30,325
Baker's in the
Bahamas, with his family.

1622
01:09:30,349 --> 01:09:32,194
Well, this guy could die
any minute. We can't wait.

1623
01:09:32,218 --> 01:09:35,503
I know, but there's
no one to do him.

1624
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:40,207
Okay, okay. Um, call Morgenstern

1625
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:43,377
tell him to get over
here right away.

1626
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:46,180
I'm starting a
ruptured aneurysm.

1627
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:48,126
Peter, you can't.
You're just a resident.

1628
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,495
What do you want to
do? You want to wait?

1629
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,030
This guy could die while
we're out here discussing this.

1630
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:52,714
I know that, but...
I'm just trying

1631
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:54,316
to keep him alive until
Morgenstern shows up.

1632
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,406
That's all, okay?

1633
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:58,692
Now call the OR, get me a team

1634
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:00,077
and tell them

1635
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,647
to set up for a
laparotomy... please.

1636
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:06,084
Yes, this is Dr. Lewis.

1637
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:07,651
Get me Morgenstern.

1638
01:10:07,687 --> 01:10:09,153
Well, find him.

1639
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:12,123
We have a blown aortic
aneurysm, and Dr. Benton's starting.

1640
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:13,169
He'd like some help.

1641
01:10:13,193 --> 01:10:14,492
Yes, that's right.

1642
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,026
Dr. Benton's starting.

1643
01:10:18,398 --> 01:10:19,964
What's on?

1644
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:21,977
Ruptured abdominal aneurysm.

1645
01:10:22,001 --> 01:10:23,501
Who's doing it?

1646
01:10:23,536 --> 01:10:24,902
Dr. Benton.

1647
01:10:24,937 --> 01:10:26,437
Dr. Benton?

1648
01:10:32,712 --> 01:10:35,313
I'm doing anesthesia
for you, Peter.

1649
01:10:35,348 --> 01:10:37,915
Great. Listen, get
down to the blood bank.

1650
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:40,084
Make sure they send up 20 units.

1651
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,685
We need at least 20.

1652
01:10:41,721 --> 01:10:43,687
And get the nurses jumping.

1653
01:10:43,723 --> 01:10:45,289
Patient's on his way.

1654
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,169
You, uh... you sure
you're okay about this?

1655
01:10:47,193 --> 01:10:48,792
Ed, I'm scared as hell

1656
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,861
but the guy's already ruptured.

1657
01:10:50,896 --> 01:10:53,197
His belly's puffed
up like a balloon

1658
01:10:53,233 --> 01:10:55,666
and he's bleeding
to death internally.

1659
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:57,168
I got to do him.

1660
01:10:57,203 --> 01:10:58,702
I'm his only chance.

1661
01:11:22,629 --> 01:11:23,561
Good evening, gentlemen.

1662
01:11:23,596 --> 01:11:24,673
Just wanted to let you know

1663
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,347
I'll going to be starting

1664
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:29,684
a ruptured abdominal
aortic aneurysm in Room Two

1665
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:32,920
and I'd appreciate a hand
when you have a minute.

1666
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:37,592
What did he say?

1667
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,727
He said he's doing an aneurysm.

1668
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:42,163
Now, that's a joke, isn't it?

1669
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:45,032
Cheryl, go make
sure he's joking.

1670
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,359
Dr. Ashley, he's doing it.

1671
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,295
You're kidding.

1672
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:59,297
Jim, break and help him.

1673
01:11:59,332 --> 01:12:02,616
I'll finish here and get
there as soon as I can.

1674
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:11,041
Okay, boys and girls, let's go.

1675
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,027
This isn't a picnic.

1676
01:12:13,063 --> 01:12:15,797
This is the late, late show.

1677
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,281
Prep, please.

1678
01:12:17,316 --> 01:12:20,267
<i>Prep,</i> please. Come
on. Quit staring at me.

1679
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:22,753
Look, I'm just trying to keep
the poor guy alive, okay?

1680
01:12:22,788 --> 01:12:24,255
All right, plastic.

1681
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,257
Jimmy's coming in to help.

1682
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:27,508
Oh, great.

1683
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:29,510
The only guy in the hospital

1684
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,413
that knows less about
vascular surgery than I do.

1685
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:33,915
Okay, is Mr. Harvey happy?

1686
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,099
He isn't complaining.

1687
01:12:35,134 --> 01:12:36,466
All right, then let's do this.

1688
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:38,568
Knife, please. Thank you.

1689
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,939
Mark the start of the
operation at 2:13 A.M.

1690
01:12:41,974 --> 01:12:45,676
Let's see how long it's going
to take the Chief to get off

1691
01:12:45,711 --> 01:12:49,013
of his girlfriend and
into his work clothes.

1692
01:12:49,048 --> 01:12:50,714
Ah, yes, nice and smooth.

1693
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,566
Started without you, Jimmy.

1694
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:54,702
There you go, sir.

1695
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:55,886
Okay, now listen up.

1696
01:12:55,922 --> 01:12:57,750
We're going straight down
the linea alba... nothing fancy.

1697
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:59,289
The guy's got

1698
01:12:59,325 --> 01:13:00,958
a 50% mortality anyway.

1699
01:13:00,994 --> 01:13:02,577
All right. Suction.
Let's get that.

1700
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:04,378
Thank you for all
the good it will do.

1701
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:05,329
Pick up. Pick up.

1702
01:13:05,365 --> 01:13:06,976
Come on, Jimmy. Work with me.

1703
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,227
Pick up.

1704
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:10,801
There's a lot of
blood in there, Peter.

1705
01:13:10,837 --> 01:13:12,870
That's precisely his problem.

1706
01:13:12,905 --> 01:13:15,139
Okay. Here we go.

1707
01:13:15,174 --> 01:13:16,640
Wish me luck.

1708
01:13:16,675 --> 01:13:18,175
Knife.

1709
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:23,997
Whoa!

1710
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:28,703
Systolic's holding at 100.

1711
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:33,407
Mother. Okay,<i> now.</i>

1712
01:13:48,207 --> 01:13:49,907
I can't find it.

1713
01:13:49,942 --> 01:13:52,042
Damn it!

1714
01:13:52,078 --> 01:13:54,011
There... no.

1715
01:13:54,046 --> 01:13:55,563
No.

1716
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,898
Jimmy, get your hand in there

1717
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,251
and push away
the small intestine.

1718
01:14:00,303 --> 01:14:02,870
Come on, little
leak, where are you?

1719
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:04,488
How bad's his pressure?

1720
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,190
You won't like it.

1721
01:14:06,225 --> 01:14:07,586
<i>I</i> won't like it? Uh-uh.

1722
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,360
Think about him.

1723
01:14:09,395 --> 01:14:11,624
Carol, hang six more
units packed cells

1724
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:15,699
and a unit of fresh-frozen
plasma and platelets.

1725
01:14:15,735 --> 01:14:17,768
Wait a minute.

1726
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,588
It's too much to hope, huh?

1727
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:24,425
I got it. Yeah, yeah.

1728
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:25,493
I got it.

1729
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:26,944
Time down. Call
it out in minutes.

1730
01:14:26,979 --> 01:14:28,924
Let's suck this field clean

1731
01:14:28,948 --> 01:14:30,476
so we can see what
the hell we're doing.

1732
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,749
I got it.

1733
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,879
Dr. Benton, the Chief
Resident is on his way.

1734
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,986
Well, suck that field clean.

1735
01:14:36,022 --> 01:14:37,955
We got the Chief coming.

1736
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:40,657
We don't want him
to think we don't know

1737
01:14:40,692 --> 01:14:42,059
what we're doing here, huh?

1738
01:14:42,094 --> 01:14:43,560
Pressure?

1739
01:14:43,596 --> 01:14:45,929
100/70 and falling.

1740
01:14:45,965 --> 01:14:47,743
Okay, I'm not
going to sweat that.

1741
01:14:47,767 --> 01:14:49,344
Let's just keep
that blood going in.

1742
01:14:49,368 --> 01:14:50,718
Jimmy, what's the matter?

1743
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:52,419
Your hands are trembling.

1744
01:14:52,455 --> 01:14:53,788
I can't imagine why.

1745
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,289
Yeah, well, me neither.

1746
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,891
Everything's cool here.

1747
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:59,226
All we have to
do is sit and wait.

1748
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:03,263
Dr. Benton, Dr. Ashley will
be with you as soon as he can.

1749
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:06,767
All of the sudden, I got
all the help I want, huh?

1750
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:09,304
Okay.

1751
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:18,529
Start a nitroglycerine drip...

1752
01:15:18,564 --> 01:15:21,798
50 in 250 D5W,
80 of lasix, IV push.

1753
01:15:21,834 --> 01:15:24,401
Get a CBC, 'lytes,
cardiac enzyme

1754
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:27,338
chest x ray and a 12-lead EKG.

1755
01:15:27,373 --> 01:15:29,173
Do you take digitalis, dear?

1756
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:30,841
Have you taken any today?

1757
01:15:30,876 --> 01:15:32,009
No.

1758
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:33,177
This morning?

1759
01:15:33,212 --> 01:15:34,845
Add a dig level.

1760
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,449
Meanwhile, three milligrams
of morphine, IV Push.

1761
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:44,171
I can't give this up.

1762
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,792
No, no, no, not
you. You're fine.

1763
01:15:47,827 --> 01:15:50,428
Dr. Greene, your wife on 2204.

1764
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,863
Yeah, I'll have
to call her back.

1765
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,704
Sure taking a long time
getting in here, huh?

1766
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:23,977
They've been out there
scrubbing for the last month.

1767
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:25,763
You know, it's times like these

1768
01:16:25,798 --> 01:16:27,931
when I get into
a reflective mood

1769
01:16:27,967 --> 01:16:30,534
and I pause and think
of how wonderful...

1770
01:16:30,569 --> 01:16:33,203
Good morning, Peter.
Give it to me quick.

1771
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:34,716
57-year-old white
male in good health

1772
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,007
previously seen at this
hospital eight weeks ago

1773
01:16:37,043 --> 01:16:40,210
when he was found to have
a pulsatile abdominal mass

1774
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:42,663
with aortic
calcification on x ray.

1775
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,399
Elective surgery was
scheduled for next month,

1776
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,900
but this evening

1777
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,270
he was complaining of
severe intermittent pain

1778
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:50,120
in the mid-back.

1779
01:16:50,156 --> 01:16:51,533
By the time he
got to the hospital,

1780
01:16:51,557 --> 01:16:53,535
he had a distended
abdomen, peritoneal irritation

1781
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:54,858
and reduced hematocrit.

1782
01:16:54,894 --> 01:16:56,160
So, you decided to open him up.

1783
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,438
That's one of the
ugliest incisions

1784
01:16:57,462 --> 01:16:58,679
I've seen in a long time.

1785
01:16:58,714 --> 01:16:59,963
A good veterinarian

1786
01:16:59,998 --> 01:17:02,483
would do a better
skin cut than that.

1787
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:04,968
All right, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

1788
01:17:05,004 --> 01:17:06,404
Okay.

1789
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:07,905
Mm-hmm.

1790
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,407
Got it.

1791
01:17:09,442 --> 01:17:11,074
What's his pressure?

1792
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:14,345
90/65, and he's gotten 12 units.

1793
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:18,148
Okay, we'll take over from here,
try to make something out of it.

1794
01:17:18,183 --> 01:17:20,150
Hey, humor me, will you?

1795
01:17:20,185 --> 01:17:21,425
Have some dopamine standing by.

1796
01:17:21,454 --> 01:17:22,336
Hoover that, will you?

1797
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:24,016
Proximal, then, uh, secondary?

1798
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,373
Sounds like a plan.

1799
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,843
Good. Give me a little
more room in there.

1800
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:30,272
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

1801
01:17:30,296 --> 01:17:31,828
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1802
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:34,097
Look at that. Mm-hmm.

1803
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,936
Peter?

1804
01:17:38,971 --> 01:17:40,454
You did a good job.

1805
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,023
You were lucky as hell

1806
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,940
but you were right
to open him up.

1807
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:46,059
Good work.

1808
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:47,745
Clear it out a little bit.

1809
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:49,213
Let me see if I can...

1810
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,293
pull it up for a second.

1811
01:17:51,317 --> 01:17:54,018
That's what we want right there.

1812
01:17:54,053 --> 01:17:56,586
That's right. Pull this up.

1813
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:20,360
Shh, shh, shh.

1814
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:22,407
Why is he still crying?

1815
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:25,266
Why haven't you
given him something?

1816
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:29,854
Look, he's still crying.

1817
01:18:29,889 --> 01:18:32,205
Why aren't you
giving him something?

1818
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,024
I can't give him anything

1819
01:18:34,059 --> 01:18:36,527
until I know the
extent of his injuries.

1820
01:18:36,562 --> 01:18:37,861
He's been to x ray

1821
01:18:37,896 --> 01:18:40,030
so we know he
has a skull fracture.

1822
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:41,543
A skull fracture?
The baby-sitter.

1823
01:18:41,567 --> 01:18:43,166
I never trusted her...

1824
01:18:43,202 --> 01:18:46,170
Ma'am, your child has multiple
contusions that are at least

1825
01:18:46,205 --> 01:18:47,504
12 hours old.

1826
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:49,372
He has a skull fracture.

1827
01:18:49,408 --> 01:18:52,075
He also has several
old healed fractures.

1828
01:18:52,111 --> 01:18:53,743
He's a battered child.

1829
01:18:53,779 --> 01:18:55,590
I'm not even going
to respond to that.

1830
01:18:55,614 --> 01:18:57,314
You think I'd harm my child?

1831
01:18:57,349 --> 01:18:58,982
Happens all the time.

1832
01:18:59,018 --> 01:19:02,319
Look, if you're not going to
treat him, I'm taking him home.

1833
01:19:02,354 --> 01:19:05,339
No, you're not. Do you
have anything to say?

1834
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:07,590
He's my date.

1835
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:15,165
Look, um... I can assure
you, whoever you are...

1836
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,067
Ross, Dr. Ross.

1837
01:19:17,102 --> 01:19:20,103
Well, Dr. Ross, let me tell you

1838
01:19:20,138 --> 01:19:22,972
your concerns are
unfounded, okay?

1839
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:26,510
How did he burn his legs?

1840
01:19:26,545 --> 01:19:27,344
What?

1841
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,513
These marks right
here on his legs?

1842
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:32,466
Those. Those are
healed burn scars.

1843
01:19:32,502 --> 01:19:34,184
How did<i> that</i> happen?

1844
01:19:34,219 --> 01:19:36,053
He... I...

1845
01:19:36,088 --> 01:19:38,856
I don't know anything
about burns on the legs.

1846
01:19:38,891 --> 01:19:41,559
I'm beginning to think
you're making this up

1847
01:19:41,594 --> 01:19:43,360
is what I'm thinking.

1848
01:19:43,396 --> 01:19:45,696
Ma'am, you may
want to call an attorney.

1849
01:19:45,731 --> 01:19:46,763
I<i> am</i> an attorney.

1850
01:19:46,799 --> 01:19:48,009
Well, then I'm sure you'll know

1851
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,278
how the Department of
Child Services will handle this.

1852
01:19:49,302 --> 01:19:50,834
How dare you speak...

1853
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:54,004
How dare you treat
your child like this!

1854
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,506
He's a little kid.

1855
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,809
I try to be
understanding in my job

1856
01:19:58,844 --> 01:20:01,579
but, lady, this just stinks.

1857
01:20:11,424 --> 01:20:14,208
Did you find the chart
on the patient in six?

1858
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:15,842
I don't know where it is.

1859
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:17,022
Well, find it.

1860
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:18,745
Well, I don't know where it is.

1861
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,592
Do you think that I am deaf?

1862
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:22,716
I heard you. Now
find me the chart!

1863
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,319
I told you I don't
know where it is!

1864
01:20:31,277 --> 01:20:33,042
Is it okay?

1865
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,544
You can go home now.

1866
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,212
You did the right thing.

1867
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,148
I mean, is the baby okay?

1868
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:41,835
He will be.

1869
01:20:51,496 --> 01:20:53,530
Oh, man...

1870
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:57,968
So how's Hathaway?

1871
01:20:58,003 --> 01:21:00,537
It doesn't look good.

1872
01:21:00,573 --> 01:21:02,539
They contact her family?

1873
01:21:02,575 --> 01:21:06,076
Yeah. They found them.

1874
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:09,880
So, how'd your
aortic aneurysm go?

1875
01:21:09,915 --> 01:21:12,399
Morgenstern showed.

1876
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,367
Dr. Benton to Trauma One.

1877
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,369
Dr. Benton to Trauma One.

1878
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:20,891
Well, no rest for the wicked.

1879
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:26,914
Gary, Perez, let's go.

1880
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:28,348
What's the problem?

1881
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,361
We picked him up in Old Town.

1882
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,863
Orderly.

1883
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,681
He was standing,
blocking traffic.

1884
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:36,924
But he's got that smell,
so I thought I'd check.

1885
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:38,926
Yeah, you did the right thing.

1886
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:40,928
We got a diabetic ketoacidosis.

1887
01:21:40,963 --> 01:21:42,495
Let's go.

1888
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:44,764
You probably saved his life.

1889
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:50,371
What do you want, a medal?

1890
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:55,459
Give him ten units
regular insulin, IV push.

1891
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,894
Start a drip, ten
units per hour.

1892
01:21:57,929 --> 01:21:59,541
I want him hydrated
as soon as possible

1893
01:21:59,565 --> 01:22:00,397
with normal saline.

1894
01:22:00,432 --> 01:22:01,698
You want KCL?

1895
01:22:01,733 --> 01:22:03,534
Not on your life or his.

1896
01:22:03,569 --> 01:22:05,202
Get a CBC and 'lytes.

1897
01:22:05,237 --> 01:22:07,204
Call me with the potassium

1898
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:08,705
and get a blood gas too.

1899
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:11,341
Mark, did you get the
message your wife called?

1900
01:22:11,377 --> 01:22:12,709
No.

1901
01:22:15,714 --> 01:22:18,114
I'll call her in the morning.

1902
01:22:18,884 --> 01:22:21,402
Hello, Mrs. Harvey.

1903
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:25,239
Okay, let's have a look here.

1904
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:34,714
He seems to be
doing just fine, ma'am.

1905
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,549
Oh, I'm so grateful.

1906
01:22:36,585 --> 01:22:38,752
Dr. Morgenstern came so quickly.

1907
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:40,521
He saved his life.

1908
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:44,691
Yes. Uh... well, Dr. Morgenstern
is a wonderful surgeon, ma'am.

1909
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:48,495
He said you did a lot too.

1910
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:52,732
Well, actually, I just helped
out a little bit, that's all.

1911
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:55,452
I'll, uh, I'll check
on you later, okay?

1912
01:23:15,474 --> 01:23:18,742
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1913
01:23:25,784 --> 01:23:27,951
You want some coffee?

1914
01:23:29,955 --> 01:23:31,622
Sure.

1915
01:23:39,965 --> 01:23:42,715
Hey, I wouldn't
kid you about that.

1916
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,384
I had a few.

1917
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,286
Maybe more than a few.

1918
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:47,654
Uh-huh.

1919
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,822
Hell of a party, though.

1920
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:55,962
Okay, Mr. Murphy, you are done.

1921
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,464
Already?

1922
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:58,965
Oh, yeah?

1923
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,201
I didn't feel a thing.

1924
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:03,303
No, I didn't.

1925
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,904
I still don't.

1926
01:24:07,843 --> 01:24:12,212
$24,000... more than
$24,000... that's what it cost

1927
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:15,248
and I want to know
where doctors get off

1928
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:17,150
charging money like that.

1929
01:24:17,186 --> 01:24:20,520
Medical costs
certainly are on the rise.

1930
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:24,358
That's why we're going to
have national health insurance.

1931
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,960
Well, I think it's a scandal.

1932
01:24:26,996 --> 01:24:30,163
I think doctors should be
ashamed of themselves.

1933
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:31,809
Many of them are, I'm sure.

1934
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,934
Let's hear what you
folks out there think.

1935
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:35,468
You know the number. Call us.

1936
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:37,182
This is Paul Barker
on<i> Nightlines.</i>

1937
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:38,821
We'll be back in just a minute.

1938
01:24:40,793 --> 01:24:41,803
That's it? Anybody else?

1939
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:45,128
Well, actually, I
got a little problem.

1940
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,030
My throat's acting up.

1941
01:24:47,066 --> 01:24:49,283
You need to see a doctor.

1942
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:50,767
Which room?

1943
01:24:50,802 --> 01:24:52,602
Five and six are open.

1944
01:24:52,637 --> 01:24:53,971
Five.

1945
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:14,807
So is that it?

1946
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:16,488
Well, if you could
take a look at my throat.

1947
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:17,655
I've got a little soreness...

1948
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,313
I'll be down in room
eight. You got a pen?

1949
01:25:20,349 --> 01:25:21,814
Wake me at 6:30.

1950
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,133
That gives you almost

1951
01:25:23,168 --> 01:25:25,852
an hour and a
half. You're lucky.

1952
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:53,563
6:30, Dr. Greene.

1953
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:03,172
Wow.

1954
