1
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,050
Hut-hut-hut, hike.

2
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,122
Button-hook at
the manhole cover.

3
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:23,325
Boom.

4
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:24,528
Ooh!

5
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:25,675
Montana to Rice.

6
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,201
Ho!

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,004
They're on different teams.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,253
Since when?

9
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:32,713
You and I watched
their last game at Carol's.

10
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:33,894
But that was way back. I'll say.

11
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:34,885
Go long.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,887
Me go long?

13
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:36,889
I'm out of shape.

14
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:37,926
You go long.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,927
I'll go long.

16
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:39,762
All right.

17
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:41,165
Doug...

18
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:43,086
Too far for the Ivy League arm?

19
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:44,123
Car!

20
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,321
Hey, you butthead!

21
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:52,408
What, are you out of your mind?!

22
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:53,711
Not another one.

23
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:55,114
Go get a gurney, Doug.

24
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,892
I'm not playing catch
with you anymore.

25
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,913
Nice of his buddies
to drop him off.

26
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,284
What are friends for?

27
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:06,424
Dr. Ross, three-month-old
seizing in One. Temp's 105.

28
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,760
I got him, Doug. Go.

29
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,831
Is Dr. Benton... Oh!

30
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:12,036
Give her three more of morphine.

31
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,173
Make it five.

32
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,955
Call X ray down here stat.

33
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:16,414
Susan, I need you in here.

34
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:17,483
Okay.

35
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:19,287
Come on, Carter, move, move.

36
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:20,935
Please, Petey. Oh, it hurts.

37
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,260
Okay, Ma. Okay, Ma.

38
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,463
Listen, all right.

39
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,413
Get an X ray of the right
hip, chest and pelvis now.

40
00:01:25,437 --> 00:01:26,670
What about a C-spine?

41
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,620
Carter, come on, get the
hell out of here, all right?

42
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,078
Carter, come with me.

43
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:31,359
X-ray tech's on his way.

44
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,895
Pulse thready and weak.
He's bleeding somewhere.

45
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:33,954
What do you got?

46
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,569
Multiple trauma. Gown up.

47
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:37,462
O2, 15 liters.
Start a flow sheet.

48
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,643
What's Benton doing?

49
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,911
His mom broke her hip.

50
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:41,171
That's bad at her age.

51
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,239
B.P.'S low, 60/30.

52
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,211
CBC, type and cross eight units.

53
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:45,648
Run the saline wide open.

54
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:47,296
Carter, Deb, guy's out of it.

55
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,555
Primary survey's done.

56
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,723
Now what do you get?

57
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:50,758
Uh... get a C.T.?

58
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:52,930
Narcan 0.8.

59
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,735
And then you got to get the...

60
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,937
Glucose 85.

61
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:58,711
Get smart, nurses,
and nod sagely.

62
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:00,582
Get her another
five of morphine,

63
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:04,123
CBC, Chem seven, U.A.,
EKG, hip, chest and pelvis.

64
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,326
Move. Come on.

65
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:06,479
No, no, no.

66
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:07,849
Don't take it off.

67
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,531
Somebody call the
chief of orthopedics,

68
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:10,789
tell him to get off his ass

69
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:11,874
and get down here now!

70
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,990
We need to undress
you, Mrs. Benton.

71
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,315
Please, not in front of Petey.

72
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,318
Peter?

73
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:17,487
Peter...

74
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:18,540
What?

75
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,577
She doesn't want to be naked

76
00:02:20,612 --> 00:02:22,047
in front of her son.

77
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,450
Okay. All right, Ma.

78
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:26,308
Um... all right, I'll
be outside, okay?

79
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,215
Here's the blood lab...

80
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,853
I'll be right out here.

81
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,736
He's going down the tubes.

82
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:39,816
Can I intubate?

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,808
Not this time.

84
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,344
It could be a neck fracture.

85
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,747
Always look everywhere.

86
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,750
We'll roll him.

87
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:45,752
I got his head.

88
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:46,789
Ready, and now.

89
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:49,310
There we go.

90
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:51,716
Single gunshot wound. And back.

91
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,070
Heart's racing, 180.

92
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,166
He barely has a pulse.

93
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,211
Put the blood on a pressure bag.

94
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,643
No pulse. He's arrested.

95
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,871
All right. Carter,
take over. CPR.

96
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:03,877
We got to crack his chest.

97
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:05,414
I got it.

98
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,519
Thoracotomy tray.

99
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,693
We do a thoracotomy when?

100
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:13,432
A penetrating
trauma and full arrest?

101
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:15,471
Exactamundo.

102
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:18,009
I need the rib spreader.

103
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,841
We have towels, scalpel.

104
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:22,420
Move your hands, Carter.

105
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,025
Put the blood on the pump.

106
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,116
There we go.

107
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,350
Rib spreader.

108
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:32,810
I'm in.

109
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,197
Pericardium's dry.

110
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:37,856
Aorta... Statinsky.

111
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,159
Is the O.R. team on alert?

112
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:41,280
They just finished
that perfed appy.

113
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:42,350
Suction.

114
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:44,850
Tell them they got
another customer.

115
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:45,857
There it is.

116
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,860
Nice save, Mike.

117
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,737
We got a faint pulse. Let's go.

118
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,188
I got to get home.
I'm on tonight.

119
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,572
I'll have the place
emptied out for you.

120
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:56,009
Deal. You taking the El home?

121
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:56,999
Yeah.

122
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:58,079
Hang on a sec, I'll go with you.

123
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,105
Lily, I'm back tonight.

124
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,541
Could you finish
the nurse's notes?

125
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:01,544
Sure. Bye.

126
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,058
Who the hell
stat-paged me down here

127
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:05,195
for some old lady
with a broken hip?

128
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,801
Hey, Peter... Dr. Wilson,
I'm Dr. Benton.

129
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:09,695
Pulled me out of a damn
department head meeting.

130
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,100
This is my mother and,
well, she broke her hip, sir.

131
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,281
That she did, Dr. Benton.

132
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,654
All right, Blair, put her
on your O.R. schedule.

133
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:17,881
No, no, no. Sir, I want
<i>you</i> to do the surgery.

134
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,496
E.R. admits go
to the teaching...

135
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,490
I don't want a resident
operating on her.

136
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,492
She's my mother.

137
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:23,673
I'll scrub in.

138
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:24,698
So does that mean you're

139
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,300
going to be the one
holding the knife?

140
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,704
All right, I want
to scrub in, too.

141
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:28,706
I'll be in there.

142
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:29,708
That's not good enough, sir.

143
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:30,872
Now, look, I know
this is your mother,

144
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,532
but you are way
over the line, son.

145
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:40,950
I'll page you when we're done.

146
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,905
Now back off.

147
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:38,799
So... you tried to sand it off?

148
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:40,571
Isn't that what you do?

149
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,444
Yeah, but we don't
use a power sander.

150
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:44,847
Hmm.

151
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:46,596
Mr. Longet is a diabetic

152
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,291
as well as an
amateur dermatologist.

153
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:52,331
Vera didn't want me
just crossing it out.

154
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,370
Well, uh... one gram of Ancef,

155
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:55,739
update his tetanus,

156
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,855
and get Plastics to see him.

157
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,948
They may have to do a graft.

158
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,989
Ah. Maybe you can
move that serpent head.

159
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:05,059
Onto the body of a goddess?

160
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:07,064
I'll be right back.

161
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:10,384
Did you eat lunch?

162
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,012
Nah. The cafeteria
was already closed.

163
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:14,181
Voila.

164
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:15,351
Thank you.

165
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:16,520
Hey, word's out

166
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:18,692
you're going to be
an E.R. attending.

167
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:19,795
Congratulations.

168
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,141
Well, it's not a lock.

169
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:22,467
Can I borrow your pen?

170
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:24,270
Yeah. A lifetime of this, huh?

171
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:26,053
Well, you know, E.R.'S great.

172
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:27,323
Your free time's your own.

173
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:28,381
What free time?

174
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,995
Well, after your residency.

175
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,590
You get skilled in every
aspect of medicine,

176
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,093
you see a variety of cases,

177
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:37,369
you have an immediate
effect upon your patients' lives.

178
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:39,874
But, mainly, it's like
joining the circus.

179
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:21,586
I'm telling you, the
opening goes in the back.

180
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,190
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

181
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,106
Oh, my God, I'm big as a house.

182
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,131
Hi.

183
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,603
Hi. Hi.

184
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:29,872
I'm Dr. Mark Greene.

185
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,007
Sean O'Brian.

186
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:32,155
I'm Jodi.

187
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,383
Jodi, why don't you
hop up on that bed?

188
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:36,332
I don't think I can
hop anywhere.

189
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,359
Okay. Easy.

190
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:40,464
All right. What seems
to be the problem?

191
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:42,401
Our baby's due in two weeks,

192
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,873
and I have to pee
every 30 seconds.

193
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:47,078
It burns, and my stomach hurts.

194
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,715
Sounds like a bladder infection.

195
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,718
Does this hurt?

196
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:51,505
No. Just don't push too hard.

197
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,640
I got to go again.

198
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,763
Okay.

199
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,173
36 minus four.

200
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,948
Baby's about five or six pounds.

201
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:07,658
Do you have any
other medical problems?

202
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:08,795
No. No.

203
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,964
Oh...

204
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,212
Is that cold?

205
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,303
Yes.

206
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,942
I'll just take a
quick listen here.

207
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,780
I love that sound.

208
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:17,848
That's great.

209
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,469
That's great.

210
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:20,672
Any, uh... cramping?

211
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:22,076
Any vaginal bleeding?

212
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:24,080
No.

213
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:26,335
You can feel the baby move?

214
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:27,938
Uh-huh.

215
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,777
Think you can give me

216
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:30,845
a urine sample?

217
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:31,948
Are you kidding?

218
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:32,817
No.

219
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,456
Yes, I think I can do that.

220
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,599
Okay, I want you
to follow my finger

221
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:40,935
with just your eyes.

222
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:48,519
Good. Okay, now squeeze
your eyes tight like this.

223
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:52,545
Mm-hmm.

224
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,684
Great. Okay, press
against my hand

225
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,337
with your face.

226
00:08:58,445 --> 00:08:59,562
Great. Okay.

227
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:01,133
Show me your teeth.

228
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:12,040
Is Grandma ever going
to be able to walk again?

229
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:14,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's going to be fine.

230
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,724
I know what you're
thinking, Jackie,

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,765
so why don't you just
go ahead and say it?

232
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,135
Shut up, Peter.

233
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,708
No, no. Go ahead and say it.

234
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:28,656
I mean, it's my fault

235
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,051
that this happened, right?

236
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:34,392
I'm so pigheaded
and self-centered.

237
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:37,666
Peter... just shut
up and sit down.

238
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:51,530
B.P.'s 90 over 60.

239
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,104
Found him in the greenhouse...
Passed out in the back.

240
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,517
Comes to visit me
at my place of work,

241
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,456
and this is the
shape that he's in?

242
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,148
Hydrate with a liter of saline.

243
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:01,431
You're going to go
where I tell you to go.

244
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,002
I am not losing another son

245
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:04,160
to alcohol and drugs.

246
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,229
I am not!

247
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:08,587
38 weeks, but I
think her dates are off.

248
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:10,224
Baby's small on exam.

249
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:12,295
Initial B.P. is 130/90

250
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,266
but, over a couple of hours,

251
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:17,173
B.P.'S been fine...
Around 120/80.

252
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,946
FHT's normal, no
cramps or spotting.

253
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:21,695
Got your test results.

254
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,058
U.A. shows white cells
too numerous to count,

255
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:26,962
bacteria two plus protein,

256
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:28,667
CBC's normal, no fever.

257
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:29,780
Simple cystitis.

258
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:30,883
Fluids, rest

259
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:32,269
and a course of bactrim.

260
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:33,761
It's a bladder infection.

261
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:36,502
Who are they?

262
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:38,155
Med students.

263
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,491
They're so young.

264
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:42,197
I know. It's
disgusting, isn't it?

265
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,486
Near term, antibiotic of choice

266
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:46,875
is Macrodantin, okay?

267
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,550
Now, I want you to take these...

268
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,521
lots of fluids,
rest, and follow up

269
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:54,326
with your doctor in the morning.

270
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,596
Okay?

271
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,303
The sulfas compete
with the bilirubin

272
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,475
for the binding
sites on albumen,

273
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,249
increasing the risk
of neonatal jaundice.

274
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:05,985
He saves lives, he teaches,

275
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,489
he slices and dices...

276
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,092
Listen, Deb, can you work up

277
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,496
a "weak and dizzy"
in Three for me?

278
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:11,732
Uh... Doctors?

279
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:14,088
Would you sign a get-well card?

280
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,758
Sure.

281
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:18,998
Who is this for?

282
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:20,553
Me.

283
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:22,574
What is it?

284
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:23,910
Hemorrhoids.

285
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,380
Yeah, that's right there.

286
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:26,895
Dr. Ross, kid's crashing.

287
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,353
What? Here.

288
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,599
His pulse is down to 40.

289
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:34,781
Pupils are pinpoint.

290
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:35,849
Haleh, get a B.P.

291
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:37,319
He's frothing at the mouth.

292
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,477
Is it drugs?

293
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:39,824
Something else is going
on. He's incontinent.

294
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:41,049
Negative drug screen.

295
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:42,113
B.P. 70/50.

296
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:43,317
Where do you work?

297
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:44,720
Wrigleyville Nursery.

298
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,211
Nursery, as in school?

299
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,481
No, like in plants.

300
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:48,483
Outside, or in the office?

301
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,486
Both.

302
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:51,874
Mig of atropine, I.V. push.

303
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,027
Take off his clothes.

304
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,130
Wear gloves.

305
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:55,199
Let's start a drip,

306
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,236
milligram an hour,

307
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,939
2-pam, one gram over 30 minutes.

308
00:11:57,974 --> 00:11:59,174
What's wrong with him?

309
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,355
It's insecticide poisoning.

310
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,560
What kind of
chemicals do you carry?

311
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:03,919
I don't know. We use everything.

312
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:05,940
We were spraying in the
greenhouse this morning.

313
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,790
Is he going to be
all right? I think so.

314
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,417
I'm going to call the nursery.

315
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:13,636
What do you have?

316
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,228
Elderly man with hemorrhoids.

317
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:16,476
Oh, yuck.

318
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,103
Everyone is so old
and sick around here.

319
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,785
Yeah. This is a hospital.

320
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,854
Yeah, I guess.

321
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:22,923
Where's Benton?

322
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:24,516
He's in surgery
with his mom. Hey.

323
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:25,630
Hi, guys.

324
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:26,787
You working graveyard?

325
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:27,790
Yep.

326
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:28,904
7:00 p.m., no Benton.

327
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:30,975
Maybe I'll get home
by 8:00 for once.

328
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,066
Somebody help me!

329
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:33,950
My wife's
unconscious in the car!

330
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:35,041
Dr. Greene!

331
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,345
Please, somebody help me!

332
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,418
She's pregnant! Hurry!

333
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:41,221
She just passed out!

334
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,610
Okay, fine.

335
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:15,116
Freeze right there!

336
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,555
It's my mother; I
want to scrub in.

337
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,027
Well, you take one more step,

338
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:23,268
and I will have your
ass hanging on my wall

339
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,707
right next to your residency.

340
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:26,943
I want to help.

341
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:28,864
Don't test me.

342
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:32,188
Out!

343
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:34,538
Now divide the iliotibial tract.

344
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:36,666
Hemostat.

345
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:52,335
Watch her airway.

346
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,604
Charging 50 amps.

347
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,274
Get a stat B.P.

348
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,510
She looks postictal.

349
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,259
How much O2 do you
want? 15 liters by mask.

350
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:00,086
Oh, my God. What's going on?

351
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:02,157
Carter, help Mr. O'Brian.

352
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:04,697
Mr. O'Brian, we really
need to work here.

353
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,947
B.P.'s high. 160/110.

354
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,282
You okay, babe? Here's a vein.

355
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,159
We got a second I.V.

356
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:11,674
Do you need bloods?

357
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:13,011
She's eclamptic.

358
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,001
Mag sulfate, four grams I.V.

359
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,003
I'm right here, baby.

360
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,005
Get your coffee yet?

361
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,253
Do you need bloods?

362
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:19,413
Yeah, she needs a
chem 24, a coag panel

363
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:21,095
and put her on a fetal monitor.

364
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:24,008
Cap refill's fair.

365
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:26,130
Mr. O'Brian?

366
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:26,948
Yeah.

367
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:28,350
Your wife has eclampsia.

368
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:29,703
Is she going to die?

369
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:32,042
No, no. We just need to get
her admitted and medicated...

370
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:32,878
She's seizing!

371
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,560
Carter, grab a bite block.

372
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:35,550
Is that mag in?

373
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,553
I got it.

374
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,023
Restrain her.

375
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,238
Somebody do something!
Somebody help her!

376
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:40,930
Help her.

377
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:46,259
Push another
four of mag sulfate.

378
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:47,946
Baby, you're going to be okay.

379
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:49,628
Another four mag.

380
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:50,953
I.V.'s out.

381
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:52,456
The other one's blown.

382
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,595
I'll thrown in an
external jugular.

383
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,134
Two migs of Ativan.

384
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,439
Where's the prep pad?

385
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:00,776
Restrain her.

386
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:03,983
Ativan's in.

387
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:10,732
All right, restrain her.

388
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,772
It's in.

389
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:15,142
You got her? Sort of.

390
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:18,165
Two Ativan.

391
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,437
O2, 15 liters.

392
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:27,036
Okay, seizure's stopping.

393
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:30,455
All right. Let's
hyperventilate her.

394
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,126
Get doptones. Grab the ambu.

395
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,797
I'll do a quick pelvic.

396
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:35,634
Let's get a blood gas.

397
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:37,493
Lift up this leg.

398
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:43,140
Fetal heart tones strong at 140.

399
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,576
That's good news.

400
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:45,740
Running 30cc's of saline.

401
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,911
Two centimeters
dilated, 80% effaced.

402
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:49,404
Membrane's intact.

403
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,844
Call upstairs, see
who's on call for O.B.

404
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:54,433
Doctor, what the
hell is going on?

405
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,648
Your wife has a
disorder of late pregnancy

406
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:57,851
known as eclampsia.

407
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,755
The blood vessels go into spasm,

408
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,028
causing a lack of
oxygen to the brain,

409
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:03,698
which leads to the seizures.

410
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:06,004
We're relaxing them
with this medicine.

411
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:07,262
What about the baby?

412
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:08,609
We'll need to deliver.

413
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,600
When?

414
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,670
Soon.

415
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,992
Very soon.

416
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:14,495
So who's in Trauma One?

417
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,434
30-year-old pregnant woman
with an eclamptic seizure.

418
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,075
She's postictal, but
she's coming around.

419
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,322
B.P.'s stabilized? Mm-hmm.

420
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,591
Mag sulfate going? Mm-hmm.

421
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,861
Okay, well, I'll take
over. Go home.

422
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,765
Nah, that's all right. I'd like
to see her through to O.B.

423
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,091
I can handle it.

424
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,438
No, it's not about you. It's me.

425
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,777
I saw her earlier, and
I diagnosed a U.T.I.

426
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:31,879
I sent her out,

427
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:34,102
and she seized
in the parking lot.

428
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,311
Oops. I thought the
protein in her urine

429
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,815
was due to cystitis,

430
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:39,731
and I blew off
one borderline B.P.

431
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:42,126
I'd feel better if I
saw her through.

432
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,177
Yeah.

433
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,605
Fundal placenta.

434
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,275
Looks okay.

435
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:52,316
B.P. 120/70. That's very nice.

436
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,525
Look at little Hunter.

437
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,706
Dermot.

438
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,841
Jason.

439
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:00,011
Patrick.

440
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,015
Is that a boy, or what?

441
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,775
Four plus turtle sign.

442
00:17:03,811 --> 00:17:04,777
What's that?

443
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:06,614
He looks like a little head

444
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,803
kind of peeking out.

445
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,075
You give a score

446
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,063
of zero or two

447
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,566
for each category.

448
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,903
Movement?

449
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,473
He seems very active.

450
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:19,645
Every night, around
the same time.

451
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,649
Okay. Score two.

452
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:24,622
Also breathing tone,
amount of fluid...

453
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:25,960
He's an eight.

454
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,329
Anything less

455
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,111
than a six, and you worry.

456
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,854
You do the A.F.I.

457
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,340
Yeah.

458
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:36,349
You divide the
abdomen into four.

459
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:37,720
Okay.

460
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,247
Find the deepest
pockets of fluid

461
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:45,420
without fetal parts
or umbilical cord.

462
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,169
You mark each corner

463
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,596
of the quadrant, measure,

464
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:50,899
then add up.

465
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,014
Is that what

466
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,149
this number is over here?

467
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,742
No. That's

468
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:55,806
the baby's heart rate.

469
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,494
That should be
between 120 and 160.

470
00:17:57,518 --> 00:18:00,489
So 140's perfect.

471
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:02,360
Yeah.

472
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,466
The baby's in great shape.

473
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:14,471
Biophysical profile's eight.

474
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:15,807
A.F.I.'s 14.

475
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:17,277
Cervix is favorable.

476
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,515
I've got a non-stress
test started.

477
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,587
Mm-hmm. I feel very comfortable.

478
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,126
I've delivered a
couple hundred babies.

479
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:27,066
It's 9:00. So we'll see
you in about an hour.

480
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:28,736
What did Coburn say?

481
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:30,040
She's at Saint Luke's,

482
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,843
and she says she'll be here

483
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:35,252
as soon as she's finished
with her repeat C-section.

484
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:37,757
Oh, and she wants
me to start an induction.

485
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,431
That is, of course,
if I feel comfortable.

486
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:41,766
She said that?

487
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:42,936
Yeah.

488
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,251
What a bitch.

489
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,843
Yeah. Hmm. Hey, Drake.

490
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,514
How do things look?

491
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:48,850
Looks great.

492
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:51,116
B.P.'s have been
perfectly normal.

493
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,762
Oh, boy.

494
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:55,732
How can I...? Excuse me.

495
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,188
He can't be more
than 12 years old.

496
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,360
He's the O.B. resident on call.

497
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:02,242
I just spoke with Dr. Coburn,

498
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,512
our O.B. attending,

499
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:06,607
and she agrees that we
need to deliver you soon.

500
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:09,263
Does that mean you
have to do a C-section?

501
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,067
I want to deliver naturally.

502
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:12,582
Your eclampsia's under control,

503
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:13,885
the baby's in good shape,

504
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:15,155
and the cervix is favorable.

505
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,559
I'd say we do a trial of labor.

506
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,563
And if that doesn't work?

507
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,957
I think it will work.

508
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:25,117
I want to give it a try.

509
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:27,154
Let's do it!

510
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,615
Excuse me.

511
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,758
Yep?

512
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:36,838
Mark, do you feel confident

513
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:37,873
to handle this down
here without me?

514
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:39,878
We're getting slammed upstairs.

515
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,604
I think I can muddle through.

516
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,787
All right. I'll check back
with you at, say, 2300.

517
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:45,112
Roger.

518
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:46,393
Carol? Yeah?

519
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:49,623
Could you give Mrs.
O'Brian .5 Pitocin I.V.?

520
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,138
You're inducing down here?

521
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:52,563
Yeah. We're going to start here,

522
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,133
then we'll get her up to O.B.

523
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:55,469
Okay.

524
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:00,481
How frequent are
the contractions?

525
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:01,996
Every ten minutes or so.

526
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:05,292
Let's have Dr. Greene decide.

527
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:06,629
You're kidding.

528
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,304
We can't call him "Baby
X" when we call our parents.

529
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,643
All right, let's
take a quick look.

530
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,011
Okay.

531
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:19,842
Okay. It's five
centimeters dilated,

532
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:22,014
90% effaced, station

533
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,051
minus two. Membrane's intact.

534
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,282
You want to look, too?

535
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,574
May I?

536
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,579
Why not? Everybody else

537
00:20:28,614 --> 00:20:30,712
has been poking around in there.

538
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:32,321
Here.

539
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,409
Hmm...

540
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:37,416
"Ian, Patrick, Dermot..."

541
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:38,753
Sounds like the cast

542
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,033
of<i> Finian's Rainbow.</i>

543
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,008
Ow!

544
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:42,194
Sorry.

545
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:43,464
"Hunter."

546
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:45,936
Hunter O'Brian?

547
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:49,828
You agree with my assessment?

548
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,565
Uh... yeah.

549
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,541
Your labor's progressing
along nicely and quickly.

550
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:57,044
The baby's doing great.

551
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,562
Is it normal for the
baby's heart rate

552
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:01,522
to be going down like that?

553
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:04,211
As long as it's briefly,
and stays over 120.

554
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:05,715
Jared's on both lists.

555
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,845
Oh, no.

556
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,349
It's not my favorite.

557
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:11,143
Compromise is
the soul of marriage.

558
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,483
"Jared" it is.

559
00:21:13,518 --> 00:21:15,487
"Jared." "Jared."

560
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,324
Jared's...

561
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,661
Jared?

562
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:19,663
Yes.

563
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:21,300
Okay, feel better.

564
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:22,637
Thank you.

565
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:23,972
You're welcome.

566
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:27,147
Hey, Mark, how come
the O.B. case is still here?

567
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:28,984
They're still busy upstairs.

568
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,488
I got to call again.

569
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,003
Dr. Greene!

570
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:33,328
Something's wrong.

571
00:21:33,363 --> 00:21:34,664
The baby's heart...

572
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,346
The monitor's down to 90.

573
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,972
Something's not right.

574
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,461
It's not supposed
to go that low, right?

575
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,640
Hey, Ma. Hangin' in there?

576
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:48,625
Hey, how you doing, Ma?

577
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:50,295
Why so long in recovery?

578
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,620
She's 76.

579
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:53,134
Estimated blood loss?

580
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:54,460
500cc's.

581
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:56,309
All right. Post-op orders?

582
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,639
She may be your mother,
but she's my patient.

583
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:02,144
We're taking the O.R. elevator.

584
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:04,115
She's going to 604.

585
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:17,279
It was bound to happen
sooner or later, Peter.

586
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,753
Okay, Sweetie, let's try
deep, cleansing breaths.

587
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:31,658
Let's exhale on
a count of three.

588
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:33,148
Shut up, Sean!

589
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,805
Call O.B. and
get the fas in here.

590
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,888
How we doing, Mrs. O'Brian?

591
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:39,898
I believe I'll have an epidural.

592
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,713
Contractions are two
to three minutes apart.

593
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:42,904
No kidding.

594
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:44,591
Tracing's showing
decreased reactivity.

595
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:45,995
What's that?

596
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,543
The baby's heart
rate is reacting

597
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,013
or varying less than it should.

598
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:51,018
But, babies sleep
in 20-minute cycles,

599
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:54,380
so what we want to
do is wake him up.

600
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,985
Rise and shine.

601
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,987
Whoa.

602
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:58,206
There we go.

603
00:22:58,242 --> 00:22:59,510
He was just sleeping.

604
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,807
The heart rate's back up.

605
00:23:00,831 --> 00:23:02,478
Get an ETA on Coburn. Okay.

606
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:05,022
I'm Dr. Urami, Anesthesiology.

607
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:07,361
I'm here to do your epidural.

608
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:11,570
Oh, yes, please, let's do that.

609
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,045
How's that epidural?

610
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:16,382
Wonderful.

611
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,550
These are great.

612
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:18,988
I'm going to show these pictures

613
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,391
of little Jared to my students.

614
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:21,727
Eighth graders?

615
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:23,731
Yeah, you know,
like Show and Tell.

616
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:25,703
In math class?

617
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:30,080
Now we can get a pressure
reading inside the uterus.

618
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,251
This scalp electrode

619
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,408
monitors the pulse
rate more exactly.

620
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:37,680
Enjoying the show?

621
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,435
Yeah.

622
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,439
I mean, no.

623
00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:43,105
She's eight centimeters dilated.

624
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:44,596
Completely effaced.

625
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,002
Won't be long.

626
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:48,939
There's another decel.

627
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,348
Variable with a late component.

628
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:55,521
Let's infuse

629
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:58,746
500cc's normal saline
through the uterine catheter.

630
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:00,566
Like a regular I.V.?

631
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:01,903
Yeah.

632
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:04,275
We need to get her up to O.B.

633
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,881
I'll see if I can light a
fire under someone's butt.

634
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:07,884
Is something wrong?

635
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,887
No. We're okay.

636
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:11,892
Page Coburn again.

637
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,263
Okay.

638
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,040
Why can't I just send her up?

639
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:20,712
She's inches away, and
the epidural's wearing off.

640
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:22,750
Then find Drake. Hurry up!

641
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:25,657
Breathe, breathe.

642
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:28,476
You want to try
some of the breathing?

643
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,733
You know that fantasy you have

644
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,304
about me quitting
work, staying home,

645
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,309
and having a bunch of kids?

646
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:34,979
Forget it. This is it!

647
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:36,316
Competitive lates.

648
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,652
We need to deliver.

649
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,334
Okay, I need to take a look.

650
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:41,327
Try some single breaths.

651
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:44,300
Fully dilated, 100% effaced.

652
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:46,973
It's time to start to push.

653
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:48,321
Already? Yep.

654
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:49,657
Here? Here.

655
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:52,986
Run and get Carol.

656
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,891
Oh! Oh!

657
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,008
Try some breathing.
Try some breathing.

658
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,778
I love you so much, babe.

659
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:00,604
So much. So much.

660
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,945
Shut up! Oh!

661
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:05,650
Get a baby warmer

662
00:25:05,685 --> 00:25:08,690
and a newborn resuscitation
tray in Three, stat!

663
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,310
Okay, push, push. Nine, ten.

664
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:13,897
Good, good. Good. Take a breath.

665
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:14,999
Take a breath, sweetie.

666
00:25:15,023 --> 00:25:16,491
Welcome back.

667
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:18,095
Did I go home?

668
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,805
Push, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

669
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:25,011
eight, nine, ten.

670
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:27,350
I'm not ready to be a mother.

671
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:28,686
Bear down.

672
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,702
I can't! It's going
to rip me apart.

673
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:34,633
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

674
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:38,008
I can't! I can't!

675
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:39,010
Get it out!

676
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:40,146
Carter, Carter,

677
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:42,484
Go to O.B. and<i> drag</i> Drake down.

678
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,501
Tell him to bring some
forceps, okay? Go, go.

679
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:46,493
She's not progressing.

680
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,510
The baby's heart
rate's dangerously low.

681
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,881
I'm going to start
the pudendal block.

682
00:25:50,905 --> 00:25:52,341
Okay.

683
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:00,760
O.B.'s got two C-sections
and three imminent deliveries.

684
00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:02,642
Mark, Mark, no one will
blame you if you wait for O.B.

685
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:03,879
The baby monitor
says now or never.

686
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:06,205
Why put your ass on the line?

687
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:07,207
Cause I've come this far.

688
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:08,209
I'm going to see it through.

689
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:09,547
Where's Coburn?

690
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:10,883
In transit.

691
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,088
What, is she coming by camel?

692
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:14,759
Get her B.P.

693
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:21,039
B.P.'s still climbing, 150/100

694
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:23,044
Go, Mark, baby's bradying down.

695
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,459
Okay, now don't
push. No, don't push

696
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:27,187
Before I break the blades,

697
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:28,957
cut a median episiotomy.

698
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:30,306
Here comes the head.

699
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,631
Can you breathe?

700
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,229
All right, here comes the head.

701
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:37,255
Look at me.

702
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,458
Get a blanket? Damn!

703
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:39,182
Get him out.

704
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:39,950
He's stuck.

705
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:40,968
Shoulder dystocia.

706
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:42,356
What's that?

707
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:43,803
His shoulder's hung
up on the pubic bone.

708
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:45,279
It's okay, sweetie.

709
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,467
Oh, my God.

710
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:50,240
Leads off.

711
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:52,862
Macrobert's maneuver.

712
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:54,934
Push the legs up
towards her head.

713
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,800
Okay, lift her legs.
Okay, I've got her legs.

714
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,871
I've got it. Straight up in
the air, straight up in the air.

715
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:00,948
Someone push
down on the abdomen.

716
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:02,284
What are you doing?

717
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,749
Trying to free his shoulders.

718
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:05,258
Push. Carter, not
fundal pressure.

719
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:07,497
Down here. Down here.

720
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,670
He's jammed.

721
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:12,006
Stat page O.B.

722
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,145
Oh, God. Do something!

723
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,734
Let's try a woods.

724
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,293
I need to extend the episiotomy.

725
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:24,786
If I can rotate the
posterior shoulder medially.

726
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:26,123
I love you, baby.

727
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:28,997
Try to deliver the posterior
shoulder. Come on.

728
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:31,535
He's jammed in.

729
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,523
Come on.

730
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:34,859
Come on! Come on!

731
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:36,864
Why can't you deliver this baby?

732
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:38,301
Mr. O'Brian, please.

733
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:45,065
It's not working.

734
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:47,088
Let her go. Let her go.

735
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,794
It's not working.

736
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,815
Zavenelli.

737
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,063
What are you doing?

738
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:55,100
Zavenelli. We've got to
push the baby back in.

739
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,203
Then what?

740
00:27:56,227 --> 00:27:57,338
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

741
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:58,775
We got to roll her
on her left side.

742
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,986
Susan, get your hand in here.

743
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,958
Grab a caesarean tray. Run!

744
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:06,727
Climb on up. Hold her head in.

745
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,553
Throw a sheet over her.

746
00:28:08,588 --> 00:28:11,242
Get her into trauma one.

747
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,183
Find out if Benson's still
here. Splash and crash.

748
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:16,538
Okay.

749
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:17,786
Where are you taking her?

750
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,445
We've got to do an
emergency C-section.

751
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:20,548
I need your consent.

752
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:21,550
What the hell are you doing?

753
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:22,552
Have you done this before?

754
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:24,022
I've scrubbed in many times.

755
00:28:24,057 --> 00:28:25,637
No. I want somebody
else in here.

756
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:27,765
It can't wait. If we
wait five more minutes,

757
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,979
your baby's brain dead.

758
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:30,314
Oh, my God. Go! Go! Go!

759
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:31,651
Watch the I.V. Do it!

760
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:32,642
Get moving!

761
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,628
Mr. O'Brian, please

762
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:34,396
get out of the way.

763
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:36,400
Sweetie, I'm right here.

764
00:28:36,435 --> 00:28:38,222
I love you so much.

765
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,569
Put a rush on the blood.
We're almost home.

766
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:40,705
Mr. O'Brian.

767
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,698
I love you. I'm right
here, right here.

768
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,937
Call respiratory, stat.

769
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:47,393
Come on, Mr. O'Brian,
you have to wait outside.

770
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:49,030
I love you, I love
you! Wait out here.

771
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:51,886
I'm right here. I'm right here.

772
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:54,285
Splash it with Betadine.

773
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,103
B.P.'s sky high, 170/120.

774
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:01,074
What about anesthesia?

775
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,410
There's no time.

776
00:29:02,445 --> 00:29:04,047
I'll throw in a local.

777
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,052
Oh! She's seizing!

778
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:07,089
Grab the bite block.

779
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:10,039
All right. Let's
paralyze and intubate.

780
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:12,033
Versed four migs.

781
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:14,037
Norcuron ten.

782
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:16,042
Intubation tray.

783
00:29:16,077 --> 00:29:19,060
Get respiratory down here.

784
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,053
Seven point five.

785
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:22,234
Here's your 7.5.

786
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:23,659
Suction standing by.

787
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,065
Okay, O2 at 15.

788
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,074
Carter, try to get in here.

789
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:33,081
We're just going
to bag her for now.

790
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:35,619
Get that typed blood
cross-matched and down here.

791
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:38,059
I need you down here.
Where's the coag panel?

792
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:39,741
Get a vent ready.

793
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:41,767
Her B.P.'S 200/130.

794
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:45,221
She's going to stroke out.

795
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:48,816
Okay, everybody, just
take a deep breath, all right?

796
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:54,999
Okay, hydralazine ten migs.

797
00:29:56,604 --> 00:30:00,076
Another bolus of mag sulfate.

798
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:02,081
Somebody call N.I.C.U.

799
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:06,357
and get somebody
down here for the baby.

800
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,171
Somebody physically
go up to the O.B.

801
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:14,876
and drag somebody
down here, okay?

802
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:16,581
Go!

803
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,266
Get the suction in.

804
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:25,969
Scalpel.

805
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:28,591
Let's see...

806
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,597
is that the fascia?

807
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:33,404
Uh... yeah, yeah,
that looks right.

808
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,452
Grab with those clippies.

809
00:30:35,476 --> 00:30:36,677
Hydralazine's in.

810
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:39,182
Grab an army/navy. Suction.

811
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:40,553
Metz.

812
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,512
The long scissors.

813
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:47,686
Retract there.

814
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,039
Okay.

815
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,926
I'm in.

816
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:53,031
Isn't there something

817
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:54,852
about a bladder flap?

818
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:56,406
Pickups.

819
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:57,476
Suction.

820
00:30:57,511 --> 00:30:58,522
I'm dividing the peritoneum.

821
00:30:58,546 --> 00:30:59,647
Hemostat.

822
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:01,724
Okay, we're in. Grab
that side and pull.

823
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,474
Okay.

824
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,479
Get a retractor in there.

825
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:07,882
We need exposure. Pull.

826
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,786
Oh, man.

827
00:31:09,822 --> 00:31:12,828
That's wide enough.

828
00:31:12,863 --> 00:31:14,843
All right, now, scalpel.

829
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,502
You cut across

830
00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:18,473
the lower segment of the uterus?

831
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:20,261
You're asking me?

832
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:23,001
I'm asking God.

833
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:24,955
Suction. No. Here.

834
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,470
I don't think you're
all the way through.

835
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:27,656
I don't want to cut the baby.

836
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,566
Open a pack of lap pads.

837
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:32,701
Retract this way, more. Okay.

838
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,544
Here...

839
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:35,847
There. I think I'm in.

840
00:31:36,951 --> 00:31:37,817
Oh, my God!

841
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,506
There's two liters in there.

842
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,293
She's got an abruption.

843
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:42,796
She's bleeding out.

844
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:44,060
Carter, Chen, gown up.

845
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:45,686
Get the baby out.

846
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:47,607
Open those IV lines.

847
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:49,707
Hurry, Mark, get him out.

848
00:31:49,731 --> 00:31:50,732
Get the baby.

849
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:51,715
Pump in the saline.

850
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:53,699
Forget that cross-match.

851
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:56,210
Eight units of O-neg
down here stat.

852
00:31:56,245 --> 00:31:57,112
Hurry up.

853
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,399
I got him.

854
00:31:58,434 --> 00:31:59,751
He's big.

855
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:01,433
Hurry up. Suction his airway.

856
00:32:01,457 --> 00:32:04,263
B.P.'s okay, 120 over 80.

857
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,933
Hurry up.

858
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:08,287
Cord's free.

859
00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:10,085
Suction, suction his nose.

860
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,931
Umbilical clamp.

861
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:18,244
He's not breathing.

862
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,346
Okay, clamp.

863
00:32:26,382 --> 00:32:28,017
All right. Bag him.

864
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:29,754
Carter, get in here.

865
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:30,991
Huh? Carter?

866
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:32,861
Get in here.

867
00:32:32,897 --> 00:32:34,532
Follow my hand down.

868
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:35,668
Feel the aorta?

869
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,338
I don't know.

870
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:38,675
It's pulsing.

871
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,777
Yeah. I do.

872
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:41,458
Okay, push down
on it and don't let go.

873
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:42,449
You got it?

874
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:43,452
I think so.

875
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:44,454
Don't think, do.

876
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:45,456
I got it.

877
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:46,459
P.D. mask.

878
00:32:46,494 --> 00:32:47,461
Is he alive?

879
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:48,463
Apgar's one.

880
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:49,466
B.P.'s 110 over 70.

881
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,468
Move. Move.

882
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:52,116
No respiratory effort,
pulse 32. Start C.P.R.

883
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,576
I'm going to intubate.

884
00:32:53,611 --> 00:32:56,247
All right. Clip.

885
00:32:57,921 --> 00:32:59,305
Heel stick of glucose.

886
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,110
Tone is flaccid.

887
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,079
We need a blood gas.

888
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,915
I can't see.

889
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,620
Suction.

890
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:06,722
O-neg's here.

891
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:08,487
All right. Pump it in.

892
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,397
I think I'm in.

893
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,175
Bag him.

894
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,932
Let me take a quick listen.

895
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:20,047
Chest expands well with bagging.

896
00:33:20,071 --> 00:33:21,919
Yeah, okay. We got it.

897
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:24,848
Tape it and keep bagging.

898
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:26,919
All right, blood sugar's 20.

899
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:29,992
Give him D-10.

900
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:31,595
He's got no veins.

901
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:32,966
Hyperventilate him.

902
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:35,506
I'm going to try
an umbilical line.

903
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:36,907
What about some epi?

904
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:39,130
Point zero four.

905
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:41,185
Epi down the tube.

906
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,555
Here's the epi.

907
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:52,294
Release that clamp
after I tie this off.

908
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:53,375
Here, I've got it.

909
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,401
Release the clamp.

910
00:33:55,436 --> 00:33:58,441
Oh, my God, how can you see?

911
00:33:58,477 --> 00:34:00,011
I don't know.

912
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:03,119
Grab a bag of O-neg.

913
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:05,658
Stick with ten per kilo.

914
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,598
40cc's.

915
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,904
Oh, come on.

916
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:12,924
Come on.

917
00:34:16,718 --> 00:34:17,760
That's the umbilical vein.

918
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:20,024
Okay, hook it up
while I advance it.

919
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,680
Okay. It's going.

920
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:24,617
Glucose at five mil per kilo.

921
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:26,289
Follow me down.

922
00:34:26,324 --> 00:34:28,126
20 Mils.

923
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:30,698
Come on, little guy.

924
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:31,802
Come on.

925
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:34,407
He moved. I swear
to God, he moved.

926
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:35,844
It's going, 100.

927
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,213
He's pinking up.

928
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:40,354
She's had three units,
two liters normal saline.

929
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,058
Vitals?

930
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,429
B.P.'s 80/50, pulse 112.

931
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:46,619
I can live with that
and so can she.

932
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:48,133
Baby's five-minute
apgar's much better, eight.

933
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:49,526
That's good.

934
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:51,530
Go ahead and re-gown, Susan.

935
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:52,533
Cavalry's here.

936
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:54,537
What's going on in here?

937
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:56,909
I intubated. The baby went bad.

938
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:59,631
I tried forceps and
got a shoulder dystocia.

939
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,535
She seized.

940
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,903
I paralyzed and
did a crash section.

941
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:06,498
Got in there and there were
two liters of blood in her uterus.

942
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,379
You knew she'd abrupted?
No, once I got in there.

943
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:09,616
Baby nearly died.

944
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,219
Who is this and what's
he doing in there?

945
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,656
John Carter, med student

946
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,511
and I'm pressing on the aorta.

947
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:16,682
It's a damned mess. What
did you use, a chain saw?

948
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:17,935
Well, I couldn't just

949
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,405
stand around waiting
while that baby died.

950
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:21,076
Get an N.I.C.U.
transport team over here

951
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,384
and the O.B. resident on call.

952
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,533
You should have let me know
you were in over your head.

953
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:27,479
Let's get a Foley in.

954
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:48,845
We got hemostatsis.

955
00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:53,456
Someone call respiratory.

956
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:58,635
Okay, Carson, you
can let go of the aorta.

957
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,189
Wait, wait.

958
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,161
Wait. Wait. Just stop.

959
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,676
Looks good.

960
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,000
Bleeding stopped.

961
00:36:06,036 --> 00:36:08,523
Go talk to the father.

962
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:17,443
Suction.

963
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:22,790
Is my baby all right?

964
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:23,959
He was apneic at first,

965
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:25,996
but his five-minute
apgar was very encour...

966
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:28,236
Stop hiding behind
that damn medical crap.

967
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,307
I think your baby's
going to be fine. Let's go.

968
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:31,844
Don't take my son.

969
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:32,880
And Jodi?

970
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:34,250
There was bleeding.

971
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:37,223
She's had transfusions,
but she's stabilized now.

972
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:38,493
Dr. Coburn,

973
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,266
the O.B. specialist, is
in there with her now.

974
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,165
She's closing the incision.
How can this happen?

975
00:36:43,189 --> 00:36:44,390
What we need to do right now

976
00:36:44,424 --> 00:36:46,037
is get your son
upstairs. Now! Go, go!

977
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,541
Everything's okay, right?

978
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:49,212
Go be with your baby.
There's nothing you can do now.

979
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:51,338
She's going to be okay, right?

980
00:36:51,374 --> 00:36:52,741
She's stabilized.

981
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,145
Go with your son.

982
00:37:01,129 --> 00:37:04,481
I have never seen such a
chain of errors in judgment.

983
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:05,672
Hey, I did what you said.

984
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:07,175
You miss a pre-eclampsia.

985
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:08,423
You underestimate
the fetal weight.

986
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:09,458
I was expecting O.B. backup.

987
00:37:09,482 --> 00:37:11,564
You miss a placental abruption.

988
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:12,554
What?

989
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,325
Blood clot, right there.

990
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,797
You do an ill-advised
forceps delivery

991
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,401
on a baby that's too big

992
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,673
and then you do a
hack job of a C-section.

993
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:22,020
Hey, look... it was
me in the barrel

994
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:23,324
with a baby going
down the tubes.

995
00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:25,429
The only thing that saved you
from disaster was dumb luck.

996
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:26,765
Yeah, well, if it wasn't for me,

997
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:28,902
the mother would be dead
and the baby a vegetable.

998
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:29,961
Who's on O.B. call?

999
00:37:29,996 --> 00:37:31,297
Drake!

1000
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,411
Mark... Mark...

1001
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:34,103
she's just covering herself.

1002
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:35,105
She was right.

1003
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:36,509
It was my screw-up.

1004
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:37,790
You were great in there, Mark.

1005
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:39,294
No, no. I couldn't
have done that.

1006
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:40,385
It was my fault, you know?

1007
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,888
It was my fault
that she went sour.

1008
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:43,191
She's my patient.

1009
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:44,473
No one is going to blame you.

1010
00:37:44,497 --> 00:37:45,697
Nah, they don't have to.

1011
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:48,737
Dr. Greene! She's crashing!

1012
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:51,309
How many units has she had?

1013
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:53,148
B.P.'s falling, 70/40.

1014
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:54,150
Two O-neg, two saline packs.

1015
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:55,152
I can't get a blood gas.

1016
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:56,722
You run the resuscitation.

1017
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:58,326
Her cap refill's bad.

1018
00:37:58,362 --> 00:38:00,732
I'll throw in an arterial line.

1019
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:03,638
Somebody put those blood
bags on a rapid infuser. Get the kit!

1020
00:38:03,675 --> 00:38:05,888
Hook up the transducer.

1021
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:08,182
Give her a mig of atropine.

1022
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:09,485
Check a manual B.P.

1023
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,358
She's really bleeding
from the puncture site.

1024
00:38:12,394 --> 00:38:14,374
Somebody put pressure on it.

1025
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:15,499
I've got it.

1026
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:17,214
I.V. Site's oozing, too.

1027
00:38:17,238 --> 00:38:19,508
I don't hear it. 60 by palp.

1028
00:38:19,543 --> 00:38:21,045
Hang a dopamine drip.

1029
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:24,252
Pull her off that
respirator and bag her.

1030
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:26,035
The blood stopped clotting.

1031
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,672
She's going into
D.I.C. Oh, damn.

1032
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:30,984
Order up ten units
cryoprecipitate and platelets.

1033
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,355
Uh-oh. Multi-focal P.V.C.s

1034
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,438
Oh, what now? Lidocaine
100 migs, I.V. push.

1035
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:35,828
I don't get a pulse.

1036
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:37,248
Start a drip.

1037
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:41,809
Mark the time,
0542. Charging. 260.

1038
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:46,219
Clear.

1039
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:49,227
Let's go again.

1040
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:50,212
Three hundred.

1041
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:51,865
Clear.

1042
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,182
She's oozing from
every cut surface.

1043
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,942
We're chasing our tails in here.

1044
00:38:55,977 --> 00:38:57,278
Time down?

1045
00:38:57,313 --> 00:38:58,982
33 minutes.

1046
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:00,631
More PVC. She's
maxed out on lidocaine.

1047
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:03,977
Add pronestyl, 30 migs
a minute, up to 200.

1048
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:05,592
No pulse. We're losing her.

1049
00:39:05,616 --> 00:39:07,284
Get a dopamine drip.

1050
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:08,688
Charging.

1051
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,202
Out of the way, out of the way.

1052
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,270
Again, 360.

1053
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:16,974
Off.

1054
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:23,154
Give her 300 I.V. push.

1055
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,393
Blood gas is bad. PO2/150.

1056
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:49,014
It's been five minutes
since her last high dose epi.

1057
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,718
Another seven.

1058
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:53,792
Mark, she's gone.

1059
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:57,032
It's 30 minutes past too late.

1060
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:58,703
I'm calling it.

1061
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:01,977
Time of death, 0646.

1062
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:13,486
It's not flatlined.

1063
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:14,672
It's fine v-fib.

1064
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,193
Another seven migs epi.

1065
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,178
Dr. Greene?

1066
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,660
Dr. Greene?

1067
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:32,945
I, uh, just wanted to
say... to, or, to tell you

1068
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:38,457
that, um, I thought what
you did was a heroic thing.

1069
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:03,616
It's just one stop the other
way, right by the train station.

1070
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:05,120
I got to get going.

1071
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:06,356
Come on.

1072
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:08,895
Not only does Shorty's have
the greasiest eggs in town

1073
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,933
stuff falls from the ceiling

1074
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:12,269
every time the el goes by.

1075
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:13,550
Sounds attractive, Susan.

1076
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:15,989
I just got a million
things I got to do.

1077
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:17,883
Are you sure you're okay?

1078
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:19,987
I'm fine, scout's honor.

1079
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:21,992
Is Jen home?

1080
00:45:20,495 --> 00:45:24,318
