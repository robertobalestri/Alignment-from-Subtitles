We're out east of the dumps now.

getting enough exercise.

We're doing everything possible.

Why are you still
feeding her in her room?

21
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:15,598
We can't move every
resident into the dining hall.

22
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,068
No, I want her to eat
with everybody else.

23
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,638
She needs to be
around other people.

24
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,230
When she gets better, she
can participate in more activities.

25

She's not going to get better

26
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:25,383
unless you keep her mobile.

27
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:27,643
If your mother
were strong enough,

28
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,747
she'd get more exercise.

29
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:31,428
You promised hydrotherapy.

30
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:33,499
You said you had
a full-time staff.

We'll do more when she's ready.

00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:37,127
What do I have to do?

33
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,042
Do I have to come down
here and supervise it myself?

34
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,469
Dr. Benton, your
mother broke her hip.

35
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:43,840
She won't heal overnight.

36
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:48,516
Yeah.

37
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,686
Thank you.

38
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,909
Mom, Chloe doesn't
have any insurance.

39
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:55,256
If you could spare a
couple hundred dollars...

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,392
Dr. Lewis?

41
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,151
I got to go, Mom. Bye.

42
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:01,190
Yeah?

43
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,959
Our chief resident in?

44
00:02:03,028 --> 00:02:04,997
Uh, he should be
here any minute.

45
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:08,270
We have tourists tonight...
Joint Commission surveyors.

46
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:10,741
I need him for two
hours after his shift.

47
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:11,876
Rolando!

48
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:13,112
Yeah?

49
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:15,984
I love chaos, but
this is overdoing it.

50
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,820
I'm a little slow today.

51
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,424
I got a cold. I'm sorry.

52
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,895
Call a replacement, go home.

53
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:23,598
Is he a jerk?

54
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,653
I don't know yet.

55
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:26,854
Carter?!

56
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:29,860
Fadenhecht, Isidore.
Caught in a metal press.

57
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,664
Multiple lacs, B.P., 80/30.

58
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,067
Pulse 135, thready.

59
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:34,202
This guy's a mess.

60
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,571
How much blood loss?

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,641
500 cc's.

62
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:40,380
Okay, let's move him up slow.

63
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,050
He's busted up enough.

64
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,254
On three. One... two... three.

65
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:45,657
I'll order o-neg.

66
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,661
Mental status at scene?

67
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,609
GCS 344, complained
of back pain.

68
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,800
No kidding.

69
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:53,087
Stopped 18 minutes ago.

70
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:54,974
Cross table C-spine.

71
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:56,510
What size tube?

72
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,696
Give me a seven.

73
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:59,077
Call Respiratory. Put
him on a ventilator.

74
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:01,231
Pulse is weak, B.P.'s falling

75
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,658
Give me three, large-bore IVs,

76
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,427
normal saline, wide open.

77
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:07,682
Tube's in.

78
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,001
Bag him.

79
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,999
Dr. Ross, I'm not getting
a pulse down here.

80
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,056
Find a surgeon

81
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,594
before this guy loses his leg.

82
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:15,063
Call X ray.
Cross-check the C-spine.

83
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,634
Rolando, Dr. Ross is still
waiting on the surgeon.

84
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:19,216
I'm on with him now...
20 minutes is no good!

85
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,476
Carter, I thought you were
reorganizing my X rays.

86
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:24,563
Dr. Ross needs
you... Crush case.

87
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,334
He's in trouble, Peter.

88
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:28,571
He's absent femoral, popliteal

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,625
and dorsalis pedis pulses.

90
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:32,589
No cap refill. X rays back yet?

91
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,882
Not yet.

92
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,662
Flexed, internally
rotated and shortened.

93
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:36,936
What is it, Carter?

94
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,590
Uh, a fracture? Mm-mm.

95
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,292
Posterior dislocation.

96
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:42,147
All right, give me
some room here.

97
00:03:42,216 --> 00:03:44,334
Carter, hold his pelvis down.

98
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:46,571
Doug, stabilize his neck.

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,785
Yep.

100
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,010
One...

101
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,631
two... three.

102
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,000
I felt a pop.

103
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:54,304
Good.

104
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:55,806
It's back in.

105
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:58,043
Distal pulse is back.

106
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,546
Well done, Peter.

107
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,616
Call Ortho.

108
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:01,685
You saved his leg.

109
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,219
Yeah, well...

110
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,249
legs are something
I<i> can</i> save today.

Hi. Hi.

114
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:58,757
How'd it go with Jen?

115
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:00,661
Oh, I never got there.

116
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,198
She didn't want me to come up.

117
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,204
Oh.

118
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,518
Uh, Wild Willie wants you

119
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:08,821
to stay after your shift.

120
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:09,846
Can't do it.

121
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,727
You want to earn points,

122
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:12,962
now's the time...

123
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:15,923
if you still want
to be an attending.

124
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,864
Mark?

125
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:22,201
She said I could
come up tonight.

126
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,305
I have to make a 7:30 train.

127
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:29,849
You know, I remember
when we used to fight.

128
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,654
We wouldn't talk
for a couple of days

129
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:36,093
but I always knew that
things would work out.

130
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:38,298
This time, I'm not so sure.

131
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,358
What do you use for
Legionnaire's disease?

132
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,651
Erythromycin. You
studying for the boards?

133
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,021
They're four months away.

134
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,190
I'm bad on tests.

135
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,591
Doug, got a kid coming in

136
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,994
with sudden hearing loss.

137
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,497
I'll take the baby in two.

138
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:56,766
Okay.

139
00:05:57,938 --> 00:05:59,649
Carter, you decide
about next year?

140
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:01,620
I'm waiting on
that surgical sub-i.

141
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:02,989
What about the E.R. sub-i?

142
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:04,425
Mark would recommend you.

143
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,450
You think so?

144
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:06,518
Yeah.

145
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:07,921
He's studying again.

146
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,692
I heard they raised
the boards' failure rate.

147
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:11,895
What?

148
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,309
Carter, Dr. Benton
needs you in Four.

149
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,667
Yeah, it went up to ten percent.

150
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:16,648
What, seven
students fail last year?

151
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:17,717
Seven? Yep.

152
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:18,752
Dr. Ross? Mm-hmm?

153
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:20,121
Katie's got a problem.

154
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:22,181
Hey, Katie, what
can we do for you?

155
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,449
Come here.

156
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:25,165
Katie's kind of shell-shocked.

157
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:26,622
Shell-shocked, as in combat?

158
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:27,892
She can't hear a thing.

159
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,974
It's take-your-
daughter-to-work day.

160
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,400
She pulled her muffs
off on the firing range.

161
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,904
Katie, do you hear ringing?

162
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:34,972
What?

163
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,275
Come here.

164
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:37,676
You hear this?

165
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,024
What is that?

166
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,819
That's louder.

167
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:45,225
All right, Wendy, call ENT

168
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:46,571
for audiometry.

169
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:49,399
I want to rule out any
middle ear damage.

170
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:51,180
Okay, where do you work?

171
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,805
Great Lakes Naval Base.

172
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:55,677
I took her to morning
gunnery exercises.

173
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:58,715
I always wondered
why there's a naval base

174
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,997
on Lake Michigan.

175
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,623
Who's going to
invade, the Canadians?

176
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,840
It only happens
when he's eating.

177
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:06,064
Uh-huh. Hold still, Henry.

178
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,733
But not in the mornings.

179
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,303
Bounding pulses.

180
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,585
Every night, his lips turn blue.

181
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:13,879
Leonard, please, let him listen.

182
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,768
It's his heart, isn't it?

183
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:20,958
Leonard, don't start.

184
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:22,127
It's not your fault.

185
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:23,396
It's my family's genes.

186
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:25,145
They all have heart problems.

187
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:27,737
We need a chest
X ray and an EKG.

188
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,309
Go on, tell me.

189
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:33,115
Uh, I hear a murmur.

190
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:35,419
There you go.

191
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,389
It's his heart, isn't it?

192
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,861
I think so.

193
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:43,467
Girl coming in. Head trauma.

194
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:44,770
Page Benton, will you?

195
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:46,417
Fickle finger of fate
gets you every time.

196
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:47,754
Wanted my daughter
to be a doctor.

197
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:49,590
But you can't get
what you want from life.

198
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,461
She's a hostess at a
Hungarian restaurant.

199
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:54,149
You know, the capital is Budapest,
where Zsa Zsa Gabor was born.

200
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,852
Pushed her around,
locked her up for no reason...

201
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,622
Mrs. Dibble, Mrs. Dibble,
you need to stay in bed.

202
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:58,757
Why? What's wrong with me?

203
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,060
You stopped taking your lithium.

204
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,129
Malik, can you take
Mrs. Dibble to three?

205
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:02,214
Okay, let's go, Mrs. Dibble.

206
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:02,987
Don't touch me. I am coming.

207
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:04,201
Ooh, you're a big man.

208
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:05,737
You could be a body builder.

209
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:06,939
You're so handsome.

210
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:08,842
We could go to
my place for dinner.

211
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,145
We'd have a lot of fun.

212
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,381
Bi-polar.

213
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,050
They found her in Grant Park.

214
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:14,788
She was sweeping the sidewalks.

215
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:17,314
I feel lucky to have the
right brain chemicals.

216
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:18,517
You okay?

217
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,597
Fine. How's Chloe?

218
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:20,821
She wears all my clothes,

219
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,056
never washes the dishes,

220
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,291
forgets to feed the cat.

221
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,462
She's coming in
today for an ultrasound.

222
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:26,943
You sound so enthusiastic.

223
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,100
I'll help her out,

224
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,304
but she's not going
to run my life, Mark.

225
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:32,643
No, I'm not going
to do it, not this time.

226
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:35,114
Dr. Greene.

227
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,529
I need you for two hours

228
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:37,998
at the end of your shift.

229
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:39,355
Joint Commission survey.

230
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,170
I can't. It's a bad night.

231
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:42,327
It sure is.

232
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,496
It's going to rain.

233
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,666
I need you here.

234
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,212
I have personal business.

235
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:48,272
Personal? Since
when does a resident

236
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,575
have a personal life?

237
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,862
I'm sorry. I do tonight.

238
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:57,340
Well, I... I guess
I'll do it myself.

239
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:00,346
Screw him.

240
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,648
Do what you have to do.

241
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:03,869
We found her
passed out in the hall.

242
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,349
She must have slipped.

243
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:06,539
Are you her mother?

244
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:07,843
I'm her homeroom teacher.

245
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:08,990
She was bleeding
all over the place.

246
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,626
She's hypotensive,
Peter, 60 palp.

247
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,797
Let's take her and shake her

248
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:14,400
on my count: one, two, three.

249
00:09:14,424 --> 00:09:16,025
Haleh, cut off this bandage.

250
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,694
She's breathing really hard.

251
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:20,160
Does she use drugs?

252
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,552
No, no, not Samantha, I'm sure.

253
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:22,866
Bleeding's controlled.

254
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,268
Does Samantha have
a history of seizures?

255
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,061
I don't know.

256
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,062
Pupils reactive to light.

257
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:28,343
What do you think, Carter?

258
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,201
Could be a blood clot,
bleeding in the brain,

259
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,332
uh, seizure disorder...
No posturing.

260
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:32,389
Let's get a head CT.

261
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,042
CBC, chem 7.

262
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:35,295
Haleh, run a blood sugar.

263
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:36,608
B.P.'s down to 60/nothing.

264
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:37,983
Arrhythmia, v-tach!

265
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:39,485
Oh, she's crashing!

266
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:40,921
What the hell is happening?

267
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,424
All right, come on, paddles!

268
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:43,760
Move!

269
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,109
One hundred.

270
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,202
Clear!

271
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,621
No. I hate psychiatrists.

272
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,458
You've put this off long enough.

273
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:53,774
A guy kicked his
daughter out a window

274
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,945
and I slugged him,
and he deserved it.

275
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,302
Go see the shrink, Doug.

276
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,150
I got past the residency review

277
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:00,455
and the guy didn't sue.

278
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,911
I need to close the file.

279
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,581
Allen Murphy,
room 607, 3:00 p.m.

280
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,931
All right.

281
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,265
Are you saving my
ass because it's your job

282
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,768
or because I'm so wonderful?

283
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,229
Why don't we just say
I'm sort of fond of you?

284
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,431
Ouch.

285
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,936
I tell you, I get
kidney infections.

286
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:17,640
As a urologist, you
should know better.

287
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,577
Why didn't you take Bactrim?

288
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:21,414
"Physician, heal thyself."

289
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:22,650
We never do.

290
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,122
Where do you practice?

291
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,902
Uh, Seattle. Evangeline.

292
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,728
We have a great E.R. there,

293
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:30,330
but the weather stinks.

294
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,499
Ah! T-That's it!

295
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:33,336
Flank tenderness right...

296
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:35,174
Temp, 98.9.

297
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,378
Get me 100 meperidine for pain.

298
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,682
Let's make the diagnosis first.

299
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,451
Doc, it hurts like hell.

300
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,892
Dr. Strong, I'm sure
your diagnosis is correct

301
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,840
but let's get a urinalysis

302
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:48,231
just to make sure.

303
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:51,654
B.P.'s still down.

304
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:53,792
Her glucose is
through the roof. 600.

305
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,373
Oh, God, it's not seizures.

306
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:58,234
Haleh, I.V. loading dose
regular insulin ten units.

307
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:00,382
Start an infusion
five units an hour.

308
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:01,451
Carter, come here.

309
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:03,093
The coma's not from head trauma.

310
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,162
Take a whiff.

311
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,374
It smells like fruit.

312
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,443
Diabetic coma.

313
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,679
She's in ketoacidosis.

314
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,216
The breathing is Kussmaul's.

315
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,241
Get a blood gas.

316
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:12,209
Run in a liter of
saline wide open.

317
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:14,147
Did she eat anything today?

318
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,917
We had a birthday party.

319
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:18,405
She had chocolate cake
and, I think, some ice cream.

320
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,857
Will she be okay?

321
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:22,162
Why is a diabetic
eating all that sugar?

322
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,782
I didn't know she was diabetic.

323
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,017
Oh, great.

324
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,899
Haleh, let me know
when the chem 7's back.

325
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:28,891
I want a potassium
every 30 minutes.

326
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,321
I can turn the
case over to Ross.

327
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:31,630
I said I want a potassium.

328
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:34,469
Carter, stitch her head.

329
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,216
What do you want, 6-0 nylon?

330
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,482
Seven and a half blood...

331
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,053
I have nightmares
that I'm getting married

332
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:45,523
in a peach wedding gown.

333
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:46,836
I kind of like peach.

334
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,495
You don't wear it every day.

335
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:50,365
Yeah. Why do nurses wear colors

336
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:51,767
and doctors wear white?

337
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,949
Because doctors
are pure and good.

338
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,207
Does that include me?

339
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,287
No.

340
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,892
A Linda Farrell called.

341
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,153
Linda Farrell. That
sounds familiar.

342
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,766
Uh, you used to date her?

343
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,890
Oh, that's right.

344
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,371
Dr. Greene, Rescue 64's

345
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,242
bringing in a bleeding drunk.

346
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,677
I thought he went home.

347
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:09,834
Oh, Mark, Tag and I

348
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,072
need a ring bearer
for the wedding.

349
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:13,676
We'd love to have Rachel.

350
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:14,956
Oh, that'd be great.

351
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,027
I'm not sure where
we're going to be in May,

352
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:18,563
if Rach is going
to be down here,

353
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,300
but, well, I'll have
to ask Jennifer,

354
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,569
but I'm sure it'll be fine.

355
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:22,526
Okay.

356
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:24,262
Susie! Hey.

357
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,876
Oh, my jacket fits nice.

358
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,833
You look great.

359
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:28,270
I don't feel so great.

360
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:29,539
I'm kind of scared.

361
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:30,808
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

362
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,021
I broke your blender.

363
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,858
I was trying to
make a milk shake.

364
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,850
Blenders break.

365
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,055
Why are you being so nice to me?

366
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:41,628
Because you're not going
to screw up anymore, right?

367
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:44,433
Let's find your room,
get you a full physical.

368
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:45,603
Vomiting blood.

369
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:47,005
B.P. 90/60.

370
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:49,676
Smells like he's been
putting it away all day.

371
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:55,320
What's your name, sir?

372
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:56,690
Screw off, bitch!

373
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,559
Just what I need today.

374
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:01,132
Let's move him
on one, two, three.

375
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,935
Aah! My stomach!

376
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:05,039
Chest X ray, EKG.

377
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:05,941
Mary!

378
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,544
That '66 Malibu.

379
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:10,349
Best engine Chevy ever made.

380
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:12,554
What's your name, sir?

381
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,908
Reicher.

382
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:17,346
I like that M-MG. '56.

383
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:19,583
That was a great car.

384
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:22,355
I like the Triumph myself.

385
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:24,225
Set up for endoscopy.

386
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:25,127
Who are you?

387
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,346
Where am I?

388
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,914
How much did you drink today?

389
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:30,203
Ah, stuff it, will you?

390
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:31,521
We'll need to sedate him.

391
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:32,691
Droperidol, 2.5 migs.

392
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Set up the suction.

393
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:34,974
He'll need a Foley.

394
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:36,543
I'll do it. Uh,
you get the back.

395
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm going to puke!

396
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:39,281
Don't do it on the floor.

397
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:41,788
We're going to get you a basin.

398
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:45,047
Suction on, give me the scope.

399
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:51,126
Okay, is he, uh,
doped up enough?

400
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,428
He seems pretty out of it.

401
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:54,459
Running it wide open.

402
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,636
All right, this is a test.

403
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,414
Are we looking at a
peptic ulcer, varices

404
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:03,594
or Mallory-Weiss?

405
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:05,954
Peptic ulcer. Varices.

406
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:08,025
You're both right.

407
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:10,491
Get the bi-cap, let's
cauterize the bleeder.

408
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,076
Mr. Reicher, can you hear me?

409
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,412
You're going to be fine.

410
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,182
You drank yourself into an ulcer

411
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:16,452
and now the taxpayers

412
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:18,255
are going to buy you out of it.

413
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,513
Mark, is he stable?

414
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:22,151
They need you on seven
for residents' meeting.

415
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,153
I'll finish this.

416
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:24,233
All right, thanks.

417
00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:25,335
We have to get
Radiology down here.

418
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,859
Blood sugar's 95.

419
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,739
Did you take care of me today?

420
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:38,965
Yes, and you
should be lying down.

421
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,881
I'm getting my medicine now.

422
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:42,272
Do I look old to you?

423
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,674
No, you don't.

424
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,178
I feel old.

425
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,558
I feel like nothing good

426
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:48,228
is ever going to happen to me.

427
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,519
I'm sorry.

428
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:51,567
I've been begging
Psych to take her.

429
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,271
It's hard to be happy.

430
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:54,429
You can't try.

431
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,365
It comes or it doesn't.

432
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,755
Blood pressure's normal. PH 7.3.

433
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,213
Run a rhythm strip.

434
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:06,550
Give her 20 milliequivalents
KCL over an hour.

435
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:07,954
We got ahold of her mother.

436
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:09,289
Good.

437
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:10,726
Well, at least her
heart is steady.

438
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,674
Looks like she didn't
take her insulin today.

439
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,532
Looks like she
didn't take it all week.

440
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:16,214
Run a potassium
every 30 minutes.

441
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:18,673
Let me know.

442
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,695
Peter, she's not
a surgical patient.

443
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:22,063
You don't have to do this.

444
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:23,413
Just keep me posted.

445
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:28,543
I think it's the flu.

446
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:30,111
He told me to go home.

447
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,414
Can you come in?

448
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:32,884
Hurry.

449
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,853
Ronson's discharged.

450
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,124
Loomis to X ray.

451
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:39,731
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Lewis Reicher.

452
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,201
Oh, we have a<i> Lew</i> Reicher.

453
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,641
My husband... is he all right?

454
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,279
Maybe we reached
the wrong family.

455
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,700
No, he's my husband.

456
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,480
Did he talk about his cars?

457
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:53,584
He likes to talk about his cars.

458
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,662
Mrs. Reicher, your
husband's fine now,

459
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,467
but he does have
a bleeding ulcer.

460
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,473
The paramedics
found him on the street.

461
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,627
That's where he lives.

462
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:06,630
Don't ask me to explain.

463
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,014
I can't explain it
to my daughter.

464
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:11,218
I sure can't explain it to you.

465
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:13,861
Your husband's
been moved upstairs,

466
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,932
if you'd like to see him.

467
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:18,264
I brought him
some clean clothes.

468
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,757
Could you see that he gets this?

469
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:23,228
Sure. But he's awake,
if you want to talk to him.

470
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:25,699
I just wanted to
see if he was alive.

471
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,418
So Chloe's staying with you?

472
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:36,699
Not for long.

473
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:37,856
Is she okay?

474
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:39,571
Yeah. Considering
she's been living

475
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:40,773
on Twinkies and popcorn.

476
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:41,931
Hmm.

477
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,934
The mother of your
diabetic's on the way in.

478
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,170
Oh! Thank you.

479
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,940
Dr. Strong's urine test.

480
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:49,644
Seems he belongs
to a different species.

481
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:52,061
He signs his name
"Dr. Lyle Strong,"

482
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:54,186
then follows it with "MD."

483
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,392
What is taking so long?

484
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,196
This pain is killing me.

485
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,866
I'm sorry.

486
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:03,437
Your test results aren't good.

487
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:04,673
What?

488
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:07,044
You know the
differential diagnosis.

489
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:10,217
You have an aplastic
bi-cystic renal neoplasm.

490
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,488
No, no. It couldn't be that.

491
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:14,759
You're right, because
there's no such thing.

492
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:17,431
The blood in your urine
was from a chicken.

493
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,933
There's some kind of mistake.

494
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,136
But your story's so good,

495
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,273
we ought to give you
any painkiller you want.

496
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,304
But then you'd only
be back for more.

497
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,850
What'd you do, read
medical textbooks?

498
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:28,218
I... I'm a doctor.

499
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,699
You're a drug addict
looking for Demerol.

500
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:30,804
Connie, what do the cops do

501
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:32,169
if you're trying to
get drugs like this?

502
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:33,594
Mr. Strong, stop!

503
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,365
Mr. Strong!

504
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:39,539
Is that the new spring fashion?

505
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,261
Henry may have a
hole between his aorta

506
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,963
and pulmonary arteries.

507
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,433
He turns blue

508
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:48,438
because he's not getting
enough oxygenated blood.

509
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,042
I knew it.

510
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,778
My whole damn family.

511
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:53,794
It's not genetic, Mr. Offenbach.

512
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:55,017
Everything's genetic.

513
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,339
He said it can be
corrected. It can be, right?

514
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,911
Open heart surgery
will close the hole.

515
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,247
Eight weeks old

516
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,518
and they have to
cut his heart open.

517
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,566
It's a common operation.

518
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,842
Well, then, do it
to somebody else.

519
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,514
I'm sorry.

520
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:11,749
Shh.

521
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,986
I wanted everything to be okay.

522
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:16,709
It's not your fault.

523
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:18,579
It just happens.

524
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:23,538
Doug.

525
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:24,707
Hey, buddy.

526
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,254
Do I have to call you

527
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:28,158
Dr. Ross in the hospital?

528
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:30,217
You can call me
anything you want.

529
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:31,654
How about air head?

530
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:32,856
Wise ass.

531
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,892
Do you work Saturday mornings?

532
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:36,295
Sometimes. Why?

533
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,098
Well, um, could you get, like,

534
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,102
12 Saturday
mornings off in a row,

535
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,073
and some Tuesday and Wednesdays?

536
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:43,509
Is this a test?

537
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:45,847
Well, my little league team...

538
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:47,984
We need an assistant coach.

539
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:50,622
It's 18 games and
two practices a week.

540
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,109
Well, give me a schedule.

541
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,656
I should be able to
make most of them.

542
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,613
Is that okay?

543
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:55,782
Yeah. Great.

544
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:56,996
Dougie.

545
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,654
My name is Doug.

546
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:01,166
You never call a grownup Dougie.

547
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:03,331
Oh, and since when
did<i> you</i> grow up?

548
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:06,535
I just closed a
huge deal in Neuro.

549
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,406
Want to celebrate with me?

550
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,695
Uh, oh, uh...
Jake, this is Linda.

551
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:13,332
Linda, Jake.

552
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,646
Hi.

553
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,054
Hi.

554
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:18,641
So, celebrate?

555
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,041
What happened
to what's-his-name?

556
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,661
Brian. Boston. Business.

557
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:23,966
I'll buy you ribs

558
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,574
at Carson's. 8:30?

559
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,760
I can't.

560
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:31,299
Why'd we stop seeing each other?

561
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:33,036
I miss you a little.

562
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:35,418
All you had to do was marry me.

563
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:39,515
I don't miss you that much.

564
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,864
Yeah.

565
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,269
I got to go.

566
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:43,622
Bye.

567
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,500
Do you go out with
her or something?

568
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:50,851
I used to.

569
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:52,539
But not now.

570
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,889
Listen, Jake.

571
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,004
You know what flirting is?

572
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,029
Yeah.

573
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,710
That's what she was doing.

574
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,413
People do it all the time,

575
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:01,284
and it doesn't mean a thing.

576
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:02,589
Okay?

577
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,144
Okay.

578
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:06,098
Guess I was
hoping for a miracle.

579
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,834
I'm glad you still visit her.

580
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:09,449
I like her. She's tough.

581
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:11,453
Anyway, it's on my way to class.

582
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,010
Keeping surgeon's hours?

583
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,513
That's what Al says.

584
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,794
How do you keep a
marriage together?

585
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:16,750
I couldn't do it.

586
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,101
When I get through

587
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:20,202
the physician's assistant course

588
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,073
we'll have a normal life.

589
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,597
I get a break at 7:00.

590
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,412
You want to grab dinner?

591
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,538
Uh, I, I don't know.

592
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:29,875
It's just dinner.

593
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:31,212
Okay.

594
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,127
Dr. Benton, can you see Charlie?

595
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,553
They brought him
from the Friends School.

596
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:37,022
Yeah.

597
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:38,937
That's a fine-looking woman.

598
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:40,242
Married, huh?

599
00:20:40,297 --> 00:20:41,932
So, what's the problem?

600
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:45,188
My leg feels funny, and
my arm, I can't move it.

601
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,124
Have you been sick lately?

602
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:48,327
I had the flu.

603
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:49,663
All right.

604
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,478
We drop a lot of people.

605
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,137
Get ready.

606
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:54,606
Okay.

607
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:56,442
Doesn't look surgical.

608
00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:59,248
I'll work him up,
but find Dr. Ross.

609
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:02,888
When'd your leg get sore?

610
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,168
This morning.

611
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:06,205
Maybe a little last night.

612
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:07,630
Have any headaches?

613
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,100
From the flu.

614
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,915
I'm still sort of sick.

615
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,674
Yeah, it's going around.

616
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:15,311
Have you fallen in
the last few days?

617
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:16,608
On Saturday.

618
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:18,696
I tripped over
my little brother.

619
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,488
Yeah, they get in
the way, don't they.

620
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:21,990
Does your head hurt?

621
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,337
No. Just my arm.

622
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:24,974
And my back a little.

623
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:27,178
The diabetic girl's
mother's here.

624
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,703
Possible left-side

625
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:29,884
hemi-paresis onset 24 hours.

626
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:31,374
This is Dr. Ross.
He's going to take

627
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:32,811
good care of you, okay?

628
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,881
Thanks.

629
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:37,001
He's really nice.

630
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:38,672
Yeah. He's a prince.

631
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:40,174
Carter!

632
00:21:40,243 --> 00:21:42,090
Your tests are okay, Chloe,

633
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,717
but you need to
start eating more.

634
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:46,454
I never ate right.

635
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:48,301
Put that down, please.

636
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:50,528
Oh, I've been
screwing up so long,

637
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,032
maybe I can't ever
do anything right.

638
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:55,214
This time, you'll try harder.

639
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:57,040
All right, open wide.
Come on. Ahhh.

640
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,556
Chloe, can't you listen
to me for one second?

641
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,048
Look at it this way:

642
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:02,651
I may not be a doctor

643
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,721
but I'm giving Mom a grandchild.

644
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,558
That'll make her happy.

645
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,239
Yeah. Just what she
wants... To be a grandmother.

646
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:09,664
She'll be thrilled.

647
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:14,005
Okay. An O.B.'s coming
down to do an ultrasound

648
00:22:14,074 --> 00:22:16,276
and then you're
going to go shopping

649
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:17,912
for baby stuff, all right?

650
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:20,149
Shop till I drop. Cool.

651
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:22,772
I know I shouldn't
eat ice cream.

652
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,677
You should've taken
your insulin today.

653
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,566
And yesterday,
and the day before.

654
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:30,648
What are you talking about?

655
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:33,775
You took it, Sam, didn't you?

656
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:35,312
Mommy, it wouldn't...

657
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,731
Oh, Sam.

658
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,887
I'm tired of being sick.

659
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:42,591
I don't want to be different.

660
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,905
I'll go blind.

661
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,143
I read it

662
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,317
in the encyclopedia.

663
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:49,538
It's not fair.

664
00:22:49,606 --> 00:22:51,008
You, uh...

665
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:54,648
you have

666
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:55,750
an illness.

667
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:59,341
You want to pretend you don't.

668
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,778
Where's that going to get you?

669
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,949
Hmm?

670
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:06,771
I don't know.

671
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,759
You have to accept
the way things are.

672
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:13,500
So maybe you won't be
exactly like everybody else

673
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:17,441
but if you don't
take your insulin...

674
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,312
you'll die.

675
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:30,298
I'll be back to check on you.

676
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:36,922
The way you talked to her...

677
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:38,347
That was great.

678
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,619
2:30. I have to do a hydrocele.

679
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:45,861
Push down, like on a gas pedal.

680
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,598
Okay.

681
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,201
You like to drive,

682
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,271
there, Charlie?

683
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:51,633
Yeah. I just got my license.

684
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:53,192
Hey. Squeeze my hand.

685
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,528
Harder.

686
00:23:54,596 --> 00:23:55,996
I'm trying.

687
00:23:56,065 --> 00:23:57,482
Mm-hmm.

688
00:23:57,551 --> 00:23:59,482
All right, Malik here's
going to take you for an MRI.

689
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,101
You know what that is? Uh-uh.

690
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,527
It's kind of like an X ray,
only you lay in this big tunnel

691
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,560
and they take pictures
of the inside of your head.

692
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:06,796
Why are you taking
a picture of my head

693
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,887
when my leg hurts?

694
00:24:07,955 --> 00:24:10,574
Because I'm the
doctor, and that's what

695
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:11,743
I want to do.

696
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,214
Malik, can I talk to
you for a second?

697
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:16,887
He didn't have any
strength in his hands.

698
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,134
No, he didn't.

699
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:19,370
Find his parents.

700
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:21,306
Have Radiology put him ahead

701
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,443
of anybody who's not critical

702
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,937
and tell Benton
to look at the MRI.

703
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,707
And get a neuro consult.

704
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:29,394
Head's okay.

705
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:32,164
It's a good position.

706
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,403
Looks like a little girl.

707
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,640
Oh, a girl. Wow.

708
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,175
How's the weight?

709
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,289
Look at her move.

710
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,860
Look at... look at her hand.

711
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:42,886
Weight's a little
on the low side.

712
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:44,488
Is something wrong?

713
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:46,392
You have to
improve your nutrition

714
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:47,995
and take pre-natal vitamins.

715
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:50,032
Remember, you're
eating for two now.

716
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:52,386
Come back next week, we'll
take another look, all right?

717
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:53,588
Thanks, Janet.

718
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,958
My pleasure.

719
00:24:56,664 --> 00:24:57,665
Susie...

720
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:58,749
What?

721
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:00,084
Look at her.

722
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:01,420
I'm looking.

723
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:03,452
I told you I was
going to have a girl.

724
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:04,976
I'm going to name her Susan.

725
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:10,787
She's mine.

726
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:14,946
That's my baby, Susie.

727
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,715
Mine.

728
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:28,103
Carol?

729
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,152
No, I will not type up
your requisition forms.

730
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:31,110
Where's Doug?

731
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:32,645
Getting his head shrunk.

732
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:33,748
When will he be back?

733
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:35,029
About a half-hour. Why?

734
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:36,686
We got the MRI back on that kid.

735
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:38,690
Tell Doug to meet
me in Radiology.

736
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,628
Uh-oh.

737
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:41,930
Yeah.

738
00:25:46,557 --> 00:25:48,436
So what do we do
now, stare at inkblots?

739
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,696
God, no. I don't know
a thing about them.

740
00:25:50,764 --> 00:25:52,666
Sit down, will you?

741
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:54,704
So...

742
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:57,876
you slugged a guy in the E.R.

743
00:25:57,945 --> 00:26:00,047
That was dumb.

744
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:01,350
What?

745
00:26:01,418 --> 00:26:03,052
That was really stupid.

746
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:04,639
Uh, you're a shrink.

747
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,344
Aren't you supposed to
talk about my neuroses?

748
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:09,615
I know all about your neuroses.

749
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:12,554
You're a reasonably normal
guy with sloppy impulse control.

750
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:14,057
That's what it's called?

751
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:15,559
Yeah.

752
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:16,963
Take my advice.

753
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:19,278
You want to lose your temper?

754
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:21,404
Go pop a guy in a bar.

755
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:26,280
Are you suggesting
that I hit someone?

756
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:28,568
I'm suggesting you
don't do it at work

757
00:26:28,636 --> 00:26:29,936
or they'll fire your ass.

758
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,811
My report will say
you had a bad week.

759
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,147
You're a pediatrician, thus,

760
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:37,785
you're particularly
sensitive to child abuse.

761
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:40,256
Now, say you'll
never do it again.

762
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:41,893
I'll never do it again.

763
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:44,665
Good. Or you could
really mess up your life.

764
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,233
Thanks for stopping by.

765
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:57,154
Dr. Murphy, I have been
a little unhappy lately.

766
00:26:57,223 --> 00:26:58,691
Well, join the club.

767
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,044
Try therapy.

768
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:01,246
Might help.

769
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:03,450
Oh, and, uh, have a nice day.

770
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,832
Dr. Greene?

771
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,836
Hi. I was wondering, uh...

772
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:15,940
Dr. Lewis said
you might be willing

773
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,011
to recommend me
for an E.R. sub-i.

774
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,614
Thought you wanted surgery.

775
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:22,686
I won't get it, and I want to
consider an E.R. residency.

776
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:25,068
Carter, you might've noticed
that a recommendation from me

777
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:26,538
might not be very
helpful right now.

778
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,095
I'd like it anyway.

779
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,209
Sure. You bet.

780
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,468
Yeah?

781
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:34,992
The MRI shows an aneurysm

782
00:27:35,061 --> 00:27:38,499
at the juncture of the
basilar and vertebral arteries

783
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:39,735
in the brain stem.

784
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:41,137
How old's the kid?

785
00:27:41,205 --> 00:27:42,506
Sixteen.

786
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:45,546
I'd say you better find
this kid's parents quick.

787
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:46,548
We're looking.

788
00:27:46,616 --> 00:27:47,883
So that explains the paralysis.

789
00:27:47,952 --> 00:27:50,521
The aneurysm is pressing
down on the spinal tract.

790
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,369
I'd say it could
blow any minute...

791
00:27:52,393 --> 00:27:53,772
or it could go in a week.

792
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:55,431
Well, nothing like
a specific diagnosis.

793
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,900
Hey, Seymour.

794
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,347
Seymour Lassally, Doug Ross.

795
00:27:58,371 --> 00:27:59,550
Doug took the case in.

796
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:00,841
Hi. What do we got?

797
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:02,878
I have an astrocytoma at 4:00.

798
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,392
Whoa! That's a huge aneurysm.

799
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,084
When did paralysis start?

800
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,086
Yesterday.

801
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:08,789
We can't do this, Peter.

802
00:28:08,858 --> 00:28:11,327
He could die in 20 minutes.

803
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:13,392
Dr. Ross, the operation
requires hypothermia.

804
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:16,020
You have to cool him
down so the brain'll survive,

805
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:18,368
and shut off the
heart-lung machine.

806
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:20,306
Get lucky and
he'll come out okay,

807
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,764
but, uh, it's not for us.

808
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,946
Dyer over at
Mercy's done it a lot.

809
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,134
Call him and get
the kid over there.

810
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:27,558
You're going to pass this up?

811
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:30,531
Mike Dyer is good,
fast and confident.

812
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,066
Call him.

813
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:39,330
He jumped right over and bit me.

814
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:40,866
Well, it's minor.

815
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,904
You'll be fine.

816
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:45,992
The neighbor said
he had all his shots.

817
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:48,163
Could he have rabies?

818
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:51,370
There hasn't been a
rabid dog in Cook County

819
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,572
in 20 years.

820
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,791
Mm-hmm.

821
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,795
You're sure about the rabies?

822
00:28:55,863 --> 00:28:58,282
Yeah.

823
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:00,754
You're sweet.

824
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,626
I'm going to tell all my friends

825
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:06,136
to come here in emergencies.

826
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:10,450
Any word on the kid's parents?

827
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:12,152
The mother's on the way.

828
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:13,656
I see it's raining
finally. Uh-huh.

829
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,359
15 miles? Where's he doing it?

830
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:16,717
Yeah. Thanks.

831
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:18,632
Carter, give me your car
keys. I need your keys.

832
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,867
Thought you were on call.

833
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,793
They paged Dyer from
Mercy. He didn't answer.

834
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:24,064
They won't take the
aneurysm without his approval

835
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,567
and he's out jogging.

836
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:26,769
Come on, your keys.

837
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:28,817
GSW to the chest coming in.

838
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:30,041
What's Benton doing?

839
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,411
Out looking for Dr. Dyer.

840
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,348
It's about his mother, though.

841
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,286
Because if he can't
make her better,

842
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:36,954
then he'll fix everything else.

843
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,627
Carter, you took too
many psych classes.

844
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,777
Get somebody from surgery
down here to cover for Benton.

845
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:44,436
Shouldn't you be out of here?

846
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:45,783
Uh, 20 minutes.

847
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:47,453
So, this, uh, woman
that had the dog bite,

848
00:29:47,477 --> 00:29:48,855
I think she was
was hitting on me.

849
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:49,813
It been known to happen.

850
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:51,115
Not to me.

851
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:52,117
Did she smile a lot? Yes.

852
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:53,197
Play with her hair? Yes...

853
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,154
Touch you? On my arm.

854
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:55,424
She was hitting on you.

855
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:57,305
Hope I'm not sending
out a signal or something.

856
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,874
I mean, you know, I
mean, me and Jen...

857
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:02,269
You've been moody lately.
Women love to save moody men.

858
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:04,941
Mark, GSW to the chest.

859
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:07,412
Susan? Yeah.

860
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:08,414
On your right!

861
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:09,616
Call Radiology, stat!

862
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,098
Why don't you intubate.

863
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:13,123
I'll check his lungs.

864
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:14,159
Vitals?

865
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:15,126
Lost 500 cc's.

866
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:16,641
B.P. 50 palp. Pulse 140.

867
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:18,110
Six units o-neg ordered.

868
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:19,669
All right.

869
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:21,137
Let's go on my count.

870
00:30:21,206 --> 00:30:23,643
One, two, three.

871
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:25,023
All right. Let's roll him.

872
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:26,932
Entry wound...

873
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:28,135
Upper left chest.

874
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:32,058
Exit... below scapula.

875
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:33,796
Second entry wound...

876
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,164
Abdomen.

877
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,801
Exit... left flank.

878
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,137
Let him die.

879
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:40,107
Who is she?

880
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:41,209
Get her out of here!

881
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:42,958
Let's get a chest tube started

882
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:45,484
and let's get a surgical
resident down here.

883
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,719
I'm his mother.

884
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:48,038
Let him die.

885
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:49,603
Ma'am, you have to wait outside.

886
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:52,531
Let him die. <i>Es el diablo.</i>

887
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,111
Somebody get her
to the waiting room.

888
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:55,815
<i>- Es el diablo. Es el diablo.</i>
- He's in fib!

889
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,122
Paddles, 200.

890
00:30:58,177 --> 00:30:59,727
Charging.

891
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,314
Clear?

892
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:03,602
Clear.

893
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,537
Three hundred.

894
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:05,650
He's still in fib. Hit it.

895
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:06,936
Charging.

896
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,893
Clear?

897
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:10,465
Clear.

898
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:11,433
He's back.

899
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,546
Sinus rhythm.

900
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,483
100 migs lidocaine I.V. push.

901
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:15,508
Tension pneumo.

902
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,044
16-gauge needle.

903
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,059
Got it. Chest tube.

904
00:31:25,128 --> 00:31:26,996
Mark, do you want
to make that train?

905
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:28,543
I got to put in a chest tube.

906
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:29,500
I'll help Susan. You go.

907
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:30,503
I'm here. You go.

908
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,854
All right. Thanks.

909
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,023
Two milligrams a minute?

910
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,460
Seven and a half gloves.

911
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:35,795
Betadyne here.

912
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,299
Drape him, please.

913
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:39,201
Lidocaine? Don't need it.

914
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,962
He killed two boys
today, another last month.

915
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:48,904
You did no good for anybody.

916
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,343
Murphy found you charming.

917
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:02,791
You must've turned it on.

918
00:32:02,815 --> 00:32:04,182
I don't turn it on.

919
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,485
It's just there.

920
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:07,533
Kind of like a force of nature.

921
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:09,370
Doug, this Little League thing?

922
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,438
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

923
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,396
Yeah.

924
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:12,799
Now what did I do?

925
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,769
Was I supposed to say no?

926
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:16,438
Jake really likes you.

927
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,754
I'm glad. You're good for him.

928
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:20,012
And?

929
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:22,684
And if you're not
serious about me,

930
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:24,087
I can handle it.

931
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:27,026
I don't expect men to
move in and stay forever...

932
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:29,241
Especially you,
with your history.

933
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:30,766
Me? Mr. Commitment?

934
00:32:30,835 --> 00:32:34,372
But if you're going
to leave Jake...

935
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:36,076
I need to know, Doug.

936
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:39,582
Not for me, but for Jake.

937
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:41,252
What's our future?

938
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,156
Six months, at least.

939
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:44,825
Diane, I don't know.

940
00:32:44,894 --> 00:32:46,528
I hope we're
together a long time.

941
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:50,636
Maybe... grow old together.

942
00:32:53,043 --> 00:32:54,043
Maybe.

943
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:57,349
I can hope.

944
00:32:57,418 --> 00:33:00,238
Can I make the
station in 38 minutes?

945
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:01,707
Mark, it'll be okay.

946
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:05,147
This will be the night
that Amtrak goes on strike.

947
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,752
Watch Garrison
inFour, hypocalcemia.

948
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,590
The girl in three, orbital
fracture from softball.

949
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:12,227
Try and get a consult.

950
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:13,441
The back pain in six...

951
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:14,776
Mark... could be
a herniated disk...

952
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,035
I can read the board.

953
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:18,022
Yeah.

954
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,941
Bye.

955
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:36,668
You're Benton's
student, aren't you?

956
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:38,058
Uh, yeah.

957
00:33:38,127 --> 00:33:40,129
John Carter.

958
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:41,465
Where is he?

959
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:43,402
I think he's in surgery.

960
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:46,608
I need his charts.

961
00:33:46,677 --> 00:33:49,580
Joint Commission's
breathing down my neck.

962
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,653
I want him the
second he gets back.

963
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:54,021
I'll tell him.

964
00:33:57,565 --> 00:33:59,733
Jerry, is Dr. Benton back yet?

965
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:01,536
No. Still out in the rain.

966
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:03,407
Probably smashed up your Jeep.

967
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:04,654
Can you get his
charts together for me?

968
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:05,922
You really want that sub-i, huh.

969
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:11,321
Just get them for
me, Jerry, all right?

970
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,453
Are you Mike Dyer?

971
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:46,855
Who the hell are you?

972
00:34:46,924 --> 00:34:49,237
Peter Benton. I'm a resident
over at County General.

973
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:50,941
I have an MRI I
want you to look at.

974
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,433
You're joking.

975
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:53,782
It's in the car.

976
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:06,993
Carol, what's the diagnostic
code for diabetic ketoacidosis?

977
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:08,796
250.11.

978
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,299
Facial laceration repair?

979
00:35:10,368 --> 00:35:12,604
120-52.

980
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:13,606
Why are you doing that?

981
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:14,942
Round up some residents.

982
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,790
You never get to see this...
Woman hit by lightning.

983
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,292
Dr. Benton's charts are done.

984
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,218
I'll see them later.
Come on, Carter.

985
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,490
Nesbit, Leslie.

986
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:24,994
Struck by sideflash
lightning on 23rd Street.

987
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:26,663
Full arrest on scene.

988
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:29,134
Bystander started
CPR in seconds.

989
00:35:29,203 --> 00:35:30,905
What's she had?

990
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:33,409
Two amps epi, two
milligrams atropine.

991
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:36,716
Look at this, Carter...
Feathering burns.

992
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:38,096
Lichtenberg's flowers.

993
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,088
Yes. Very good.

994
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:41,591
She's cyanotic.

995
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,829
Hyperventilate her and
get Respiratory down here.

996
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:45,198
I'll bag her.

997
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:46,968
Handle it, Carter.

998
00:35:47,037 --> 00:35:49,017
Okay, get ready to
move her on my count:

999
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,878
One, two, three.

1000
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:54,966
Asystole. How
long since last epi?

1001
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:56,570
Seven minutes.

1002
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,394
All right, Carter.

1003
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:01,874
Give a high dose,
uh, five milligrams.

1004
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,478
Get a CBC, Chem
24, cardiac enzymes.

1005
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:05,013
Pupils fixed and dilated.

1006
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,117
Doesn't matter. You get that
temporarily with lightning strikes.

1007
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:08,152
Where the hell is everybody?

1008
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:09,422
They should be
in here seeing this.

1009
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:10,780
I got a weak pulse.

1010
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:12,043
Sinus rhythm.

1011
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:13,179
Put her on a full cross...

1012
00:36:13,203 --> 00:36:14,369
Dopamine, 400 milligrams

1013
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:15,790
of 500 D-5-W.

1014
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:17,787
Let's get a cross table
c-spine, then a chest.

1015
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:19,340
Let's order a head
CT, noncontrast.

1016
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:20,631
Right.

1017
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,900
Well done.

1018
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:22,970
Good teachers.

1019
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:23,671
Who?

1020
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:24,655
Dr. Benton

1021
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,109
Dr. Greene, Dr. Lewis.

1022
00:36:26,177 --> 00:36:27,277
Which one's the best?

1023
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:28,347
They're all good.

1024
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:30,010
They teach diplomacy, too.

1025
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:31,547
What do you want
to do with this patient?

1026
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:33,000
If X rays are okay,
then I get the CT

1027
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,957
and we'll ship her

1028
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,293
to the ICU.

1029
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,747
Yes. Shooting!

1030
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:40,797
They picked up your
mother at O'Hare.

1031
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:41,862
She's on her way to Mercy.

1032
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:43,040
What'd she say?

1033
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:44,176
I didn't talk to her.

1034
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,712
Well, it's just that...

1035
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:48,116
you know, since she and
my dad have been divorced,

1036
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:50,855
she works and all, and I
know she's going to be worried.

1037
00:36:50,924 --> 00:36:51,925
Yeah.

1038
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:56,666
I don't just have
the flu, right?

1039
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:00,206
No.

1040
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:06,017
You have an aneurysm.

1041
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:07,486
It's like a little balloon

1042
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,256
in a blood vessel in your brain.

1043
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:12,195
It doesn't sound good.

1044
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:15,401
It's not.

1045
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:17,973
Why am I going
to another hospital?

1046
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:20,260
It's a complicated operation.

1047
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:22,631
Complicated?

1048
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:24,018
Like I could die?

1049
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:28,208
Yeah... you could die.

1050
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,217
But that's not going to happen.

1051
00:37:33,286 --> 00:37:34,487
Hmm?

1052
00:37:41,568 --> 00:37:43,504
I'm going over there alone?

1053
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:46,410
Don't worry. You'll
be in good hands.

1054
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:47,412
All right?

1055
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,481
All right.

1056
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:19,003
Dr. Benton, your
charts look good.

1057
00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:20,907
Thank you.

1058
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:23,913
This student of
yours is terrific.

1059
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,450
So you found the neurosurgeon.

1060
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:29,324
Yeah. Oh, uh... car keys.

1061
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,227
My charts?

1062
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:35,268
Dr. Swift wanted
them, so I finished them.

1063
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:36,715
Yeah, well, uh... thank you.

1064
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:38,173
Excuse me?

1065
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:39,375
I, uh, said

1066
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:40,778
thank you.

1067
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:42,181
I know.

1068
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,661
I just wanted to
hear you say it twice.

1069
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:44,997
I'll see you in the
morning, Carter.

1070
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:46,468
What happened to you?

1071
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,760
I had to run an errand.

1072
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,665
Huh. Still interested in dinner?

1073
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:53,236
Yeah.

1074
00:38:57,746 --> 00:38:59,280
Is this cool or what?

1075
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,151
Yes.

1076
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,855
Does she really
need six pairs to start?

1077
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:06,193
Aren't these cute?

1078
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:07,863
Well, these are nice.

1079
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,978
Maybe we can take
some of the others back.

1080
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:12,671
Forget the bows.
Keep the patent leather.

1081
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,576
Chloe, how much did
you put on my credit card?

1082
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:18,983
I don't know, like
$100, maybe $150.

1083
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:21,054
Chloe, this is easily $300.

1084
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,665
Suz...

1085
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:32,542
I'm going to be
somebody's mother.

1086
00:39:34,615 --> 00:39:37,001
If Mom could do it, you can.

1087
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:39,506
At least I didn't
drink sangria all day.

1088
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:42,511
Yeah, or smoke
four packs of Luckys.

1089
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,047
And we turned out okay.

1090
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:46,185
And Mom didn't
have you to help her.

1091
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:52,780
It's going to be
all right, isn't it?

1092
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,488
Yeah, it's going to be fine.

1093
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:59,860
Three plus three is six.

1094
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:04,235
And four plus four is eight.

1095
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:05,972
And six...

1096
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,212
Daddy, I don't have
any more fingers.

1097
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,981
Well, I do, okay?

1098
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:12,183
Hold up six.

1099
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:14,755
Hey, banana fish,
it's time for bed.

1100
00:40:14,824 --> 00:40:16,658
But Daddy's here.

1101
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:18,662
Well, Daddy can't stop you

1102
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:21,066
from falling asleep
in school tomorrow.

1103
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:23,070
Go brush your teeth.

1104
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,408
<i>If</i> I get a story.

1105
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:27,179
Mmm... well...

1106
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:30,317
Daddy'll read you a story.

1107
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,487
Go brush your teeth.

1108
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:33,690
Go.

1109
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:40,069
Jen?

1110
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,507
It's been a long day, Mark.

1111
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,818
Should I turn
around and go back?

1112
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:49,688
I just... I can't do this.

1113
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:52,643
We need to talk about Rachel.

1114
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:54,146
I miss her.

1115
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:58,186
I need to see her more.

1116
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:04,749
You live two hours away.

1117
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:06,118
I'll move up here.

1118
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:11,195
Mark... it's over.

1119
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:14,067
No, I mean, I'll
get a place here.

1120
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:15,803
I'll commute.

1121
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,210
I want to raise my daughter.

1122
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:21,348
You'll commute?

1123
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:22,900
I'm not going to get

1124
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:24,470
that attending job.

1125
00:41:24,538 --> 00:41:27,675
I'll try to find a job here.

1126
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:29,546
If that's what you want to do.

1127
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:33,854
Look, uh, can I
stay here next week

1128
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:36,285
while I'm looking for a place?

1129
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,331
It's not a good idea.

1130
00:41:41,671 --> 00:41:43,940
Can I stay here
tonight on the couch?

1131
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,645
Daddy, aren't you coming?

1132
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,693
I'll be there in a sec.

1133
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:51,888
Get under the covers.

1134
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:55,161
Please.

1135
00:41:56,866 --> 00:41:58,834
Okay. Okay.

1136
00:41:58,903 --> 00:41:59,836
Thanks.

1137
00:41:59,905 --> 00:42:01,573
Daddy!

1138
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,082
Why don't you go read to Rachel?

1139
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,719
Yeah.

1140
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:29,492
So she stood up, and
she started to applaud.

1141
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:31,262
In the middle of graduation?

1142
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,699
The whole medical
school was staring at her.

1143
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:38,743
When I graduated from
college, my father danced.

1144
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,378
What's wrong with that?

1145
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:42,416
On a table.

1146
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,610
I hope my kids don't sit
around laughing at me.

1147
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,714
Better than hating us.

1148
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:51,216
You don't hate your mother.

1149
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:52,953
Just 'cause your mother's great

1150
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:54,256
doesn't mean mine was.

1151
00:43:00,803 --> 00:43:02,504
So, uh...

1152
00:43:02,573 --> 00:43:06,612
she's never going to
get any better, is she?

1153
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:09,768
There won't be much improvement.

1154
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,341
And there's not a damn
thing I can do about it, huh?

1155
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,512
No.

1156
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,823
I, uh...

1157
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:29,872
I wouldn't be getting
through this thing if it...

1158
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,778
if it wasn't for you.

1159
00:43:43,016 --> 00:43:47,021
I think Peter Benton can get
through just about anything.

1160
00:43:54,437 --> 00:43:56,423
He used to think so.
