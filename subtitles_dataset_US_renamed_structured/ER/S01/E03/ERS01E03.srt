00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,415
Yes, Mama?

3
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,251
Are you all right?

4
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:40,422
Just woke up early, that's all.

5
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:42,991
Go back to bed.

6
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:45,438
I'll wake you when I leave.

7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,596
You don't have to work today.

8
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,963
I want to.

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,435
If you're not ready,
no one would mind.

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,070
I know, but I am ready, Mama.

11
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:57,439
It's all right.

12
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,474
Don't worry.

13
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,813
Go on. Go back to bed.

Oh, my last, or so I thought.

28
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:11,939
Hey, Wendy.

29
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,953
Carol, welcome
back. How are you?

30
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:16,110

Well, can you find
out whose patient it is?

00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,168
Sure, but I'm on my

That's fine. Good.

Dr. Greene, is
this your patient?

No, this is my

42

How you doing, Mr. Resnick?

43
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,926
I'm having an enema.

four-year-old daughter, Grace.

50
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,438
C.C... lingering cough
and a runny nose.

51
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,941
No doubt because
the kid has a cold.

52
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,376
All right, I'll take
Baby Huey first.

You're almost done, Mr. Resnick.

55
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,932
Doug, this is the third time

56
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,900
you've asked me this morning.

57
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,235
The answer is still no.

58
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,737
We need to be a
little sensitive here.

59
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,060
It's her...

60
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,561
first day back?

61
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,096
Yeah. Yeah.

62
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,735
Excuse me.

63
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,370
I'm here to unload that
new shipment of barbiturates.

64
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,722
Hi. Hey.

65
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,125
At least you didn't kill off

66
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,304
your sense of humor.

67
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:19,644
No. Just a few brain cells.

68
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,745
Hi.

69
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,080
Hi, Jerry.

70
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,231
Jerry...

71
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,182
Jerry, you're killing me.

72
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,979
Nothing you
haven't tried already.

73
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:27,969
Don't start.

74
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:28,969
Oh, please.

75
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:31,005
Don't start what?

76
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,152
Dr. Ross asked us all to
be a little sensitive today.

77
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:35,593
Ah, there she is.

78
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,428
Whose patient is this?

79
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,629
Hey, Carol, welcome back.

80
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:39,564
Thanks.

81
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,948
Where did you find her?

82
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,967
Who is she?

83
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:42,968
I don't know.

84
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,013
Cops brought her in.

85
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,148
They found her riding
the el about 4:00 a.m.

86
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,683
She had no I.D., wouldn't talk.

87
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,007
Oh, yeah?

88
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,319
Well, she sings...

89
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,642
loudly.

90
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,978
Really?

91
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,246
Sorry, Dr. Benton.

92
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,542
All right, so who's going
to take Madame X here?

93
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,594
I've got a laceration
in the suture room.

94
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,067
Abdominal pain, room 1.

95
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,180
I will, in just a minute,

96
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:03,082
but Dr. Jones wants
these X rays right away.

97
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:05,773
Oh, I'll get it.

00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:07,291

Any congestion,
vomiting, diarrhea?

104
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,627
No. He just doesn't seem right.

105
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:29,364
Have you or your wife
been sick recently? No.

106
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,800
Do you have other
kids, or a baby-sitter?

107
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,935
No. We never even left
him with a baby-sitter.

108
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:36,821
Okay. We're going to
get some blood tests,

109
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,024
and we're going to do
some fever control measures

110
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,291
to get his temperature down,

111
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,210
and we'll see how he
does, okay? All right.

112
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,895
He looks a little lethargic.

113
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,596
Let's get a CBC,

114
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,083
blood culture, chest,
urine, throat swabs.

115
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,179
And hope against hope

116
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,603
we don't have to
do a lumbar puncture

117
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,724
or we're looking at
a Valium drip for dad.

118
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,726
By the way, have you seen...?

119
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,739
No, but I certainly
will remember

120
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:01,741
to be sensitive when I do.

121
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:05,750
If you ever want to take a
few minutes, talk about it...

122
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,118
Thanks.

123
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,121
See you around.

124
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,800

125
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,124
Not back yet.

126
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,792
Okay. Thanks.

127
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,906
Hey, Carol, I hope
you don't mind

128
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,308
that we were joking
with you earlier.

129
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,299
You don't think
attempted suicide

130
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,967
is something to joke about?

131
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,969
Jerry, don't worry. It was fine.

132
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,638
Okay. If you ever want
to talk or anything...

133
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,141
Boy, am I happy to see you.

134
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,144
'Cause I don't have to
be charge nurse anymore.

135
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,812
Welcome back.

136
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,482
Carol, I have the perfect
first-day-back patient for you.

137
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,484
Jerry, where did
they drop Arthur?

138
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,498

139
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,821

140
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,023
Yeah.

141
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,159
So, how's it going?

142
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,827
Couldn't wait for
this day to get here.

143
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,130
Now I think I'll be
glad when it's over.

144
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,165
I feel like everyone's
watching me.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,046
Everyone is, but no one
is looking for you to fail,

146
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,181
if that's what you're
worried about.

147
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,172
My shrink wanted me to consider

148
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,175
working in a doctor's
office instead of the E.R.

149
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,521
Uh-huh. Dermatology's good.

150
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,844
I don't think so.

151
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,847
Maybe this was too
soon to dive back in.

152
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,527
Come on. It's
Monday. It'll be easy.

153
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,852
Kids who faked being
sick to stay out of school,

154
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,199
a few people who partied
too hard this weekend...

155
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,856
and Arthur.

156
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,192
Gosh, it is good to be back.

157
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,994
All the familiar faces.

158
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,867
Arthur?

159
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,602
Arthur, get up!

160
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,371
Come on, let's go.

161
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,373
Ma'am?

162
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,377
Ma'am?

163
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,712
Ma'am, are, uh...?

164
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,881
Are you okay?

165
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,783
I mean, I can see that...

166
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,485
that you're not okay.

167
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,587
Uh... if I could
just get your...

168
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,189
your name for the... the, uh...

169
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,391
If I could just get your...

170
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,393
your first name?

171
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,895
Or your...?

172
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,897
It's okay, actually.

173
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,911
I don't need your name.

174
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,901
Um...

175
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,038
Hey, now, uh...
would you, uh...?

176
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,807
Would you... like a drink?

177
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,087
I know I would like a drink.

178
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,128
Gunshot wound's on its way.

179
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:15,463
When?

180
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:16,964
Now.

181
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,553
Malik, find Benton,
clear trauma 1

182
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,288
and notify the O.R.

183
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,789
Lydia, draw a CBC.

184
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,992
Get the lab to cross and
type six units whole blood.

185
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,461
Find out how much
"0" negative's around.

186
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,141
This guy's a major bleeder.

187
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,805
We've got another
one... 79-year-old male,

188
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,233
probable heart attack.

189
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,202
E.M.T.s are here in two minutes.

190
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,205
Call Susan Lewis, and
get the cardiologist on call.

191
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,873
A couple of sick kids?
Weekend partiers?

192
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,192
Welcome home.

193
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,543
He's in shock.

194
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,212
Keep those I.V.s wide open.

195
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,074
All right, people.

196
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:50,798
Show time. Let's move.

197
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,753
He's not breathing.

198
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,323
Get the intubation tray.

199
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,143
All right, no breath sounds.

200
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:03,656
Hyperresonant on the left side.

201
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,957
He's got a touch of pneumo.

202
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,415
Let's et a chest tube,
and let's get it now. Move.

203
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,050
Seven and a half?

204
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,501
Where the hell is X ray?

205
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,236
I'll find them.

206
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,271
Check with Susan.

207
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,788
See if she needs help
with that heart guy.

208
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,803
We need X ray, trauma 1.

209
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:18,159
He's on his way.

210
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:19,661
Hey, welcome back to Beirut.

211
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,340
I could use some company.

212
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:22,663
Timmy, find Pam.

213
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:23,715
What have you got?

214
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,228
Classic heart attack symptoms...

215
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,385
Sudden onset, crushing
substernal chest pains

216
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,332
radiating down left
arm with diaphoresis.

217
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,300
Had nitro spray times
two without relief,

218
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,724
and five milligrams morphine.

219
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,225
Hey, Carol, hi. Hey.

220
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,504
Vitals?

221
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,146
BP's down 90/50, respiration 24.

222
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:39,813
He was in sinus rhythm.

223
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,150
Went into this as we pulled up.

224
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,630
Okay, one, two, three.

225
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:46,798
Mr. Flanagan, I'm Dr. Lewis.

226
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:48,389
How's your pain now?

227
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:49,723
Oh, much better.

228
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,392
Dr. Kayson's my cardiologist.

229
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,127
Someone was going to call him.

230
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,973
Okay, let's check on Dr. Kayson.

231
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:55,963
Get an EKG,

232
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:57,298
chest, CBC,

233
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,317
Chem seven, enzymes
and coag panel.

234
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,985
BP's 90/55.

235
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,698
Pulse is racing at 180.

236
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,300
What's his rhythm
look like to you?

237
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,469
It's hard to say. V-tach,
we need to shock him.

238
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,826
You want to do it?

239
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,840
No. He seems relatively stable.

240
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,347
Let's try adenosine...
Six milligrams

241
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:15,383
I.V. push.

242
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,071
Heart rate's dropping.

243
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,319
BP's down. Down to 50 palp.

244
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,663
Damn. Get the
external pacemaker.

245
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,683
Where's the pacer?

246
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,017
In the drawer.

247
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,030
Carol, stay put. We
need you in here.

248
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,288
Take this to Susan in 4.

249
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,273
How's the belly?

250
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:40,608
Abdomen is rigid.

251
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:41,953
You got it. Lavage time.

252
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:43,110
Anesthesia?

253
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:44,523
Well, I'd say his buddies

254
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,947
already took care of it for us.

255
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,617
Heart rate's still low.

256
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:51,619
Give him another
milligram of atropine.

257
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:52,965
Pacemaker's capturing.

258
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,288
Is the dopamine running?

259
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,624
Yes. You sure you don't
want to intubate him?

260
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,637
He's biting down. I'd
have to paralyze him,

261
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,862
which I'd rather not do
considering his low BP.

262
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:01,941
Dr. Lewis? Keep bagging.

263
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,192
Nothing's going right.

264
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,694
This guy's blood gas stinks.

265
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,895
Did you reach Kayson?

266
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,552
He's being paged.

267
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,887
I can't wait.

268
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,489
Get the Pavulon, Versed and SUX.

269
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,141
Prep a dose of
TPA, just in case.

270
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,476
Vitals?

271
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,912
BP's 50/30, respiration's
36, pulse 140.

272
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,248
All right, let's take a look.

273
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:21,616
Catheter.

274
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,570
His S.T. wave is way up.

275
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,904
Acute M.I.

276
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,088
We're in trouble.

277
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,557
You want to inject TPA?

278
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,873
Hand me his old chart.

279
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,992
He has no contraindications
to giving TPA,

280
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,634
but I don't want to
start him bleeding.

281
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,168
90/60. How's his pressure?

282
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:42,815
Oh. man. Okay,
we got to go with it.

283
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,851
5,000 units Heparin and TPA ten
milligrams push, 60 over one hour.

284
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,070
Let's get another EKG.
Keep him on the monitor.

285
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,061
BP?

286
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,430
Still 90/60.

287
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,114
He's in V-fib.

288
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,916
Crash cart.

289
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:57,735
Yes. 200?

290
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,837
And clear.

291
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,958
Clear again.

292
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:09,057
I'm Dr. Kayson.
What have we got?

293
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,181
He's having an
acute inferior wall M.I.

294
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,500
I just started TPA.

295
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,834
Without consulting me?

296
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,814
He should go to cath
lab for angioplasty.

297
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,471
I felt drug therapy
was indicated.

298
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:19,118
Did you think
angioplasty wasn't?

299
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,675
No. Of course not. But, since...

300
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,721
Well, I favor a more
aggressive approach.

301
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,479
That's one opinion. I chose
drugs. They're less invasive.

302
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:27,392
Dr. Lewis, Mr. Flanagan
is my patient.

303
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,883
You're a resident.

304
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,418
All decisions concerning
his care will be made by me.

305
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,582
Call the cath lab. Tell
them we're on the way up.

306
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,572
Vitals?

307
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,441
Blood pressure is 110/70.

308
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,109
Pulse is 90.

309
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,111
Okay. Pacemaker
captured... That's a start.

310
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,012
Prep another milligram atropine.

311
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,347
Keep bagging.

312
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,766
All right, come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Move!

313
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,102
I'll get up to the blood bank.

314
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,770
How's that M.I.?

315
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,451
Kayson seems to
have it under control.

316
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,141
Want to grab some coffee?

317
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:00,214
That was good
work in there, Carol.

318
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,550
You may have doubts
about being back,

319
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:04,552
but none of us do.

320
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:06,320
Thanks.

321
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,785
Have you seen Morgenstern?

322
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,787
No.

323
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,567
Doug, have you seen Susan?

324
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,191
Am I the hall monitor? No!

325
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,804
Mark, need you in exam 4.

326
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,139
Mrs. Cheung, early 30s.

327
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,506
Eye and cheek badly swollen,

328
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,142
facial lacerations,
bruised ribs.

329
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,443
Don't know how it happened.

330
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,744
She doesn't speak English,

331
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,768
but her son does.

I'm not wrong.

It was a bad
call. Admit it, Div.

343
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,866
Anybody could have made it.

344
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,923

347
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,472
There were two outs.

348
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,873
McDowell had it
sewed up right there.

349
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,730
Yeah. Until he
threw it in the dugout.

350
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,936
Right. What do you need?

351
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,971
This is Madame X.

352
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,538
I've completed a physical,

353
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,451
but I'm having a little trouble

with the psych exam.

355
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:21,245
Did you run the mental
status questions?

356
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,091
Tried. Half the
time, she screamed.

357
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,349
The other half the
time, she was in tears.

358
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,335
Okay, let's see what we can do.

359
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,437

She fell down the stairs.

363
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,863
At your house?

364
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,348
Yeah.

365
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:43,684
Did you see her fall, Frank?

366
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,752
Yeah.

367
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:50,157
And you live at 311
West MacArthur.

368
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:52,727
Apartment "A"?

369
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:57,531
Apartment "A."

370
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,934
That would be
on the third floor.

371
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,168
Right, Frank?

372
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:04,438
No. We live on the first floor.

373
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,725
So where were the stairs?

374
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,834
<i>Lao tai hai bin dou?</i>

375
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,902
<i>Kinman...</i>

376
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,002
<i>nei ng sai ken.</i>

377
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,671
<i>Kiu koi bong mamee ler.</i>

378
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,921
Will you help her?

379
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:27,194
Yes, we will.

380
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,680
Malik, why don't you

381
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,248
take Frank back out front?

382
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,427
Come on, Frank.

383
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,596
I'll show you how
to get free stuff

384
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,131
out of the candy machine, huh?

385
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,121
X rays?

386
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,455
Yes.

387
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,635
Left orbit, chest and ribs.

388
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,795
What do you bet we find
a few healed fractures?

389
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,660
My dad once saw Benny Goodman

390
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:51,318
play at the old Monroe Theater.

391
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,565
On 33rd street?

392
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:54,688
Yep.

393
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,869
I used to sing
there during the war.

394
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:58,670
All those boys in uniform.

395
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,728
Well, he was one of them.

396
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:01,862
Who knows?

397
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:03,864
Maybe you even danced with him.

398
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,111
I never thought to
talk to her about music.

399
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,146
I don't even know
anything about music.

400
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,603
Neither does he.

401
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:13,774
So you ready to try
some of those questions?

402
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,275
Like on<i> Jeopardy?</i>

403
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,079
Can you tell me where you are?

405
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:21,915
What is a jail?

406
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:23,951
No. No, you're not in jail.

407
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:26,098
The cops brought me<i> in</i> here.

408
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,522
Okay, okay, I'll
give you that one.

409
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,208
Um... Do you know
what year it is?

410
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,445
Um... What is 1948?

411
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,580
And who's the president?

412
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,449
Harry Truman.

413
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,884
Who is...

414
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,885
Harry Truman?

415
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,221
Okay, now, this is a
different kind of question.

416
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,356
If you found a sealed letter

417
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,791
with a stamp on it, okay,

418
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:51,111
lying in the street,
what would you do?

419
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,779
Uh...

420
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,481
I... I would, uh...

421
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:59,119
I... would...

422
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,454
It's okay.

423
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,456
Forget it. We'll
try another one.

424
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:03,824
We'll try another one.

425
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,160
Can you tell me
what the difference is

426
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,894
between a child and a dwarf?

427
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,183
I am a child,

428
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,318
but I'm not a dwarf.

429
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,764
Excellent.

430
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,071
Very good. Good.

431
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:20,824
Carol.

432
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,904
Dr. Morgenstern.

433
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:22,893
Walk with me.

434
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,161
You glad to be back?

435
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,340
Glad to be anywhere.

436
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,541
How's your family handling this?

437
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,143
Pretty good. I
think, for a while,

438
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,878
they were afraid
it was their fault.

439
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,213
And how are you holding up?

440
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,869
Okay. Just hoping
to slip back into work,

441
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,039
and not have everyone
make such a big deal about it.

442
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,084
It<i> is</i> a big deal.

443
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,685
People<i> should</i> be concerned:

444
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,021
your family, the staff.

445
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,939
But everyone felt you were ready

446
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:41,946
to come back.

447
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,313
Thank you.

448
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,315
You're welcome.

449
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,830
Now go work too hard.

450
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,854
Hypothyroidism?

451
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,290
Cushing's syndrome?

452
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,458
Hepatolenticular degeneration?

453
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,759
Vascular disease?

454
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,172
When you hear hooves,

455
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,007
think horses, not zebras.

456
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,015
You mean, think
obvious: think Alzheimer's.

457
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,145
That would account for the
mood swings, loss of memory,

458
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,412
confused judgment, yeah.

459
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,836
What should I do with her?

460
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,881
Find her family.

461
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,225
She probably just wandered off.

462
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,694
Mr. Carter, I asked
you to check her over,

463
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,846
not to become her
personal physician.

464
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,655
I see Malik taught
you his trick.

465
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,300
Frank... I know
sometimes it's scary

466
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,901
to tell the truth...

467
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,038
especially about stuff
that happens at home.

468
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,307
Like when your
mom and dad argue,

469
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,909
you don't want to
take sides, right?

470
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,580
Telling the truth
isn't taking sides.

471
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,249
It's just saying what happened.

472
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:55,335
And, if we knew what really
happened to your mom...

473
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:58,572
we might be able
to help her more.

474
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:02,443
She didn't really fall
down the stairs, did she?

475
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,490
Here you go.

476
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,460
Don't worry, Frank.

477
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,546
Your mom's going
to be fine, all right?

478
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,248
Just fine.

479
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:37,210
Hey!

480
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,211
Going to lunch?

481
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,247
Uh...

482
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,848
You know, the cafeteria

483
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,983
has taken a real
dive since you left.

484
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,485
It's got all this low-fat
health food junk.

485
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:46,553
It's a major drag.

486
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:48,421
Doug, I can't really do this.

487
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:49,489
Do what?

488
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:50,557
Go to lunch?

489
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:52,459
Look, I'm not asking you out.

490
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:53,661
I'm not suggesting

491
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:55,829
that we should see
each other... again.

492
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:57,464
Hey, Carol, I'm sorry I'm late.

493
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,432
Had a knee
arthroscopy on this kid...

494
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:01,635
Captain of the high
school football team.

495
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,287
His folks are a little worried

496
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,789
about his college
scholarship, but...

497
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,967
Doug, you know John Taglieri.

498
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,957
Hi, John.

499
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,941
Hi, Doug.

500
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,159
How's pediatrics?

501
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,462
You must have a
lot of worried parents.

502
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,463
All of them.

503
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,048
So maybe we should go, huh?

504
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,048
Yeah.

505
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,617
But not the cafeteria.

506
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,252
No burgers, no fries.

507
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:19,753
Place is worthless.

508
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,308
Hey, really good
seeing you again.

509
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,894
That's a really funny story.

510
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:34,897
I'm going to have to
remember that one, Mr. Karnow.

511
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,899
Dr. Carter? Yes?

512
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:39,223
Can I see you for a minute?

513
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,857
Excuse me.

514
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,771
You were supposed to be

515
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,906
in Radiology 20 minutes ago.

516
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,329
Yes.

517
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,165
Look, he can talk about
his mother, his father,

518
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,179
his brother, his
sister, his dog.

519
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,181
Your job is to remained focused

520
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,516
on his medical problem, okay?

521
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,017
Bird touching down
in two minutes.

522
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,886
Teenagers. Some
kind of boating accident.

523
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,988
All right, now, these
chopper jockeys move fast,

524
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,790
so stay close, pay
attention, listen up,

525
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,079
don't go near the rear blade,

526
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,581
and try not to
fall off the roof.

527
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,862
You're really not being
much help with this, Mark.

528
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,120
Well, I've surrendered. You haven't
been able to decide for six months.

529
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,701
But I've really narrowed it
down to either the Cherokee,

530
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,603
Explorer, Montero,
Trooper or Pathfinder.

531
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,092
What? No 4Runner?

532
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,572
Susan, Mark, I'm going to switch

533
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,173
this week's M&M
to this afternoon.

534
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,948
I want Dr. Kayson to come,
and he can't be there on Friday.

535
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,117
Dr. Kayson?

536
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,918
Present your heart
case from this morning.

537
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:25,919
Mr. Flanagan.

538
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,704
Excellent teaching case.

539
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,473
All part of the process.

540
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,041
I'll see you at 5:00.

541
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,443
Oh, God.

542
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,445
He didn't crump, did he?

543
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,657
No. I gave him TPA.

544
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,492
Kayson wanted angioplasty.

545
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,594
Just hate to get into it again.

546
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,852
Well, I'm sure It will be an
excellent teaching case, Susan.

547
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,955
Follow me.

548
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,957
Stay close, all right?

549
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,127
Don't get in the way,
whatever you do.

550
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,799
Stay on me.

551
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,201
I'll call you.

552
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,884
Go!

553
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,492
What have you got?

554
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:22,859
16-Year-old girl...

555
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,794
Jet Ski accident by Navy Pier.

556
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,232
Boyfriend tried to
outrun a 20-foot whaler.

557
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,334
Altered L.O.C. from head trauma.

558
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,013
Okay, go. What are her vitals?

559
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,837
Four-inch scalp laceration.

560
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,839
Bleeding controlled
with pressure.

561
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,508
Carter, go! Move!

562
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,477
Left arm and right leg with
obvious support fractures.

563
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:43,480
Vitals are 60/40,
pulse 140 and thready.

564
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,016
GCS 3-4-3. Skin
is pale and cool.

565
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,485
How long was she
down in the water?

566
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,719
Three minutes max.

567
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,556
Boyfriend started
CPR, got her sputtering.

568
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,857
Was there any...?

569
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:54,858
Carter, move!

570
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,861
Get the door! Go ahead. Go!

571
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,396
Bring her down.

572
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:03,867
Mr. Layton, Huey's test results

573
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,880
failed to show a
source of infection.

574
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,705
What does that mean?

575
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,150
It doesn't necessarily
mean anything

576
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,386
but, with his lethargy, we
need to rule out meningitis,

577
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,004
so I would like to do
a lumbar puncture.

578
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,211
Lumbar puncture?

579
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,424
A spinal tap.

580
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,415
Spinal tap?

581
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,667
You'll have to fill me in.

582
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,657
Dr. Carter?

583
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,041
Uh... she's 16.

584
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:31,061
There was an accident on
the lake. She's hypotensive.

585
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,630
I think she was
underwater five minutes.

586
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:34,631
Three minutes.

587
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,378
Multiple trauma, hypotension,

588
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,967
tachycardia, GCS 3-4-3,

589
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,731
multiple extremity fractures,

590
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,332
neuro and vascular intact.

591
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:42,856
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

592
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:44,457
We'll take it from here.

593
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:45,926
Let's move, people.

594
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,962
Tell X ray we need a
cross table, C-spine...

595
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,463
Chem seven, CBC-type,

596
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:52,599
and crossmatch eight
units packed cells.

597
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,319
Call the O.R. Tell them
we'll be down. Let's move.

598
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,915
The bathroom is right over here,

599
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:59,073
you want to splash
some water on your face.

600
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:01,320
Malik will show you
where you can wait, okay?

601
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,576
Thank you.

602
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,111
There you go.

603
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,179
Hey.

604
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:06,880
I heard you had a crasher.

605
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:08,760
The trials of fatherhood.

606
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:10,384
Talk to Carol yet?

607
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:11,463
I tried to.

608
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,786
Taglieri showed up.

609
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,288
You're not surprised, are you?

610
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,056
They've been
going out for a while.

611
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:18,658
You didn't expect her to
pine away for you forever.

612
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:19,704
No, I didn't.

613
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,362
Just hoped she would?

614
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:23,641
Yeah. Nobody
likes being replaced.

615
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,876
All right, I did it first.

616
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,244
Although, for the life of me,

617
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:27,312
I can't remember why.

618
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,270
Maybe it was just
because you're stupid,

619
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:31,972
childish, immature...

620
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,288
I get the point.

621
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,650
We'll have someone in here

622
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,461
to do your stitches in
a few minutes, okay?

623
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,462
Thank you.

624
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:39,930
Sure. Your blood test came back.

625
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,199
You didn't tell me
you have leukemia.

626
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,946
You asked what I came
in for... this darn cut.

627
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,604
I feel so stupid,
slipping in the kitchen.

628
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,156
You're supposed to
slip in the bathtub, right?

629
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,693
I don't think you slipped,
Mrs. Packer. I think you fainted.

630
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:55,094
Your white blood cell and
platelet counts are very low.

631
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,462
You have severe aplastic anemia.

632
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:58,760
If someone could
just sew me up...

633
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,551
You need to be
admitted to the hospital

634
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:03,353
for a blood transfusion.

635
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,423
That's just not
possible... not today.

636
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,909
Mrs. Packer, without
transfusion of blood components,

637
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:10,944
you're susceptible to
infection, bleeding...

638
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,278
Possibly even a heart attack.

639
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:13,641
I know all about it, Doctor.

640
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,977
I've been dealing with
this for quite some time.

641
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,669
And time is something
that I don't have

642
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,404
a great deal of anymore.

643
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,684
I'd rather not spend
it in the hospital.

644
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,292
Now, if I could just
get a few stitches.

645
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:30,146
Okay. We'll have someone
in here in a minute, all right?

646
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,681
Thank you.

647
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,573
I know. I know.

648
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:41,641
Okay.

649
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:44,177
All right, you're
a very brave boy.

650
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:45,379
All finished.

651
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,548
Dr. Carter, next time
you can do the lumbar.

652
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,017
Come here, buddy.

653
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:51,018
Here we go.

654
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:52,035
I know.

655
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,103
I know.

656
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,272
It's all over.

657
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,473
Come on.

658
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,888
Susan needs you
to do some stitches

659
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,346
by the nurse's desk.

660
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,447
Okay.

661
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,082
Hey.

662
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,570
Hey, have you seen Mark?

663
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,594
No. Sorry.

664
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,697
Hanging in?

665
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,566
We still having coffee later?

666
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:23,767
Yeah, sure.

667
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,212
That ought to do
it, Mrs. Packer.

668
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,568
Thank you.

669
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,914
Are you okay?

670
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,116
No.

671
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,724
Shh! You're going to be okay.

672
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,308
You're going to be okay.

673
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,501
Shh...

674
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,621
You know, when I think
of all the great ones,

675
00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:37,490
Ella Fitzgerald is
probably my favorite.

676
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,226
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:42,095
I mean, she's amazing.

678
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:43,797
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

679
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,167
And the music...

680
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,503
There's nothing
like that music today.

681
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,473
No, there isn't.

682
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:54,707
No.

683
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:58,294
Do you want to sing?

684
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,942

Excuse me.

696
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,207
My breasts hurt.

697
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:02,709
Okay.

698
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:04,411
Dr. Carter, please.

699
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,246
And your name again?

700
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,198
Proserpina, daughter of Ceres,

701
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,317
who was whisked away
into the dark, dank bowels

702
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,119
of the underworld by Pluto,

703
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:15,472
who not only had
his way with her,

704
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,324
but also forced her to eat

705
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,460
three red, ripe, dripping
pomegranate seeds.

706
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:23,463
And to think you could
have missed all this.

707
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,932
All right, Miss
Pina, let's start

708
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,435
with a Social Security number.

709
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,353
Jennifer make it by for lunch?

710
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,067
No. She had a job interview

711
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,436
with Pitten, Pitten
and Stefronofsky.

712
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,759
What a mouthful. I'd
hate to be the receptionist.

713
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,940
I'm going to take off early
and meet her for dinner.

714
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,730
Don't leave before
today's teaching session.

715
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,599
I need all the friends
I can get with Kayson.

716
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,446
Miss your interrogation?
I don't think so.

717
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,114
Mark? I need you for a minute.

718
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,437
Don't be late.

719
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,284
That little boy, Frank,
wants to talk to you.

720
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:50,607
About his mother?

721
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,819
Didn't say, but I think

722
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,254
that's a pretty good guess.

723
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,558
He's scared to death.

724
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,025
Shot again, huh?

725
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,983
Never have I seen such a thing.

726
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,718
I've turned into a magnet.

727
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,852
What's your name, sir?

728
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,200
Ivan Gregor. He
owns a liquor store.

729
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,723
They're damn bad shots.

730
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,425
Maybe I should buy a gun.

731
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,628
Never wanted one around,
but what I am supposed to do?

732
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,008
Calm down, Mr. Gregor.

733
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,410
Let's get him in here.

734
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,578
Call Radiology.

735
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,302
Let's get a left tib-fib
X ray right away.

736
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,370
Carter!

737
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,317
Malik, can you go find Carter?

738
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:23,818
He's been disappearing.

739
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:26,454
All right, people, we're
going to do this on my count,

740
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:27,989
and we're going to do it right.

741
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:30,680
Lisa, I don't think
that we should...

742
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,585
Okay.

743
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,090
Remember that thing
that you did the other night?

744
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,093
Mm-hmm. The thing in
the car or in the kitchen?

745
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,772
The thing on the stairs.

746
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,096
Mm-hmm.

747
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,464
Well, there's nothing
compared to...

748
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:53,136
I don't think we have
any uneven parallel bars.

749
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,593
You know what they
say in med school?

750
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:03,263
S-1, S-2, S-3, S-4,

751
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:05,915
keep the pelvis off the floor.

752
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,519
Patient: Gregor, Ivan.

753
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,355
Medical record 6955.

We can start a
transfusion immediately.

760

You'd only have to
be here one night.

761
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,467
I know that doesn't seem
like very long to either of you.

762
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:42,235
To me, it is an eternity.

We need a wheelchair!

780
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,665
And has your
father hit her before?

781
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,753
Has your father
ever hit you, Frank?

782
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:44,047
Does your father know that
you and your mom are here?

784
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:48,685
I guess I shouldn't have told.

785
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,738
No, no, no, no. You
did the right thing.

786
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:56,108
We're going to try and get
some people to help you, okay?

787
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,431
Why don't you go back
in and see your mom?

788
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,435
Call Social Services

789
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,604
and Children and
Family Services.

790
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,941
See if anyone can come
up with a shelter for them.

791
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,943
Let me know when they're here.

792
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:16,980
Don't think I've seen
such an old little boy.

793
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:21,796
So you elected
not to cardiovert?

794
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,952
He seemed stable.

795
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,754
Hypotensive with chest pain?

796
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,322
The pain was controlled.

797
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,423
Somewhat.

798
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,825
Let's continue, please.

799
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:31,011
Could be a wide
complex tachycardia.

800
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,556
Was that a consideration?

801
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,281
I felt it was rate-related.

802
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:35,348
Which it wasn't.

803
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,627
No. Heart rate fell.

804
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,929
EKG shows an
acute inferior wall M.I.

805
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:40,732
Why the delay on the intubation?

806
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:42,272
You had the bad gasses.

807
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,241
I was hoping he'd come
around with bagging.

808
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:48,011
When I got the gasses
back, I tubed him.

809
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:50,525
So you recommended
drug therapy... TPA?

810
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,710
I do angioplasty with my M.I.s.

811
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,434
Jumping in with TPA
messed everything up.

812
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:55,646
He had no contraindications,

813
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,748
you weren't available,
and time is heart muscle.

814
00:35:57,772 --> 00:35:58,772
I was on my way!

815
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:00,106
I didn't know that.

816
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:01,953
People, please. It's
just a teaching session.

817
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:03,126
What was the outcome?

818
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,178
Did the angio cath,
and it was a mess.

819
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:06,846
Bled like a stuck pig.

820
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:07,930
Before I got

821
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,467
to the angioplasty,
his heart rhythm

822
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,851
went haywire.

823
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:13,569
Shocked him once,
then he came around.

824
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,605
EKG came back to
normal... The artery opened.

825
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,367
So you never did angioplasty?

826
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:18,908
Well, I could hardly...

827
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,610
and the TPA worked.

828
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,811
Yes.

829
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:28,101
Dr. Benton, what
would you have done?

830
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,323
Angioplasty.

831
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,208
Dr. Langworthy?

832
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,727
Angioplasty.

833
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,713
Dr. Greene?

834
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,549
Angioplasty.

835
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:54,422
Just because we're friends

836
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,424
doesn't mean we're
always going to agree.

837
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,147
That's not the
point. The point is,

838
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,849
I'm getting dragged
over the coals,

839
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,651
you stroll in late,
don't say a word.

840
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,130
Well, I missed the first half.

841
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,565
How was I supposed to comment?

842
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,656
Didn't stop you from
commenting in the end.

843
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,102
Why do I feel like a traitor?

844
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,270
It wasn't personal.

845
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:10,760
I'm<i> dying</i> out there,

846
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,263
and you're siding with
the slicers and dicers.

847
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,665
Benton, Langworthy...
They're all surgeons.

848
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,134
All they ever want to
do is cut people open.

849
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,481
That may be a little
bit of an exaggeration.

850
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,139
The patient was fine
with a dose of TPA

851
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,408
versus a $10,000
surgical procedure.

852
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,842
My decision was valid.

853
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,661
You should have backed me up.

854
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:31,664
Have you seen the chart on the
sliced finger in the stitch room?

855
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,666
Yep. Hey, did
Proserpina find you?

856
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:34,834
Who?

857
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:36,168
Oh, Liz. Yeah.

858
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:38,504
She seems like
an interesting girl.

859
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,672
Yep. Yeah, she is.

860
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,686
I knew a girl like that once.

861
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,521
Freshman year of college.

862
00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:46,105
"Penicillin" was
her middle name.

863
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:52,902
No meningitis.

864
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,370
He's got no infection.

865
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:57,407
You got to continue to
monitor his temperature,

866
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:01,244
and you have his doctor check
the blood cultures tomorrow.

867
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,579
All righty. Thank you.

868
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,029
Okay?

869
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:07,934
Hey.

870
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:09,102
Hey.

871
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:10,719
Want to get some coffee?

872
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,658
Uh... you know, I'm not sure
right now is really a good time.

873
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,626
We'll go outside,

874
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:19,374
we'll watch them polish
up the ambulances.

875
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,197
Well, uh... yeah. Okay.

876
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,332
I'll just be a few minutes.

877
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,717
Okay.

878
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,968
Dr. Lewis was so persistent,

879
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,954
I had to agree to a transfusion

880
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,477
just to get rid of her.

881
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:37,213
We're just worried
about you, Mrs. Packer.

882
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,893
I'm worried about missing

883
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,295
my granddaughter's
christening tonight.

884
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,463
8:00 service.

885
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,687
Well, your family could
always reschedule.

886
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:45,766
Why should they?

887
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,635
I'm not going to die on them.

888
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,836
Not today.

889
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,560
You know, in all this mess,

890
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,429
I've had a lot of time
to think about dying.

891
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,080
Can't say I recommend it.

892
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:59,469
A nice fat stroke would
have suited me better.

893
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:04,740
But each morning I wake
up I think of as a gift and...

894
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,309
there's this feeling I have...

895
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,945
I don't know when
it's going to happen,

896
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,714
but I know when it's not.

897
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,084
I'm not going to die today.

898
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,521
I am going to a christening.

899
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,789
Father showed
up ten minutes ago,

900
00:39:24,813 --> 00:39:27,133
very determined to leave.

901
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,316
Mr. Cheung...

902
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:31,617
I'm Dr. Greene.

903
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:34,386
You like to go somewhere
to talk this through?

904
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:35,755
There is no need,

905
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,884
but thank you.

906
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,388
I want to get my family home.

907
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:44,748
This mother and son
need to get to a shelter.

908
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:47,223
They've got to want to go.

909
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:50,253
Frank told me that
his father hit her.

910
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,454
Look at her face.

911
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,856
She denies it.

912
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,370
My son was very upset
when his mother fell.

913
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,503
Confused.

914
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,044
You understand.

915
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:06,052
Frank...

916
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,554
please ask your
mother again for me.

917
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:09,922
Will you?

918
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,317
Can we get Children
and Family Services here?

919
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,586
Not unless the
child's been beaten.

920
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,655
How can you say such a thing?

921
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,457
Has your father
ever hit you, Frank?

922
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,183
Frank, did your
father hit your mom?

923
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:48,861
No...

924
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,346
No.

925
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,549
<i>Hao, zen mo?</i>

926
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,585
<i>Fai dee, fai dee.</i>

927
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,123
Thank you for your concern.

928
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,733
Mmm! I don't think so.

929
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,568
I'll get it.

930
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,470
Uh...

931
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,540
Who was... Who was Jimmy Dorsey?

932
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,575
Glenn Miller.

933
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,789
Well, I got Duke
Ellington, didn't I?

934
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,345
Big deal.

935
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,773
What are we doing here?

936
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:35,308
We're waiting.

937
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:37,137
Your granddaughter's
here. Remember?

938
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,422
You're going home.

939
00:41:38,446 --> 00:41:39,579
That's right.

940
00:41:39,614 --> 00:41:41,748
My granddaughter's here.

941
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:44,300
Did you meet her?

942
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,217
Yes.

943
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,703
I'm going home.

944
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,605
Yes.

945
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,241
Can you come?

946
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:53,254
Well, I'm very busy today,

947
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:55,027
but some other time.

948
00:41:56,998 --> 00:41:58,464
You all set?

949
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,267
Thanks again.

950
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:03,236
And I'm sorry about this.

951
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,838
She usually doesn't
wander so far.

952
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:07,884
It's okay, really. Don't worry.

953
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:08,908
She's really great.

954
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,828
Love you, love you, love you.

955
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:19,769
I love you, too.

Thanks.

Good first day?

967
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,635
Yeah, so far.

968
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,103
That's good. I'm glad.

969
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:57,756
Listen, I was hoping that...

970
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:01,427
Um... that... I mean, I know

971
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:03,495
that you're seeing Taglieri,

972
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:04,563
but I was thinking that

973
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:06,616
maybe you and I could
see each other again.

974
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:09,296
If I'd known you'd find
suicide such a turn-on,

975
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,887
I would have tried it
when we were together.

976
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:12,871
I'm serious.

977
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:14,001
No, you're not.

978
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,402
You're standing
there like a puppy

979
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,621
with its tail between its
legs 'cause you feel guilty.

980
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:19,228
No, I don't.

981
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,497
I<i> do,</i> but that's not
what this is about.

982
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,510
Yes, it is. You think
you had something to do

983
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,412
with my swallowing
a whole bunch of pills.

984
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,386
Well, you didn't.

985
00:43:27,422 --> 00:43:28,954
There were actually

986
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:31,541
more depressing
events in my life than you.

987
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:34,060
Tell me about them.

988
00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:37,146
I want to know.

989
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,182
Aw, it's a combination
of things, you know?

990
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:42,363
Too much stuff starts piling up.

991
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:43,597
You feel trapped.

992
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,087
I spend a lot of time

993
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,100
talking about all this stuff

994
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,835
with my shrink, so, um...

995
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,971
I have a lot of work to do.

996
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:54,780
Carol, do you really
want to be with Taglieri?

997
00:43:54,815 --> 00:43:57,216
He was there for me
before this happened...

998
00:43:57,252 --> 00:43:58,551
When it happened.

999
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:02,538
What we had...

1000
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,973
Is it worth another chance?

1001
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,663
You thought what we had
didn't work. Remember?

1002
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:23,509
I don't suppose we could

1003
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:25,789
talk you out of
this one more time?

1004
00:44:25,813 --> 00:44:27,746
I told you Dr. Lewis let me in

1005
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:29,482
first thing in the morning

1006
00:44:29,517 --> 00:44:31,517
for the rest of my transfusion.

1007
00:44:31,553 --> 00:44:33,986
I can't miss one
minute of one thing.

1008
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:36,289
Not one minute,
one hour, one day.

1009
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:38,291
Of course, when I was your age,

1010
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:40,460
I never thought of such a thing.

1011
00:44:40,495 --> 00:44:41,860
I do.

1012
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:45,815
Life might be giving up on me,

1013
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,617
but I'm not giving up on it.

1014
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:51,403
Then we'll see you
tomorrow morning?

1015
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:54,006
Yes, you will.

1016
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,911
She leaving again?

1017
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,547
She's going to a christening.

1018
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,316
Carol!

1019
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:04,917
Carol, come quick.

1020
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:06,068
Mark's hurt.

1021
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,433
Surprise!

1022
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:23,030
Speech!

1023
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,287
Okay.

1024
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,656
Uh... we wanted to
give you something

1025
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,758
to let you know how glad we are

1026
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:30,960
that you're back.

1027
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,028
Eight weeks ago,

1028
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,346
you managed to
grab our attention.

1029
00:45:34,382 --> 00:45:38,000
So, if you feel like you
need to do that again,

1030
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,918
we'd like you to put this on.

1031
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:41,470
Oh, God.

1032
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:53,248
Speech!

1033
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:56,986
Uh... okay.

1034
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,921
Well, to say I feel lucky

1035
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:01,757
would be kind of
an understatement.

1036
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:05,227
What you all did to, uh...

1037
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,931
to save me was like a gift.

1038
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,366
And, uh...

1039
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,604
I've promised myself to
remember that every day, so...

1040
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:21,159
Thank you.

1041
