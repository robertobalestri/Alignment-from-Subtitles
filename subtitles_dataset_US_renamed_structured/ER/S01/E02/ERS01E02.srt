00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,714
Susan? Susan?

3
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,048
Susan!

4
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,550
You have to get up.

5
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:19,885
What time is it?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,219
It's a baby.

7
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,888
A baby?

8
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,090
In respiratory arrest.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,264
One-year-old found
unresponsive in crib.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,564
We couldn't get an I.V.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,011
What did you find on arrival?

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,268
No spontaneous resps.

13
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,680
She's cyanotic.
Faint pulse at 200.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,670
We scooped and ran.

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,671
What happened?

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,151
She just stopped breathing.

17
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,908
Has she been sick? No.

18
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,542
No. Any medications?

19
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,877
Any recent trauma?

20
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,212
No. Nothing.

21
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,718
Let's see if we can
find a vein here.

22
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:54,753
Shh!

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,857
Sinus tach 180.

24
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,180
Come on.

25
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,303
Laryngoscope.

26
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,447
Magill forceps.

27
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,982
Forceps.

28
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,001
Where are you?

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,842
An earring.

30
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:36,344
Hyperventilate her.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,679
Blood sugar?

32
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:38,680
Twenty.

33
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,148
I'll need an 18-gauge spinal.

34
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,428
I'll go in interosseus.

35
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:42,851
Is she going to be all right?

36
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:44,252
I'll need dextrose.

37
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,004
Is she going to be okay?

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,927
Dextrose is in.

39
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,261
Okay, got it?

40
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:54,596
Got it.

41
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,333
Oh, my God!

42
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:24,359
Get a blood gas, chest
film, C.B.C. and chem seven.

43
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,394
She's going to be fine.

44
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,664
Hi.

45
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:27,656
You had an infant
in respiratory arrest

46
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,491
and you didn't wake me up?

47
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:31,605
You got an extra hour's sleep.

48
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,206
You should be thanking me.

49
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,362
I know, but...

50
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:36,442
We didn't need you for the baby.

51
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,766
Now we need you.

52
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,101
For what?

53
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,502
German tourists.

54
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:42,832
They got food poisoning
at some hofbrauhaus

55
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,105
on 46th.

56
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,106
<i>Guten morgen.</i>

57
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,708
<i>Das ist Dr. Carter.</i>

58
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:50,795
<i>Guten morgen, Herr Doktor.</i>

59
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,081
They need

60
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:56,101
stool wax.

61
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,136
Rectals?

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,804
One you've got to rule out M.I.

63
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,661
Two is that baby Lewis saved.

64
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,029
Three is some old guy

65
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:10,665
who keeps sticking
his hand up your shirt.

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,967
Four is chest pains.

67
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,135
Five is a kid with
an allergic reaction.

68
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,448
Where is the guy with the hand?

69
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,438
Good morning, Sue.

70
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:17,605
Morning.

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,274
Hey, Timmy, what's up?

72
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:20,309
Oh, hold please.

73
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,777
We've got four coming in
on a chopper, two critical.

74
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:23,778
How soon?

75
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,779
Five to ten.

76
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:25,780
Okay.

77
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:27,126
Hey. Morning.

78
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,950
Hey, Timmy.

79
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:30,118
Dr. Lewis.

80
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,386
Hold, please.

81
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,788
I got a chest pain
in Exam Room Four.

82
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:36,624
Night shift ran X ray and EKG.

83
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,128
You know, Timmy, I
really need a cup of coffee.

84
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,463
Cream, no sugar?

85
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,498
Yep. Thank you.

86
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,639
Want to help with a chest pain?

87
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,008
Yes.

88
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:56,244
I'll be right back.

89
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,996
Good morning, Mr. Zambano.

90
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,031
I'm Dr. Lewis.

91
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,365
This is John Carter.

92
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,468
In order to evaluate
pain, start with P.Q.R.S.T.

93
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,636
So, start.

94
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:05,682
Oh, great.

95
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,484
Provoking, palliating, right?

96
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,152
So, what brought on your pain?

97
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,359
I was in the shower,
and it just started.

98
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,211
And could you describe the pain?

99
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,480
It's like somebody
squeezing my chest.

100
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,632
Right.

101
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,134
Well, good.

102
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:20,985
Radiation.

103
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:21,819
Ah! Uh...

104
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,321
Does the pain move

105
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,689
anywhere? Neck? Back?

106
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,591
No. What is he, a beginner?

107
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,243
This is a teaching
hospital, Mr. Zambano.

108
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,157
Your E.K.G. is normal

109
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,300
your pain's subsided
and your history of angina

110
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,170
I don't think we need
to be too concerned.

111
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,483
Dr. Carter will
keep an eye on you

112
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,541
while we wait for your
enzyme results, okay?

113
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,079
It's been eight weeks.

114
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,202
Wait a second.

115
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:56,538
You mean, you haven't
even been out there yet?

116
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,218
I've thought about it.
I just haven't done it.

117
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,220
You and Hathaway were so close.

118
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:06,414
It's not going to get
any easier, Doug.

119
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:09,083
Just go.

120
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:27,815
Let's go.

121
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:36,978
All right. Two
majors, two minors.

122
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,713
Passenger space intrusion.

123
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:39,959
Guy ran a red light

124
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,161
T-boned a car at
50 miles per hour.

125
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:45,219
Head, neck, chest,
pelvic and right hip injury.

126
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:46,755
She's had three liters so far.

127
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,900
G.C.S? Point-one-one!

128
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:50,158
Pressure's 50/30. Pulse 120.

129
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,294
All right. Okay. Let's go.

130
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,966
Hurry up. Let's go.

131
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,036
What else you got?

132
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:04,539
Head, neck and abdominal pain.

133
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,541
Pressure's 65.

134
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,543
Pulse 150 and thready.

135
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,545
G.C.S... 4-6-5.

136
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,681
She's also got a
scalp laceration

137
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:15,216
and a deformed
right humerus fracture.

138
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:18,920
Right. Let's go downstairs
right away, all right?

139
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,606
We're going to
take her into Two.

140
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,208
Doug, take the
little girl into One.

141
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,979
Mommy!

142
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,313
Here. She's hypovolemic.

143
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,393
Okay. Let's go.
All right, people

144
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,563
we're going to do
this on my count...

145
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,352
And one, two, three, go.

146
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,821
Good.

147
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,523
Type and cross match
six units packed cells,

148
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,770
C.B.C., chem seven.

149
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,939
Let's get the "O"
neg moving now.

150
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,496
Mommy!

151
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,164
I need a chest tube tray.

152
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,033
Come on, people, let's move.

153
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,367
This isn't a museum.

154
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,703
Let's go. We got work to do.

155
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,315
Who else is on the floor?

156
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,639
Everybody's working today.

157
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,653
All right, call the O.R. and
let's see who they can spare.

158
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,011
Mommy!

159
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,360
Lydia, type and
cross match four units.

160
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,350
Positive.

161
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,185
Pressure's still 50
palp. Pulse's 180.

162
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,420
All right, sweetheart,

163
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,889
I want you to tell me
where else it hurts, okay?

164
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:12,991
I want you to concentrate.

165
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,325
All right, You hear me?

166
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,627
Mommy!

167
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,962
Okay? You hear me?
Tell me where it hurts.

168
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,163
Does it hurt here?

169
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,164
How about here?

170
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,544
Ow! Spleen.

171
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,934
Okay, we got to
get her to O.R. now!

172
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,922
Okay, just stay
really still, okay?

173
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:29,107
Mommy!

174
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,610
Mommy!

175
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,048
Mommy!

176
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,419
This the guy who hit them?

177
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,421
Yeah. Is he going
to be all right?

178
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,422
Yep.

179
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,423
Too bad.

180
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,258
We'll need blood alcohol.

181
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,593
Bet it's over 200.

182
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,927
350, easy.

183
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,097
Let's get a tox screen
and a C.T. of his head.

184
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,300
We have to rule out head trauma.

185
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,769
He done this before?

186
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,137
Five times.

187
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,143
Mr. Ring, we've
called orthopedics.

188
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,878
They'll be down in a minute

189
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,614
to take a look at your leg.

190
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,827
Are my wife and
daughter all right?

191
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,884
We're working on them right now.

192
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,764
I didn't even see him coming.

193
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,900
The light changed,
Janet screamed

194
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,290
and there he was.

195
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,326
We're working on your family.

196
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,115
Whew!

197
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,951
How many more do we have?

198
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,285
Three.

199
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,620
Three.

200
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,222
I have to check on a patient.

201
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,858
I'll be right back.

202
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,830
Whew!

203
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,165
Whew!

204
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,805
Still feeling okay?

205
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,140
How much longer am
I going to have to wait?

206
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,921
Just a couple more minutes.

207
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:56,511
We are very busy today.

208
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:59,047
But you're feeling
all right otherwise?

209
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,348
Mr. Zambano?

210
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,217
Mr. Zambano?

211
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,887
Mr. Zambano!

212
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,225
Oh, damn! Mr. Zambano!

213
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,782
Hey! Hey! Hey!

214
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,737
I could use a
little help in here!

215
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,548
Hey!

216
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,043
Clear!

217
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,015
Hey! What the
hell are you doing?

218
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,549
Sorry.

219
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,945
You need help? I'm here.

220
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:55,470
Are vital signs stable?

221
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,472
Yes.

222
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:01,776
Sir, you're going
to be just fine.

223
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:03,060
Whew!

224
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,296
Pressure's 80/50. Pulse 120.

225
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,298
They ready for her upstairs?

226
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,633
All right, well, let's go.

227
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,234
Get ortho to the O.R.

228
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,371
We're taking you to
another part of the hospital

229
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,040
to make you better, okay?

230
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,374
Where's my Mommy?

231
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,976
We're taking care of her, too

232
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,911
and your daddy's
going to be there

233
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,479
when you wake up, all right?

234
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,814
Here you go, Doug.

235
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,182
Yeah. Thanks.

236
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,164
Is she going to make it?

237
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,320
Ruptured spleen.

238
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,488
How's the father?

239
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,268
Orthopods are doing his leg.

240
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,470
The driver's
sleeping like a baby.

241
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,894
Not a scratch on him.

242
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,831
How's the mother?

243
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,365
Maybe...

244
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,413
It's been eight weeks
since she attempted suicide.

245
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,715
You two were close.

246
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,818
You and Hathaway
shared a lot of things.

247
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,220
I stopped by.

248
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,654
A couple of times.

249
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,006
Never got out of the car.

250
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,510
Take her some flowers.

251
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:12,129
You don't have to stay long.

252
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,978
You want me to go with you?

253
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,468
I'm off Sundays.

254
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,781
That would be a good time.

255
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,205
I don't know. I don't know.

256
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,741
I'll drive.

257
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,581
It's me.

258
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,152
It's not your fault, Doug.

259
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,804
You got to forgive yourself

260
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,890
sooner or later.

261
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,972
Ay! Pop, pop! Just
like that, they shoot me.

262
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,507
For cigarettes!

263
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,843
Give him a gram of Ancef I.V.

264
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,745
No older than my grandson.

265
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,346
12 maybe, with a little gun.

266
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,415
C.B.C., chest
and shoulder films.

267
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,000
Little man, little gun.

268
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,252
15 Years

269
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,004
I am selling liquor
out of the same store.

270
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,235
Robbed seven times. Never hurt.

271
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,043
Nothing! Now I get shot by
sixth grader with baby gun.

272
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,441
Dr. Benton, you have a patient
in Two with abdominal pain

273
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,760
and a person in Trauma with
a stab wound to the forearm.

274
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,233
Well, Mr. Gregor, you're lucky.

275
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,617
The bullet went
straight through.

276
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,220
I'm going to send
you up to the O.R.

277
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:27,889
They'll explore the wound
for any serious damage

278
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,225
remove any dead
tissue and debris.

279
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,227
Work up the patient in Two.

280
00:13:32,262 --> 00:13:33,461
I want a focused H and P.

281
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,628
And don't take all day.

282
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,097
I'll be there in ten minutes.

283
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:37,098
Ten minutes?!

284
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,349
Or less.

285
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,934
Hey, Doc, you like cognac?

286
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,136
I can get you a good cognac.

287
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,237
Smooth as silk.

288
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:45,173
That won't be necessary.

289
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,242
Cigars, then.

290
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:48,459
Cuban, maybe?

291
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,061
No, no, that's fine.

292
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,395
Thank you, though.

293
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,930
I don't smoke.

294
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,733
Dr. Carter, you
have nine minutes.

295
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,868
Good doctor, huh?

296
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,688
He's the best.

297
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:02,790
He has a low-grade fever,

298
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:04,392
slight productive cough,

299
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,961
postural hypertension,
and he's dehydrated.

300
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,463
I have to go home.

301
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:09,464
I know.

302
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,677
You told us your first name.

303
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,912
Do you remember your last name?

304
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,969
Uh... uh...

305
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,471
I have to go home.

306
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:17,839
Victor, you need to lie still.

307
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,440
Why don't you lie
back right here?

308
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:21,642
Hey, Malik, we might need
some restraints over here.

309
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:22,722
I have to feed my dogs.

310
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:25,079
Give him D5 N.S., 300cc's.

311
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,248
Do a head C.T., non-contrast.

312
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,184
Get Psych Services
down here for a consult.

313
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:31,652
Do a G.G.F.1.

314
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:32,832
A G.G.F.1?

315
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,455
"Grandpa's got a fever."

316
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:37,759
C.B.C., Chem 7, chest X ray,
U.A. and blood cultures X 2.

317
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,580
All right. Come on.

318
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,114
Give it to me quick.

319
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,196
65-Year-old male with severe
peripheral vascular disease

320
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,565
manifested by
claudication of the left calf.

321
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,801
He's ten days post-op
from Mercy General

322
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,002
after having an aorta
bi-femoral bypass.

323
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,972
Normal postoperative course
until about six hours ago,

324
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,408
when he began to
experience the gradual onset

325
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,876
of lower-left quadrant pain

326
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,045
without palliative
or provoking factors

327
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,947
other than a large
Mexican dinner.

328
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,270
Meds?

329
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,050
30cc's milk of magnesia.

330
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,574
Constipation.

331
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,275
Mother's maiden name?

332
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,012
He's joking.

333
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,519
Good morning, Mr. Thunhurst.

334
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,020
I'm Dr. Benton.

335
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,789
You have abdominal pain?

336
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,190
I called my doctor.

337
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,592
He isn't here yet.

338
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,593
Joe Arndt.

339
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:29,794
You know Joe?

340
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,295
No, I don't.

341
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,547
Is it sensitive here?

342
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,032
Mm-hmm.

343
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,167
Okay.

344
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,302
No rebound or guarding.

345
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,237
Leg is warm.

346
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,672
Cap refill is normal.

347
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,690
My leg is fine.

348
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:43,741
My stomach hurts.

349
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,743
Dr. Carter, what would you do?

350
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,913
Well, in view of his
history of constipation,

351
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,648
and the diffuse
nature of the pain,

352
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,753
I'd order a CBC, Chem 7,
U.A., Amylase and a K.U.B.

353
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,772
Mm-hmm. And if they're normal?

354
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:58,834
I'd discharge him.

355
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,586
Let him follow up with
his personal physician.

356
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,593
Yeah. Congratulations.

357
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,561
You just cost this hospital

358
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,314
a $2 million

359
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:07,998
malpractice settlement.

360
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,134
You could have a
thrombosis at the graft site

361
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,002
with potential
extension into the renal

362
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,137
or mesenteric arteries.

363
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,138
What the hell

364
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,183
is a thrombosis?

365
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,858
It's a blood clot,
Mr. Thunhurst.

366
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,426
They replaced an
artery in your leg.

367
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,261
Sometimes a clot
forms at the graft site.

368
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:23,113
It's unlikely, but
I'd like to rule it out.

369
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,015
Get him an arteriogram.

370
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,467
Shouldn't we wait for my doctor?

371
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:29,253
No. I don't think
that would be wise.

372
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,955
Let's notify radiology,
and get them

373
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,158
on it right away.

374
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,094
Thrombosis.

375
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,829
Uh-huh.

376
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,016
The mother's still in surgery.

377
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,819
The blood alcohol
come back at .435.

378
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:47,065
What about the drug screen?

379
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,056
It was negative.

380
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,659
There's no justice, is there?

381
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:52,993
Not much.

382
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,683
He's dehydrated, and has

383
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:06,885
a slight respiratory
tract infection.

384
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,208
The fluids helped,

385
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,955
but he's still
confused and agitated.

386
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,412
Sir... sir... sir...

387
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,980
I have two dogs.

388
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,314
Two? That's great, sir.

389
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,083
That's great.

390
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,419
Did you run a CAT scan?

391
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,698
Diffuse atrophy.

392
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,266
Nothing new or focal.

393
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,691
I'm out of here.

394
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:26,394
That's it?

395
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:27,873
What were you expecting?

396
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:29,663
I expected him to be admitted

397
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:31,265
to a Psych Services bed.

398
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,178
But he's got an infection.

399
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,770
He's senile, and he
needs psych support.

400
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,783
Now you're a psychiatrist?

401
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,174
I can recognize senile
dementia when I see it.

402
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,589
He's not medically
cleared to my service.

403
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:45,591
He has an upper
respiratory tract infection,

404
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,080
and he's dehydrated.

405
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,428
What he needs is
antibiotics and I.V. hydration.

406
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:50,885
I'll buff him up,

407
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,554
start the antibiotics
and pull the I.V.

408
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:55,155
Give him 2.5 Haldol

409
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,558
and have Social
Services do a follow-up.

410
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,960
I don't have a bed for him.

411
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,507
He needs our help.

412
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:04,298
You want me turning
away homicidal psychotics

413
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,100
because your patient's
got one of my beds?

414
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,904
Find him a medical
bed or release him.

415
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:12,907
I'm not admitting him.

416
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,276
End of discussion.

417
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:18,012
Whoo! Mm-mm-mm. Burn.

418
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:20,648
You fell asleep?

419
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,917
Oak Street Beach.

420
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:25,753
You fell asleep in the sun.

421
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:27,521
Yeah.

422
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,757
Can you sit down?

423
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,276
I don't think so.

424
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,077
Maybe we should just lean him

425
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,313
against a gurney
or something, huh?

426
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,032
Mark?

427
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,617
I passed.

428
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,118
The bar?

429
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,119
Yes!

430
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,587
Yahoo!

431
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,888
Hey! Hey!

432
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,207
Oh!

433
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:47,208
Yes!

434
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,221
She passed the bar exam.

435
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:51,145
I am so proud of you.

436
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,563
This is heartwarming,

437
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,731
but could I get some help here?

438
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,684
Um... Malik, can you
take some vital signs?

439
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,036
Sure thing, Doc.

440
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:06,827
Ouch!

441
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,031
Hi.

442
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,366
Congratulations.

443
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,434
Mmm.

444
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,635
Mmm.

445
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,637
Jen, what are you doing?

446
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:20,040
Remember the back
seat of your Celica?

447
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,375
Uh-huh.

448
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,410
Remember the trip to Hawaii.

449
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,912
Mmm.

450
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,401
Jen, you got to get accepted
to the bar more often.

451
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,541
Timmy, who was the car accident?

452
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,358
Hi, Mr. Ring.

453
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,159
I'm Dr. Benton.

454
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,190
Is my daughter out of surgery?

455
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:00,263
Not yet, but don't worry.

456
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,098
She's going to be okay.

457
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,635
We had to repair her spleen.

458
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,270
I need to talk to
you about your wife.

459
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,506
She's got a spinal fracture

460
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,308
and massive internal bleeding

461
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,311
and, well, now she
has what's called D.I.C.,

462
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,113
which basically means
her blood won't clot

463
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,516
as a result of all the trauma.

464
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,984
She's going to die.

465
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,587
Mr. Ring, did you and your wife

466
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,590
ever discuss organ donation?

467
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,492
He needs to be admitted.

468
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,827
On what grounds?

469
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,295
Change of mental status.

470
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,374
He's senile.

471
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,765
That's nothing new.

472
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,977
Give him antibiotics
and send him home.

473
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,300
He has no family.

474
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,635
There's no one
there to make sure

475
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,804
he takes his meds, to feed
him, to go to the bathroom.

476
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,984
That's what Social
Services are for.

477
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,775
They can't get to him today.

478
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,987
What about Psych?

479
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,656
Cvetic won't admit him.

480
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,763
He can be treated
medically as an outpatient.

481
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,965
We don't have the beds.

482
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,668
If Cvetic won't
take him, he's out.

483
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,402
Thank you, Timmy.

484
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,559
The emergency alarm's

485
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,411
going off.

486
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:38,540
Okay, Malik.

487
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,130
Grab the crash cart.

488
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,566
Susan, we got a Mayday.

489
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,282
Hi.

490
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,333
Hi.

491
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:02,670
I, uh... I can't find

492
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:03,770
my earring.

493
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,306
Hi.

494
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,354
Your hand was on the
emergency call button

495
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,724
the entire time? Oh, man!

496
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,193
I miss all the good stuff.

497
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,540
I'm never going
to live this down.

498
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:31,398
Everybody thought you
were some kind of a saint.

499
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,867
I was going to start
calling you Mahatma.

500
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:36,214
What's going to happen
when Wertz hears?

501
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:39,206
You were with your
wife... Lucky you. Hey.

502
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,708
I'm chief resident.

503
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,710
I'm supposed to
set a good example.

504
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:44,222
Well, it's a big hospital.

505
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:46,224
Maybe Wertz won't
even hear about it.

506
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,882
Hey, Mark, um...

507
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:50,383
how's it hanging?

508
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:53,754
I'm a dead man.

509
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,260
Carter?

510
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,232
Doctor...

511
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,767
time to get up.

512
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,082
Clear!

513
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,575
I've got a rash.

514
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:16,911
Uh-huh.

515
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:20,781
I need a doctor.

516
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:21,982
Okay.

517
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,554
Are you a doctor?

518
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,089
Me?

519
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:32,859
She's got a rash.

520
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:33,877
Ah.

521
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,045
Can you help me?

522
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,446
Sure. I can try.

523
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,535
Pressure's 70 over 50.

524
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,436
Pulse is 120.

525
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,990
Resp's 32.

526
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,407
Temperature's 102.5.

527
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:48,642
Pulse ox is

528
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,177
only 85%.

529
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,616
You her husband?

530
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,835
Yes.

531
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,270
Mr. Franks, this is Dr. Greene.

532
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,718
What kind of
medications is she on?

533
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:06,276
I've tried to get her to
see our doctor for weeks,

534
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,045
but she wouldn't go.

535
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,614
Lasix, dig,

536
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,116
K.C.L., Isordil,

537
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,485
nitro, Captopril, Antivert,

538
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,970
Darvocet, Timoptic.

539
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:20,608
We need a chest film, EKG, CBC,

540
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:23,260
Chem 7, dig level, U.A.,

541
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,923
blood cultures times two,

542
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,992
blood gases, and hydrate her

543
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:29,532
with a 300cc bolus of saline.

544
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,420
Is she going to be all right?

545
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,075
We may have to
make a difficult choice

546
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,955
in the next few hours.

547
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,444
Um... we're dealing

548
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,014
with an impending
respiratory failure.

549
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,620
Please, do everything you can.

550
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,750
We're going to get
blood gases first,

551
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:54,019
and then we'll take
it from there, okay?

552
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:55,492
Okay.

553
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,213
So you're in your third
year of medical school.

554
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,364
Mm-hmm.

555
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,199
Must be hard.

556
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,000
It's pretty demanding.

557
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,021
Must be very...

558
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,490
hard.

559
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,208
Afternoon, Dr. Carter.

560
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,542
Oh, hi, Dr. Lewis.

561
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:31,289
Poison ivy... pretty nasty case.

562
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:33,692
I did my dermatology
rotation last fall,

563
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,393
so I saw a lot of this stuff.

564
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,317
You don't mind if I stick around

565
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:39,064
and observe, do you, Doctor?

566
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:40,553
Oh, he's doing fine on his own.

567
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:41,521
I'm sure he is.

568
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:42,489
No, sure, stay.

569
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:43,602
A Medrol dose pack

570
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,003
and some antihistamine

571
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:46,571
will clear this right up.

572
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:47,928
Yeah.

573
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:52,299
Remember the summer

574
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:56,136
when Jerry broke
his arm up at the lake?

575
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,283
And you were so worried.

576
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,109
I told you that
boys will be boys,

577
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,578
but you pampered him.

578
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:06,992
It's remarkable he turned out

579
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:09,783
as well as he did, isn't it?

580
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,151
Mr. Franks?

581
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:15,122
I'm troubled with the results

582
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,924
of your wife's blood gases.

583
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,460
How old is she?

584
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:24,231
Eighty-six.

585
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,661
Our options are limited.

586
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,336
Her condition is terminal.

587
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,165
If we put her on a respirator,

588
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,791
we may not be able
to wean her off it later.

589
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:37,010
We'd be prolonging her
life in a vegetative state,

590
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:40,931
or we can make her comfortable:

591
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,118
give her fluids, antibiotics,

592
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:46,536
let nature run its course.

593
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,855
You mean, let her die.

594
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:51,524
She'd die in peace.

595
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:55,295
Put her on the respirator.

596
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,260
Mr. Franks, are you sure

597
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,844
that's what she'd want?

598
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,455
We'll hold off

599
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,890
till we get another blood gas.

600
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,806
Hopefully, things will improve

601
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,111
with the nebulizer treatments.

602
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,018
She has 13 grandchildren.

603
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,821
Did you know that?

604
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,759
No, sir.

605
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:27,327
I didn't know that.

606
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,664
I just thought you should know.

607
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,265
So you're finally up.

608
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,733
What time is it?

609
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,801
7:30.

610
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,288
I must have really
tied one on this time.

611
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:56,723
I'll go get you a doctor.

612
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,125
Thanks.

613
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,598
Damn it.

614
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:08,302
Did I get busted again?

615
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,454
You don't remember?
No, not much.

616
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,791
What?

617
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,037
Am I hurt or something?

618
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,228
The policeman went
for a cup of coffee.

619
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,713
He'll be right back.

620
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:23,144
Boy, I must have really
screwed up this time, didn't I?

621
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,869
You hit a family.

622
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,571
The mother's dead,

623
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:30,373
and the daughter's
in intensive care.

624
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,279
You wanted an angiogram?

625
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,760
Yeah. They haven't
gotten around to it yet.

626
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,028
Radiology's backed up.

627
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,601
Thank God for small favors.

628
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,498
You're not concerned
about a thrombosis?

629
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,472
His urine came back positive.

630
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:48,108
I think his abdominal
pain is related

631
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,359
to a urinary tract infection.

632
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,277
He had a Foley catheter
during his surgery.

633
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,974
You don't think
it's serious, Joe?

634
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,431
I'll write you a prescription,

635
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,049
have you home
in time for dinner.

636
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:57,762
Well, that's the
same thing he said.

637
00:28:57,786 --> 00:28:59,586
Excuse me, Doctor.

638
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:02,601
May I have a word
with you, please?

639
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:06,260
I, uh... I really think

640
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:08,273
you might want to reconsider.

641
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,497
What are you, a
third-year resident?

642
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,694
Second-year...
surgical resident.

643
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:15,452
Well, the next time
you want to practice

644
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,955
expensive, overly
aggressive procedures,

645
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,457
you do it on one of
your indigent patients.

646
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,126
They won't know
you're showing off

647
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,161
for your medical students.

648
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,964
I'll have you out of
here in five minutes.

649
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,732
Joe, that's great.
Thanks so much.

650
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,601
Right in the middle
of the reception,

651
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:34,304
she just starts
puking her guts out.

652
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,074
Honey, I'm sorry. I
just, just... oh, God!

653
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,055
There she goes again.

654
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,712
Compazine, ten milligrams
I.M., CBC and Chem 7.

655
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,181
Do you know what she ate?

656
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,761
I don't think she ate anything

657
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,328
until the reception.

658
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,652
Did you, honey?

659
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,832
Everybody had the
same buffet at Gerber's.

660
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,355
You're holding your reception

661
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,057
at Gerber's Hofbrauhaus on 46th?

662
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:56,226
That's where those
German tourists ate...

663
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,661
The ones from this morning.

664
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,663
How many guests at your wedding?

665
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,176
Couple of hundred.

666
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,333
I'll get some more
emesis basins.

667
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,013
She's become a
little more lucid.

668
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,005
Mm-hmm. Have her
blood gases improved?

669
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,008
PC-02's up to 70.

670
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,542
She's tiring.

671
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,483
She's getting better.

672
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,524
Your wife was
dehydrated, Mr. Franks.

673
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,493
She woke because
we gave her fluids.

674
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,396
Her respiratory
problem is worsening.

675
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,268
I'm very tired.

676
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,604
I know, dear.

677
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,657
Are you in any pain?

678
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:45,909
I'm dying, aren't I, Doctor?

679
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,304
No. You're going to be fine.

680
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:57,286
Mrs. Franks, you are
not going to be able

681
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,455
to continue
breathing on your own

682
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,940
for very much longer.

683
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:03,843
Do you want us to
put you on a machine

684
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,612
to help you breathe?

685
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:06,997
Yes, she does.

686
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,332
I'm asking your
wife, Mr. Franks.

687
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,820
For how long?

688
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:15,455
I don't know.

689
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,402
We've already discussed this!

690
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:20,577
No.

691
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,762
No.

692
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,501
I don't want you to go!

693
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:30,137
Oh, I know.

694
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:36,176
Shh. Shh.

695
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,163
It's okay, darling.

696
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,449
It's okay.

697
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,266
A couple of hundred?

698
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:03,436
Yeah, but not everybody
had the potato salad.

699
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:05,205
Only about 60 are sick.

700
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Man...

701
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:07,741
Oh, Connie, thank God.

702
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:10,076
I have never been so glad

703
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:12,746
to see anybody in my whole life.

704
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:14,247
Good night, everybody.

705
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:16,249
Just keep your head down, ma'am.

706
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:19,219
We'll be with you
as soon as we can.

707
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:20,720
Dr. Greene.

708
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:22,222
John, everybody
gets Compazine...

709
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:25,625
D5 N.S. I.V.s if they look
like they need it, okay?

710
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,504
Okay. Yeah. I'm holding. Yep.

711
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:31,131
What the hell was that?

712
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,833
Accordions. They moved
their wedding reception

713
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,869
into our waiting room. Night.

714
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:36,870
Dr. Lewis?

715
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:37,871
Yeah?

716
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:38,872
I need you.

717
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:39,873
Okay.

718
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:41,340
I'll be right back.

719
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,178
They found him walking down
the middle of Halsted, naked.

720
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,047
He was still wearing
his hospital bracelet.

721
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,382
Hey, Victor.

722
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:50,549
Hello.

723
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:54,087
My dogs... I have
to feed my dogs.

724
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:55,471
I know you do.

725
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,634
Want me to get Cvetic down here?

726
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,702
No. I want you to take
him to Psych Services

727
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,971
and check him in right now.

728
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:01,461
What if they won't accept him?

729
00:33:01,497 --> 00:33:03,697
Then<i> I'll</i> sign him in

730
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,248
to Cvetic's service!

731
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:12,872
How you holding up?

732
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,374
I'll make it.

733
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,875
I'm off in three hours.

734
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,210
You on tonight?

735
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,523
No. Benton.

736
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:20,925
You should talk to
Doug about Hathaway.

737
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,427
It's been two months.

738
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:23,583
I did.

739
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:26,052
I even offered to
drive him out there.

740
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,932
Why's he acting like this?

741
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:29,601
They were together two years.

742
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:32,091
He feels guilty;
thinks it's his fault.

743
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:33,693
Well, I guess things

744
00:33:33,728 --> 00:33:36,241
are better with you
and Jennifer, huh?

745
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:40,767
She passed her bar.

746
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:42,269
She was excited.

747
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:46,306
Yeah. So were you,
from what I could see.

748
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:51,010
So what happens next?

749
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,512
She gets a job?

750
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:53,846
She's looking.

751
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:54,847
Yeah.

752
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,027
Lewis?

753
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:57,217
Yeah?

754
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:59,264
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

755
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,588
You do not admit a
patient to my service

756
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:02,634
without a consult.

757
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:04,023
He needs psychiatric help.

758
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:04,991
Not in my opinion.

759
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:05,875
He was found naked,

760
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,988
wandering down Halsted.

761
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,345
He's senile, not psychotic.

762
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,478
He needs full-time care.

763
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,724
Admit him to<i> your</i> service.

764
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,844
Don't turf him
to mine. I tried to.

765
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:14,533
Wertz wouldn't let me.

766
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:20,023
Don't ever do that to me again.

767
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:35,988
Dr. Benton?

768
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:38,991
I'm sorry about what
happened earlier today

769
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:40,738
with the thrombosis patient.

770
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:42,806
I think you were right.

771
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,898
Is that so?

772
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,166
Yeah.

773
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:47,801
I think he

774
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,663
should have had the angiogram.

775
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,487
Great. I'll be sure

776
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,873
to notify the<i> New England
Journal of Medicine</i>

777
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:55,424

Finally.

793
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,286
I'm proud of you, counselor.

794
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,977
Who'd have thought
I'd make it, huh?

795
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:19,545
Hmm?

796
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:21,814
I knew you'd make it.

797
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,253
I miss you.

798
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,088
Hmm.

799
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:31,591
I miss you, too.

800
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:37,062
Oh... we have to
make love more often.

801
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,402
The look on your face...

802
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:46,739
Well, it was a
little embarrassing.

803
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:55,748
We could pick up
where we left off.

804
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:58,251
What if Rachel wakes up?

805
00:38:58,286 --> 00:39:00,819
We could stay out here.

806
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,321
In the yard?

807
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:04,023
Mrs. Navrocki sees us?

808
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:05,724
What if she did?

809
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,993
Hmm?

810
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:14,634
I have to be back in the
hospital in two hours, Jen.

811
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,707
I'm sorry.

812
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:36,055
You're never going
to leave, are you?

813
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,978
The hospital.

814
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:55,408
I don't know.

815
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:01,230
I need you, Mark.

816
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:10,490
I love you.

817
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,306
Hi.

818
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:01,407
Hi.

819
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:02,875
How did you get...?

820
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,210
So let's go.

821
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:05,995
Where?

822
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,129
Your place.

823
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,365
I live with my folks.

824
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:11,500
My place, then.

825
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:16,339
Okay.

826
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:36,042
I mean, what are we there for

827
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,577
if we can't keep
a 75-year-old man

828
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:41,014
from wandering around
the Northside naked?

829
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:45,151
I just... I just get so frustrated
sometimes, you know?

830
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:48,621
I just... want to scream.

831
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:53,526
Well... we can't solve
all the world's problems.

832
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,227
<i>That's</i> what Wertz said.

833
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,596
Oh, he's very wise.

834
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:02,935
Listen, you have
to be very careful

835
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:05,382
how you deal with consults.

836
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:08,541
You can get yourself
in real trouble.

837
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:11,410
I just want to
make a difference.

838
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,213
Yeah, well, you also
want to have a career,

839
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:17,516
and not everybody's going to be

840
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:20,319
as understanding as I was.

841
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:22,155
Oh, yeah.

842
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,656
You're real understanding.

843
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:26,159
It's one of my best qualities.

844
00:42:26,194 --> 00:42:27,493
Hmm...

845
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:28,673
Well, one of them.

846
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:14,273
Hello, Helen.

847
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,310
Can I come in?

848
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,279
No. You can't.

849
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:22,214
Go away.

850
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:23,583
Please.

851
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:26,001
Who is it, Mama?

852
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:28,220
I asked him to leave.

853
00:43:28,255 --> 00:43:29,989
It's okay, Mama.

854
00:43:40,468 --> 00:43:42,585
Hi.

855
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,828
You look beautiful.

856
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,090
How have you been?

857
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,659
Okay.

858
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:11,197
I just came by to
see you... to say hi.

859
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,448
You know?

860
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,964
It's good to see you.

861
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:23,575
Take care.

862
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,589
Dr. Benton?

863
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,857
What is it?

864
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,204
E.M.T.s are on their way in.

865
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:59,708
They think it's a
ruptured bowel.

866
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:03,932
His pulse is 140,
pressure's 60 over 40.

867
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:05,901
We've been pumping in fluids.

868
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,370
He's had 1,500cc's.

869
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,938
His abdomen's rigid,
extremely tender.

870
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:11,807
Guy says he was here today.

871
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,609
Something about a thrombosis.

872
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:15,456
All right, let's get a CBC

873
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,224
type and cross, six units.

874
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,092
Drop an N.G., call the O.R.

875
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,667
Tell them to prep
for an exploratory lap.

876
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,499
Let's act like we
know what we're doing.

877
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,156
We've done this before.

878
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:29,270
Everything's going to be fine.

879
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,627
On my count...
We've done it before.

880
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,640
Here we go: One, two, three.

881
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,977
Clear! Let's move, people!

882
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:39,368
Let's act like we
got things to do.

883
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,370
I need to drop an N.G.

884
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,873
Let's get a chest X
ray and abdominal.

885
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,075
Make it a portable.

886
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,710
Let's move!
