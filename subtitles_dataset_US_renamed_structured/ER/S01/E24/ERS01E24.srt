00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:14,958
Susie!

3
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:18,765
Mmm...

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,140
Chloe, I worked till
1:00 in the morning.

5
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:25,980
I-I think it's time

6
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:28,685
for, you know, the baby.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,656
Are you sure?

8
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,326
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:34,297
Are you having contractions?

10
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:35,966
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,272
Every couple of minutes.

12
00:00:38,307 --> 00:00:39,707
Why did you wait so long?!

13
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:40,743
I had some stuff to do.

14
00:00:40,778 --> 00:00:41,811
I had to take a shower,

15
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:43,699
pack the baby clothes.

16
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,903
Chloe, your contractions
are two minutes apart.

17
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:47,423
We should be at the hospital.

18
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:49,327
I thought you needed the sleep.

19
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:51,659
Oh, you picked a hell of a
time to start being considerate.

20
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:53,251
Ow!!

21
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,587
Chloe, Chloe...

22
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:57,972
Chloe, breathe. Breathe, Chloe.

23
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:59,425
Hee, hee, hee. Hee, hee...

24
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:00,511
Oh, my Go... I need my music.

25
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,001
Get me my tape player, please.

26
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:03,237
Lug that thing?

27
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:04,574

28
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:05,976
Okay, okay, okay.

Ow!

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,111
Oh, damn it! My keys!

34
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,447
Chloe, stop it.

35
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:26,818
I got to clap for my keys.

36
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,590
Got it.

37
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:33,030
Okay, Chloe.

38
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,836
Wow, this is scary.

39
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,701
Hee, hee, hee...
Carter, get over here.

40
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:39,108
I need your help.

41
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:40,478
Hee, hee, hee.

42
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:41,480
Keep panting.

43
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:42,817
We're almost there, Chloe.

44
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,363
Hee, hee, hee... Is

45
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:45,689
Get me drugs!

46
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:47,738
Contractions are 90 seconds
apart. Why'd you wait so long?

47
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:48,728
Get her up to OB now.

48
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:50,631
Breathe, Chloe, hee, hee, hee.

49
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,486
Hee, hee, hee,
hee... What is "hee"?

50
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:55,057
What is with you people
and this "hee, hee" thing?

51
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:56,694
Have you ever had a baby?

52
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,264
Do you think that really helps?

53
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,868
Just give me some drugs!

59
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,724
Right, get her up to OB.

60
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,960
Okay, I have.

61
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:14,663
Okay, okay, I'll see you in 20.

62
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,220

Shoot me, just please shoot me.

66
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,863
Chloe, hang in there just
a little bit longer, okay?

67
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:27,769
No kidding. This
baby's crowning.

68
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:30,160
Oh, my God. Coburn's
never going to make it.

69
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,747
Who else is on?

70
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:33,517
O'Melveny, but she's doing

Okay, let's shift her up.

75
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:42,736
I-I can't do this.

76
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:43,915
Yes, you can. Yes,
you can, Chloe.

77
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,486
Breathe through the pain.

78
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,826
No, no, no, it's a bad idea.

79
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,213
I can't do this, really.

80
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:50,329
Chloe, on the next one, you're
going to push, you hear me?

81
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:51,420

a week early,

161
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:29,136
to help us do some
things around the house.

162
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:30,372
Sounds scary.

163
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:31,574
Mm-hmm.

Yep, when I left this morning

165
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:36,551
they were planning
on painting a bathroom.

166

going to decide so soon.

176

I don't know what to say.

177
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:54,603
Well, say yes.

178
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,618
You want it, don't you?

179
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:59,580
I haven't heard about
the surgery Sub-I yet.

180
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:01,984
I got to know by
the end of the day.

181

182
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,133

We cut it at the site.

188
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,720
He's in shock, pulse
140 and thready.

189
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:14,855
B.P.'s 50/30.

190
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,113
Let's go! Go!

191
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:22,041
Rolando, there's a horse
in my parking space.

192
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:24,512
Why are you riding a horse?

193
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:25,982
It's not mine, Rolando.

194
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,420
Oh. Would I call
security about that?

195
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:29,634
I don't know.

196
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,027
That's why they pay
you the big bucks.

197
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:33,397
Wait, Dr. Ross?

198
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:35,011
Eight little Ranger
scouts, diarrhea.

199
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,603
<i>Mucho.</i>

200
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,520
Which is why they
pay <i>you</i> the big bucks.

201
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,023
Josh got off early.
He let me sleep in.

202
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:42,359
Our mothers were
coming for lunch.

203
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,452
He was going to clean the
kitchen and the bathrooms.

204
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:47,225
Was he unconscious
when you found him?

205
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,729
Yes! He mixed
ammonia with bleach.

206
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:52,301
I thought he'd
know not to do that.

207
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,149
Okay, we'll take care of
him. Let's get him in here.

208
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,643
You're going to have
to stay out here, uh...

209
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:57,712
Michelle.

210
00:07:57,747 --> 00:07:59,582
We'll take care of him, okay?

211
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:01,786
On three. One, two, three.

212
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:03,122
He's wheezing.

213
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:04,425
O2, ten liters.

214
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:05,794
Albuterol nebulizer?

215
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,265
Yeah, and give him

216
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,602
125 milligrams
solumedrol, I.V. push.

217
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:11,138
Malik, call radiology.

218
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:12,253
Let's get a portable chest film.

219
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:13,510
You've got it.

220
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:14,624
B.P.'s going
nowhere. Still 50/30.

221
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:15,692
C.B.C. temp request eight units?

222
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:16,916
Carter, should we yank it?

223
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:18,230
No. Not here, never.
Then I need a Foley.

224
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:19,489
Right.

225
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:21,893
Go to O.R. for
exploratory laparotomy?

226
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,061
Right again.

227
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:24,699
That's my son, James.

228
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,134
Is he going to be okay?

229
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,214
I'm Dr. Hicks, Mrs. Schaeffer.

230
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:28,785
I don't know yet, but
we'll do everything we can.

231
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:29,776
Please wait out here.

232
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,780
What have we got, Peter?

233
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,817
15-year-old male,
impaled on a rebar.

234
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,021
We need to get him up
to the O.R. for an ex lap.

235
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,023
Netzley's up there.
He'll take him.

236
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,370
Anesthesia's on its way.

237
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,962
Carter, come on.
You're going with me.

238
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:42,635
I can't leave.

239
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,637
Hold it.

240
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:44,639
All right, clear the hallway.

241
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:45,641
Let's get the elevator.

242
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:46,643
Let's move! Go! Clear, clear!

243
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:47,645
Get out the way!

244
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,647
Let's move!

245
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:50,751
Heads up! Look out!

246
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:51,853
Nice corsage.

247
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:53,266
My kids. Mother's day. Yeah?

248
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,424
Shooting!

249
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:58,566
You guys need any help?

250
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:00,749
Nope. Got it under control.

251
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,284
Chlorine gas poisoning.

252
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,275
He's on humidified oxygen,

253
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,090
15 liters per minute.

254
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:08,118
Gave him solumedrol,
125 milligrams I.V.

255
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:09,822
Respiratory's coming down.

256
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:12,226
Call me if you need anything.

257
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:14,598
I'll draw a blood gas.

258
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:19,274
They've had diarrhea all morning

259
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,111
in addition to abdominal cramps

260
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,547
and excessive flatus.

261
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:24,584
We farted the
whole way over here.

262
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,831
Pipe down, Palmer!

263
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:26,989
And you are...?

264
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,561
Dolores Minky, Little
Ranger Scout Mother.

265
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:30,897
Hi, Dolores. Hey, um, uh, Mark?

266
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:33,803
I've got a seven-year-old
in curtain two

267
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:36,875
uh, high temperature
and excessive vomiting.

268
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,779
Could you take a look?

269
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,816
Happy to.

270
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,496
I suspect it's a
case of Giardia.

271
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,099
We had a camping trip
about three weeks ago.

272
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,002
Contaminated stream
water, beaver feces,

273
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,628
that sort of thing.

274
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:48,732
Gross. Jeffrey just cut one.

275
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,235
I'm going to puke.

276
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:51,605
I didn't do it.

277
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,007
It was Andrew.

278
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,154
Boys, now, that's enough!

279
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,223
Hey, now, guys, come on.

280
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:56,359
Come on, guys. Hey,
hey. You don't need that.

281
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:57,817
Come on, come on.

282
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:00,055
Oh, oh, there
you go. There it is.

283
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,393
Told you.

284
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,798
Temperature's 102.

285
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,201
Does that hurt?

286
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:07,704
Yeah.

287
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:10,019
Yeah. Has anyone
else in your family

288
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,055
been sick recently?

289
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,683
No, we've all been fine.

290
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:16,600
Your daughter has a very
faint heart murmur, is that right?

291
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:18,024
Yeah, since birth.

292
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,406
But they call it an
innocent murmur,

293
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,575
not supposed to be dangerous.

294
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,077
No, it's fine, Mrs. Lafferty.

295
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:24,248
Joanie's probably got the flu.

296
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:25,551
I think she's dehydrated,

297
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:29,079
so I'd like to get her
started on some fluids.

298
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:31,362
And I think it's best
if we get a spinal tap

299
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:32,632
and rule out meningitis.

300
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,691
Spinal tap? That's very serious.

301
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:37,631
We hope it will rule
out anything serious.

302
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,044
What are they going to do, Mom?

303
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:42,050
We are going to help you
get better, that's what, okay?

304
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,508
Be right back.

305
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,715
Let's start an I.V.,
saline, 100cc's per hour.

306
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:50,656
Get a C.B.C., chem
seven and prep for an LP.

307
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,092
You got it.

308
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:53,896
Thanks.

309
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:57,653
All right.

310
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,991
Retract the liver.

311
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,294
Suction.

312
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,051
I had a case like this just
a couple of weeks ago.

313
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,041
Rebar went straight through
the inferior vena cava.

314
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:09,288
Extend the incision
up through the chest

315
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:10,323
and divide the sternum.

316
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:11,348
Scalpel?

317
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:16,235
Yeah, this guy's

318
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,577
putting a TV
antenna on his roof.

319
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:21,017
It fell, and he
fell, right on it.

320
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:22,485
Ouch.

321
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:23,838
All right.

322
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,041
Bone saw.

323
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:29,633
Carter, can you see
anything back there?

324
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:30,635
Uh, not really.

325
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,105
All right, well, step up.

326
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,708
Hold the retractor.

327
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:36,147
Aluminum spike right
through his gallbladder.

328
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,666
Lungs down.

329
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,593
Sternal retractor.

330
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:56,253
What happened?

331
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:59,275
Well, ruined his
reception, for one thing.

332
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:02,515
I'm a cable man myself.

333
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,788
Okay, um, open the
pericardium and put a 2-O

334
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,274
proline purse string

335
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,741
around the auricle
of the right atrium.

336
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,432
I.V.C.'s dissected free.

337
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:14,506
Carter, get ready to pull.

338
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,542
We're close.

339
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:19,449
Now.

340
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,286
Okay, ease it out.

341
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:23,908
Easy. Get ready
to advance the cath.

342
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,177
Say when.

343
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,493
Okay. Now!

344
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,864
Okay, tighten the
purse string around it.

345
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:31,741
Pretty cool, huh, Carter?

346
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:33,260
Very cool.

347
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,466
Okay, let's do some
repair work here, huh?

348
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:38,587
V-fib!

349
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:39,639
Internal paddles!

350
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:40,737
Carter, get over
here, stick your hands

351
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,772
in there and massage the heart!

352
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:42,796
Charge to ten.

353
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:47,772
Clear.

354
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:51,813
Hey.

355
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,416
Hey. Nice shirt.

356
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:54,987
Ha-ha! Occupational hazard.

357
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:58,593
Listen, is there any chance
you can get off early today?

358
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,642
Jake and I are
going house hunting.

359
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,001
What's that about?

360
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:04,705
Well, the landlord gave
us two months' notice.

361
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,220
He wants his
daughter to move in.

362
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,377
That's a drag.

363
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:08,730
Dr. Ross,

364
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:11,236
you<i> are</i> coming back in, right?

365
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:13,506
Yes, Wendy, I'm coming back in.

366
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,093
No, it's okay.

367
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:19,330
I'd like a bigger place

368
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:21,634
and, um, Jake needs a backyard.

369
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:22,759
Mm-hmm.

370
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:25,430
You know, depending
on how we feel

371
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,980
there could be room for you.

372
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:30,039
Uh... um...

373
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,544
are you, uh, talking about us

374
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,047
moving in together?

375
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,552
Maybe, you know, at some point.

376
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:37,800
Well... you...

377
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:39,002
you know...

378
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,296
Oh, you can stop
stuttering, Doug.

379
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:42,965
It's just an idea.

380
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,836
I mean, I just...

381
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,118
do you think that we're ready?

382
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:49,913
Well, I think I'm
probably more ready

383
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:52,819
than you are, but
I'm in no hurry.

384
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:57,895
Well, you let me know
if you find anything today

385
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:59,699
and I'll take a look.

386
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,937
Call me later.

387
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:03,540
Okay.

388
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:06,762
I've got an appendectomy
late this afternoon.

389
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,744
Make sure you do
charts and labs first.

390
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:10,035
Are you saying I can scrub in?

391
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:11,606
After charts and labs.

392
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:12,774
Of course. Right.

393
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:15,357
Hi, Mrs. Schaeffer.

394
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:16,916
I'm Dr. Benton.

395
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,252
As you know

396
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:20,601
your son James was brought in

397
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:25,032
with severe head trauma
and internal bleeding.

398
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:29,608
His heart stopped during
emergency surgery.

399
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:32,280
We tried for 33 minutes
to resuscitate him.

400
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,952
We used all of our capabilities

401
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:40,129
but his injuries were
too severe, and he died.

402
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,466
Tag... Tag, please.
I<i> do</i> like your mom.

403
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:54,774
I just don't want to have dinner
with her three nights in a row.

404
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,745
Tag? Tag?

405
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:01,655
Don't say anything.

406
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,191
It's only a wedding.

407
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:06,164
So what if the
caterers just canceled

408
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,568
and the bridesmaids'
dresses are late

409
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:10,640
the relatives are early?

410
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:14,347
I'm sure this is going to
make me a much better person.

411
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:19,658
So, are you going up to
Milwaukee for Mother's Day?

412
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,461
Rachel's got a sleep-over.

413
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:23,644
Jen's coming down
for dinner tonight.

414
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,369
Sounds like a date.

415
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:26,582
Yeah. That's the idea.

416
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:27,874
Oh, Carter!

417
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:29,009
Carter?

418
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:38,412
How's Chloe?

419
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:39,492
She's fine.

420
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:41,150
The baby's great.

421
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:42,953
They're staying one more night,

422
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:45,169
then home to mom and pop Lewis.

423
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,162
Oh, so your folks
finally gave in?

424
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,299
Yeah. Guilt's a wonderful thing.

425
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,336
See you later.

426
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,871
Carter, sit down.

427
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:54,221
So, did you make a decision?

428
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,750
Uh... well, I'm grateful
for the year I've survived

429
00:15:57,785 --> 00:16:01,390
but I guess I'm going
to have to decline.

430
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:03,572
Benton came through
with the surgical?

431
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,365
No, not exactly, not yet,

432
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,001
but I think surgery
is what I want.

433
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:08,916
More like being a real doctor?

434
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,241
No. No, of course not.

435
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:12,457
Surgeons, they
get all the glory.

436
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:14,227
You know, we're
just the middlemen.

437
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:15,496
Don't worry, Carter.

438
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,624
You're going to do great,
whatever you choose.

439
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:28,494
Oh, excuse me.

440
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,832
Where can I find Chloe Lewis?

441
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:31,834
You're family?

442
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,836
Yes.

443
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:33,838
I'm Cookie Lewis.

444
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,708
Room 304 on the right.

445
00:16:35,743 --> 00:16:37,345
Thanks.

446
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:40,451
Mom?

447
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:41,553
Susie-cake!

448
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,424
Mom!

449
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,494
What's that ridiculous
shirt you're wearing?

450
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,167
Do they allow you
to wear that to work?

451
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:49,703
Good to see you, too.

452
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:51,340
Come on, Chloe's in here.

453
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:58,304
Hi, Cookie. Get in here.

454
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,608
Oh, what a cute little thing.

455
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,446
Oh!

456
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,581
Yeah.

457
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:05,167
It's pretty neat, huh?

458
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:07,221
Oh, my, yes.

459
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:08,458
Mm-hmm.

460
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:11,764
Almost makes me glad
you got yourself knocked up.

461
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,849
Mom!

462
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,012
What's the matter, Susie cakes?

463
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:15,471
Am I embarrassing you?

464
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:19,078
Ow! God, she's got a
mouth like a staple gun.

465
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:20,448
Yeah. So did you.

466
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:21,817
Both of you.

467
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:23,354
Will you take her, Susie?

468
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,656
Yeah.

469
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,896
Yeah, I got her.

470
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,138
Mom, they do feed
people here, you know.

471
00:17:32,173 --> 00:17:34,253
A little extra won't hurt.

472
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:35,322
She's going to be here a week.

473
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,312
No. She's not.

474
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,314
I told you, she's
leaving tomorrow.

475
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,551
Here.

476
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:42,191
No. I told your father
it would be a week.

477
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,062
He's putting up

478
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,115
the crib, isn't he?

479
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,873
You know how he is
with that sort of thing.

480
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:51,359
Mom,<i> please.</i>

481
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,556
Well, I was always the one

482
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,460
putting things together
on Christmas eve.

483
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:55,997
Yeah. Right.

484
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:57,856
Like what?

485
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:58,858
Chloe, please.

486
00:17:58,893 --> 00:17:59,894
Don't start.

487
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:01,680
Don't start what, Susie?

488
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,351
I mean, how many little
red wagons did you see

489
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:05,688
around the house?

490
00:18:05,723 --> 00:18:08,459
Oh, I think she's going to
have your father's curly hair.

491
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,346
Mom, Ronnie has curly hair too.

492
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:11,884
How would I know that?

493
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,386
Have I ever met him?

494
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:14,388
Well, you will.

495
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:15,390
Next week.

496
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:16,760
Well, I had to call him

497
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,780
and tell him he was a father.

498
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:20,617
He's going to come up and visit.

499
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:21,664
Don't worry. He's
not going to stay.

500
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:23,005
Why would he stay?

501
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,211
He's only got a
brand-new baby to support.

502
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:27,248
Why stay?

503
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:29,201
I got to get back to work.

504
00:18:29,237 --> 00:18:30,898
Mom, please get
Dad started on the crib.

505
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:32,902
We're going to be there
tomorrow afternoon.

506
00:18:32,926 --> 00:18:34,840
Don't forget to call
before you come.

507
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,830
What?

508
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,545
Well, you know. In
case we're not home.

509
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:39,104
Aw, please.

510
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,711
Henry hasn't left the
barcalounger in 15 years.

511
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,650
Don't talk about
your father like that.

512
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:47,554
The guy doesn't even
come down to visit

513
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:48,789
his firstborn grandchild?

514
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,260
He's a lazy, fat pig freak.

515
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,602
If you'd played catcher,
this wouldn't have happened.

516
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:55,604
Mom...

517
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:56,956
We play in the

518
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,471
mother-daughter
tournament every year.

519
00:18:58,495 --> 00:18:59,707
This morning, bees.

520
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:00,875
Everywhere, bees.

521
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:02,613
I don't think there's a
problem, Mrs. Sandburgh.

522
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:03,748
Well, think again, doctor.

523
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:05,016
Kaitlin is allergic to bees.

524
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,007
Well, there's no sign

525
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,121
of reaction.

526
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,128
There will be.

527
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,197
I know.

528
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,233
I'm allergic to bees.

529
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:11,519
It's not necessarily genetic.

530
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:13,523
Oh, right.

531
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:15,175
Like you know that, huh?

532
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:17,346
I'm going to get some forceps.

533
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:18,883
I'll be right back.

534
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:20,737
I don't like him.

535
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:21,884
Trade you.

536
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:22,974
Mm-mm.

537
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:30,055
What happened in here?

538
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,091
Mother's Day.

539
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:34,264
I had no idea it could
be so dangerous.

540
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,667
Why is she sleeping?

541
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:38,038
Passed out. Brunch
at the pump room.

542
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:41,144
Drank too many mimosas,
stumbled in the parking lot

543
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,348
and her kids brought her in.

544
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,130
I've got another mother for you.

545
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:47,100
A little old lady in
exam room four.

546
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:48,136
Arm laceration.

547
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,522
Check on her when you're done.

548
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,152
The results of the spinal tap

549
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:57,677
are negative,

550
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,425
so we can rule out meningitis.

551
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,897
Murmur's a little
louder... three/six.

552
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,355
B.P.'s 80/50m

553
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,860
but her pulse is 120, resp 36.

554
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:07,697
Can I see your hands?

555
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:09,166
They are very pretty.

556
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:11,249
You know, I have a
daughter about your age

557
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:13,286
and her favorite color is pink.

558
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,591
Unfortunately, we're
going to have to take it off

559
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,728
so I can look at
your nails, okay?

560
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:18,852
Okay.

561
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:20,367
Let's find some acetone

562
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,304
and take off the nail polish.

563
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:25,499
Mrs. Lafferty, can I please
speak to you for a minute?

564
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:26,812
Is it her heart?

565
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:29,118
They said the murmur
wasn't dangerous.

566
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,909
We need to do more blood work

567
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:32,346
and get a chest X ray.

568
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:33,749
It could be pneumonia

569
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,419
or possibly early heart failure.

570
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:37,121
Oh, my God.

571
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:40,496
Has your daughter had
any other injuries recently?

572
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,098
Any medical or dental work?

573
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,212
She went to the dentist

574
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:44,815
two weeks ago, had
her teeth cleaned.

575
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,276
She could have what's
called endocarditis.

576
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,380
Bacteria spreads
into the bloodstream

577
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,185
and causes an infection
around the heart valves.

578
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,624
It can be treated
with antibiotics.

579
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,447
Excuse me. I
ordered a burger, fries

580
00:20:57,482 --> 00:21:00,686
and a vanilla shake,
very, very thick.

581
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:03,257
Look at you,
working on a Sunday.

582
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:05,507
No rest for the ambitious.

583
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,773
Do you have Mother's Day plans?

584
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:10,872
No, thankfully, I do not.

585
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:14,246
Hmm. Well, you're
welcome to join me and mine.

586
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:16,985
We're drinking
Manhattans at Shaw's.

587
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,454
And boyfriend Brian?

588
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,026
Couldn't, uh...
couldn't keep up.

589
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:23,297
Had to cut him loose.

590
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,303
Well, thank you,
but I can't make it.

591
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:27,873
How about afterwards?

592
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:30,111
No. I can't do that, either.

593
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:32,449
God, you're being good.

594
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:35,722
But I knew you
when you were bad.

595
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:37,592
See ya.

596
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,103
He was eating the Sunday
special at Chulac's on 23rd,

597
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:44,774
turned blue and collapsed.

598
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,287
We tried the
Heimlich. Got nothing.

599
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:47,278
Heart attack?

600
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:48,692
Yeah. Sounds like it.

601
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:51,319
He's cyanotic, pulse
58, B.P.'s 50 palp.

602
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,657
Stopped breathing
at your back door.

603
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:56,263
We got two I.V.s of
normal saline going,

604
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:57,983
500cc's bolus in the field.

605
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:03,772
All right, people,
on my count...

606
00:22:03,796 --> 00:22:05,965
One, two, three.

607
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:07,268
Grab the I.V.s.

608
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:09,139
Cap refill's no good.

609
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:12,445
Give him a mig of atropine
and start a dopamine drip.

610
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,782
Pulse is still 58,
B.P.'s 40 palp.

611
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:16,731
Mr. Carter, this gentleman
has stopped breathing

612
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:19,159
and he would appreciate
being able to do so.

613
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:20,694
Would you intubate him, please?

614
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,030
Sure. Of course.

615
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,567
Laryngoscope.

616
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,390
Carter, hurry up.

617
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,614
I can't.

618
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,852
I think there's an obstruction.

619
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:34,605
Joe said he

620
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:36,225
was eating, right?

621
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,169
Again.

622
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:42,850
Yeah, there's an obstruction.

623
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:45,361
Get the Magill forceps.

624
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:47,932
Here, Carter. You
need to learn this.

625
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,335
Pulse ox is falling.

626
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,471
Susie-cakes!

627
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:52,792
Can I talk to you for a minute?

628
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:54,006
Mom, not in here.

629
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,143
I'll be out there in a minute.

630
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,002
I got something.

631
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:03,814
Suction.

632
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,066
Damn. That's nasty.

633
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:06,736
All right, let's
hyperventilate him

634
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:07,883
and get a blood gas. Let's move.

635
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:09,491
Mom?

636
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:13,115
Mom, I'm sorry about that,
but we don't want anyone

637
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:16,823
in the trauma room while
we're working on a patient.

638
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,667
Hello.

639
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:22,802
I'm John Carter.

640
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:25,506
Dr. Benton told me
that you cut your arm.

641
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,510
Oh, no. No. It's not me.

642
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:29,081
I'm Ethyl.

643
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,952
It's my mother, Ada.

644
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:32,487
Oh, hello, Ada.

645
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:35,110
Can I look at<i> your</i> arm?

646
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:36,712
Ada?

647
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,282
So, what did you need?

648
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:39,585
I can't do it, Susie.

649
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,591
I can't take the baby,
and I can't take Chloe.

650
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:44,272
Somebody help! Code blue!

651
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,043
What? Mom... I know I
said I would, but I just can't.

652
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,033
And quite honestly,

653
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:48,803
I don't think it was
fair of you to ask me.

654
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,687
I mean, it's not fair to me, and you
should have known better. Mom...

655
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:54,014
I mean, you know, the crib's
not going to be up in time.

656
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,619
The wallpaper isn't
right in that room.

657
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:58,757
Your father and I still
might take that cruise

658
00:23:58,792 --> 00:23:59,992
in Alaska this summer,

659
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:02,264
and so I just think you'd
better make other plans.

660
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,800
Mom, what happened?

661
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:06,037
Did Chloe say
something, do something?

662
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:07,274
No.

663
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:08,588
So you're just
changing your mind

664
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:10,124
after agreeing to
do this, is that it?

665
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,215
Yes.

666
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,670
Well, what the hell am I
supposed to do with her?

667
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:14,783
She doesn't have any money.

668
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:16,118
She doesn't have
a place to live.

669
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:17,255
This is your granddaughter
we're talking about!

670
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,582
Susan, don't you throw that

671
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:21,552
in my face.

672
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:24,608
Now, I did my
best with you girls,

673
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:28,282
but I just... I
can't do it again.

674
00:24:28,318 --> 00:24:30,853
I don't want to do it again.

675
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:34,361
I had my kids, Susie.

676
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:36,766
I'm done.

677
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:40,573
Now... I have to stop by
the market on the way home

678
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,711
'cause we're out of beer.

679
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:47,521
You know how your father
hates it when we're out of beer.

680
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:07,254
Where are you going
on your honeymoon?

681
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:09,046
Tag's going to Paris.

682
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,750
I'm going to Hawaii.

683
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:12,353
Can I go with you?

684
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:14,924
Sure. You can leave
Chloe and the baby

685
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,361
with his 15 cousins.

686
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:18,331
Good. Thanks.

687
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:20,168
I might stay.

688
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:21,504
In Hawaii?

689
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,074
Yeah.

690
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:24,677
Okay.

691
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:26,882
I can do that.

692
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:29,720
You think Tag'll mind?

693
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:32,326
He'll get over it.

694
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:34,196
Think Chloe'll mind?

695
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:37,135
I don't think
she'll even notice.

696
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:39,907
Think they've noticed
that we've been gone?

697
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,344
Probably.

698
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,748
Think we should head back?

699
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:46,487
Probably.

700
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:58,295
See, that was your
first elevator ride.

701
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,698
Yeah.

702
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:06,477
Oh, here, this is a window, see?

703
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:08,213
That's gum stuck to the window.

704
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,984
Yuck.

705
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,254
And this is...

706
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:12,867
Send him to O.R. three.

707
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,327
Metcalf's on his way.

708
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:15,506
And that?

709
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,176
Hold the elevator.
That's whatever that is.

710
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,204
I'll get his parents to
talk to him in a second.

711
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,576
Chloe? Hey, is this
little Miss Lewis?

712
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:24,145
Yeah. Isn't she perfect?

713
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:25,214
Oh, yeah. She sure is.

714
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:26,650
What's her name?

715
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,532
Susan, Susie,
maybe little Susie.

716
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:30,191
Oh, hey.

717
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:32,340
You know where big Susie is?

718
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:33,564
Uh, big Susie?

719
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,169
No. Chloe, you really
shouldn't have the baby

720
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:37,271
out here so soon.

721
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:38,987
Oh, no, no, no, it's
okay. She likes it.

722
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:41,313
Well, I'm sure she
does, but you might want

723
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:42,749
to wait a month or so.

724
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:43,785
Please, help me!

725
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,920
Somebody help me!

726
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:46,456
Nina's in trouble here.

727
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:48,327
Lydia, I need some help.

728
00:26:48,362 --> 00:26:49,897
Jerry, get a gurney.

729
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,233
Clear trauma one.

730
00:26:51,268 --> 00:26:52,513
What's her name?

731
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:53,503
Nina.

732
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,091
Nina, can you hear me?

733
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:56,293
What'd she take?

734
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:57,946
I don't know for sure.

735
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:00,651
She did a speedball
and maybe some downs.

736
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:02,288
What kind of downs?

737
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:03,402
I don't know, I don't remember.

738
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:04,459
Please help her.

739
00:27:04,495 --> 00:27:05,461
Mouth shield?

740
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:06,463
She's crashing.

741
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,445
Let's get her out of here.

742
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:09,514
Let's go. Trauma one.

743
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:10,750
What's your name?

744
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:12,141
Everett.

745
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:13,255
Call respiratory stat Everett, you're
going to have to try and remember

746
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,859
to trauma one. if she
took red or she took blue.

747
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,049
We had everything.

748
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:17,452
I don't know for sure.

749
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:18,521
Watch your head.

750
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:20,502
Lydia, get me an invasion tray.

751
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:23,041
Right. The paddles
over here, too.

752
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:25,547
You got to stay
out here, please.

753
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:34,930
Look at the little baby.

754
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:36,167
What a doll.

755
00:27:36,191 --> 00:27:38,327
Can you please take
her back to the nursery?

756
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:40,142
She's not supposed
to be down here.

757
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,234
Sure, I'll take her up.

758
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:51,786
You said the pediatric
surgeon would be coming in?

759
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:53,188
Yes, Dr. Netzley.

760
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:56,730
We'll schedule surgery with
him as soon as he gets here.

761
00:27:56,765 --> 00:27:58,984
And he's done this before?

762
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,732
Mitral valve replacement?

763
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:02,057
Yes, many times.

764
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:05,029
I know it's a lot to
take in, Mrs. Lafferty,

765
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:06,466
but it's a routine procedure.

766
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:09,037
Is your husband able to come?

767
00:28:09,073 --> 00:28:10,540
We're divorced.

768
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:12,244
He lives in Tucson.

769
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:37,227
Hey, Chloe.

770
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:40,500
What are you doing here?

771
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,408
What happened?

772
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:45,777
What's wrong?

773
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:50,186
A baby is so small, Susie,

774
00:28:50,222 --> 00:28:53,692
and I just started thinking
about all the bad stuff

775
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:55,541
that can happen, you know?

776
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:58,602
And how do I keep
it from happening?

777
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,706
What are you talking about?

778
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:03,679
Mom and dad couldn't
keep it from happening.

779
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:05,083
Nothing's going to happen.

780
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,551
The baby's fine.

781
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:09,424
She is now, but...

782
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,097
Oh...

783
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,614
All right, I'm just scared.

784
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:20,246
I guess I'll feel better
when we get home

785
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:23,752
even if it is with
Cookie and Henry.

786
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:26,558
So...

787
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:29,631
Yeah, you'll feel better
when you get some sleep.

788
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:31,335
Yeah.

789
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,087
Get up to your room

790
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:43,592
and I'll come see
you later, okay?

791
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:45,128
Okay.

792
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,643
Thanks, Susie.

793
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:00,426
The decision's made, Peter.

794
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,730
That's all there is to it.

795
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:04,779
Look, I've trained
this guy all year.

796
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,518
Peter, Susan? We
need you down here.

797
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,221
Dueling gang chicks.

798
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:12,717
This one's Rosario Guitterez,
also known as La Puppet.

799
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:14,286
Stab wounds to the chest.

800
00:30:14,322 --> 00:30:15,288
Pulse 140, thready, B.P.. 60/30.

801
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:16,290
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

802
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:19,430
That one's Angelina
Figueroa, La Blue Eyes.

803
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:20,766
GSW to the head.

804
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,104
Pulse 60, B.P.. 90/60, GCS 5.

805
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,377
All right, people, let's
lift her on my count.

806
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:28,415
One, two, three.

807
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,884
Have a nice day.

808
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,320
O2, 15 liters.

809
00:30:31,356 --> 00:30:32,723
Tracheal shift.

810
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,360
She's really cyanotic.

811
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:36,475
Capillary blanch is positive.

812
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:38,880
Tension pneumo. Hey,
Dr. Ross, use a 16-gauge needle.

813
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,105
You got it.

814
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,786
Give me a 6.5 tube.

815
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,244
No respiratory effort.

816
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,482
What have we got?

817
00:30:45,517 --> 00:30:48,555
Gray matter all over her hair.

818
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,960
All right, let's
hyperventilate her.

819
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:52,174
Sinus brady 52.

820
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:55,802
Mannitol, 75 grams,
and a gram of Ancef, I.V.

821
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,172
O2, 15 liters.

822
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,791
That's right.

823
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:01,397
Second intercostal
space, midclavicular line.

824
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:02,466
O-neg's here.

825
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:03,862
Want to do a chest tube?

826
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,666
Yeah, let's get one prepped.

827
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,659
La Puppet's breathing easier.

828
00:31:07,694 --> 00:31:09,341
Rosario, can you hear me?

829
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:11,245
Hey, Rosario, can you hear me?

830
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,319
Get off of me!

831
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:13,565
Get off me!

832
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:15,642
Whoa, baby, I guess you can.

833
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,011
Hold her down.

834
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,176
I'm fine!

835
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,333
Let me go.

836
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:20,868
Let me go, I said.

837
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:21,537
Let her die!

838
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:23,391
Let her die!

839
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:26,162
You stabbed me with
my own knife, you bitch.

840
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,866
I hope you die, you whore.

841
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:29,903
Connie, get her restrained

842
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:31,340
and 2.5 of Droperidol I.V. now!

843
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:32,809
How about a tox screen?

844
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:34,713
Yeah. Guess that one woke up.

845
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:35,982
Let's get a CBC.

846
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:38,654
Chem seven, type and
cross-match two units.

847
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,558
Get a chest film and do a C.T.

848
00:31:40,593 --> 00:31:41,860
on the way to I.C.U.

849
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:42,996
Pupils are blown.

850
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,384
No reflexes, flaccid paralysis.

851
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,565
Want me to track
down her family?

852
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:48,168
Yeah. Haleh, why don't
you check her wallet,

853
00:31:48,192 --> 00:31:50,105
see if there's a donor
card on her driver's license.

854
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:51,096
Yeah, that's likely.

855
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:52,365
She stole my boyfriend.

856
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:54,688
I want her to die.

857
00:31:56,693 --> 00:31:58,193
Lydia, call the I.C.U.

858
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:01,767
and tell them we'll be
up in a few minutes. Now!

859
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:06,744
You damn bitch!

860
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,648
Look what you did to me.

861
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:09,950
Get her out of here!

862
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:11,854
You cut my ear off!

863
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,423
Where the hell is security?

864
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:14,741
Get her off!

865
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:15,946
Malik!

866
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:21,957
Focus, Carter.

867
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:24,095
Do the chest tube.

868
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:25,597
I'll get you!

869
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:26,745
No!!

870
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:28,136
Dr. Benton, your mother's

871
00:32:28,171 --> 00:32:29,773
nursing home is on the phone.

872
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:31,911
Tell them I'll have
to call them back.

873
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:32,957
They say it's urgent.

874
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:33,948
Go, go. Go, go.

875
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:35,224
All right. Get her up to I.C.U.

876
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:37,021
Everything all right in here?

877
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,023
Hunky-dory.

878
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:39,091
More Droperidol?

879
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:40,093
Yeah, 2.5.

880
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:42,331
Trauma team's on its way down.

881
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:45,036
Let's clamp the suction tube.

882
00:32:45,072 --> 00:32:47,241
Okay, let's move her.

883
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:48,644
Carter!

884
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,281
Grab the monitor.

885
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,783
Come on. Come on.

886
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:02,650
Where's Dr. Benton?

887
00:33:02,674 --> 00:33:04,275
Uh, had to go.

888
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,348
Uh, Mr. Carter

889
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:11,289
I know Dr. Benton wanted
to talk to you about this

890
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,027
but I need to
notify some people.

891
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:16,967
We had a number of
excellent candidates this year

892
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:18,837
for the surgical sub-internship.

893
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:21,242
The selection process
was very difficult

894
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:23,680
and while you've done
some excellent work,

895
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:25,896
another applicant
was more qualified.

896
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,157
I'm sure you'll do well in
whatever else you choose.

897
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:37,992
Hey, having fun
in here, big Susie?

898
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:40,330
What did you call me?

899
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:41,632
Big Susie?

900
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:42,935
I like that.

901
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:45,474
Hey, starting nose tackle
for the Chicago Bears

902
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:47,477
Malik Williams,
ladies and gentlemen.

903
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:48,514
All right!

904
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:51,452
Security's got her
restrained in the suture room

905
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,857
if anyone wants to
check out that ear.

906
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:55,193
She brought the ear?

907
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:56,306
Carol... hey.

908
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,631
Ow!

909
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,902
Thanks, Malik.
We'll be right there.

910
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:04,678
Carter, you seen Benton?

911
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:06,883
Carter, you all right?

912
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,052
What?

913
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,254
Yeah, fine.

914
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:19,174
Dr. Benton...

915
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,977
What is it? What's happened?

916
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:23,481
I'm sorry I couldn't
get to you sooner.

917
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:24,650
What's going on?

918
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:26,299
They wouldn't tell me
anything on the phone.

919
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:28,369
Dr. Benton, your mother
arrested at 5:15 this afternoon

920
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:29,973
while I was in attendance.

921
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:32,700
We tried to resuscitate
her for 25 minutes.

922
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:34,481
We used all our capabilities,

923
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,076
but her heart was too
weak, and she died.

924
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:38,393
I'm sorry.

925
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,325
Are you all right?

926
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:55,762
Yeah, we're okay, uncle Peter.

927
00:34:55,798 --> 00:34:57,500
Mama's still in with her.

928
00:34:58,637 --> 00:34:59,971
Yeah.

929
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:34,641
Hey.

930
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,843
I'm going to go check
on the kids, okay?

931
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,069
I thought you were off at 8:00.

932
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:49,640
I'm on my way home.

933
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:52,177
I thought you and Jen
were having dinner.

934
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:53,480
She's running late.

935
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:54,628
You in the mood

936
00:36:54,652 --> 00:36:56,820
to give a little
personal advice?

937
00:36:56,856 --> 00:36:58,067
Not really.

938
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,995
Diane's thinking about
us moving in together.

939
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:03,044
Sorry, Doug, I'm not
going to touch that one.

940
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:04,970
Did you and Jen live together

941
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,116
before you got married?

942
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,778
She says we barely
live together now.

943
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:10,013
The answer is no.

944
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:11,450
Her dad would have killed us.

945
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:14,055
So you bowed to the
reverend's wishes?

946
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,694
I try not to look at
it that way, exactly.

947
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:19,109
So, what are you going to do?

948
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,100
I don't know.

949
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:22,404
Did you know when
you were ready?

950
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:23,941
Yeah.

951
00:37:23,977 --> 00:37:28,016
So, you mean, if I don't
know, then I'm not ready?

952
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:33,928
That's what I thought.

953
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:37,769
Does your lack of
readiness have anything to do

954
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:40,507
with Carol getting
married next week?

955
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,422
What's that supposed to mean?

956
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:44,048
It might be liberating.

957
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:47,354
Does your lack of
readiness have anything to do

958
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:49,558
with me making this next shot?

959
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:51,062
Yes, completely.

960
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:52,631
Okay. If I make it,

961
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,745
you're ready,

962
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,372
and if I don't, you're not.

963
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:08,363
Look, those are the stars.

964
00:38:10,102 --> 00:38:13,139
That's... the little dipper...

965
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:19,018
and... that's the big dipper

966
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,258
and...

967
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:26,816
I don't know the names
of any of the others,

968
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,052
but we'll find out, okay?

969
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:29,521
Dr. Lewis?

970
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,707
Carter.

971
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,530
Do you know the names
of the constellations?

972
00:38:33,565 --> 00:38:35,065
Um...

973
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,341
Well, there's, uh...

974
00:38:39,376 --> 00:38:40,677
Moe...

975
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:42,959
and over there is Larry...

976
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:45,954
and that's got to be Curly.

977
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:48,459
You're worse than I am.

978
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:51,899
She's adorable.

979
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:53,770
I've delivered so many babies

980
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:58,195
and I've never realized
how little they are.

981
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,867
Look at her hands.

982
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:03,205
I'm sorry you're not doing

983
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,858
the E.R. Sub-I.

984
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:06,361
Mark told me.

985
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:09,485
Actually, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

986
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,990
Uh... maybe I made
the wrong decision.

987
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:14,795
Not if surgery's what you want.

988
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,832
Yeah, yeah... I
was just thinking

989
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:19,588
maybe the E.R. is
really what I want.

990
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,093
What do you think
Dr. Greene would say

991
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:24,297
if I told him I changed my mind?

992
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,834
Well, I think he'd
say it's too late.

993
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:27,537
He offered it to Garreau.

994
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:29,307
I suppose she said yes?

995
00:39:29,342 --> 00:39:30,292
I think so.

996
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,829
What was that?

997
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:34,317
A baby burp?

998
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:36,588
Oh, yeah, little one.

999
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:38,224
You look sleepy.

1000
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,851
Yeah, we should put you down.

1001
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:44,855
Carol, page Netzley
to trauma one now.

1002
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:47,460
When Jen arrives, can
you tell her I'll be out

1003
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:48,728
as soon as I can.

1004
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:50,332
Lydia, we got pulmonary edema.

1005
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:53,572
Draw up five of morphine,
start a nitroglycerine drip

1006
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:55,142
and get a blood gas.

1007
00:39:55,178 --> 00:39:56,289
Mark?

1008
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:57,680
Jen, I got

1009
00:39:57,715 --> 00:39:59,784
a seven-year-old crashing.

1010
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:01,454
Can you please wait, okay?

1011
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:32,900
It's not what you think.

1012
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,704
Diane... Diane, listen to me!

1013
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,574
Now, wait!

1014
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,678
I want you to listen to me.

1015
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:40,264
I've done that already.

1016
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,283
Don't do this.

1017
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:42,803
No, don't you do this!

1018
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,107
Don't tell me it's
not what I think

1019
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,321
when you're
standing there lying.

1020
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:47,512
You are lying, aren't you?

1021
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:48,592
Oh, yes, I am lying.
Maybe that's because

1022
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:49,661
the idea of you and
I moving in together

1023
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:51,465
was something that
I wasn't ready for.

1024
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,458
You could have just said that.

1025
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,460
It's because I'm scared

1026
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:57,215
and I was stupid, and I'm sorry.

1027
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:00,488
Give me another chance.

1028
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,591
No.

1029
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:04,029
It won't happen again.

1030
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:06,367
Yes, it will.

1031
00:41:06,402 --> 00:41:08,371
Come on, Diane!

1032
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,046
How long will the surgery take?

1033
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:23,484
Uh, a little over... a
little over three hours.

1034
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,488
And you're sure it's all right

1035
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:27,826
to do it now,
even after all this?

1036
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:29,329
Oh, yes.

1037
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,010
She's quite stable,
Mrs. Lafferty.

1038
00:41:31,034 --> 00:41:32,847
And believe me, this
procedure is really routine.

1039
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:34,772
Joanie's going to be fine.

1040
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:36,654
There's a waiting room just
down the hall from surgery.

1041
00:41:36,678 --> 00:41:37,645
Thanks, Mark.

1042
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,349
Thank you.

1043
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,094
Uh-uh. It is a total
myth that it's the bride

1044
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:47,126
that wants the splashy wedding.

1045
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,750
I know. How big is your church?

1046
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:51,501
Well, it's too small for the
3,000 people on the groom's side,

1047
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:53,894
and too big for the
12 people on mine.

1048
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,010
He invited everyone he ever met.

1049
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:58,037
So did Mark. What a nightmare.

1050
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:00,774
His relatives had
every motel for 20 miles.

1051
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,523
How'd you get through it?

1052
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:03,747
Drugs.

1053
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,853
Hi.

1054
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:08,089
What's going on?

1055
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:09,725
Pre-marital advice.

1056
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,565
Oh, is she telling you
about how I wanted to elope

1057
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,948
but she insisted on Notre Dame?

1058
00:42:14,972 --> 00:42:16,940
Yeah, right.

1059
00:42:21,852 --> 00:42:25,256
Sorry... uh, sorry about dinner.

1060
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,194
You had a patient, Mark.

1061
00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:29,643
She was supposed
to go up hours ago.

1062
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,505
There were complications
and then, the usual...

1063
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,940
These things happen.

1064
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:36,112
What are you going to do?

1065
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:37,848
It's getting late.

1066
00:42:37,884 --> 00:42:39,619
We should get going.

1067
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:41,155
Come on.

1068
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,632
Peter?

1069
00:42:57,189 --> 00:43:00,577
"All of our capabilities."

1070
00:43:03,886 --> 00:43:05,320
Whoo.

1071
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:10,865
I've said those words I
don't know how many times.

1072
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:15,673
I've never actually
heard them until today.

1073
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:18,213
I'm sorry, Peter.

1074
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:21,385
Jackie, uh...

1075
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,658
Jackie brought the kids home

1076
00:43:24,693 --> 00:43:26,695
way past dinner time.

1077
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:31,172
I told her I'd stay here
and, you know, finish up.

1078
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:37,083
You know something?

1079
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:40,657
I, uh... hmm.

1080
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:44,998
I thought I'd be more
prepared for this.

1081
00:43:48,174 --> 00:43:51,345
No one's prepared.

1082
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,882
They said we could
come back tomorrow

1083
00:43:53,918 --> 00:43:58,443
and pick up her
things, and... you know.

1084
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:04,020
I sat beside her...

1085
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:10,132
and I held her hand...

1086
00:44:11,837 --> 00:44:14,408
and I touched her face.

1087
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:21,422
Her skin was so soft.

1088
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:23,560
And just for a moment, you know,

1089
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:26,264
just a second, I guess...

1090
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:32,310
I thought I could stay there...

1091
00:44:32,345 --> 00:44:34,280
forever.

1092
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:41,328
But I can't do that, can I?

1093
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:47,406
I mean...

1094
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:50,078
I can't hold her.

1095
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:53,285
I can't... I can't touch her.

1096
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,456
I can't... I can't do anything.

1097
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:58,629
Shh. Shh.

1098
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:00,900
To keep her.

1099
00:45:35,304 --> 00:45:37,473
