1
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:17,057
Doug?

2
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:23,872
Doug, you slept
through the alarm.

3
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:26,912
Hmm.

4
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:35,697
Doug?

5
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:37,401
Hmm?

6
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,040
Come on.

7
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:42,558
Jake's going to be up soon.

8
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,735
No. Come on. You're
going to get me started.

9
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,685
Two nights in a row, huh?

10
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,610
Didn't you need the bathroom?

11
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,304
No. There's one at work.

12
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:44,330
I'll lock it, okay?

13
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:46,334
You forgot to lock it yesterday.

14
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,184
Okay. All right.
Yeah. I'll see you.

15
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,076
Later.

16
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,346
Carter, go to Radiology.

17
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:01,250
Pick up the film on O'Shields.

18
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:03,221
Chen, work on
those med renewals.

19
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,559
I've got a gallbladder
this afternoon,

20
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:08,432
then I've got to start
those sub-I evaluations.

21
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,749
But placements
aren't until next month.

22
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:12,943
I need your procedure
books by 7:00.

23
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:14,947
I thought we had
until next week.

24
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:17,937
Well, you did. Now you
don't. Is that a problem?

25
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:22,196
It's not fair.

26
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,733
You have been here longer.

27
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,849
You've done more
procedures than I have.

28
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:27,340
There's a few I
haven't done yet.

29
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,022
Four or five. How many
intubations have you done?

30
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:30,526
Lost count. Chest tubes?

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,864
Did a femoral
cut-down yesterday.

32
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:35,659
Oh, but I did. You didn't.

33
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:41,906
How long have you had
this pain, Mr. McDowall?

34
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,475
Since Friday... bowling night.

35
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,413
When I can't bowl,

36
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:46,817
I'm not a happy man.

37
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:48,821
Well, we want you happy.

38
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:50,591
Okay. Chem seven, CBC, LFTs

39
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:51,961
and abdominal ultrasound.

40
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:53,297
An ultrasound?

41
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:54,700
Could be appendicitis.

42
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:55,468
Could be gas.

43
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:57,156
Yeah, I know, but...

44
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,141
Is there a problem?

45
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,193
How you doing, sir?

46
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,031
Not too good. Stomachache.

47
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,166
Kept him from bowling.

48
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:03,837
That's a shame.

49
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:06,120
Mr. McDowall, this is

50
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,347
Dr. Swift, our
attending physician.

51
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,926
Cancel the CBC,

52
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,679
Chem seven, LFTs and ultrasound.

53
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:17,032
Excuse me?

54
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:18,702
Dr. Greene, what's
your diagnosis?

55
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:20,719
Probable gastroenteritis.

56
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,976
Stomach flu.

57
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:23,797
Why are you ordering
$1,000 worth of tests?

58
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,044
Rule out appendicitis.

59
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,285
It's ruled out. Trust me.

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,284
He has pain in the
right lower quadrant.

61
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,894
And so would you

62
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:31,897
if you were full of gas.

63
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,235
Sir, go home.

64
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,803
Take nothing by mouth

65
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,408
for six hours.

66
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:39,381
And when you do, take
little sips of clear fluid.

67
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,755
If it gets worse, you come
back and see us immediately.

68
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,124
All right?

69
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:51,452
You'll be there to get
her moved this afternoon?

70
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:52,777
I'll be there.

71
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,461
I'll tell her she's
going to the home,

72
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,623
but I need you to
back me up, Peter.

73
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,661
Listen, Jackie, I, uh...

74
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:03,967
I want to be the
one to tell her.

75
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:07,875
Please, Jackie.

76
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,071
All right.

77
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:21,355
Petey!

78
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,691
Hey, Ma.

79
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:25,097
Hey, Ma, how you feeling?

80
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,101
I'm leaving today.

81
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:31,110
I've been trying
to make my hair up

82
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,449
the way Daddy liked it.

83
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:35,131
Could you help me, honey?

84
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,622
Ma...

85
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:38,426
Hmm?

86
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:42,518
Uh... Jackie and I
and the doctors...

87
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,063
th... think you need more
care than we can give you.

88
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,366
You need to have
someone around all the time

89
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,753
to make sure that you're okay.

90
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:57,334
We found this great place...

91
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,372
The Melville Home.

92
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:06,754
We'll make it just as nice
as your house, Mama.

93
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,828
Yeah. Jackie's going
to make you curtains.

94
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:12,584
Yellow stripes,
Mama. Your favorite.

95
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:19,299
Do I have to go, Peter?

96
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,179
Yeah, Ma.

97
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:27,416
You... you do.

98
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:29,012
Swift was way out of line.

99
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:31,139
He was right. I
ordered too many tests.

100
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,485
What for? Talk to him.

101
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,289
You still want the
attending, don't you?

102
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:36,449
He's already made
up his mind about me.

103
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:37,953
What do we have?

104
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:40,759
He works for the
electric company.

105
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:42,497
Took a 20-foot fall.

106
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,134
High-current burns.

107
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,271
Got it from here, Doug. Thanks.

108
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,707
Start a central line.

109
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:48,922
Okay. Carter, over here.

110
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:51,382
Have you ever
done a central line?

111
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,053
No, but I've seen one.

112
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,790
You're going to do one now.

113
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:57,496
Put the long 14-gauge
on the 6cc syringe.

114
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,145
B.P. 120 palp, pulse 120.

115
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,739
Prep five migs morphine.

116
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,793
Give him a liter
of Ringer's first.

117
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:05,274
Aim at the sternal notch.

118
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:06,448
80, 90 kilos.

119
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:07,985
Yeah. Right.

120
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,572
You have blood refill.

121
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:10,975
Remove the syringe...

122
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:13,931
and feed the guide wire through.

123
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,635
Lucky guy.

124
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,340
No S.T. changes.

125
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:20,357
Slide it in the
subclavia. Do you want

126
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:21,181
a tetanus?

127
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:22,183
Get it.

128
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:23,518
300cc's Ringer's.

129
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,857
Here are the X rays.

130
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:27,227
They'll do that upstairs.

131
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:28,507
Leave enough guide wire

132
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,068
at the end so you
can pull it back though.

133
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:32,267
You're doing

134
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,690
a central line?!

135
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:34,944
Yep.

136
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,266
Get an X ray to check

137
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:38,501
the placement.

138
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:39,938
Excellent.

139
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:41,875
Get him ready for transfer.

140
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,095
Talk to me.

141
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,217
He fell from a utility pole.

142
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:47,622
Third-degree burns
to upper extremities.

143
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:49,092
No cardiac changes.

144
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,997
C-spine, chest,
pelvis... all are negative.

145
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,534
No long-bone fractures.

146
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,305
Okay. Let's get him up.

147
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,775
Let's go.

148
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,111
Here we go.

149
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,709
Rolling. Rolling.

150
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,744
Any fever, Mrs. Ryan?

151
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,985
No. Just the headache
and some dizziness.

152
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,423
I think I'm going to throw up.

153
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,961
And nausea.

154
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:16,033
Okay, Janette, we'll get you
fixed up right away. Okay?

155
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,715
What's wrong with her, Doctor?

156
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:19,307
It's probably just a flu bug.

157
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:20,878
That's what most of the kids

158
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,248
have been coming in with.

159
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:24,451
Her heart rate is
a little fast though,

160
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,055
so we want to run some tests.

161
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:27,625
Winnie, you want to put her

162
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,192
on a monitor? And let's
check her rhythm strip.

163
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:31,328
A monitor?

164
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:32,653
Yeah. Heart monitor.

165
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:33,833
Isn't that serious?

166
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:34,859
Not necessarily.

167
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:36,995
We just want to
keep our eye on her

168
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,432
while we run the tests.

169
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:39,847
Doctor, are these tests

170
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:41,617
going to cost a lot of money?

171
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,443
You have insurance, don't you?

172
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,779
No.

173
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:47,351
Well, we'll work something out.

174
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,560
How long have
you had that cough?

175
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:55,302
You can give me medicine, okay?

176
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,775
How long, Mrs. Salazar?

177
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,366
A week. Two.

178
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:04,589
Have you been coughing
anything up, like blood?

179
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:05,991
It's not so bad.

180
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:07,328
I have to go.

181
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:09,667
Could you have been exposed

182
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:11,003
to tuberculosis?

183
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:12,284
Tuberculosis?

184
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:14,277
I don't know what you mean.

185
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:17,551
Does anyone else in your
family have this cough?

186
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:19,221
Anybody you work with?

187
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:20,525
I don't work, okay?

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,340
<i>Mi esposo</i> has green card.

189
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:24,344
He work. My children at home.

190
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:25,669
I need to go.

191
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,541
Mm-hmm. Have any
of them been sick?

192
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:30,813
Fevers? Night sweats?

193
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:32,215
My daughter.

194
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,719
I have to go home!

195
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:36,593
<i>Mi madre,</i> she take
care of her now.

196
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:38,262
If your daughter is sick,

197
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:40,400
and you have tuberculosis,

198
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:42,071
we need to see her.

199
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:43,675
It's very contagious.

200
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,946
Now, I can't make
you stay, Mrs. Salazar,

201
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:48,985
but I would like to
strongly advise you

202
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,756
to take these tests.

203
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,462
There's no questions
asked, okay?

204
00:09:57,673 --> 00:10:00,344
Okay. I stay a little bit.

205
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:06,089
What's she so afraid of?

206
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,571
She's probably illegal.

207
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:10,500
She doesn't want to
be put into the system.

208
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:12,937
Lydia, we've got
to get Mrs. Salazar

209
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,341
into an isolation room.

210
00:10:14,376 --> 00:10:17,113
She needs a chest
X ray, acid fast stain

211
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:18,550
and a sputum culture.

212
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,588
Carter, why don't
you find her a mask?

213
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:21,657
Sure.

214
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:24,541
I want you to stay
away from me, Shirley.

215
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:26,602
You could have
killed Mr. Munchy.

216
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:28,650
No such luck. It
was your fault, Sari!

217
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:30,705
You said the road was clear!

218
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:33,043
Didn't say it would
stay that way!

219
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,053
I told you to step on it!

220
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,567
It's not safe to speed!

221
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:38,093
You were going
five miles an hour!

222
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:39,574
Shut up. This is all your fault.

223
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,968
Two sisters, slow-moving MVA.

224
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:45,442
One with a nose lac, the
other dizzy with headache.

225
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:46,678
Vitals stable.

226
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,685
The only danger they're
in is from each other.

227
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,054
Thanks, Sancho.

228
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:53,939
Somebody help!

229
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:55,698
Please! Please!

230
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:58,637
Pulse is thready.

231
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,642
Start a line. Get her some O-2.

232
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:03,514
Get the crash cart with
pediatric paddles now, please.

233
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,118
My God. What's happening?

234
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,783
You have to stay back right now.

235
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:07,474
B.P. 70/50.

236
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,745
Lydia, give me some Adenosine.

237
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:12,718
Janette, you're going
to have to help me out.

238
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,054
Blow on your thumb

239
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,878
like you're blowing up
a balloon, really hard.

240
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:18,047
Two milligrams Adenosine.

241
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:19,383
Three I.V. push.

242
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:20,820
Not registering a B.P.

243
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:22,840
I can't feel a pulse.

244
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,509
She's out.

245
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,911
Oh, my God.

246
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:26,264
Set it on 50.

247
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,801
Hit the synch switch.

248
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,324
Clear.

249
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,500
She's in V-fib.

250
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:35,713
Turn the synch switch off.

251
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,848
Charge to 100 joules.

252
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:38,207
And clear.

253
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,218
Normal sinus rhythm.

254
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:44,186
Pulse bounding.

255
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:45,189
What's that?

256
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:46,425
It means she's okay.

257
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:50,078
Welcome back, kiddo.

258
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:51,948
It's going to be okay.

259
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,187
Your mom's right here.

260
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:55,411
You're fine.

261
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:01,157
"A-R-Q-P-T-X."

262
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:03,295
That was completely wrong.

263
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,101
Why don't you try the same line

264
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:07,905
with your glasses?

265
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:09,642
Oh. Yes.

266
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:15,822
Here we go.

267
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:19,831
"N-T-O-A-

268
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,836
W-R."

269
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,247
Damn it, Shirley.

270
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,068
I can't see squat.

271
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:30,186
I'm going to kill you!

272
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,525
We've lived
together for 50 years,

273
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,296
and I'm not dead yet.

274
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,799
You're a bully, Sari.

275
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,620
Well, now I'm blind.

276
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,290
Are you happy?

277
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,358
Ladies, please.

278
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,762
She's no lady.

279
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:42,764
Hold still.

280
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,103
I'm concerned about your vision

281
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,088
and your headache.

282
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:48,226
We need to get a CAT scan

283
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:49,228
of your head.

284
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:51,900
Which glasses are yours?

285
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,605
How should I know?

286
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,507
I can't see.

287
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,728
Why don't you try these?

288
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:59,100
Here.

289
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:06,868
Oh.

290
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,070
Oh!

291
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:11,429
I thought you'd be older.

292
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,525
Young man...

293
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,630
Just one second.

294
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,402
Carter, got a
procedure for your book.

295
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:24,483
Really?

296
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:25,675
Mm-hmm. Pelvic.

297
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,153
I already have a ton of pelvics.

298
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,418
Lady asked for you personally.

299
00:13:30,454 --> 00:13:31,654
I'm so thirsty.

300
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,357
Some water, please.

301
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:37,366
There you go.

302
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,550
Hey.

303
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:56,558
So, Janette has
supraventricular tachycardia.

304
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:58,363
It's sort of like

305
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,478
a short circuit in her heart.

306
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:03,318
So she needs to be
admitted into Cardiology.

307
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,156
Now, somebody
from Social Services

308
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,327
is going to come down here

309
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:10,956
and help you with your
applications for Medicaid.

310
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:17,872
Your daughter's going
to be fine, Mrs. Ryan.

311
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:20,844
Just fine.

312
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,897
Lunch later?

313
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:22,967
Yeah. Sure.

314
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:24,681
Doc McGoo's, the cafeteria

315
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,251
or the vending machines?

316
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:27,642
It doesn't matter.

317
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:30,850
Wild Willy wants you
to see the lady in Three.

318
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,999
Have you talked to him yet?

319
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:34,524
Nope. Don't plan to.

320
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,073
Why? What's to lose?

321
00:14:36,097 --> 00:14:37,999
She's in her eighth month...

322
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,870
Complaining of stomach cramps

323
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:42,388
and frequent urination.

324
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:45,147
Uh... why don't you take it?

325
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:46,350
Why?

326
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,389
'Cause I asked you to.

327
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:54,719
Do I know you from someplace?

328
00:14:54,754 --> 00:14:55,765
No.

329
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:58,125
Well, why did you ask to see me?

330
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:00,731
Well, um... you treated
my friend Barbara.

331
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,335
She recommended you.

332
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,310
The truth is, I don't really

333
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:07,347
have cramps.

334
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,120
Why are you here, Mrs. Blum?

335
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:13,042
Well, Barbara and her husband

336
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,814
have been trying to
have a baby for years.

337
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,619
They've tried everything.

338
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:20,224
Last month, she
came in with cramps,

339
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,494
and you examined her.

340
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,626
And, the very next week,

341
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,568
she got pregnant!

342
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:27,440
You think I had
something to do with that?

343
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:28,993
Barbara certainly does.

344
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,200
When I told her that
Dan and I were trying,

345
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,272
she said, "Go
see that Dr. Carter.

346
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:36,209
He's got the magic touch."

347
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:39,933
Dr. Greene.

348
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:47,050
Your name's on the board
for that pregnant woman.

349
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:49,265
Why is Dr. Lewis with her?

350
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,791
I gave it to her.

351
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:55,501
I see.

352
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:58,507
I understand you lost
a mother during delivery

353
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,056
a couple of weeks ago.

354
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,049
Jody O'Brien. Pre-eclampsia.

355
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:03,185
She bled out.

356
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,333
I'd like you to present it

357
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:07,338
at the case conference today.

358
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:08,395
Today?!

359
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:09,397
2:00.

360
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:11,068
I need time to prepare.

361
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,805
No, you don't.

362
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,575
You know what happened.

363
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:24,764
Mrs. Salazar...

364
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,186
your tests are positive
for tuberculosis.

365
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:30,193
We need to get your family
in here as soon as possible.

366
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:31,529
I bring them<i> manana.</i>

367
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:32,899
No, no, no.

368
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:33,901
<i>Today,</i> Mrs. Salazar.

369
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:36,140
You shouldn't be
leaving the hospital.

370
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,744
You are very sick.

371
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,079
I feel better.

372
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,449
Really. I can go.

373
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:42,821
You understand the
seriousness of your illness?

374
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:44,959
What matters is your
family, Mrs. Salazar.

375
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:46,562
I don't care if you're illegal.

376
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:47,832
I just want to make sure

377
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:48,968
your kids are okay.

378
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:50,338
They're fine.

379
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:51,606
You are going to infect

380
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:54,062
every person you
come in contact with...

381
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,434
Your children, husband,
the people you work with.

382
00:16:56,469 --> 00:16:57,770
Dr. Greene.

383
00:16:57,805 --> 00:16:59,875
Your family at home
needs to come in

384
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,280
and be seen in this hospital!

385
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:04,017
Mark.

386
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:10,614
What's the matter with you?

387
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:12,831
She's leaving A.M.A.
with infectious TB.

388
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,002
I'm not supposed to
be angry about that?

389
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:17,229
Well, how do you
expect her to trust you

390
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:18,699
if you're screaming at her?

391
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:20,147
I wasn't screaming at her.

392
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:21,605
Now you're screaming at me.

393
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,886
Okay, fine. Forget it.

394
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,412
She leaves, she leaves.

395
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:29,121
Well, rule out sepsis.

396
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:31,427
We made a supra pubic tap.

397
00:17:31,462 --> 00:17:32,896
You're kidding.

398
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:34,534
Step right up, Doc.

399
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:38,053
Temp's 102.

400
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:40,613
I gave him four
ounces of clear liquid

401
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:42,217
like you said. Nothing.

402
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:43,787
Gave him four more.

403
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,206
Eight ounces?

404
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,478
It's dry as a bone.

405
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:48,675
Isn't there some other way

406
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,546
that you can find the
source of the fever?

407
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,339
This is the easiest way.

408
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:55,613
Carter, I want you
to swab the area.

409
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:57,076
Hold the syringe in one hand...

410
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,113
That's okay, kiddo...

411
00:17:58,137 --> 00:17:59,716
And palpate the pubic symphysis.

412
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,824
What now?

413
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,812
We use a small needle

414
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,549
to get a urine sample.

415
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,595
Be careful not to push too hard.

416
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,239
How do you know what's too hard?

417
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:10,578
Oh! Ew!

418
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:11,865
That's probably too hard.

419
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,221
Your husband brought you in?

420
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:19,481
The old fuddy-duddy.

421
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:21,485
He thinks I have
paranoid psychosis

422
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:23,824
with highly elaborated
delusional systems.

423
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:26,496
He reads too much, that's all.

424
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:30,772
Do you ever hear voices
when no one else is around?

425
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,109
Of course not.

426
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,189
Ever have frightening thoughts?

427
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,180
No.

428
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:35,216
Are you ever afraid

429
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,370
that someone is
trying to harm you?

430
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:38,852
Of course. The streets

431
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:41,023
aren't safe nowadays, are they?

432
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:43,533
Mrs. Gainsley,
have you ever been

433
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:45,672
under the care
of a psychiatrist?

434
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,878
Yes. Would you like his number?

435
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:51,217
Let's see. Where'd I put it?

436
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:52,954
It's somewhere.

437
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,026
Just give me a second here.

438
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,869
Yikes.

439
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:03,510
Oh. Sig Saur 228.

440
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:05,092
Nine millimeter, double action.

441
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:06,633
13-round clip.

442
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:10,944
Little heavy, but lethal.

443
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:15,386
Would you mind if I gave
this to Security, just for now?

444
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,107
Not at all.

445
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:19,963
I've still got the Beretta.

446
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:25,976
Still here?

447
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,857
Waiting for the
ambulance to transfer her.

448
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:29,016
How are you, Ma?

449
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:30,330
She's been quiet.

450
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:34,328
Let me talk to her for a minute.

451
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:37,000
Ma, you're going
to like the place.

452
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,337
I saw it.

453
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:40,007
It's nice and clean.

454
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:43,147
You'll have your
own TV in your room.

455
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:47,322
There's a little
courtyard outside.

456
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:54,003
I've got surgery.

457
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,354
Jeannie's going
to go with you now.

458
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,701
I'll come by later, okay?

459
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,858
I love you, Ma.

460
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,999
We're ready.

461
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,063
Hey.

462
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:53,399
Conference?

463
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:54,336
Yeah.

464
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,006
You nervous?

465
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,010
Oh, no. I love an inquisition.

466
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:59,290
You'll do fine.

467
00:20:59,314 --> 00:21:00,616
Are you kidding?

468
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:02,419
They'll be out for blood.

469
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:04,034
We've all been there.

470
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:07,430
Oh? How many young
mothers have you killed, Doug?

471
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,432
Mark, listen.

472
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,636
Hey.

473
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,241
Sorry I can't be
there with you today,

474
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:14,379
but you're going to do okay.

475
00:21:14,414 --> 00:21:15,615
Thanks.

476
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,017
Good luck.

477
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:25,854
Excuse me.

478
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:28,327
Isn't there supposed to be a
conference in here at 2:00?

479
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:29,540
Not enough space.

480
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:31,333
They moved it
to the sixth floor.

481
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:32,414
Oh, yeah? What room?

482
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:33,838
The auditorium.

483
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:35,358
Finger lac in Two.

484
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:37,395
I have to finish
the med renewals.

485
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,899
What's the matter?

486
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:40,580
You got enough finger
lacs in your book?

487
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:41,739
I told you, I'm busy.

488
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,075
Yeah. Right.

489
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,747
Carter, why in the hell did
you give Mrs. Baba water?

490
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:46,917
Who?

491
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,720
The little old lady in Two.

492
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:50,056
She was thirsty.

493
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:51,393
She was N.P.O.

494
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:53,208
Scheduled for gallbladder
surgery this afternoon.

495
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:54,533
No food, no water.

496
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:56,282
She was your
gallbladder patient.

497
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:57,539
Just read the chart.

498
00:21:57,574 --> 00:22:00,546
Now, because of you,
she can't have surgery.

499
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:02,016
I'm doing a small bowel.

500
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,719
Chen, scrub in.

501
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:07,027
To the O.R.

502
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:08,396
Really?

503
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:16,063
Ah, good. You're here.

504
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:19,204
I hope it's instructive...

505
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,056
for the other residents.

506
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,150
Down there.

507
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:40,900
Do you know the diagnostic
criteria for pre-eclampsia?

508
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:43,150
Blood pressure
greater than 140/90,

509
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:44,937
persistent proteinuria
and edema.

510
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:46,213
She had hypertension.

511
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,718
Which I attributed to a
urinary tract infection.

512
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:51,390
Her pressure was high
on only one occasion.

513
00:22:51,426 --> 00:22:52,754
You should have taken
it again in six hours.

514
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:54,508
My index of suspicion
should have been higher.

515
00:22:54,532 --> 00:22:55,678
She seized in the parking lot.

516
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:57,332
I treated her
seizure aggressively

517
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:59,068
with magnesium
sulphate and Ativan.

518
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,195
Have you had a chance
to review the ultrasound?

519
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,426
I missed the
placental abruption.

520
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,896
Did you know what
you were looking for?

521
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,900
The AFI and biophysical
profile were excellent.

522
00:23:05,924 --> 00:23:07,470
There was a normal
fundal placement.

523
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:08,461
Yet she abrupted.

524
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:10,193
I had no clinical
reason to be suspicious.

525
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:11,901
There was no vaginal bleeding,

526
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:14,206
shock, abdominal
pain or fetal distress.

527
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:16,612
What are the criteria for
operative vaginal delivery?

528
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:17,947
Mainly a favorable fetal lie

529
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:19,647
and a small baby...
Under 4,000 grams.

530
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:21,472
The baby was nine
pounds, three ounces.

531
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:23,343
Macrosomia.

532
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:26,533
I used the Leopold
Maneuver and fundal height

533
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:28,871
to estimate baby
weight and size.

534
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,475
I was off.

535
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,795
What risks do you run

536
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,566
using forceps on a
Macrosomic baby?

537
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:36,021
A 23% chance of
shoulder dystocia.

538
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:36,922
Yes. Which happened.

539
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,154
What qualifies you to manage

540
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:39,205
high-risk O.B. in an E.R.??

541
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:40,530
We're not here to question

542
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:41,650
Dr. Greene's training.

543
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:42,652
Stick to the case.

544
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,122
Why a C-section in an E.R.?

545
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:45,268
The baby was hypoxic

546
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,610
and bradycardic.

547
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:48,726
Had to do it in minutes or we
ran the risk of brain damage.

548
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,029
How many crash
C-sections have you done?

549
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,716
I've scrubbed in on
several. That qualified you?

550
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,707
I give Dr. Greene credit

551
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:54,144
for crashing her when he did.

552
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,499
Knowing the outcome, what
would you have done differently?

553
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:59,405
I should have taken
her up to O.B. myself.

554
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,407
Immediately.

555
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:02,161
I've induced before.

556
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:04,015
Delivered babies before.

557
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,322
I assumed that I could
handle the situation.

558
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:09,427
I was wrong.

559
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:17,277
Anyone else?

560
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:24,760
Thank you, Dr. Greene.

561
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,694
That wasn't too bad.

562
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:34,643
I knew, once you had a chance

563
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,138
to talk it through,
you'd feel fine.

564
00:24:37,173 --> 00:24:40,144
I'm supposed to feel
some sense of relief?

565
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,480
Is that it?

566
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:43,468
I got to get back to work.

567
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:45,772
By the way,

568
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:48,512
that stomach flu this morning...

569
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:51,429
The next time you
disagree with my diagnosis,

570
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:53,823
don't do it in front
of the patient.

571
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:59,386
Where are we going?

572
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:00,721
Follow me.

573
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:06,969
All right. Hold that a second.

574
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,743
What do you think?

575
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:12,949
It's a little small for you.

576
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:13,951
Yep.

577
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:15,153
Whose is it?

578
00:25:15,188 --> 00:25:16,756
Yours.

579
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,427
Mine? Doug...

580
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:19,997
It's the same as yours.

581
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:21,111
That's right.

582
00:25:21,135 --> 00:25:23,049
18-speed, grip-twist shifter,

583
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:24,440
hyper-sprocket drive

584
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:26,979
and other stuff I
know nothing about.

585
00:25:27,014 --> 00:25:28,116
Hey, come here.

586
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,284
Come here.

587
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,723
You ride bike, you wear helmet.

588
00:25:31,758 --> 00:25:33,260
Where's your helmet?

589
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:35,676
I know you mean
well, Doug, but it's...

590
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,979
Come on, Doug Race you!

591
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,104
You're on!

592
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,742
You should have
talked to me about this.

593
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:43,147
I'll be back.

594
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:49,562
Where's Anita Salazar?

595
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:51,098
Eloped. Can't find her.

596
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,314
Want me to send Public
Health out to get her?

597
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,539
Give it a try

598
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:57,411
but, ten to one, it's
probably a fake address.

599
00:25:57,447 --> 00:25:59,283
Mark, we could use your help.

600
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,287
We've got an MVA coming in.

601
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,696
Rollover, T.C.

602
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,478
Thrown 20. Heavy E.T.O.H.

603
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:09,037
Lac on his right leg.

604
00:26:09,073 --> 00:26:10,407
No apparent fracture.

605
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:11,943
He's yanked two I.V.s.

606
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:14,599
Calls himself Smiley.

607
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:15,636
No I.D.

608
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,711
Aw! I'm in the wrong place.

609
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,715
Get a portable down here.

610
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,232
CBC, Chem seven, blood alcohol.

611
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:25,557
Watch his neck.

612
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:27,495
Transfer... one, two, three.

613
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:30,367
B.P.'s 90/50.

614
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:31,531
Someone get him undressed.

615
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:32,789
Hit your head?

616
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,025
Does it hurt?

617
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,094
How should I know?

618
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:36,882
Drunk as a skunk.

619
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,447
Scalp's okay. No lacs.

620
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,673
All right, cap refill's slow.

621
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,010
He's hypovolemic.

622
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:44,248
Do you think it's his spleen?

623
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:45,216
I don't know.

624
00:26:45,252 --> 00:26:46,585
Bloods are drawn.

625
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,724
Shoot a cross-table C-spine.

626
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,130
CBC type and cross for four.

627
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:52,650
Peripheral pulses are cool.

628
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:54,653
Lungs clear.

629
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:56,057
Shooting.

630
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:57,626
Stand back.

631
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:00,215
Hold your breath.

632
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:03,289
Clear!

633
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:04,291
O-2's here.

634
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:05,259
This hurt?

635
00:27:05,295 --> 00:27:06,607
Get your hands off me!

636
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:07,899
His abdomen's rigid.

637
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:09,469
I think it's the spleen.

638
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:10,638
Prep for a lavage.

639
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:12,459
Smiley, we're very
concerned about you.

640
00:27:12,494 --> 00:27:15,365
We're going to make sure that
you're not bleeding internally.

641
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,121
We're going to take this
tube and put it in your nose,

642
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:19,792
let it go down
into your stomach.

643
00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:21,027
It's not very pleasant.

644
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:22,531
Go to hell!

645
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:25,136
It's not the highlight
of my day, either.

646
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:27,658
Don't come near me with no tube.

647
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:29,296
One percent Xylocaine with EPI.

648
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:31,500
You are drunk out of your mind.

649
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,738
We need to take care of you.

650
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:36,510
So this is our
decision, not yours.

651
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:37,613
Hey!

652
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:39,668
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.

653
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:41,956
Okay, come on.

654
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,744
Good. Good.

655
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:47,920
Assisted on a laparotomy,

656
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:50,391
and closed the
incision in the O.R.

657
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:51,761
Two new procedures.

658
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,564
Finally, I have a chance.

659
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,567
Uh-huh.

660
00:27:54,603 --> 00:27:56,905
Can I get you anything, Haleh?

661
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:57,908
Coffee? Cake?

662
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,912
You want to get me coffee?

663
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:00,914
Sure.

664
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,451
Cream and sugar.

665
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:06,460
Where we putting Fareau?

666
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:07,663
Oh. Exam Two.

667
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:08,966
Oh, and, if you could,

668
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,236
here is a list of
procedures I still need,

669
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,177
so if any of them come
in, throw them my way?

670
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:15,445
Sure.

671
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:18,352
You can start by helping
Wendy get an I.V. going

672
00:28:18,388 --> 00:28:20,140
on our junkie friend in Two.

673
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:22,310
Oh, I.V.'s not on my list.

674
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:23,348
It is now.

675
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:33,452
Maybe we should get a doctor.

676
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,523
I'll find a vein.

677
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:36,804
Always do.

678
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:39,198
There's one.

679
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:41,636
Oh, no good.

680
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:43,306
I'll get Dr. Lewis.

681
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:44,353
What for?

682
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:46,580
He hasn't got a
vein left anywhere.

683
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:53,095
He's going to
need a central line.

684
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,464
He's bleeding out.

685
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,196
We've got to find out
where the source is.

686
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,153
How's the lavage coming?

687
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:58,335
Almost there. Chest normal.

688
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,172
Got to find the bleeder.

689
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,949
Could be retroperitoneal.

690
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:07,993
Where is he bleeding?

691
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:10,499
Any output? Nothing yet.

692
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:12,804
Hang two units now.

693
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,158
This is soaked through.

694
00:29:14,193 --> 00:29:16,006
Will four units be enough?

695
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,047
Get four more.

696
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,417
Cap refill's bad.

697
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:19,419
Whoa! Whoa!

698
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:20,421
Found it.

699
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:21,423
Femoral artery.

700
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,425
It's a pumper.

701
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,703
Let's get vascular on the line.

702
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,714
Let's get an angiogram.

703
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:25,827
Let's get him up.

704
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,114
Call the blood bank.

705
00:29:27,138 --> 00:29:28,104
Get the blood

706
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,173
to the cath lab.

707
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:30,626
Let's move!

708
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:36,339
Deb?

709
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:40,681
Almost... done.

710
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:42,352
There.

711
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:43,521
Are you crazy?

712
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:46,093
You're not allowed
to do a central line.

713
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:48,343
I was just going
to get it started

714
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,835
but then it seemed so easy.

715
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,271
You'll get in trouble.

716
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:52,308
I'll get fired.

717
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:54,145
It's fine. Look.

718
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,313
Oh, my God.

719
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,650
Where's the...?

720
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:57,818
What's wrong, Deb?

721
00:29:57,854 --> 00:29:58,820
Oh, my God.

722
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:00,090
What's going on?

723
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:02,028
Where's the guide wire?

724
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:03,565
You lost the wire?

725
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,035
Deb, where is it?

726
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,073
Ah, there it is.

727
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,077
Cath lab, stat.

728
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,315
What happened?

729
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,517
Deb, what happened?

730
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:14,300
I need a cath lab.
Two open? Fine.

731
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:15,424
Come on, Carter. Move.

732
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,208
We're going to need to
put a line in and snare it.

733
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:19,511
Get a fluoroscope.

734
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:20,813
And order an echo.

735
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:22,907
Call Transport to take him up.

736
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:24,276
Deb?

737
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:30,339
Deb, wait a minute.

738
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,876
Deb, wait!

739
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:42,466
Find Deb?

740
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:45,039
No, and there's no
answer at her house.

741
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:46,721
I almost feel responsible.

742
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:50,050
Why? You're not the one
who nearly killed a patient.

743
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:51,720
Carter, where's Chen?

744
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:53,056
I have no idea.

745
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:54,771
Well, I don't care
how you do it. Find her.

746
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:55,908
Swift wants to talk to her.

747
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:57,243
How's the patient doing?

748
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,336
Well, we got the wire out,
if that's what you mean.

749
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,569
But whether or not we'll be sued

750
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,827
is another story.

751
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,404
Hey.

752
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,909
You shouldn't have
bought Jake that bike.

753
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:10,911
Why not?

754
00:31:10,947 --> 00:31:12,750
He has one. He doesn't
need another one.

755
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:14,252
He wanted it.

756
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:16,758
There's a lot of things he
wants, he doesn't get, Doug.

757
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,272
All right, well,
I'll take it back.

758
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,597
You miss the point.

759
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:20,599
Doug, at the back door...

760
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:22,070
12-year-old hit
by a delivery truck.

761
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:23,338
Okay. I'll be right there.

762
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:24,340
I don't get it.

763
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:26,279
I was just trying to
do something nice.

764
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:27,592
It's too much too soon.

765
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:29,296
He doesn't know what it means.

766
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,122
Neither do I. What does it mean?

767
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:33,338
You can't go through
him to get to me.

768
00:31:33,362 --> 00:31:34,363
That what you think?

769
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:36,646
That's what he
hopes you're doing.

770
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,881
Doug, Trauma One!

771
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:40,409
12-year-old ran a
red light on his bike.

772
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:41,945
Hit and thrown 20 feet.

773
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:44,585
L.O.C. at scene,
B.P.'s crashing 60/40.

774
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,656
I think he's got a left pneumo.

775
00:31:46,692 --> 00:31:48,627
Name's Billy Schmoo.

776
00:31:48,662 --> 00:31:50,331
Jennifer left?

777
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:54,223
I can't believe you
waited this long to tell me.

778
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,677
It's not like I was going
to make an announcement

779
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:57,715
over the intercom.

780
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,702
What did you tell Rachel?

781
00:31:59,737 --> 00:32:01,449
I took the high
road on that one.

782
00:32:01,473 --> 00:32:02,909
Nothing.

783
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:10,257
I don't think I could
bear losing her.

784
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:13,476
I hardly see her as it is.

785
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,703
Yeah.

786
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:17,707
Well...

787
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:21,683
that's kind of the
problem, isn't it?

788
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:25,123
With Jennifer, not just Rachel.

789
00:32:25,158 --> 00:32:27,529
She wants to be in Milwaukee.

790
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:28,664
So what?

791
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,184
Figure something out.

792
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:31,621
Call her. Go see her.

793
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:33,174
I'm going this weekend.

794
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,682
That's so like a guy
to wait four days.

795
00:32:36,717 --> 00:32:38,352
Go tonight.

796
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:39,633
I work tomorrow.

797
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,492
I'll cover tomorrow.

798
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:45,668
I owe you.

799
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:52,415
Thanks.

800
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,465
Lacerations look superficial.

801
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,703
Pulse is thready at 150.

802
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:03,006
He looks dusky.

803
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:04,287
Tension pneumo.

804
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,378
18 gauge.

805
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:06,814
Set up a Pleurovac.

806
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,551
There we go.

807
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,622
All right.

808
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:13,045
Pulse ox is 65.

809
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,782
CBC, Chem seven.

810
00:33:14,817 --> 00:33:16,730
How many units O-neg?

811
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:17,888
Six.

812
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:20,043
12 lead. Call X ray.

813
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:23,383
Cross-table C-spine
and a portable chest.

814
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,553
He's on his way.

815
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:25,621
Scalpel.

816
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:26,736
What size?

817
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,461
28 French.

818
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,903
There you go.

819
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:35,577
The belly's soft.

820
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:37,414
Bowel sounds normal.

821
00:33:40,021 --> 00:33:42,024
Got that chest tube ready?

822
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,226
Yep.

823
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:55,302
All right.

824
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:59,278
Breath sounds are good...

825
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:01,015
but his B.P.'s crashing.

826
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,372
Distant heart sounds,
dilated neck veins.

827
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:07,696
Prep for pericardiocentesis.

828
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:21,911
All right, kiddo.

829
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:24,183
Alligator clamp.

830
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:25,499
Okay.

831
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:28,860
B.P.'s falling.

832
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,721
Come on now, damn it.

833
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,645
Where are you, little heart?

834
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,798
Whoa. Too far.

835
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,840
It's okay.

836
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,829
Come on, where are you, damn it?

837
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,434
Come on, little heart.

838
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,805
I know you're in
there somewhere.

839
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:53,696
All right. Got it.

840
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:55,584
Oh, yeah, that's much better.

841
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,588
Call O.R. and a thoracic team.

842
00:34:57,624 --> 00:34:59,242
We've got a live one.

843
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:00,345
B.P.?

844
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,000
Coming up... 60/40.

845
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:04,704
Cross-table C-spine.

846
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,709
Let's get a chest film.

847
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:09,030
You're going to
be just fine, buddy.

848
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:13,874
We'll take him up.

849
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:15,277
Great.

850
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,448
You okay?

851
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,185
I'm heading home.

852
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:21,690
What's not to be okay?

853
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:29,307
Pepperoni or salami?

854
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:30,388
What?

855
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:32,248
Pepperoni or salami?

856
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:33,250
On your pizza.

857
00:35:33,285 --> 00:35:34,503
Salami.

858
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:37,109
Too bad. I win.

859
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:40,131
All right, all right,
but only on one-third.

860
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,468
Okay.

861
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:43,104
See you in a bit, babe.

862
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,540
Bye.

863
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,314
Pizza'll be there in 20 minutes.

864
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:48,750
Thanks.

865
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:50,154
For what?

866
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,367
For staying.

867
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:53,828
Yeah, well, you're
buying the pizza.

868
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:02,964
Look at your daddy.

869
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,336
That silly hat!

870
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:11,549
Oh, I am so tired.

871
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:15,091
Well, Ma, why don't
you get some sleep?

872
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:16,128
Here.

873
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:19,601
Let me take this.

874
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:24,244
Pete...

875
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,153
do you still want
to be a doctor?

876
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,347
Ma...

877
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:36,621
I<i> am</i> a doctor.

878
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:42,317
Your talent is
God's gift to you.

879
00:36:42,353 --> 00:36:44,990
What you do with it

880
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,197
is your gift back to God.

881
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,291
Go ahead... get some sleep.

882
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:02,995
Okay.

883
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,829
Hi, Jen. How are you?

884
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:35,734
Rach?

885
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:37,337
Good.

886
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:40,576
I want to come up
and see you guys.

887
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:42,815
I want to talk.

888
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:45,320
No, no. Tonight.

889
00:37:47,326 --> 00:37:49,162
How about tomorrow?

890
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:53,806
Okay, well, we'll
see you Saturday.

891
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:56,678
Rachel there?

892
00:37:56,713 --> 00:37:59,518
No, no, no. Don't wake her.

893
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:01,722
I just... I miss her.

894
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,333
Jen, I love you.

895
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:10,074
You there?

896
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:14,852
Yeah, okay.

897
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:33,392
Oh... sorry.

898
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:38,487
Chloe?

899
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,299
Hi, Susie.

900
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,726
Hi.

901
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:36,315
Um... let's go to the kitchen.

902
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:41,173
I really didn't care
about the patient.

903
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:43,732
I just wanted the procedure.

904
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:48,623
By tomorrow,
everybody will forget.

905
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:49,759
I won't.

906
00:39:49,794 --> 00:39:51,663
I'm quitting.

907
00:39:51,698 --> 00:39:52,743
You can't quit.

908
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,001
Sure, I can.

909
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:57,086
Deb, listen. You're
smart, and you learn fast.

910
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,147
What's that got to do
with taking care of people?

911
00:40:00,183 --> 00:40:02,787
You're going to
be a great doctor.

912
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:05,025
I don't really like it.

913
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,698
No, that's not completely true.

914
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:09,836
I like the science of it,

915
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:12,809
but the patients,
the sickness...

916
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,047
Sometimes, it almost scares me.

917
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,862
Scared the hell out of me.

918
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:18,131
When I was a kid,

919
00:40:18,155 --> 00:40:20,637
my older brother
was really sick...

920
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:22,642
In and out of the hospital.

921
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,114
When I saw how the doctors
treated him, and how they treated me,

922
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:26,734
I knew that this was
what I wanted to do.

923
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,010
See, that's the
difference, John.

924
00:40:29,046 --> 00:40:32,819
You think about
treating patients.

925
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:35,392
You take the time
to talk to them.

926
00:40:35,427 --> 00:40:36,928
You listen to them.

927
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:38,431
You care.

928
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,955
So what are you going to do?

929
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:46,616
Join the party.

930
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,808
My parents' wedding anniversary.

931
00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:53,331
I'll wait to tell my
folks afterwards.

932
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:55,535
Mother will throw
up... Should be fun.

933
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:06,375
Thanks.

934
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,380
Mm-hmm.

935
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,335
Mark?

936
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,139
You've got visitors.

937
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:31,095
Mrs. Salazar.

938
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,726
Hi.

939
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,676
<i>Hola. Esta es mi madre, Maria.</i>

940
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,867
Hi, Maria.

941
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:42,548
<i>En mi nina, Cristina.</i>

942
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:45,644
Hi, Cristina. You're
the sick one, huh?

943
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,515
You guys grab the bag.

944
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:52,293
Here. Eat this.

945
00:41:52,328 --> 00:41:54,380
It'll warm you up.

946
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:56,985
I don't want to put
you to any trouble.

947
00:41:57,021 --> 00:41:59,190
Yeah, right.

948
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,696
Ronnie sold my stuff.

949
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:02,943
You're kidding.

950
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:04,769
I'm shocked.

951
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:08,845
You were so right about him.

952
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,216
Actually, you were
right about all of them.

953
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:14,658
Yeah, well, they're all
basically the same person.

954
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:17,330
That... that is not true.

955
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:19,469
Norm was a good guy.

956
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:23,711
Sure, the two hours of
the day he was awake.

957
00:42:25,383 --> 00:42:27,752
Chloe!

958
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:32,162
What did you do to my coat?

959
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:37,619
I hitched a ride
with this family.

960
00:42:37,643 --> 00:42:39,478
A kid got carsick.

961
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,220
I switched to ultra lights.

962
00:42:44,491 --> 00:42:48,096
You've seen a doctor
for the baby, haven't you?

963
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,235
A couple times...

964
00:42:53,945 --> 00:42:55,112
Once.

965
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:57,585
Recently?

966
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,120
Sort of.

967
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:11,915
I am so glad to be here, Susie.

968
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:22,071
I'm glad you're okay...

969
00:43:22,107 --> 00:43:24,509
Sort of.

970
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:30,255
Oh...

971
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,162
I'm so tired.

972
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:41,079
I know.

973
00:43:41,115 --> 00:43:44,120
I'm scared, Susie.

974
00:43:47,796 --> 00:43:49,430
Don't worry, Chloe.

975
00:43:49,466 --> 00:43:51,434
Don't worry.

976
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,139
We'll be okay.

977
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:57,447
We'll be okay.

978
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:11,278
