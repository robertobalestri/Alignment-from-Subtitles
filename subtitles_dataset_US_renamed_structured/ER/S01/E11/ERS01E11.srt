1
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,367
<i>Santa.</i>

2
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:10,925
<i>Santa.</i>

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:12,894
Santa.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,430
Mr. Claus, wake up.

5
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:19,151
Santa, you okay?

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,288
Santa...

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,056
Oh, must have dozed off.

8
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,525
I woke up feeling
a little dizzy.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,527
Must be those double shifts.

10
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,528
Come on back.

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:31,696
We'll check you out.

12
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:32,697
Oh, okay.

13
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,666
Up you go.

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,212
Oh, my gosh, it's 10:00.

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,381
Kids will be lined
up for blocks.

16
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,582
I got to go.

17
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,639
Oh, I think you ought
to see a doctor first.

18
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:42,640
I'm already late.

19
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,676
At least let me check
your pressure, okay?

20
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,144
Are you taking any medication?

21
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,712
Um, I'm feeling a lot better.

22
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,659
Thanks, young
man. Thanks anyway.

23
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,016
But...

24
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:56,104
Okay, I've got skates
for Rachel... that's easy...

25
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,672
But I never know
what to get Jen.

26
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,752
Only six shopping
hours left till Christmas.

27
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:02,110
I can't believe I'm
waiting till the last minute.

28
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,578
I got to make up for last year.

29
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:05,025
What did you get her?

30
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,248
A dustbuster.

31
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:07,416
Ow.

32
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:09,029
Hey, get her a
broom. It's cheaper.

33
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:10,685
I'm running out of ideas.

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,731
Okay, go to field's.

35
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:13,066
Fill me in on the patients.

36
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,056
I'll cover for you.

37
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,735
You sure? Yeah. Just
be back in an hour.

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,426
Can I borrow your
car? Chloe has it.

39
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,494
Dr. Greene... Freeman,
Zimberg and Woo

40
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,962
are waiting to be discharged.

41
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,742
Sounds like an
international law firm.

42
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,066
Here. Thanks.

43
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:26,079
Okay, be careful going in here,

44
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:28,570
'cause Regina's
busy hallucinating.

45
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:30,150
Mr. O'Neill, he
opened up his hand

46
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,617
along with a can of mixed nuts.

47
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,319
Incoming head
trauma on the chopper.

48
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,111
Okay. Susan, take over for me.

49
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:37,245
Uh... sure.

50
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:39,659
Oh, Susan, there's an
electrical burn in One,

51
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,928
a "weak and dizzy
all over" in Two,

52
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:44,464
Uh-huh. and torn
cartilage waiting in three.

53
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:46,455
Ah, Dr. Lewis, from
your Secret Santa.

54
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,123
Oh, you know... uh, okay.

55
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:49,536
Suz, I'm tied up
here with an LP.

56
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,304
Will you Gram stain
that for me? Oh, man.

57
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,461
All right.

58
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:55,464
There, thanks. Uh,
Merry Christmas.

59
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,049
Yeah.

60
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,322
Hey, Dr. Green.

61
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,991
Haleh's fudge.

62
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,625
Ooh, you're spoiling me, Jerry.

63
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,929
Help me! Help me!

64
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,764
Help me! Somebody help me!

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,932
My son's dying!

66
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,545
I'm, I'm a doctor.
Give me your kid.

67
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,880
Come on, I got him, I got him.

68
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:17,981
He fell in the lake. Yeah?

69
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,015
Please help him. Uh-huh.

70
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,172
Murray! Murray!

71
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,173
Near drowning!

72
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,174
Murray!

73
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,375
Kid's frozen. Trauma One.

74
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,012
Got it, Haleh?

75
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,346
It's all my fault.

76
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,748
Murray, don't die, please.

77
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,749
Please don't...

78
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,861
Sir, you got to back up.

79
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,851
Get him out of here.

80
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,852
Get him out of here!

81
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,531
Sir, you got to come with me.

82
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,366
Sir, you got to wait back here.

83
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,568
I have to stay right here.

84
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,891
He's not breathing.

85
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,593
Start pulmonary suction.

86
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,928
Laryngoscope.

87
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,679
Five-and-a-half ET tube.

88
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,014
Yeah. Perfect.

89
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,483
All right.

90
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,336
Come on, little guy.

91
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:53,889
Tube's in.

92
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,503
Let's suck the water
out of him, then bag him.

93
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,327
Connie, I want blood studies,

94
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:01,329
a coag panel and a chest film.

95
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:02,397
What happened?

96
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,931
I took him ice fishing.

97
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:05,867
Murray ran ahead and fell in.

98
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,536
How long was he under?

99
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,537
How long?

100
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:11,105
I don't know, five
minutes, maybe.

101
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,607
I couldn't find him.

102
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:15,193
B.P.'s 30 palp, pulse is weak.

103
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,040
He's bradycardic,
heart rate's 32.

104
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,374
What's his temp? Eighty.

105
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,400
Let's warm him up, or
we're going to lose him.

106
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:25,137
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

107
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,217
Blessed art thou among women,

108
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,874
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb Jesus.

109
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,778
Holy Mary, mother of
God, pray for us sinners

110
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,380
now and at the...

111
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,286
Oh, God, don't
take my little boy.

112
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:44,523
Please don't take my son.

113
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,464
Put him on heated,
humidified O-2.

114
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,433
I need the suction cath.

115
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,101
The warmed IVs are here.

116
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,937
How about a pleural
lavage to warm up his heart?

117
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,306
Yeah, yeah. That's a good idea.

118
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,409
Lydia, grab me two 36
French thoracostomy tubes.

119
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,410
Right.

120
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,313
We may have to do a
cardiopulmonary bypass.

121
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,914
All right?

122
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,822
All right, Carter.

123
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,758
You know the drill. Come on.

124
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,313
Keep your head down.

125
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,806
What do you got?

126
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,508
25-Year-old male.

127
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,443
Crashed his snowmobile
on the convoy.

128
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,812
No helmet. Found him comatose.

129
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,514
Pulse 110.

130
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,582
Normotensive, 140/90.

131
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,251
Reps 12 and agonal.

132
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,730
Tubed him in the field.

133
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,388
Neuro exam?

134
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,224
GCS 4, right pupil blown.

135
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,592
Decerebrate posturing.

136
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,931
Ready.

137
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,834
He's in asystole.

138
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,369
How about atropine?

139
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,648
Body temp's too low.

140
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,638
I'm not getting a pulse.

141
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,240
Come on, Murray.

142
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,620
Don't give up on me now.

143
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,721
Come on, pal.

144
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,246
Let's get the crash
cart over here.

145
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,580
Come on, Murray.

146
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,393
Hold on. Stay with us.

147
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,697
Stay with us.

148
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,148
All right. Let's go.

149
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:29,471
Carter, diagnosis.

150
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:30,805
Hematoma, right side of brain.

151
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,107
Same side as the blown pupil.

152
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,109
Uh-huh. Prognosis? Poor.

153
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,955
Yeah, well, with a
Glasgow score of four,

154
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,924
I'd say he's doing
about as good as a rock.

155
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:38,913
Let's go, people.

156
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,193
Let's put him in! Let's go!

157
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,183
All right. Hurry up.

158
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,895
Unstrap him. We've
got to move him.

159
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,286
We've got to move him quick.

160
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,398
All right, here we go.

161
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:46,804
Come on, people, let's move.

162
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,667
One, two, three, move him.

163
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,225
Here we go.

164
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,559
All right, Carter.

165
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:53,628
How do you decrease
intercranial pressure?

166
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,446
Burr hole decompression. Uh-huh!

167
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,698
Spoken like a true surgeon.

168
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,100
But I don't like to drill holes

169
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:59,701
in people's heads
unless I have to.

170
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,068
All right, hyperventilate him.

171
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:03,271
Pressure's holding. 130/90.

172
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:04,472
All right, Malik.

173
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,841
Rapid bolus him
with 75g's of mannitol.

174
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,609
Positive Babinski.

175
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:09,627
Uh-huh.

176
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,129
He's got fluid
draining from his ear.

177
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,215
All that cerebral spinal fluid.

178
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,795
Basilar skull fracture?

179
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,068
All right, Malik.

180
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,903
Get a head CT
and a nuclear scan.

181
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,866
Let's see how much
brain he's got left.

182
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,024
Haleh, try and track
down the next of kin.

183
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,326
Carter, get a blood type.

184
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,077
Anybody know his name?

185
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,879
License says Teddy Powell.

186
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,283
He's back!

187
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:38,823
Good boy.

188
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,125
Let's start a warm
peritoneal lavage.

189
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,429
Kid's clotting
factors look normal.

190
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,564
Let's keep those
heated IVs going.

191
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,811
I'll watch for rewarming shock.

192
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,468
Good.

193
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,404
So, Hathaway's engagement party?

194
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,073
Uh, I heard.

195
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,219
You going?

196
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,576
Not invited. I'm going
to be in Winnetka

197
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,412
with Linda's parent's
eating goose, in a tux.

198
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,964
Life could be worse.

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
You won't need me here anymore.

200
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,284
I am off page.

201
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,252
Where are you going? Shopping.

202
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,622
Doctor, Doctor...

203
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,624
thank you for helping my son.

204
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,959
I'm Dr. Greene.

205
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,427
I'm Dante Valario.

206
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,896
I'll never forget you.

207
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,598
Mr. Valario, your
son's condition is stable,

208
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,134
but he's not out of danger yet.

209
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,281
Now, we're still
warming up his body

210
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,871
and it's too early

211
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,188
to know how he'll respond.

212
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,810
Can I see him now?

213
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,125
Yeah. Yeah.

214
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,387
Shoot!

215
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,888
Regina's still agitated.

216
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,667
Would you take a quick peek?

217
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,857
Do I have a choice?

218
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,993
Claims a grinch
spiked her eggnog.

219
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,797
It's my party.

220
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,799
It's my party!

221
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,634
It's<i> my</i> party.

222
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,304

00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,220
The E.R. is no place
for a case like this.

228
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,722
I.C.U. is maxed out.

229
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,256
Okay, well, can't Neuro take it?

230
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,592
Soon as there's an opening.

231
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,594
Till then, it stays
in your service.

232
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,962
All right, all right.

233
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,332
He's got a big
right-sided bleed.

234
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,668
Midline shift.
Herniated. Mm-hmm.

235
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,270
No uptake activity
in the brain stem.

236
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,584
Can we do anything?

237
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,374
Carter, he's brain dead.

238
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,920
Let's keep his heart going

239
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,689
till we can locate a relative

240
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,913
and get permission
to recover his organs.

241
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,147
Okay, we already got that.

242
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,716
He signed the
back of his license.

243
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,529
He's got family. Get consent.

Head lac in the suture room.

247
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:53,942
Oh, call Susan.
She's covering for me.

248
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:57,577
Susan's tied up, and your
name is still on the board.

249
00:09:58,315 --> 00:09:59,480
Come on.

250
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,951
You should have seen it.

251
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,285
The<i> Trib</i> called it

252
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,620
"a masterpiece of
electrical ingenuity.

253
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:10,291
86,239 bulbs of
scintillating brilliance."

254
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:11,404
Huh?

255
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:12,671
Uh...

256
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,863
Enough wattage to
light ten city blocks.

257
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,300
Uh, you know, it
takes me two months

258
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,967
to put all the lights up.

259
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,370
You know, people travel
from all across this state

260
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:23,371
just to see it.

261
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,855
That's how famous we are.

262
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,458
Connie, get a C.B.C, lytes
and C.P.K. to make sure

263
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,071
there's no muscular damage.

264
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,362
My wife said I should
charge admission this year.

265
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,397
I said no.

266
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,798
We-we-we take and we take.

267
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,983
We should give
something back, you know.

268
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,019
Bring some joy to
the neighborhood.

269
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,488
I'm sure it's beautiful,
Mr. Kaminski.

270
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:44,225
Beautiful? No. It-It
was breathtaking.

271
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,044
Do you know we took first
place five years in a row

272
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,380
in the amateur division?

273
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,482
Right. You know,
that's a record.

274
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,751
This year was the topper.

275
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,186
It was an alpine Christmas.

276
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,188
We had everything.

277
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,458
We had... mountains and chalets.

278
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,861
We had a... a miniature ski lift

279
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,630
that went<i> all</i> the
way to the roof.

280
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,599
All I needed was
just a little more juice.

281
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,318
The power company said no.

282
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:14,956
I tried to tap into
the main power box.

283
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,594
Now... now look at me.

284
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,073
We'll give you a
topical antibiotic

285
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,608
and keep you on
the EKG to make sure

286
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:24,310
the power surge
didn't hurt your heart.

287
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,751
My heart?

288
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,787
What can that machine
tell about a broken heart?

289
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:33,993
How's his temp?

290
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,137
Up to 88.

291
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,528
B.P.'s steady.

292
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,864
Still got a long way to go.

293
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,298
Brain damage?

294
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,834
It's hard to say.

295
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,286
If you're going to
drown, do it in cold water.

296
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,673
Murray?

297
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,718
Hey, buddy.

298
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,839
Merry Christmas, Murray.

299
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,705
Oh, Mark, Mark...

300
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,874
Merry Christmas.

301
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,910
Aah.

302
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,359
Hey, you're five minutes
late. What'd you get?

303
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,949
I haven't even gone yet.

304
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,083
What happened?

305
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,398
Too many patients,
not enough residents.

306
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,821
Your offer still stand?

307
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,623
Oh, yeah. Just be back by lunch.

308
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,902
I'm starving. Okay, thanks.

309
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,125
Bye.

310
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,295
Malik, can you erase
my name off that board?

311
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,797
Stabbing coming in.

312
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,835
68-Year-old male
mugged in a parking lot.

313
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,070
Penetrating stab
wounds to mid-abdomen.

314
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,205
Mark?

315
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,490
Pressure crashed at 60.

316
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,560
Brought him up to 130
with 1,000cc's normal saline.

317
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:00,561
Blood loss?

318
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:02,340
200cc's, bleeding contained.

319
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,215
Give me six units of O-negative.

320
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,549
Notify the O.R.

321
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,419
Let them know they may
have a laparotomy coming up.

322
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,455
Are you his wife?

323
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,721
Yes.

324
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,623
Does he have any history
of medical problems?

325
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:13,824
Heart problems? Hypertension?

326
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,304
No, no, no, he's
in perfect health.

327
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,061
Okay, you have to
stay right here, ma'am.

328
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,114
The ventilator will keep
his blood hyperoxygenated

329
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,650
and his heart, kidneys
and liver perfused

330
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:24,585
until we're ready for surgery.

331
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,682
He may be going into D.I.C.

332
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,374
All right, give me ten packs
of platelets and two units

333
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,708
fresh frozen plasma.

334
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,278
I am not losing his organs to
a bunch of damn blood clots.

335
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,163
I've located Mr. Powell's wife.

336
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:37,910
She's on her way over. Good.

337
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,066
He's in V-fib.

338
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:40,629
All right, come
on, let's spark him.

339
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,747
I need this heart.

340
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:42,781
Come on, Carter, let's move.

341
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,238
One hundred.

342
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,356
Charging.

343
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,341
Good. All right.

344
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:47,342
Ready.

345
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:48,377
Clear! Clear.

346
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,497
He's in sinus rhythm.

347
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,583
Carter, call
cardiology for an echo.

348
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,954
I just resuscitated a dead man.

349
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:05,893
Pretty nasty cut, Patrick.

350
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,662
How'd you hurt yourself?

351
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:12,466
Can... can I have
some ch-chocolate milk?

352
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,717
Sure.

353
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,986
Patrick, what happened
to your helmet?

354
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,022
I lost it.

355
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,457
Okay.

356
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,904
Did your father bring you here?

357
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:28,165
Wh-Wh-Why did
the cat walk on sand?

358
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,301
Why?

359
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,038
To... to get sandy claws.

360
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,095
Jerry, is the organ
network on line?

361
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,031
Yeah, I linked you up
with local and regional.

362
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,600
All righty, let me get in.

363
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,881
Carter, did you
get the blood type?

364
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,738
Yeah, I did. It's B-negative.

365
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,673
Okay, here we go.

366
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,508
Age... 25.

367
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:56,143
Male.

368
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,979
Height... 5 "10".

369
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:02,316
Weight... 70 kilos.

370
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,383
Blood type... B.

371
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,888
All right, let's
see what we got.

372
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,234
What we got, what we got...

373
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:10,825
Okay, here we go.

374
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,594
Cincinnati General's got
a guy that needs a heart

375
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,563
and there's a woman in
Altoona dying for a liver.

376
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,599
Both perfect matches. Good.

377
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:24,249
It's going to be a
merry Christmas

378
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:25,973
for a few lucky people, huh?

379
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,859
I feel ridiculous coming
here, but Aaron insisted.

380
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,996
He's worried... his cousin
died of a ruptured appendix.

381
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,664
Ooh, that's pretty tender.

382
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,333
Do you think it's serious?

383
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,101
I wanted Aaron here
to be here with me,

384
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,503
but his plane's been delayed.

385
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,405
Look, if there's anything wrong,
I don't want to hear it alone.

386
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,068
I'm not too concerned,
Mrs. Skulper,

387
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,692
but I want to do a few more
tests just to be sure, okay?

388
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,077
Okay, thanks.

389
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,317
I got this from Neuro.

390
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,297
This is the best they could do.

391
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,621
Ah, thanks, Malik.

392
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,593
Look, Patrick, I have
a new helmet for you.

393
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,530
No, I d-don't want it.

394
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,264
Why? If you don't wear it,

395
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,700
you'll hurt your
head when you fall.

396
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,937
A-And I'll have to c-come back?

397
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,274
Do you want to
stay here for a while?

398
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,676
Okay.

399
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,445
Look, Patrick, no one
answers at your home.

400
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,347
Does anyone know you're here?

401
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,500
Hmm...

402
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:29,036
Do you see anything yet?

403
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,739
I don't see any gallstones.

404
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,275
Oh, my...

405
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:36,777
It's my appendix.

406
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:37,778
I knew it.

407
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:39,113
No, it's...

408
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,781
It's something worse?

409
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:41,782
Is it a tumor?

410
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,033
It's a baby...

411
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,936
About 12 weeks old

412
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,421
with a steady heartbeat.

413
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,741
A baby?

414
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,346
<i>My baby?</i>

415
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,951
We tried for years.

416
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,303
They said it was impossible.

417
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:05,072
Well, you proved them wrong.

418
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,959
I'll have obstetrics come
down, but everything looks fine.

419
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,271
Oh, look at that.

420
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,745
It's a miracle.

421
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,930
Aaron's gonna flip!

422
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,565
Thank you, Dr. Lewis.

423
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,650
Thank you.

424
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:17,963
Well, be sure to
send me a picture.

425
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,953
Oh, a baby!

426
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,084
We have been
waiting over an hour.

427
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,507
Kirby could have died.

428
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,310
He'd have to eat an
entire poinsettia plant

429
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,845
to be sick, Mrs. Bower.

430
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,847
Even then, he'd only
have a bad stomachache.

431
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,515
This is my
colleague, Dr. Carter.

432
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,117
He's going to examine him.

433
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,118
Please hurry.

434
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,598
We have company coming.

435
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,921
Need any help?

436
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,956
I think I can handle this one.

437
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,091
Merry Christmas.

438
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,826
Thanks. Merry Christmas.

439
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,362
Carter, you might
want to wait a minute.

440
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,981
I'm just having a little trouble

441
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,515
getting Kirby to open his mouth.

442
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,417
Carter, watch it.

443
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:51,785
Almost got it.

444
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,848
Carter! What?

445
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:53,821
Oh!

446
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,023
Doug!

447
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,759
Buddy, got to know when to jump.

448
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,166
Ew...

449
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:08,135
You heading home, Mr. Kaminski?

450
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,121
Yeah, yeah. Try and rescue
as many bulbs as I can.

451
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,286
The power surge probably
blew out most of them though.

452
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,144
Well, just remember to
change the dressing daily

453
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,346
and apply the
antibacterial ointment.

454
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,315
Okay.

455
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,150
Hey, these are beautiful.

456
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,019
Thank you, Dr. Lewis.

457
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,587
Just use them safely.

458
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:30,124
These are old,
antique twinklers.

459
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,643
I mean, they're... they're
a real collector's item.

460
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,107
Perfect for next year's
old-fashioned theme.

461
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,815
Where'd you find them?

462
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,133
Oh, man.

463
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,802
First, somebody
eats all the popcorn

464
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:44,471
off the Christmas tree, and
now the lights are missing.

465
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:50,211
Have you had any
trouble sleeping

466
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,747
or with your appetite?

467
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:54,681
I'm been waking up very early

468
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,284
and I can't seem
to get back to sleep.

469
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,854
Mm-hmm. How have
your spirits been?

470
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,688
I don't know.

471
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,991
Have you ever suffered

472
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:07,094
from depression, Mrs. Abernathy?

473
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,731
Well, the holidays are
always pretty rough for me.

474
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,800
And this year is worse.

475
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:13,979
How much worse?

476
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:20,308
Sometimes... I can
barely get out of bed.

477
00:19:20,343 --> 00:19:23,194
I've made some

478
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,780
terrible mistakes with my life.

479
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:28,915
Christmas just seems
to bring them back.

480
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,306
He was injured this morning
in a snowmobiling accident.

481
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,441
He never regained consciousness.

482
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:41,445
The medical examiner
determined that your husband is...

483
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,031
is brain dead.

484
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:47,634
I'm... I'm sorry.

485
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:48,969
I don't understand.

486
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:52,606
Why is he hooked up to all
these machines if he's dead?

487
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,386
Well, because he
could help others

488
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,854
by donating his organs.

489
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:58,912
His face... it's so warm.

490
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,581
And his hands...

491
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,135
I've heard of people
waking up from comas.

492
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,521
There is this man in our
church who was in a coma

493
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:10,140
for six months, and
everybody said it was hopeless

494
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,559
and then one day he woke up.

495
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:15,562
I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell, but...

496
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,375
there is absolutely
no possibility

497
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,466
of your husband ever recovering.

498
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:22,219
Well, I want a second opinion.

499
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,355
Look, I know...

500
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:29,093
I know he looks like he's alive,

501
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:32,196
but the only reason he's
hooked up to this ventilator

502
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,064
is to keep his heart pumping.

503
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,237
I want a second opinion.

504
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:49,563
Hi. Have you seen Doug?

505
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,732
Sorry.

506
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:55,318
Oh. Dr. Greene, are you a skier?

507
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,870
Uh... no.

508
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:58,539
My company is sponsoring

509
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,552
an emergency physician's
conference in Aspen...

510
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:01,576
Tax deductible,

511
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,611
continuing medical education
credits, free lessons...

512
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,613
Oh, hi, sweetie.

513
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:09,450
Linda's drumming up business.

514
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,785
Residents don't
buy pharmaceuticals.

515
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,687
They just like your freebies.

516
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,122
You like my freebies?

517
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:17,357
That's a whole other story.

518
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:19,371
I left the tux in your locker.

519
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,361
Any luck finding bargains?

520
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:23,241
I haven't been
able to go out yet.

521
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,982
Do you have any idea where I
can get Jen in 15 minutes or less?

522
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,634
Well, I'm a killer shopper.

523
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,969
You wouldn't mind?

524
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:31,072
I've got some last-minute
shopping to do.

525
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:32,306
What's your price range?

526
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:33,774
Huh...

527
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:38,971
I get it. Strictly budget
basement. Same as Doug.

528
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,200
Nice tie.

529
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,903
Oh, Thanks. I got it from
Haleh, my Secret Santa.

530
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,004
Oh.

531
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,907
Have you opened your
Secret Santa gift yet?

532
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,176
Oh, no. I haven't had a chance.

I'd like a suite with
a view of the lake.

541
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:16,342
And would you take
my bag up, please?

542
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:27,694
He's developing neurogenic
pulmonary edema.

543
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:31,231
Lydia, give him
renal range dopamine

544
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,233
and 40 milligrams of lasix.

545
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,901
How much time do we have?

546
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,080
I don't know.

547
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,072
About an hour before
we start losing organs.

548
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,741
Also, increase the
vent pressure to ten.

549
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,545
Peter, Dr. Hicks is outside.

550
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,047
She'd like to speak to you.

551
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,486
All right.

552
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,144
Why are you holding Powell?

553
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,164
Cardiac and liver transplant
teams are waiting upstairs.

554
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,166
Well, I...

555
00:23:06,202 --> 00:23:08,902
I ran into a little problem
with the patient's wife.

556
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:10,103
What?

557
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,992
His wife won't sign the consent.

558
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,306
You called the team before
you had his wife's consent?

559
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,963
His driver's license
gave us permission.

560
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,376
I told you to
contact the family.

561
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,978
It's his wife's
decision, not yours.

562
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,970
If she doesn't want
it, we don't do it.

563
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,772
You've got eight
transplant surgeons flying

564
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,968
into this hospital,

565
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,054
with patients and their families

566
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,027
waiting at the other end.

567
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:37,431
If we can't harvest, what are
you going to tell these people?

568
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,593
You may need an antidepressant.

569
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,696
I'm going to give you
the name of a therapist.

570
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,832
I think my sadness may
be connected to something

571
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,013
that happened a long time ago.

572
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,670
Mm-hmm. On Christmas?

573
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,838
40 Years ago...

574
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:05,376
a young man proposed
to me and I said no.

575
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:08,362
It was the biggest
mistake of my life.

576
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:10,046
Why'd you say no?

577
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,915
He was Jewish.

578
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,084
My parents didn't approve.

579
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,886
And last year

580
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,755
after my mother died,
I found his letters.

581
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,102
She'd kept them hidden from me.

582
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,895
He wanted to know why I
wouldn't answer his letters,

583
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,315
why I stopped loving him.

584
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,250
He lived in Tulsa.

585
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:33,386
So, I got his number
and I called him

586
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:35,055
and a beautiful voice

587
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,091
that I hadn't heard
in 40 years answered.

588
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:43,063
It was his son.

589
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:45,432
Sammy died three years ago.

590
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,176
Hey, Mark.

591
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,778
Could I borrow your pen?

592
00:24:57,813 --> 00:25:00,347
Great save on that
mesenteric rupture.

593
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:01,548
Thanks.

594
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,144
Listen, uh, I've got a problem.

595
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,608
I've got a gork's wife
who won't sign a consent,

596
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,683
and if she doesn't
change her mind soon,

597
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,384
I'm going to start
losing organs.

598
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:13,410
I was hoping maybe...
you could persuade her.

599
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:14,745
Sometimes you can't.

600
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,514
Yeah, but I already
called the chop,

601
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,528
and the transplant
teams are on their way.

602
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,868
That wasn't very smart.

603
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,405
See what I can do.

604
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,621
He's not breathing.

605
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,212
Crash cart to Trauma One.

606
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,213
Call a code!

607
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,281
Fill me in.

608
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:35,299
I don't know what happened.

609
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,578
He complained of
dizziness this morning.

610
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,052
You let him go?

611
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:40,065
He left against medical advice.

612
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:43,256
All right, I'm going to
need some muscle in here!

613
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:46,894
Okay, got it. Thanks.

614
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,280
All right, let's move him.

615
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,117
One, two, three.

616
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,288
Taking any medication?

617
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,440
Under the belt.

618
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,724
I can't find a pulse.

619
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,143
Okay.

620
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,099
He's in arrest.

621
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,655
Malik, give him an amp of epi.

622
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,078
Atropine. One milligram IV.

623
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,460
Mrs. Powell, I'm Dr. Greene.

624
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,762
I'm the chief resident here.

625
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,065
Are you taking over the case?

626
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,268
Dr. Benton just asked
me to come speak to you.

627
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,570
To sign the consent.

628
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,573
I want you to do what you think

629
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,586
your husband would have wanted

630
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,877
and what's right for you.

631
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,648
I don't know what Teddy
would have wanted.

632
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:02,519
I haven't spoken to
him in five months.

633
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,621
But you are his wife?

634
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,942
We were separated last summer.

635
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:11,594
He called me yesterday.

636
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,115
He wanted us to spend
Christmas together.

637
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,067
I told him no.

638
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:24,774
I wanted to hurt him as
much as he'd hurt me.

639
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,811
I wanted him to
come crawling back.

640
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:31,915
I wanted him to
beg for forgiveness.

641
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,885
Now all I want
to do is hold him.

642
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:39,489
I just want him to
know that I still love him.

643
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,131
Mark it 1922.

644
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,133
Do we get an I.D.?

645
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,447
No wallet, no driver's
license, nothing.

646
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,703
Carter.

647
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,505
Oh, God...

648
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,374
I killed Santa.

649
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,899
Any word from Neuro?

650
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,734
They haven't been down yet.

651
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,137
Hope he's the same
kid he was before.

652
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:12,172
Yeah.

653
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,124
Did he say anything?

654
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,376

His parents went
away on vacation

664
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,721
and left him with the neighbors.

665
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:03,768
Her family left
her with a cousin.

666
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:06,721
All of sudden, her
Alzheimer's gotten a lot worse.

667
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,589
Hey, Jerry, I've
paged Div twice.

668
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,513
Are you sure he hasn't called?

669
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,182
Yeah. Sorry, Dr. Lewis.

670
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,519
Yeah, he probably just forgot
to turn on his beeper again.

671
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,903
But I thought Cvetic quit.

672
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:18,789
What?

673
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,344
I thought he quit.

674
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:32,752
Yes, Dr. Cvetic, please.

675
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,456
Okay. Thank you very much.

676
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,546
Is everything all
right, Dr. Lewis?

677
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,714
What?

678
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,266
Is everything okay?

679
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,601
I don't know.

680
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:49,269
When do you get off?

681
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:51,204
Just signed out.

682
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,555
Would you do me a favor?

683
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,790
Sure. Could I have a ride?

684
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,929
Prom night?

685
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,598
Something like that.

686
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:02,766
Linda picking you up?

687
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,613
No, I'm meeting her there.

688
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,047
Cocktails at Jack's Place,

689
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,737
then on to Winnetka

690
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,084
for 200 of her parents'
close, personal friends.

691
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,442
Do I detect a lack
of enthusiasm?

692
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,789
It beats putting in chest tubes.

693
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,915
Mark, we got a bunch of choir
kids and a minor fender bender.

694
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,417
Anything serious?

695
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,796
Only cuts and scrapes.

696
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,737
Merry Christmas, guys.

697
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:25,692
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

698
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,625
See ya.

699
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,432
You okay?

700
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,251
Thought I was.

701
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:41,037
I think about her all the time.

702
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,274
Do you ever tell her that?

703
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,742
No, no, no.

704
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:46,778
Why not?

705
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:47,960
'Cause I was afraid.

706
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:49,607
Afraid of what,
she might say no?

707
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:51,681
Afraid she might say yes.

708
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,452
It's too late.

709
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,055
She's not married yet.

710
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,187
You spoke to Dr. Greene.

711
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:16,322
Yes.

712
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:17,691
Mm-hmm.

713
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:22,395
We're running out of time.

714
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:25,531
So what?

715
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:30,570
Okay.

716
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,673
Okay.

717
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,009
Hey.

718
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,534
Where's the form?

719
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,092
Div?

720
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:58,030
Div?

721
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:27,026
He moved out.

722
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:36,503
Hello.

723
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:42,876

Bob...

727
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:02,995
did you take those
Christmas lights down?

728
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:05,932
No. It is not true.

729
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:10,069
Whoever says this is a liar.

730
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:13,239
I was asking a question.

731
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:15,358
So you going to be okay?

732
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,026
Thanks, Carter.

733
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,662
You're a really
good friend to me.

734
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,709
Good Secret Santa, too.

735
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,033
<i>You're</i> my Secret Santa.

736
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,870
Oh, I-I haven't
even opened it yet.

737
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,438
It's a music box.

738
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,409
Thank you.

739
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:38,531
So, uh... you're sure
you're going to be okay?

740
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:43,737
Yeah, I'm always okay.

741
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,572
'Cause I could come,
come in for a while.

742
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:50,977
Keep you company.

743
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:54,614
Uh...

744
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,467
I don't, I don't think
we should do this.

745
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:00,231
I'm sorry.

746
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:03,956
No, don't be.

747
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:08,528
Oh.

748
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:11,531
Well, this was for Div, but...

749
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:12,865
Thanks, I guess.

750
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,669
Well, I got to get
back to the hospital.

751
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:18,405
I got to check on
Miss Cavanaugh, so...

752
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,739
Merry Christmas.

753
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:21,107
Merry Christmas.

754
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:02,694
Excuse me. Hi. Uh...

755
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,130
Hey, buddy.

756
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:18,531
We're here.

757
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,533
What?

758
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:22,369
We're here, the cafe.

759
00:35:22,404 --> 00:35:24,871
Change your mind?

760
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:26,756
No. Here you go.

761
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,618
Hurry up! We're late.

762
00:35:42,524 --> 00:35:43,790
Hey, no, hang on!

763
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:45,858
Hey! Hang on, hey... hey!

764
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,560
Hey, come on!

765
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:25,376
Linda Farrell
brought this in for you.

766
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,599
Oh, thanks.

767
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:42,982
Wow, is that for Jennifer?

768
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:44,317
You got good taste.

769
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:45,584
Thanks.

770
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,254
All my ex ever gave me
was a vacuum cleaner.

771
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,151
Okay.

772
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,050
Organs look good.

773
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,185
Let's proceed with the harvest.

774
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,271
Stop the heart first.

775
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,774
Insert the catheter into
the brachiocephalic artery.

776
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,089
Okay.

777
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,412
Catheter's in.

778
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:15,415
Now, cross-clamp the aorta
right above the diaphragm.

779
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,000
Doctor, clamp.

780
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,439
Okay.

781
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,058
Aorta cross-clamped at 2048.

782
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:28,645
Now infuse the
cardioplegia solution quickly.

783
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,469
Heart rate's falling.

784
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:39,839
Heart stopped.

785
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:41,757
Let's get these organs out now.

786
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:14,185
Susan.

787
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,808
Susan.

788
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,145
Susan!

789
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,386
Where's Div?

790
00:38:29,324 --> 00:38:30,789
I don't know.

791
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:32,854
Wasn't he supposed
to come home with you?

792
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,261
Well, his apartment's
empty and he's gone.

793
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:36,629
So, I guess not.

794
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:37,931
Aw, man, cheer up.

795
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:40,266
I've been dumped
by lots of guys.

796
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:41,301
I got over it.

797
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:43,018
You'll get over it, too.

798
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,221
Hey, that's my robe.

799
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,889
May I borrow it?

800
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,892
Yes, you may.

801
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,393
Thank you.

802
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,530
That music's pretty.

803
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,365
It was a gift.

804
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,702
Ooh...

805
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,982
Mm... you know, it
reminds me of that...

806
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,100
that merry-go-round
we used to ride.

807
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,609
That looks so cool.

808
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,677
Oh, I got you something.

809
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,146
Oh...

810
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,369
Oh, it's pretty.

811
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:18,237
"Susan."

812
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,605
Thank you.

813
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:27,580
You'll have to share
it with the baby.

814
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,593
We're naming it after you.

815
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,916
What baby?

816
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,386
I'm pregnant.

817
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,373
Oh, Chloe.

818
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,965
Go home, Doug!

819
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,177
I love you.

820
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,201
You love some old idea of me.

821
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:23,548
And you love me. No, I don't.

822
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:24,715
Yes, you do. No, I don't!

823
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:26,951
You haven't changed,
Doug, and the sad thing is,

824
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:28,052
you don't even know it.

825
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:29,542
All right, then I<i> will</i> change.

826
00:40:29,578 --> 00:40:31,055
I am not asking you to change!

827
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,211
Carol, listen to me!

828
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:33,546
I don't want to listen to you.

829
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:35,514
I don't want you, Doug.

830
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,749
Leave me alone.

831
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:38,362
What the hell's he doing here?

832
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:39,686
Leaving. No, I'm not.

833
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:41,699
What's going on? You're
coming home with me.

834
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:43,367
You need to get some help.

835
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:44,802
Get out of here, okay?

836
00:40:44,826 --> 00:40:47,193
Go ahead and tell him
that you don't love me.

837
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:49,588
Tell him that you don't think
about me when you're with him.

838
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:51,297
Hey, hey, hey!

839
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:54,000
Stop, stop, stop, please! God.

840
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,610
Stay out of my life, Doug.

841
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,580
Tag... Tag, please.

842
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,050
Come on, please.

843
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,125
Let's get the liver and
kidneys up to the copters.

844
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:22,227
Thanks, everyone.

845
00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:24,374
That's it. Benton, nice work.

846
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,645
The heart's only good for
three hours, so get it on ice,

847
00:41:27,669 --> 00:41:30,213
then pray the weather
clears in Cincinnati.

848
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,682
Vinnie, could you sew him up?

849
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,639
Uh, if you don't mind,

850
00:41:33,675 --> 00:41:36,141
I'd like to, uh, I'd
like to sew him up.

851
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,337
Okay.

852
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,463
You want staples?

853
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,448
No. I'll sew him up right.

854
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:44,934
