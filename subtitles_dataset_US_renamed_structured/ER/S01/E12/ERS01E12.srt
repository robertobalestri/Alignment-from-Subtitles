1
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,197
Who's in?

2
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,765
Dr. Greene.

3
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,201
Dr. Greene, there's
this guy on the street.

4
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,647
Gunshot wounds, I think.

5
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,104
There's blood everywhere.

6
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,039
All right, you heard the doctor.

7
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,507
Here we go.

8
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,542
We got a G.S.W. on the street.

9
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,279
We're going to need
some hands out there.

10
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:49,781
Will you get this out of here?

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,861
Patients will strangle
on Christmas lights.

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,218
Let's get a move on.

13
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,792
There he is, between the cars.

14
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,594
I see him. Okay, I see him.

15
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,866
All right, yeah,
he's still breathing.

16
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,067
I got a pulse.

17
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,970
We got to get him out of here.

18
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,105
Lift him up.

19
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,540
All right, all right.

20
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,042
Easy. Watch his head.

21
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,443
You got him?

22
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,548
Bag him.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,169
Connie, notify the O.R.

24
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,118
Get Benton in here, and order up

25
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,584
eight units O-negative.

26
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,586
Bob, call Security. We
got a gangbanger here.

27
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,659
Gangbanger?

28
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,829
Dial 432 and say, "Help."

29
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,430
Coming to Trauma Two.

30
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,666
In the winter, I wish they'd
dump the bodies inside.

31
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,002
Yeah. Pretty
inconsiderate of them.

32
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,871
This is Trauma Two.

33
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,505
Call the blood bank.

34
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,908
We need eight units
of O-neg down here,

35
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,044
and I need a page on Benton now.

36
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,616
Get his clothes off.

37
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,452
Terry, can you clear that?

38
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:03,655
Abdomen, chest

39
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,491
neck, legs...

40
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,110
Pulse 160 and thready.

41
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,857
Treat for the sounds.

42
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,059
Hypo-resonant on the right.

43
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,382
I'll decompress.

44
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:17,335
.14 gauge? Get
your souvenirs here.

45
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,365
I'll get it out of here.

46
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,989
Let's intubate him.

47
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,075
Carter, why don't
you jump in here?

48
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,242
Me?

49
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,821
Yeah. You've seen
about 50 of these

50
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,161
by now, right?

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,947
Okay.

52
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,638
All right, good.

53
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,974
Advance the blade
to the epiglottis

54
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,192
and then lift.

55
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,150
I can't see a thing in here.

56
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:49,501
I'll suction.

57
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,520
All right, good.

58
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,500
Visualize the vocal cords

59
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:56,992
and pass the tube through them.

60
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,030
Stay away from that esophagus.

61
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,615
Good.

62
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,303
I got it.

63
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,582
Nice work, Carter.

64
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,638
O.R.'s waiting.

65
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:11,772
What do we got?

66
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:12,940
Tube's in. Let's go.

67
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,409
Multiple gunshot wounds

68
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:16,911
to the neck, chest,
abdomen and legs.

69
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,580
Intubated. Tension
pneumo on the right.

70
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,150
Needs a thoracotomy
and a laparotomy.

71
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,318
Cole, clear that elevator.

72
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:24,864
I'd like to follow
him through the O.R.

73
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,954
There's going to be enough
bodies swarming around.

74
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,201
Still haven't been in there.

75
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:29,424
I'll take him from here.

76
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,709
I'm the one who
found him in the street.

77
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,947
Yeah? Well, you probably
saved his life. Let's go.

78
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,228
Captioning Sponsored
by WARNER BROS.

79
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,127
We got a dead shovel in Two,

80
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,096
and a paper cut
in the suture room.

81
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,052
Paper cut?

82
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,732
Yeah. Guy says
that his newspaper

83
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:34,366
jumped up and attacked him.

84
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,634
We're waiting for Psych.

85
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,325
Isn't it comforting to know

86
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:40,494
that 1995 isn't going to
be any different than 1994?

87
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:41,774
Excuse me. Carter?

88
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:44,232
Can you call the
medical examiner's office

89
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,968
and have them pick up
the dead shovel in two.

90
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,614
Sure. What's a "dead shovel"?

91
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:50,282
Fat man shoveling snow.

92
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,573
This is our lady with
heart palpitations,

93
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,175
and a fractured femur

94
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:55,744
who's waiting on the orthopods.

95
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,011
Excuse me?

96
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,980
I've been here for hours now,

97
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,149
and I feel absolutely fine.

98
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,152
Mrs. Davis is the
mitral prolapse

99
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,270
with resolved S.V.T.

100
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,756
Yeah. Resolved and forgotten.

101
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,106
Where's Dr. Lewis?

102
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,103
She'll be with you
as soon as she can.

103
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:13,106
I hope so, because I
have a seven-year-old

104
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,395
at home with the mumps.

105
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:17,098
So do I. Gets on
your nerves, doesn't it?

106
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,283
Yeah.

107
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,534
Thank you.

108
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,255
You can do it.

109
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,724
I can do it.

110
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,392
Just swing on.

111
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,494
You mean hang on?

112
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,028
I can't do it, Bob.

113
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,797
I can't do it.

114
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,198
Yes. Yes, you can.

115
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,167
Are you okay?

116
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,902
New year's revolution.

117
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,204
<i>Resolution.</i> I quit smoking.

118
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,506
She had a mental.

119
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,774
Menthols don't count.

120
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,220
My New Year's resolution

121
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,921
was to quit doing scut work...

122
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,613
after I take these urine
specimens to the lab.

123
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,092
He failed. Why can't I?

124
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,384
Is Dr. Benton back
from surgery yet?

125
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,518
Been and gone.

126
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,518
Thank you.

127
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,021
Ew! This is gross!

128
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,222
Come here.

129
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,301
Shut up, Stuey!

130
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,424
No, you!

131
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,227
Stop it!

132
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,273
Let the doctor do his work!

133
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,598
Perhaps Binky
wants to wait outside.

134
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,667
Mrs. Bentley, Stuey's
eye is going to be just fine.

135
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,169
Here's just a word of caution.

136
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:14,139
Keep all the guns,
even the paint guns,

137
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,306
away from the kids.

138
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,753
Yeah, well, obviously!

139
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,888
What do you think
I am, an idiot?!

140
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,356
Come on, Stuey, let's go.

141
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,412
Binky?!

142
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,367
I got a bumsicle for you.

143
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:28,336
Freeze-dried at the back door.

144
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,116
Okay, let's clear Trauma One.

145
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,706
Gotta go. Welcome back.

146
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,591
Found him under
the El on 43rd Street.

147
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,959
His name's Gilbert McCabe.

148
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,796
Legs frozen to the sidewalk.

149
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,014
I was just sleeping.

150
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,895
I feel fine. Put me down.

151
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,196
You can't even
stand up, Gilbert.

152
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,296
We had to chip

153
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,415
through the ice
with a tire iron.

154
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,205
They woke me
up is what they did.

155
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:52,143
Mr. McCabe, my name's
Dr. Greene, this is Dr. Hicks.

156
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,478
We're going to
check you over, okay?

157
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,382
I don't want some colored
woman working on me.

158
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,366
Hey!

159
00:06:58,435 --> 00:06:59,478
Like I said,

160
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,614
'95's going to be just like '94.

161
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,038
I said put me down!

162
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,346
What are you, deaf?

163
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:05,618
Dr. Kayson?

164
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,119
I'm very busy, Dr. Lewis.

165
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:08,376
This will just take a minute.

166
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:10,579
I've got a patient with
mitral valve prolapse...

167
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,025
You'll have to wait, Dr. Lewis.

168
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,289
I've got a patient
coming out of surgery.

169
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,172
Miss Davis, everything
checks out okay.

170
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,952
Your heart rate's normalized.

171
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,393
We just need to
increase your Verapamil.

172
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:27,244
Oh. So I can go?

173
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,141
Not until the
attending cardiologist

174
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,175
gives the okay.

175
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,682
Don't worry, Miss Davis.

176
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,220
You'll have plenty of time to
enjoy your daughter's mumps.

177
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,971
They last a good seven days.

178
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,990
You have to take them off.

179
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,259
The hell I do.

180
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,594
You need Carter?

181
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,895
Not if you do.

182
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,397
Get off me.

183
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,031
Bowel disimpaction in one.

184
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,380
How was surgery?

185
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,534
Which surgery?

186
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,247
The gang kid from this morning.

187
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,504
He died ten minutes in.

188
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,850
This is supposed to
be my surgical rotation.

189
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,107
Your<i> E.R.</i> surgical rotation.

190
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,987
I haven't been in an O.R. yet.

191
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,690
Do you always treat your
students like this? Like what?

192
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,614
I hate to complain, but all I
do for you is your scut work.

193
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,051
Well, that's what I did
for my surgical resident.

194
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,285
It's what we<i> all</i> did,

195
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,565
and it's what you
will continue to do

196
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,890
until you can do
it in your sleep.

197
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,169
You are a medical student.

198
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,271
You're here to
make my life easier.

199
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,627
I'm also here to learn.

200
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,145
And have you learned?

201
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,717
Glove up and dig in.

202
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:23,985
And don't take all day.

203
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:33,445
Mr. McCabe, can
you feel anything here?

204
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,280
Keep it where I can see it.

205
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,281
Mr. McCabe.

206
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,298
What?

207
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,145
Are you feeling anything here?

208
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,101
Where?

209
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,369
Can you feel that?

210
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,438
No.

211
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,905
And don't touch those pants.

212
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,491
Now?

213
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,159
No. Nothing hurts. And don't get

214
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,690
into those pockets. I got all
my money in those pockets.

215
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:53,481
What do you keep poking for?

216
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,933
My feet feel fine.

217
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,401
It's just that they're...

218
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,136
you know, a little heavy...

219
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,837
Like a chunk of wood.

220
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,172
And I want to take

221
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,424
those shoes with
me, do you hear me?

222
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:05,571
Connie, let's set
up a morphine drip

223
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:06,761
and a gram of Anseph,

224
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,641
and give him a tetanus booster.

225
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,231
I don't want any drugs.

226
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,383
And Heparin, 5,000 units.

227
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,335
Mr. McCabe, you have severe

228
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,421
frostbite in both
your feet and legs,

229
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,022
ice crystals in the tissues,

230
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,024
and we need to
warm them up quickly

231
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,259
in a whirlpool bath.

232
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,761
You mean like a Jacuzzi?

233
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,580
Yeah, like a Jacuzzi.

234
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,177
After that, we'll see if
there's any tissue damage,

235
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,380
and then we'll decide
if you need surgery.

236
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,969
Oh, no. I won't need that.

237
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,422
A perfectly good
pair of hoofers here.

238
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,441
Just need a little
warming up, that's all.

239
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,870
But tell them I'm taking
my clothes with me.

240
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:41,095
Don't want some bonehead

241
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,248
stealing them.

242
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,749
Mrs. Davis is 38 years old,

243
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,685
known history of recurrent,
easily controlled S.V.T.

244
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,654
Should have released
her hours ago.

245
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,667
I did try to talk
to you about her,

246
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,736
but you were on
your way to recovery.

247
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,327
Should have come to
me a long time before that.

248
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,862
The patient's been
here for hours.

249
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,280
Hi, Susie.

250
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,327
Not now, Chloe. I did try...

251
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,884
I need to tell you something.

252
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:05,720
Hey, you one of
Susie's teachers?

253
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:07,055
Here's your release.

254
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,422
Next time, Dr. Lewis,

255
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:09,857
try harder.

256
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:11,559
Oh, Mrs. Davis needs you.

257
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:14,462
Okay. I told you to stop
coming by the hospital.

258
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,375
Let me just tell you something.

259
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,199
It couldn't wait until tonight?

260
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,530
No. I'm not going
to be here tonight.

261
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,465
Ronnie and I are
moving to Texas.

262
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,682
I've come to say good-bye.

263
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,391
Susan, you coming?

264
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,409
Yeah.

265
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:35,100
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

266
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,085
I don't know.

267
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:40,054
Learn how to cook chili.

268
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,422
This isn't funny.

269
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,269
You waltz in here and tell me

270
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:45,438
you and Ronnie
are moving to Texas.

271
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:47,840
You're not even
sure he can get a job.

272
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,597
I told you, He's got an uncle

273
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,132
that works in a refinery.

274
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,945
Where are you going to live?

275
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:54,836
I always figure that stuff out.

276
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,054
You're pregnant, Chloe.

277
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,900
It's a little
different this time.

278
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,507
This is crazy.

279
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,026
I don't think you should go.

280
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,845
You want me and
Ronnie and the baby

281
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,681
to stay with you?

282
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,522
You don't even want
me to have the baby.

283
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,241
I just think...

284
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,691
Well, I want to,

285
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,176
and I'm going to.

286
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,644
At least stay in Chicago.

287
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,646
Maybe I can talk
to Mom and Dad...

288
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,498
I don't want that.

289
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:25,816
I don't want

290
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,301
to stay with people

291
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,487
that always think I'm doing

292
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,822
the wrong thing.

293
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,309
I'm going to love this
baby, Susan, so much,

294
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:39,814
and I want everyone
else to love it, too.

295
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,638
You going to eat that?

296
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,039
No.

297
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,884
Hey...

298
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,288
I'll send you a postcard
from the Alamo, okay?

299
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,760
Chloe, wait.

300
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:16,334
You don't even
have a winter coat.

301
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,565
Thanks.

302
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,900
I'll wear it.

303
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,118
I'll wear it all the time.

304
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,605
All right, give him
a liter of Ringer's

305
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:33,894
the first hour,

306
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,563
16 Lines, start a Foley.

307
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:38,110
B.P. 70/40, Resp shallow at 28.

308
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:39,945
Full thickness
burns to both legs.

309
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,637
Check to see who's
covering plastics.

310
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,750
We need more sterile saline.

311
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:46,674
Lydia's coming with it.

312
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,077
Third degree, scalp and face.

313
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,811
Burn unit's notified, Mark.

314
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,196
Thanks, Lydia.

315
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,576
Pulse ox, 85. I'll
start a flow sheet.

316
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,132
Any other firemen hurt?

317
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,345
No.

318
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,935
Give him ten of morphine.

319
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,187
Want me to get rid of them?

320
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,757
No, no. Let them stay.

321
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:04,804
Jose, you're missing
my point, man.

322
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:07,929
We are not a pizza joint,
and we do not deliver.

323
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,229
Okay. Sure.

324
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,165
Take your business elsewhere.

325
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,178
Guy wants us to
make house calls.

326
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:14,502
How quaint.

327
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:17,505
You, however, Dr. Ross,
won the Pick Three Lotto.

328
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,173
You got a runny nose in One,

329
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:21,141
cough and a sore throat in Four,

330
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,178
and babies having babies
over at curtain number Two.

331
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:25,746
Babies it is.

332
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,199
Thanks.

333
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,268
So, how was New Year's Eve?

334
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,037
Sorry I didn't make it.

335
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,138
Neither did we.

336
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,206
Walt and I fell out by 10:30.

337
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,875
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

338
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,545
So what does he think
about your new job?

339
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,879
He's happy.

340
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,748
Kids me about it all the time.

341
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,416
Says working for Parks and Rec

342
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,552
is like being an
urban forest ranger.

343
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,940
Yeah, but I bet
Mom's proud, right?

344
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,325
That's what we need
to talk about, Peter.

345
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,661
Walt and I saw
this really nice place

346
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,028
across from Grimwald Park.

347
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,597
She'd have her own room,

348
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,298
people would
spend time with her,

349
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,133
nurses would look after her.

350
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,680
Jackie, what are
you talking about?

351
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,037
I don't think we can
keep caring for her, Peter.

352
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,874
Ever since the stroke, she's
been in and out, and you know that.

353
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,542
She needs constant
looking after.

354
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,177
I don't know "constant."

355
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,279
No, you wouldn't know "constant"

356
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,047
because you're never around.

357
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,450
Now, with this new job,
I'm not able to do it anymore,

358
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,353
and I don't want the kids to
have to take on that responsibility.

359
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,989
Steven made the basketball
team, and Joanie's doing plays,

360
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,057
and I'm not going to
ask them to give that up.

361
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,304
Why? Because that's
what you had to do

362
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,229
when you were
looking out after me?

363
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,614
When Mom went back to work,

364
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,866
we didn't have much
choice, now, did we?

365
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,469
Huh? Well, I do have a choice

366
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,953
about my own kids.

367
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,006
Okay.

368
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,175
Jackie, uh...

369
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,844
there's got to be
something else.

370
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,296
What about Mrs. Lukey?

371
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,132
Mrs. Lukey's only three
years younger than Mom.

372
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,129
She looked out after
that old man on the corner.

373
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,298
She lives right across the
street. She could come over.

374
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,716
She could spend the days.

375
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,968
All right, I'll make the
arrangements. I'll pay for it.

376
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,803
And since when do you
have all this extra money?

377
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,906
Look, Jackie, let
me worry about that.

378
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,890
Is this some kind of done
deal because you say so?

379
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,982
Where the hell have you been

380
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,833
for the past six years

381
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,885
while Walt and I
worried about it?

382
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,104
I can't put her in a home.

383
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,376
<i>You</i> won't have to.

384
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,762
It's<i> our</i> decision.

385
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,831
<i>All</i> of ours.

386
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:30,554
It can't always be about
what you want, Peter.

387
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:35,643
I'm going to miss my bus.

388
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,157
Doc...

389
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,509
what's the story?

390
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,077
How's our boy?

391
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,514
It's not great, guys.

392
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,515
Sorry.

393
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,416
He's got full thickness burns

394
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,113
to 60 percent of his body.

395
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:04,149
He needs to go up to
the O.R. for debridement,

396
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,773
and from there to the burn unit.

397
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,041
But he's going to make it?

398
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,728
I'll know a lot more
in about 12 hours.

399
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:11,996
Yeah.

400
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,831
Okay, thanks, Doc.

401
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,001
Dr. Greene, can I talk
to you for a second?

402
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,109
Yeah. Can I borrow your pen?

403
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:23,307
Uh... I don't know
if this is appropriate.

404
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,576
I'm just not sure
that Dr. Benton's

405
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,545
all that interested in
supervising me anymore.

406
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,265
In fact, I'm fairly
certain that he's not.

407
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,435
That warm, fuzzy demeanor...
It's not getting through to you?

408
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,186
Yes, that would be accurate.

409
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,000
When I was in medical school,

410
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,073
I had a ton of
residents like Benton.

411
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,104
Matter of fact, I think
Benton had a ton

412
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,494
of residents like Benton.

413
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,963
He's not the worst
one you're going to get.

414
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,615
My advice... get used to it.

415
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,885
Lydia, I need some help
with those teenagers.

416
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,709
I can't. I'm on my
way to Radiology.

417
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,346
She can't. She's on
her way to Radiology.

418
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,348
She's trying to quit smoking.

419
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,416
She's chewing that nicotine gum.

420
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,985
The whole pack?

421
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,315
You okay?

422
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,505
I've, uh...

423
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:32,376
I never seen anything like that.

424
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:37,131
I just started, uh...
three weeks ago.

425
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,889
Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

426
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,575
But I didn't think it
would scare me like this.

427
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,266
Hey... you need
to get some rest.

428
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:59,387
Go home, okay?

429
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,955
Get some sleep.

430
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,392
Breathe.

431
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,030
Breathe.

432
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,517
The EKGs are normal?

433
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,863
That's right, Mr. Venerbeck.

434
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,032
So are your blood tests,
chest X rays and enzymes.

435
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,485
There doesn't seem to be any
damage to the heart muscle.

436
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,875
So what was this pain, then?

437
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,877
Probably muscular.

438
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,464
You take all this time

439
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,867
just to tell me I
pulled a muscle?

440
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,302
So what, I take that
anti-inflammatory again?

441
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,220
Again?

442
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,488
A couple of months ago,

443
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:36,368
my wife made me
clean the garage.

444
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:37,392
Threw my back out.

445
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,126
Two months ago?

446
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:40,995
That's what I said.

447
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:43,197
Oh, here it is. They
gave you Feldene.

448
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,464
Your pain stopped now,

449
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,027
so you don't need
to take it this time.

450
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,468
Okay, so I'm out of here.

451
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:50,154
I can't discharge
you exactly yet.

452
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,950
What's the deal?
You said I was fine.

453
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:54,191
I've got three customers
to see this afternoon.

454
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,993
I need to run your tests

455
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,172
by the cardiologist on call.

456
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,076
Then we can sign you out. Sorry.

457
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,548
Have you seen mark?

458
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,549
Room One.

459
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,951
Okay.

460
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,441
Mark.

461
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,554
Oh, it's okay, Mrs. Packard.

462
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,994
She's a nurse.

463
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:16,497
Sorry. Chopper setting down
in two minutes with an M.V.A.

464
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:17,831
Get Benton for it.

465
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,166
He's still at lunch.

466
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:20,763
Here's your pap
tray, Dr. Greene.

467
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:21,897
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

468
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:22,853
He's your man.

469
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,238
Right this way.

470
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,392
Okay.

471
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,539
Paramedics are bringing
in an M.V.A. on the chopper.

472
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,240
Benton's out. I need
you to bring him down.

473
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,530
Okay, wait. By myself?

474
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,531
Uh-huh.

475
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,532
Excellent.

476
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,068
Carter, it's 34 degrees out.

477
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,203
You might want to get your coat.

478
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,437
My coat.

479
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,218
Carter, is there some kind

480
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,402
of emergency?

481
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,050
All right, come on.

482
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,730
All right.

483
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,282
What have we got?

484
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:13,737
M.V.A... school bus
versus a two-door.

485
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,973
Blunt abdominal trauma.

486
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,742
25 Years old.

487
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,912
Pulse is thready.
B.P. is 50 palp.

488
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,080
Go! Go! Go!

489
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,414
Couldn't intubate.

490
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,961
Just scooped and flew.

491
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,651
All right, we'll take him.

492
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,736
Cap refill slow.

493
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,904
Sinus tack at 150.

494
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,122
Run a strip.

495
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:38,195
What do we got?

496
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,514
M.V.A. Blocked
trauma to the abdomen.

497
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:41,893
Okay, people, let's intubate.

498
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,083
I got it.

499
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:44,813
You help intubate.

500
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,147
I'll get x-ray down here.

501
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,254
Okay, Mr. Carter.

502
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:49,590
He's all yours.

503
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:52,025
Connie, can I get a 7.5?

504
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:53,894
Jim, it's Lily in E.R.

505
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,346
We need portable X
rays in Trauma Two.

506
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,050
C-spine and abdominal
series to start.

507
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,101
Okay, thanks.

508
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:04,271
He's got a lot of secretions.

509
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,340
I'm going to need some suction.

510
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,459
Where's the O-neg?

511
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,610
On its way.

512
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,612
Advance the blade.

513
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,592
B.P.'s at 50 palp.

514
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:15,982
Pass through the tube.

515
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,198
How much fluid has he had?

516
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,088
Two liters in the field.

517
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:23,423
This will make four.

518
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:24,758
I got it.

519
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:25,937
Give me a suction cap.

520
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:26,893
Respirator?

521
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:28,256
No, we're going

522
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,296
to bag him.

523
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:32,900
His abdomen's rigid.

524
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,752
Peritoneal lavage?

525
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,421
And would you like to
do that also, Mr. Carter?

526
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,724
No. You can do that one.

527
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,508
Oh. Why, thank you.

528
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:42,704
Don't bother, Peter.

529
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,022
I got a team scrubbing up.

530
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,290
Let's move him upstairs.

531
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:46,591
Okay. Give me the bullet.

532
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,765
M.V.A., 25 Years old,

533
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,716
brought in pale and diaphoretic.

534
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,751
Pulse is 150, B.P.'s 50 palp,

535
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,987
resp is 25. Intubated.

536
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:55,066
Blunt abdominal trauma.

537
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,306
Probable ruptured spleen.

538
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,386
Thank you, one and all.
We'll take it from here.

539
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,761
Let's go.

540
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:12,189
Morgenstern and I are doing
a gall bladder at 8:00 p.m.

541
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:13,357
Scrub in by 7:30.

542
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:24,968
We have made contact.

543
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,170
I repeat, we have made contact.

544
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,207
It was you who was
looking for him, right?

545
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,542
Yeah.

546
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,876
Dr. Kayson?

547
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,346
I'm on my way to the
cath lab, Dr. Lewis.

548
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,680
Then I'll ask you

549
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,427
to sign out Mr. Venerbeck now.

550
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,395
Admitted with
nonradiating left chest pain

551
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,663
reproducible with movement.

552
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,164
Tenderness, left sternal border.

553
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,433
Resolved without treatment.

554
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,589
EKG is normal?

555
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,658
Yes.

556
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:47,991
Enzymes? Chest X ray?

557
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,137
Normal.

558
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,261
Dizzy? Palpitations? No.

559
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,263
Diaphoretic? No.

560
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,776
Hyperlypoproteinemia? No.

561
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,277
History of chest
pain? No, but...

562
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,735
Risk factors?

563
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,280
None, but slightly
elevated blood pressure.

564
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,571
Doesn't sound cardiac.

565
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,506
Have him see his
doctor for a stress test.

566
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:03,907
Thank you, Dr. Lewis.

567
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,476
Thank you, Dr. Kayson.

568
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,507
You're free and
clear, Mr. Venerbeck.

569
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,031
See your own doctor.
Get a stress test.

570
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,567
Oh, great. I miss
two appointments,

571
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:14,636
and you take three hours

572
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,069
to tell me to see my own doctor.

573
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:18,049
Well, I'm sorry
that it took so long,

574
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,452
but we wanted to give
you a thorough checkup.

575
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:22,041
Sure, sure. Thanks, okay?

576
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,410
I'll send a nurse in.

577
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,479
Great.

578
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:25,779
Dr. Lewis?

579
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,787
When I was a resident,
I was always worried

580
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,989
about getting people's approval.

581
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,191
The attending, the patients.

582
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,194
Maybe because I was a
woman... a black woman.

583
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:44,030
Life was a lot easier
once I got over it.

584
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:47,133
Don't let the patients
get to you, Dr. Lewis.

585
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:49,303
We treat them as soon as we can,

586
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,571
and there is no
need to apologize

587
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,307
for how long it takes.

588
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,310
We're a busy hospital,
not a restaurant.

589
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:02,016
Don't touch me.

590
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,084
You started it.

591
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:04,084
I did not.

592
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:05,385
You did, too.

593
00:25:05,454 --> 00:25:07,855
Ladies, you're sisters.
We can work this out.

594
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,857
Sally didn't want the name Emily

595
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,158
until I chose it.

596
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:12,904
Emily is grandmother's name.

597
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,195
There are plenty of
other names you can use.

598
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,197
You don't even
know if it's a girl.

599
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,166
Besides, I deliver
a week earlier.

600
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,101
Not if I have it induced...

601
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,302
Oh, no!

602
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:24,149
Connie... Get out of the way!

603
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:26,573
Connie, get a C.B.C.
and a Chem seven.

604
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,109
Get F.H.T.s with a
Doppler and call O.B.

605
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,745
Hey, Susan, you bored?
Looking for something to do?

606
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:33,380
Come on. Her name's Territa.

607
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,982
She's 19 years old.

608
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:37,384
She's complaining
of abdominal pains.

609
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,886
She needs Narceine

610
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,204
and an amp of glucose.

611
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,190
Hook up the suction
to the Yankower.

612
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,860
We need an amp of glucose.

613
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:48,595
Narceine given.

614
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:51,582
Where's that Doppler?

615
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,866
B.P. 70/30.

616
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:54,568
Resp shallow at eight.

617
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:55,914
She's somnolent.

618
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:57,148
Pupils pinpoint.

619
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:58,350
What's she on?

620
00:25:58,374 --> 00:26:00,574
Boyfriend says
pills and cocaine.

621
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,120
Let's get a tox screen.

622
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,022
She needs an amp of D-5.

623
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,214
We're going to
help you, Territa.

624
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,233
Can you tell me
When your due date is?

625
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,884
I don't know!

626
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:13,220
Everything's going to be fine.

627
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,721
It's coming!

628
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,573
She's fully dilated.

629
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,742
100 percent effaced.

630
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,593
Membrane's ruptured.

631
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,128
Let's get her up to O.B.

632
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:24,681
Elderly couple's coming
in, both comatose.

633
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,216
E.T.A.'s two minutes.

634
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,751
Benton's in surgery,

635
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,060
and Dr. Hicks is
on her way down.

636
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,405
Please hurry. It's coming.

637
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:34,508
It's coming.

638
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:37,177
Don't push. Don't push.

639
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:38,512
Take short breaths,

640
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:40,847
like you're blowing
out a candle.

641
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:43,350
Oh, damn, we've
got a foot coming out,

642
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:44,851
and it's blue.

643
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,521
Okay, let's back her
up and take her in here.

644
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,900
Come on, people. Excuse us.

645
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:50,173
Help me.

646
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,508
Call O.B.

647
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,210
Tell them to get
down here right away.

648
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,146
Can't get much worse
than a cocaine toxic

649
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,648
footling breech.

650
00:26:58,717 --> 00:26:59,816
Yes, it can.

651
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,818
Umbilical cord's prolapsed.

652
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,453
Grab those monitors.

653
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,021
Where are the leads?

654
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,423
In the crash cart.

655
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,625
Oh, God, no!

656
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,389
Are they going to be okay?

657
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:11,295
Who are you?

658
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,963
I live next door.

659
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,298
Their cat was scratching
to get in the apartment

660
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,968
but, when I knocked,
nobody answered.

661
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:26,276
Her skin is cherry red,

662
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,561
especially under the nails.

663
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:29,829
O2 is 15 liters. Call
Respiratory in here stat.

664
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,698
It's probably carbon
monoxide poisoning,

665
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:32,799
with both of them out.

666
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,435
Carol, do a sodium
hydroxide test.

667
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:36,714
Can you get a couple of
test tubes from the rack?

668
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,233
Were they using space heaters?

669
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,123
Yeah. They got
those little ones with...

670
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,324
It's not oil, but...

671
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:42,659
Kerosene.

672
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,339
We need a portable
X ray in here now.

673
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,947
They're going to
be okay, aren't they?

674
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,149
They've lived next
door to me all my life.

675
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:50,651
They're like my grandparents.

676
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,196
C.O.'s present, both samples.

677
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,331
Carboxy-hemoglobin.

678
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:55,100
Let's get the oxygen
hooked up here.

679
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:56,689
What kind of lab test you want?

680
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,042
Keep breathing.

681
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,544
Turn the warmer on.

682
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,129
Who's on in N.I.C.U.?

683
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:05,132
Son of a bitch! It hurts!

684
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,550
No, no!

685
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,869
Breathe slowly.

686
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,137
I can't...

687
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:12,005
Good. I got the other leg.

688
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:13,674
Who's on in N.I.C.U.?

689
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,061
N-n-no!

690
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,724
Shoulder blades are free.

691
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:21,414
Okay, rotate it sideways.

692
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,667
Keep the arms
down over the chest.

693
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,035
What are you doing?

694
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:26,203
Here we go.

695
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,687
No!

696
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:30,006
He's tremulous.

697
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,258
Suction.

698
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:40,501
Okay. Breathe. Keep breathing.

699
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,941
Here's a line.

700
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,630
My baby.

701
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,466
I'll stick a butterfly
in his scalp vein.

702
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,069
Get me a heel stick.

703
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,174
Blood sugar is 25.

704
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,810
Any vaginal tears?

705
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,179
Not too bad.

706
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,142
Let me get some cord blood.

707
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,899
Give him six milligrams

708
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,501
of ten percent DW
over three minutes.

709
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,306
Susan, didn't you just release
a patient named Venerbeck?

710
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,176
Honey, you're going to be okay.

711
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:24,477
I just know it.

712
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:25,879
What happened?

713
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:27,447
I don't understand.

714
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,117
The whole time he
was here, he was fine.

715
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,263
He's had five of morphine...

716
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,521
He's got a new holosystolic
murmur with a thrill.

717
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,550
Give me an E.T. tube, 7.5.

718
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:39,292
Why did you let him go?

719
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,061
Why did you let him go?

720
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,796
500cc's D5W.

721
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:46,532
Ten mics per
kilogram per minute.

722
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:49,519
Would somebody please
tell me what is going on?

723
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:52,255
38-year-old bounce
back with chest pain.

724
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,990
Holosystolic murmur.

725
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,103
Hypertensive with possible

726
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,872
ventricular septal rupture.

727
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,497
Give me 40 milligrams
Lasix I.V. push.

728
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:01,731
Doctor, please.

729
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Someone tell me
what is going on!

730
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,469
Get him on the portable monitor.

731
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,499
Order up his lab results.

732
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:08,988
Come on, let's go.

733
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,923
That will be all, Dr. Lewis.

734
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,069
Mrs., uh...

735
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:13,026
Venerbeck.

736
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:14,110
Mrs. Venerbeck.

737
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,328
I'm Dr. Kayson.

738
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,730
We need to take certain
emergency measures

739
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,150
to stabilize your
husband's cardiac...

740
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:41,488
Miss Marianski...

741
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:45,592
Miss Marianski,

742
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:47,661
I'm sorry it's not the news

743
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,474
that you wanted to hear.

744
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,431
No, I want this baby.

745
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:57,437
Is it your husband?

746
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:02,442
He doesn't want
to have the baby?

747
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:05,512
Miss Marianski,
this is something

748
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,415
that the two of
you, as a couple,

749
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:10,517
really should discuss.

750
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:12,585
He's infertile.

751
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:17,957
Well, um...

752
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:21,461
In that case, uh...

753
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,448
um... yeah, that would be...

754
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,501
These are the maxillary sinuses.

755
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:30,437
If you see opacification
on the affected site,

756
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:33,340
that's a subtle clue
that the inferior wall

757
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:34,986
of the orbit's fractured.

758
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,610
If this isn't a good time...

759
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:38,189
Sorry. It's been a long day.

760
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:40,713
Actually, it's not a
great time for me either.

761
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:43,316
I'm scrubbing with
Dr. Benton on a gallbladder

762
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:44,484
in seven minutes.

763
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:46,986
If I know Dr. Benton,
he'll be early.

764
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:48,588
Better get out of here.

765
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,040
Oh, Carter, remember

766
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,208
these three things:

767
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,676
Cystic duct, common duct, liver.

768
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,510
What?

769
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,245
Get out of here.

770
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,593
They're asleep.

771
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,595
Oh, you scared me.

772
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,930
Sorry.

773
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,199
The blood gases have normalized.

774
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,867
The C.O. levels are down.

775
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,569
They're going to be fine.

776
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,054
They're on a 2359 hold.

777
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:24,507
I just wanted to check
on them before I head out.

778
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,045
Mr. Babcock owned a bakery.

779
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,213
Started it the year
they were married.

780
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,000
He still makes a three-tier
cake every June 14

781
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:35,518
on their anniversary.

782
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,904
They got lucky today.

783
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:41,191
I think maybe they've
been lucky every day.

784
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,065
Carter...

785
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:07,411
you don't have to
butt in backwards.

786
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:08,930
You're not sterile yet.

787
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,203
Okay.

788
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:12,705
Turn on the faucet
with your knee.

789
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:14,774
Pop open the brush packet.

790
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:22,282
Come on, get it open.

791
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:27,120
Good.

792
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,833
Now, get your hands wet,

793
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:31,124
starting with your fingernails.

794
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:33,688
Scrub your
fingernails ten times...

795
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,547
Front, side, back, webbing.

796
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,883
Like this?

797
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,486
Yeah. Sort of.

798
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,821
Then scrub the palm ten times.

799
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:49,025
Back of the hands,
down the arm...

800
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:54,247
Front, side, back,
up to the elbows.

801
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:58,485
And rinse.

802
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:00,821
Let the water run down your arms

803
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,155
not your hands.

804
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,623
You got it?

805
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,326
Yeah. Think so.

806
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:07,327
Good.

807
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:09,496
Remember, ten times.

808
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:11,031
And hurry up.

809
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,077
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

810
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,113
One, two, three, four,
five six, seven, eight.

811
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,365
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

812
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,305
Good. Just pull it right back.

813
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:21,207
Sometimes... You
know what I like to do?

814
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:23,042
Just pull the thing
back and hold it...

815
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:24,143
Get it out of your way.

816
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:25,144
Like this?

817
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,145
There you go.

818
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:27,647
It'll spring right back.

819
00:34:27,716 --> 00:34:28,982
Good.

820
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,451
I'm going to get this
out of your way there.

821
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,454
So you saw a piano showroom?

822
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:36,934
Yeah. A piano showroom...

823
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,169
Right on the
Eisenhower Expressway.

824
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:40,459
Drove right by it.

825
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:42,810
Let's bougie this bleeder.

826
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,964
So what's so strange about that?

827
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:47,834
Well, I've been driving
that same route home

828
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:49,468
every night for six years,

829
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:52,138
and I never even
saw it until last night,

830
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:53,640
but there it was...

831
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:56,208
On the Eisenhower
right off Central.

832
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:58,088
Well, I guess that is strange.

833
00:34:58,112 --> 00:34:59,562
Scalpel.

834
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:03,399
Okay, now, divide the
anterior rectus fascia.

835
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,802
Yeah, yeah, let's
Hoover that puppy.

836
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,137
Good.

837
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,072
Shirley, is it hot in here?

838
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,506
No, Dr. Morgenstern.

839
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,936
I think it must be
the change of life.

840
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,494
Pianos on the expressway?

841
00:35:14,563 --> 00:35:15,695
Thank you, Shirley.

842
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:16,696
You may go now.

843
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:18,197
Zap it there, will you?

844
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:21,951
Ah, Mr. Carter, glad
you could join us.

845
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,952
Dry off.

846
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,332
Tonsil clamp.

847
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,088
Divide the rectus,

848
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,391
and grab the
posterior rectus sheath.

849
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,709
Straight arms.

850
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:31,044
Good. Very good.

851
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:32,289
Scalpel.

852
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:33,313
I got it.

853
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:38,684
Right hand.

854
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:39,986
Right hand.

855
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,789
Sorry, I thought you
meant<i> your</i> right hand.

856
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:44,524
No, your right hand.

857
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:49,763
Left hand. Grab it.

858
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,431
We'll straighten it out.

859
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,165
Good. Spin.

860
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:57,804
Still with us, Carter?

861
00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:59,489
Yeah. Right here.

862
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,491
You're done.

863
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,493
Dr. Benton.

864
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,607
Okay. There's the fundus.

865
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:06,563
Dr. Benton...

866
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:07,564
Okay, grab it.

867
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:08,899
Dr. Benton...

868
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,567
What is it, Carter?

869
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,118
Where should I stand?

870
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:14,265
Well, not right there.
Don't touch my shoulder.

871
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:16,155
You just contaminated yourself.

872
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:18,357
Shirley, would you take
Dr. Carter out of here?

873
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,947
Want to play a round
of foreign capitals?

874
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,018
No. I hate this game.

875
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:37,027
Yes, Doug. Yeah, Doug. Oh!

876
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,528
Oh, no!

877
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:41,031
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

878
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,033
Don't move!

879
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,810
What was your name again?

880
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:59,215
Someday I'm going to
believe that line out of you.

881
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,095
What are you talking about?

882
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,752
Can you remember the names

883
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,888
of all the women
you've slept with?

884
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,557
No.

885
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:10,060
So? Someday you'll forget mine.

886
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,896
You're assuming
that we won't last.

887
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:16,566
Well... yeah.

888
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,903
Where are you going?

889
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,739
I've got that conference
in the morning.

890
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,008
All right.

891
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:28,078
We treated this
older couple today.

892
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,080
They were married 48 years.

893
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,414
Ai-yi-yi!

894
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,750
No, they seemed
pretty happy about it.

895
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,418
That's<i> them,</i> not us.

896
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:36,920
How do you know?

897
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,421
How did<i> they</i> know?

898
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,092
Because, if it were us,
we wouldn't be doing this.

899
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,526
We'd both be married.

900
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,629
Have daughters in Girl Scouts.

901
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,363
Be renting<i> The Lion King.</i>

902
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,666
We would never
have met each other

903
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:53,436
because we would already be
committed to somebody else.

904
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,087
Mm-hmm. Don't you want that?

905
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:57,540
Not now.

906
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,042
Not with me?

907
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,111
Same thing.

908
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,226
Then why don't <i>I</i> want it?

909
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,184
Because you are afraid.

910
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,285
Most men are afraid.

911
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,286
Of what?

912
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:14,957
Responsibility, aging, death...

913
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,294
diminished sexual capacity.

914
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,466
See you.

915
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:33,909
Iceland.

916
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,078
Reykjavik.

917
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,080
Don't move.

918
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,082
Belarus.

919
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,784
Minsk.

920
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,052
Ha!

921
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,374
Okay, pack off the colon,
duodenum and stomach.

922
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:49,876
Suction.

923
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:51,277
Suction.

924
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,846
Zaire.

925
00:38:58,286 --> 00:39:00,887
Kinshasa?

926
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:06,173
Perhaps your student

927
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:07,939
should step a little closer.

928
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:10,580
Yeah, I guess you're right.

929
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,509
We're all packed off here.

930
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:13,816
Peel it like a pear.

931
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:17,687
Grab at the ampulla and
dissect Calot's triangle.

932
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,924
Mr. Carter...

933
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,503
can you tell us what defines

934
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:26,546
Calot's triangle?

935
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,034
The cystic duct, the
common duct and the liver.

936
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:38,736
Hold this retractor, will you?

937
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,779
All right, let's get
a little bougie here.

938
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,685
Mr. Carter... have you ever
noticed that piano showroom

939
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,754
on the Eisenhower Expressway?

940
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:57,727
So then she blurts
out, "He's infertile."

941
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,231
Susan, that's my best
story of the new year.

942
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:04,934
Sorry. It's just been

943
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,071
another incredibly
hateful day with Kayson.

944
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,054
Yeah?

945
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:10,740
Well, you buy into it.

946
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,509
You can't let him
ride you like that.

947
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,511
I'd put salt on them.

948
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,962
Shouldn't eat salt.

949
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,464
What are you doing?

950
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:19,899
I need more Tabasco.

951
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:21,751
You haven't tasted them yet.

952
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,930
Don't need to.

953
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,386
But if you haven't
tasted them...

954
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,433
You have a problem with this?

955
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,925
No. No. Absolutely not.

956
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:32,328
Saw Chloe wandering
around the halls today.

957
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,331
She was so calm, I
hardly recognized her.

958
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,666
Thanks, Mark.

959
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,200
Sorry. That was stupid.

960
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,936
Actually, they're
moving to Texas.

961
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,504
Ronnie's going to dig for oil,

962
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,590
and she's going to have his
baby... assuming it<i> is</i> his baby.

963
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,053
Why don't they just stay here?

964
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,577
Probably because I told her
she should get an abortion.

965
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,578
Why did you do that?

966
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,314
Because I think she should.

967
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:53,026
That's not very supportive.

968
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,250
Supportive of what?

969
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,619
My sister's<i> fantasy</i>
of having a child?

970
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,421
She thinks it's like having

971
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,022
a pet, Mark... a little puppy

972
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,725
who will follow her around
and love her forever.

973
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,044
Who won't care that
she's an alcoholic,

974
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:06,379
that she abuses drugs,

975
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:08,058
that she's getting God
knows what diseases

976
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:09,760
from sleeping with
every guy on the corner.

977
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:12,385
Maybe this baby will turn
her around. You don't know.

978
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:14,921
Yeah. Like the one we
delivered this afternoon?

979
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:16,133
Maybe. I don't know.

980
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:17,256
Well, I do.

981
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:19,019
No, you don't, Susan.
That's the point.

982
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,977
None of us do. Chloe
will have a chance.

983
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,411
The baby will have a chance.

984
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,590
Who are you to decide?

985
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,547
I'm her sister.

986
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,948
I pick up the pieces.

987
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,283
It's still her choice.

988
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,218
And one that I would support

989
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:33,389
if she'd ever taken one ounce
of responsibility for her life

990
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,441
before wanting
to take on another.

991
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:36,809
I love my sister, Mark,

992
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:38,878
but she can't
even part her hair.

993
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:42,314
So do I think she should
bring a child into this world?

994
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:43,383
No, I do not.

995
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,140
Kayson?

996
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,132
Venerbeck is dead, Dr. Lewis.

997
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,450
Oh, God.

998
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,269
I've reviewed
this file thoroughly.

999
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:23,423
The man should never
have been released.

1000
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:25,368
You approved his release.

1001
00:42:25,392 --> 00:42:26,888
I didn't have all
the information.

1002
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:28,177
What information?

1003
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,224
He came in here two
months ago with back pain.

1004
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:32,492
The diagnosis was
musculoskeletal.

1005
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,866
It was probably atypical angina,

1006
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:35,563
and you should
have told me about it.

1007
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:37,998
You didn't ask for
his medical history.

1008
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,302
Do I have to ask for everything?

1009
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,440
What are you suggesting?

1010
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:42,942
I am suggesting this case

1011
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:45,177
was more complicated
than you thought,

1012
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,479
and that your
experience as a resident

1013
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:50,116
was not sufficient to
either determine that

1014
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:52,284
or to present it to
those who could.

1015
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:54,231
I presented what you asked for.

1016
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:55,921
But not the entire picture.

1017
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,057
And, because of
that, a man is dead,

1018
00:42:58,126 --> 00:43:00,793
and his wife is
consulting their attorney.

1019
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:07,566
Dr. Morgenstern has been
made aware of the situation,

1020
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:10,302
and I have requested
a full case review.

1021
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:14,573
Susan, E.M.T.'s

1022
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,242
pulling up...

1023
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:17,977
Woman in respiratory arrest.
