1
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:30,285
Oh, God, what time is it?

2
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,289
It's late.

3
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,861
Go back to sleep, Natalie.

4
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:37,782
What?

5
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:40,020
I said go back to sleep.

6
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:44,195
You... you just
called me Natalie.

7
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:46,233
It's not Natalie?

8
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:48,068
Mm-mm.

9
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:49,739
Sorry.

10
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:51,374
It's okay.

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,864
I... I forgot your name, too.

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,533
Don?

13
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:56,435
Doug.

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,870
Doug.

15
00:00:57,906 --> 00:00:59,274
Pamela.

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,943
Hi, Pamela.

17
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,313
Hi.

18
00:01:09,262 --> 00:01:11,196
Are you going someplace?

19
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,533
Work.

20
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,402
At 4:00 a.m.?

21
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,972
Man's got to eat.

22
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:21,216
I'll call you.

23
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:22,552
No, you won't.

24
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:23,887
Hey...

25
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:27,294
don't let the cat out.

26
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:10,393
Huh...

27
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,530
Huh!

28
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,736
Huh, damn, it's cold out.

29
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,347
Slow night?

30
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:23,351
Calm before the storm.

31
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:25,355
In a little early, aren't you?

32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,692
Actually, I am a
dedicated pediatric resident

33
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,707
struggling to
fulfill the promise

34
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:32,902
of a brilliant early career.

35
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,906
You been drinking?

36
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:36,187
I wish.

37
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,278
Nobody's in four,

38
00:02:37,313 --> 00:02:39,093
if you want to get a few
winks before your shift.

39
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,599
No, I'll just catch up on
some paperwork. Thanks.

40
00:02:54,563 --> 00:02:55,897
You're in early.

41
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:57,066
You're in late.

42
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:59,770
Yeah, I'm still waiting for
someone to pick up Tatiana.

43
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,776
Family and Children's Services
said they'd be here by midnight.

44
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:04,647
Did they say what year?

45
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:06,584
Nice shirt. Sleep in it?

46
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,582
Something like that.
You working today?

47
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,075
Yep. On at 7:00.

48
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:12,490
Why don't you
get a couple hours.

49
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:13,798
I'll keep an eye on Tatiana.

50
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,935
Really?

51
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,322
Yeah. I can practice
up on my Russian.

52
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,009
She's in three.

53
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:23,383
Thanks, Doug.

54
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:25,270
What are friends for?

55
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:31,564
I know, I'm early.

56
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:56,262
Hey.

57
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,246
Hi.

58
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,918
Hi.

59
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:28,557
Oh, God.

60
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:31,596
Hi, yourself, kid.

61
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,631
Jesse...

62
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:36,371
Baby, leave Uncle Peter alone.

63
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,108
Now go on upstairs. Go.

64
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,179
Put some clothes on.

65
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:44,954
I'm sorry, honey.

66
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:46,769
I was trying to let
you get some sleep.

67
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:49,146
Yeah.

68
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:50,883
What time is it?

69
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,535
It's about 6:30.

70
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,876
I was going to make
you go home last night

71
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:58,547
but you were snoring
to wake the dead.

72
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,216
I do not snore.

73
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:02,990
Worse than Daddy used to.

74
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,763
Oh, man.

75
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,214
Be advised that Archer Avenue...

76
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,184
Look what the cat dragged in.

77
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,575
Any juice?

78
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,579
Is that blood on your shoes?

79
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,982
Probably.

80
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:18,714
She give you any
trouble last night?

81
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:20,590
No, she went to bed early.

82
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,925
Hey, how was the movie?

83
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,261
Wack.

84
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:24,429
Jesse liked it.

85
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:25,716
Jesse's four.

86
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,469
You going to make it back

87
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:28,833
in time for dinner?

88
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:31,326
Today's Thursday. I don't
watch Mom on Thursdays.

89
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,396
It's the 16th, Peter.

90
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:35,484
Mama's birthday?

91
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,488
Oh, yeah. Today.

92
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:40,160
Yeah, for the last 76 years.

93
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:42,832
Come on, kids. The
dad bus is leaving.

94
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,515
Steven, come straight
home from basketball practice.

95
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,843
Don't make me have to
send your father after you.

96
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:50,179
Here.

97
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:52,517
You going without your books?

98
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:55,188
I don't know what
this lipstick is about

99
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:57,894
but we're going
to talk about this.

100
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:04,039
So you're not coming?

101
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,544
No, no, no. I'm coming.

102
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:11,153
I just got to figure
something out, that's all.

103
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:12,889
Lamb?

104
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,893
Standing rib roast.

105
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:18,033
Right. The American
Heart Association diet, right?

106
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:21,583
Hey, it's what she
likes, and it won't kill you.

107
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:23,944
It might.

108
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,059
Peter, please
don't disappoint her.

109
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,653
You're the only one she
really remembers anymore.

110
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,067
WMAQ weather for tonight:

111
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,058
Cloudy, cold, low 18...

112
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:32,526
Jackie, I'll be here.

113
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:35,933
50 degrees, currently
48 degrees in Chicago.

114
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:37,603
I'll be here.

115
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,325
I've been on for
24 hours, Peter.

116
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:29,597
I'll take your Christmas shift,
New Year's, Thanksgiving,

117
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,133
Fourth of July, Flag
Day, you name it.

118
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:32,870
You owe me three days already.

119
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,695
All your hemorrhoid
cases for a year,

120
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:37,266
half my future practice,
my firstborn... Mort!

121
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:39,488
Hey, man, it's my mother.

122
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:40,590
She's sick.

123
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,260
I-I-I need to be there.

124
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,562
Not this time, Peter.

125
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,566
I can't. Sorry.

126
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,924
Lily, get Psych down here now.

127
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:53,093
Jerry, what the
hell is happening?

128
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:54,128
Carter's got a guy down here

129
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:55,597
who's poured gasoline
all over himself,

130
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:56,799
says he's going to drop a match.

131
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:58,157
Is he serious?

132
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,605
Who knows? But
I'm playing it safe

133
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,841
and looking for marshmallows.

134
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:02,009
Get any closer and I'll do it.

135
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,147
You don't want to do this,
Mr. Halgren. Really, you don't.

136
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:04,836
Yes, I do.

137
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:05,420
No, you don't.

138
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:06,473
Yes, I do.

139
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:07,208
No, you don't.

140
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:08,739
Yes, I do! No, you don't.

141
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:10,397
What, are we arguing? I do.

142
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,486
Back up. Back up!

143
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,223
I'm backing up.

144
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:17,928
You know, if you do
this, you're going to set off

145
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,210
the sprinkler system, and then
all you're gonna be is a bald guy

146
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,697
with no facial hair and
a really bad sunburn.

147
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,516
You don't have a
sprinkler system.

148
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,442
We...

149
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:28,081
We don't have a
sprinkler system?

150
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:29,767
All right.

151
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,583
We can talk about this, right?

152
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:33,218
We can because I
don't want to see you

153
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:36,096
hurt yourself and I don't
want you hurting anybody else,

154
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:38,718
so let me be your
friend here, okay?

155
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:40,205
I can be your friend.

156
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,508
Please? Come on.

157
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:51,342
When you're finished
making new friends, Dr. Freud,

158
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:53,480
Sparky there will
need an eyewash

159
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,349
and a shower.

160
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,923
Daddy. ROSS: There's
something you don't see every day.

161
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:04,450
Ow. MAN: He climbed
up on a chair in our den,

162
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:07,505
stuck his head in,
started screaming.

163
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,175
He's bleeding a little bit.

164
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:10,277
It hurts.

165
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:12,415
The teeth are
jammed into his neck.

166
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,219
Ow. Ow. Hang in there, buddy.

167
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,188
We're going to get
you out of there.

168
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,937
I took him to see<i>
The Lion King</i> again

169
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,395
for the ninth time last night.

170
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:21,165
This is the thanks I get.

171
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,846
No more<i> Lion King,</i>
Gus. You hear me?

172
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,903
No more.

173
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,240
Daddy...

174
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:27,243
Did you bag this?

175
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,075
My great-grandfather
was a roughrider.

176
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,079
He bagged it in India
with Teddy Roosevelt.

177
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,315
Mmm-hmm.

178
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,018
Ow. Sorry. When did it happen?

179
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,561
1910. They were
in the Punjab, I think.

180
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:38,743
No, I mean, when did this
get stuck on Gus's head?

181
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,737
Oh... gee.

182
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,239
A half an hour ago.

183
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:45,512
I might have made it a
little worse trying to pull it off.

184
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,165
He's going to need stitches.

185
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,070
Malik, why don't you go
up to Ortho, get a bone saw.

186
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,289
Ho-ho-hold up.

187
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,360
You're going to cut
into my kid's neck?

188
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,848
We're going to saw
the jaw off the tiger.

189
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:57,952
It's been in my
family for 90 years!

190
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,424
I mean... it's historical,
for God's sake.

191
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,777
I mean...

192
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:04,448
Gee... Teddy Roosevelt.

193
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:11,144
17-Year-old female,
B.P.'s 90/60, pulse 108.

194
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,449
Empty bottles of
vodka and brandy,

195
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:15,452
Valium, flexural, Darvon...

196
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:18,624
Father thinks she may have
others stashed away somewhere.

197
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,626
No note.

198
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:20,829
Okay.

199
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:22,799
Okay, ready? On three.

200
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,171
One, two, three.

201
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:28,443
All right, let's get a CBC,
chem-7, cath. urine for ruds,

202
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,514
a tox screen and
a blood alcohol.

203
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:32,028
What have you got?

204
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:33,787
One of your old favorites, René.

205
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:36,025
Whoa, René, it's
been a long time.

206
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,628
What? A couple of weeks?

207
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:39,766
René..? René!

208
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,435
What are you on, René?

209
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,007
I got a headache.

210
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,777
I bet you do have a headache.

211
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,179
Give me something.

212
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,617
Something? What, were
you taking, uh... aspirin?

213
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:50,899
No.

214
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:54,360
Ah. You're not getting
Demerol, René, so forget it.

215
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,495
Lavage?

216
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,677
Ewald tube...
Saline, three liters.

217
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,136
I'll get the charcoal.

218
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:00,951
It's stomach pump time, René.

219
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:02,287
Oh, no. No!

220
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,512
Calm down or this is
going down your nose

221
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:06,583
and you know how
much you hate that.

222
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:08,332
So, who brought
her in this time?

223
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:09,656
Her dad or the creep?

224
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,825
Her dad.

225
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,074
You know, if we gave
out green stamps,

226
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:17,071
René'd have a car by now.

227
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:20,037
The people over at Sunshine
House have agreed to take her in.

228
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:21,696
And they're set up
to handle AIDS kids?

229
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,010
That's all we do.

230
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,634
What are her
chances of adoption?

231
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:27,040
With advanced AIDS, zero.

232
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,843
There's foster care.

233
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:31,361
So she goes there to die?

234
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:34,586
The people at the
hospice are great.

235
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,490
She'll be with other kids,

236
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:39,429
there's full-time
nursing care, teachers.

237
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,934
She's fortunate there
is a Sunshine House.

238
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,217
Yeah, it's her lucky day.

239
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,440
She's in here?

240
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:47,278
Uh-huh.

241
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:55,894
Tatiana,<i> eta</i> Mrs. Brown.

242
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,718

<i>Eta horoshia mesto.</i>

247
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,273
What's she saying?

248
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:13,845
She doesn't want to go.

249
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,339
Hi, Tatiana.

250
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,246
I like your doll.

251
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:25,751
What's her name?

252
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:32,046
<i>Scaggee yeh eemya

253
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,468
Anna.

254
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,853
Anna.

255
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:38,993
That's a very pretty name.

256
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:44,604
Tatiana, you need
to come with me.

257
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:46,874
Please?

258
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,548
<i>Edee.</i>

259
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,318
<i>Vsaw budict,</i> okay?

260
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:53,889
<i>Edee.</i>

261
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,681
Start an I.V., five
milligrams morphine.

262
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,584
How'd this happen, Mr. Kazuo?

263
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,841
Boning fish.

264
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,690
All right, let's get a CBC,

265
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:33,959
Ancef I.V. and a DT.

266
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:34,949
X Ray? Whoa... Yeah.

267
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:36,097
Where's your finger?

268
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:38,189
I couldn't find it.
It hurt too much.

269
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:41,445
Well, if we can find it, we
may be able to reattach it.

270
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,166
The guys brought the crate in.

271
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,680
Dr. Benton? Yeah.

272
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:47,675
All right. Carter,
Chen, let's go.

273
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,682
All right. While the good
news is the finger's on ice,

274
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:53,919
the bad news is, it's in here.

275
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:54,921
All right, dig in.

276
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:56,703
Let's get the
replantation team up here.

277
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:57,876
Carter, Chen, move.

278
00:13:57,912 --> 00:13:59,279
If that tissue freezes,

279
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:02,185
you might as well
serve it as sushi.

280
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,388
René's going to be okay.

281
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:14,525
We pumped your
daughter's stomach.

282
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:18,131
The tox screen showed
cannabis, opiates,

283
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:19,968
benzodiazepines.

284
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:23,526
Her blood alcohol
level was .375.

285
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,780
She had a fight
with her boyfriend.

286
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:29,221
Said she wanted to kill herself.

287
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:31,892
You want me to get
Psych down here again?

288
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:33,328
What for?

289
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:36,201
They'll just let her out

290
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:38,170
in a couple of days.

291
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,040
Have you thought about

292
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,779
any in-patient treatment
centers for René?

293
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:44,733
We did that.

294
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,838
She cut her wrists.

295
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:51,679
What am I going to do?

296
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,450
Oh, God.

297
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,749
Have you decided
what you're going to do

298
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,820
in your sub-I next year?

299
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:05,266
My elective? I
don't know. Uh-huh.

300
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,937
We've still got a couple months

301
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,328
to make up our minds.

302
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:10,900
Well, sure, but the good
ones are going to be long gone.

303
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,948
I thought we just
had to sign up?

304
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:13,922
Uh, no.

305
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:15,476
It's really competitive.

306
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:18,092
Oh.

307
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:20,451
I was thinking about
just staying here.

308
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,455
Trauma placement?

309
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,110
They've already got 12
requests for the one spot.

310
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:26,211
In the E.R.?

311
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:27,365
Mm-hmm.

312
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,703
We're here, so we
have the inside track,

313
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:31,906
but it's the
resident's decision.

314
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:33,476
Benton?

315
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:36,549
Uh-huh. It's not supposed
to be, but they always go

316
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:38,469
with who the resident wants.

317
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,272
So have you already applied?

318
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:42,477
Are you kidding?
As soon as I got here.

319
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:43,645
I didn't want Ben

320
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,483
to think I wasn't interested,

321
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:46,918
and...

322
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:48,222
I got it!

323
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:49,991
He already told you?

324
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,663
One missing digit.

325
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:56,770
Six-year-old male,
gunshot wound to the back.

326
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:58,819
C-7, T-1 region, no exit wound.

327
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:00,845
B.P. 70/50, Pulse 112.

328
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,018
Oxygen, 15 liters by mask,
two large-bore I.V.'s wide open.

329
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:05,833
All right, let's get
him on my count.

330
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,037
Nice and gentle...
One, two, three.

331
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:09,928
Good bilateral breath sounds.

332
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:11,165
Cap refill's poor.

333
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,278
Blood coming up?

334
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:14,988
GCS 201. I.V.'s wide open.

335
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:17,466
Type and cross four units O-neg.

336
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:18,640
Let's move.

337
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:19,665
All right.

338
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,067
Start a flow sheet.

339
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,314
Okay.

340
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:23,405
A C-spine and chest film.

341
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,339
Get them up here now.

342
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,743
I think we've got a cord injury.

343
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:28,297
Okay, start a flow sheet.

344
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:30,185
He's going to need a Foley.

345
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,253
All right.

346
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:32,384
Good bilateral breath sounds.

347
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,486
All right, blood coming up.

348
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,906
Pass the trauma scissors... Hey.

349
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,081
Hey!

350
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:38,117
Are you hurt?

351
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:39,452
Are you hurt, too?

352
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:40,788
I killed him.

353
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:41,969
I killed Drew.

354
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,495
Connie, let's get
another gurney in here.

355
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,160
Switch him over to a dynamap.

356
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,829
Where's that O-Neg?!

357
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,621
I killed him. He's in shock.

358
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:50,623
I killed Drew.

359
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:51,660
Here we go.

360
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:53,996
I shot my little brother.

361
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:57,370
Let's get him on mask,
start an I.V. Of saline.

362
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:01,745
I shot my little brother.

363
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:06,437
Got them.

364
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:09,743
Damn.

365
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,914
C-7, T-1 vertebrae.

366
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,183
Gardner-Wells?

367
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:14,185
Yeah.

368
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:15,532
All right, bolus 600 migs,

369
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:18,694
methylprednisolone over 15 now.

370
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:21,733
Start a Foley catheter
and an NG tube.

371
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,067
Kid's father's here.

372
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:36,027
I'll take it.

373
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,931
Call Neuro and book an O.R.

374
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:41,097
He was okay a
couple of days ago.

375
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:42,367
Now he's confused.

376
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:43,436
He's agitated.

377
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,426
Dick.

378
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:45,595
Dick?

379
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,200
Mr. Thornberg, do you
know where you are?

380
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:51,139
Do you know what day it is?

381
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:52,569
Would you scratch
that for me, Dick?

382
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:53,460
It itches like crazy.

383
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:55,130
Do you know where you are?

384
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:57,267
Dick, damn it, I'm telling you.

385
00:17:57,303 --> 00:17:59,616
Has he been sick
on any medications?

386
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,275
He has lung cancer.

387
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:02,811
Chemo, radiation?

388
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,282
They gave up a
couple of months ago.

389
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,636
Come on, Dick.

390
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:08,205
Come on.

391
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,878
Let's get a CBC,
lytes, calcium level.

392
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:13,226
Want an EKG? Yeah.

393
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,651
Get out of my car.

394
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:16,153
I'll get somebody.

395
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,590
Are you Mrs. Thornberg?

396
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:18,926
Uh...

397
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:21,647
No. Just... just a friend.

398
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,253
Have you contacted
anyone in his family?

399
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:27,326
He's got a daughter somewhere,
but they're not in touch.

400
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,828
Can I please stay with him?

401
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:30,163
Oh, sure. Sure.

402
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:33,737
Hey, Mark, Susan, we've
got end-stage lung cancer

403
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,841
with altered mental
status in one.

404
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,158
One, two, three.

405
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:41,853
Don't let the screen
door hit you on your butt

406
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:42,889
on the way out.

407
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,399
What is that smell?

408
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:49,735
Halibut.

409
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,239
It's the same thing, all right?

410
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,608
Dr. Benton?

411
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,414
Walt, come on, man.

412
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:59,253
You know how I
feel about birthdays.

413
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,422
All right, all right.

414
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:02,292
Look, I gave my
word. I'll be there.

415
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:05,531
Do me a favor, tell Jackie
don't make a big deal out of it.

416
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:06,867
Okay. 7:00.

417
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,506
Today your birthday?

418
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,220
Carter, my personal
life's my own

419
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:13,525
and don't eavesdrop
on my phone calls, okay?

420
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,667
Sure. Sorry.

421
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:19,541
Uh... I had a question about
next year's Trauma Sub-I.

422
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,476
What about it?

423
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:21,678
Well, I understand that

424
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:23,377
12 Students have
already applied,

425
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,469
and I was wondering
if I was interested,

426
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:28,041
if you could tell me wh-what
my chances would be.

427
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:29,571
12 People have applied, right?

428
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:30,228
Right, yeah.

429
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,664
With me, it would be 13.

430
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,420
Well, then I'd say your
chances are one in 13.

431
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,525
You walked into that one.

432
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:38,728
Yeah.

433
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:41,216
The creep is here.

434
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:43,420
He's in the waiting
room with dad.

435
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:46,058
Great. My day is complete.

436
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,862
It's Dr. Benton's birthday.

437
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:49,933
Really? It's my
daughter's birthday, too.

438
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:51,814
Think we should do something?

439
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,804
Like what?

440
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,319
I don't know. Throw a party?

441
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,077
A part? Oh, God.
He would hate it.

442
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,413
Talk to Lydia.

443
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:00,787
She can pull those things
together pretty quickly.

444
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,220
Mr. Thomas?

445
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:12,893
I'm Dr. Ross.

446
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,898
The bullet entered
your son's back.

447
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:17,301
It smashed his vertebrae.

448
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:19,405
We need to do some
exploratory surgery

449
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:22,278
to determine the
extent of the injuries.

450
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:25,833
He does have reflex activity
and anal sphincter tone,

451
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,173
both of which are hopeful signs.

452
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,058
Kyle, stop.

453
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:37,657
Will my boy live?

454
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:40,094
Uh, well... we don't know.

455
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:43,802
It-it-it'll be a few hours.

456
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:45,505
Doesn't look good.

457
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,713
Kyle, stop it.

458
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,671
I said shut up.

459
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,069
I'm sorry, son.

460
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:02,504
It's okay, son.

461
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,107
It's okay.

462
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:05,644
I'm sorry, Kyle.

463
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,717
It's going to be all right.

464
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:16,465
I always keep my guns locked up.

465
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,487
I must have forgot.

466
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,923
I told them to stay
out of that room.

467
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:25,259
I told them a million times,

468
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:26,963
but I must have forgot.

469
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:31,728
Good Lord, I must have forgot.

470
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:36,769
Hypercalcemia. Normal saline

471
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,255
300cc's per hour

472
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,527
and diurese with
40 migs Lasix I.V.

473
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:42,558
There's too much calcium
in your friend's system.

474
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:43,661
We're going to get it out.

475
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:44,801
Is it from the cancer?

476
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,917
Mm-hmm. It's not
uncommon, but he needs

477
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,494
to see his oncologist for
long-term drug treatment

478
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,442
to prevent this from
happening again.

479
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,167
Just gets worse and worse.

480
00:21:53,203 --> 00:21:55,706
He'll feel better in
a couple of hours.

481
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,304
His calcium level
wasn't that high.

482
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,786
Mike's too stubborn to die, huh.

483
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,222
Have you known him long?

484
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:05,224
Not really.

485
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:06,560
About a year.

486
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:08,030
We met at church.

487
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,184
He's a real character.

488
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:12,021
He's fun to live with.

489
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:13,356
You two live together?

490
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:15,845
Oh, no, no. It's not
romantic or... or anything.

491
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,046
I liked him.

492
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:19,050
Thought maybe I could help out.

493
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:21,889
He's a sweet guy.

494
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,260
He's got no one, no family.

495
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:27,400
It just seemed like
the right thing to do.

496
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:28,769
Huh?

497
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:34,090
<i>I was trying to get
rid of a headache.</i>

498
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:36,283
Maybe you should
just stay in the hospital.

499
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:37,218
I want to go home.

500
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:38,599
You don't know what I want!

501
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,936
So, René, your father said

502
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,894
you were threatening
to kill yourself.

503
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:42,896
I was just upset.

504
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:44,778
You know, T.J. and I
had a fight, that's all.

505
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,013
Hey, this I.V.'s hurting her.

506
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:48,017
Can you give her
something for her pain?

507
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,821
So you weren't
considering suicide?

508
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:52,292
Hey, she just told
you what happened.

509
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:54,046
T.J., shut up. You're
not part of this family.

510
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,548
Hey, don't you
tell me to shut up.

511
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:56,650
Why don't you shut up?!

512
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:58,626
Leave him alone!

513
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:00,614
Why don't you all shut up, okay?

514
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:02,684
So, René,

515
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:05,673
you weren't trying to
kill yourself this morning?

516
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:09,997
I just wanted to go to sleep.

517
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:12,703
Why don't you check
yourself in voluntarily,

518
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:13,738
get cleaned up?

519
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:16,593
I want to go home.

520
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,065
I got to get to work.

521
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,503
Mr. Franks.

522
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,277
Sure. Whatever.

523
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:29,152
Let her go.

524
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,867
Dr. Benton.

525
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,697
I understand you're anxious
to change your shift tonight.

526
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,417
Not anxious, but I was hoping

527
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,355
to find somebody to
cover for me, yeah.

528
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,926
Well, it's happened
a lot lately.

529
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:52,178
A couple of times, yeah.

530
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:53,692
Four times. I checked.

531
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,830
Peter, it's not
forbidden to swap shifts,

532
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:58,001
but we don't want
to encourage it.

533
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,105
Look, Dr. Hicks, I
assure... Let me finish.

534
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:03,032
Dr. Morgenstern and I have
spent a great deal of time

535
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,964
with the schedule,
and we try to provide

536
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:07,501
every resident with a
well-rounded work experience.

537
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:09,796
And swap shifts, you
upset the balance.

538
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:12,084
Peter, you've got two
women with abdominal pain

539
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,086
in curtain two.

540
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,089
Yeah. Um...

541
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:18,696
My, uh... my mother's been ill.

542
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,332
It's always difficult,

543
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:23,271
but if your mother's
declining health

544
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:24,824
becomes an impediment

545
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,123
in your completing
your residency,

546
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:29,027
you may want to
consider taking a hiatus.

547
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,084
Peter.

548
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,515
He'll be right there.

549
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:32,839
It's not uncommon.

550
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,554
You're an excellent doctor.

551
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:35,656
These things happen.

552
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,698
You can rejoin the
program next year.

553
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:42,324
That won't be necessary.

554
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,445
So we understand
each other, then?

555
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,298
Yeah. Yeah.

556
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:52,710
Some time this century, Peter.

557
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,190
They're sisters.

558
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:02,095
Got some sort abdominal
seizure from something they ate.

559
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,142
B.P.'s 5o over nothing.

560
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,745
I think they're crashing.

561

What the hell is
wrong with them?

562
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,574
I can't stop twitching.

563
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,826
Her B.P.'s racing.

564
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:11,897
Oh, my God.

565
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:13,750
Doctor, I can't stop.

566
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:15,181
Okay, okay. Carter,
hold her down.

567
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:16,656
Doctor, please help me.

568
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:19,394

got married there

and it was lovely.

Oh, yeah? Your sister.

I could do more to help her.

622
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:55,493
I was thinking... maybe
we could adopt her.

623
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:02,840
You want to adopt
a kid with AIDS?

624
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,176
Yeah.

625
00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:06,263
She doesn't have anybody.

626
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,510
She doesn't speak the language.

627
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:08,467
She's completely alone.

628
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:09,570
How advanced is the virus?

629
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,918
She doesn't have a lot of time.

630
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,745
What, a month? A year? Five?

631
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,825
What difference does it make?

632
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:16,599

00:28:18,855 --> 00:28:22,678
Wh-Why do you
have to do this now,

635
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,693
three months before
the wedding? Why?

636
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:27,053
Because she needs us now.

637
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:31,061
So, if I don't want to do this,
does that make me a bad person?

638
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:35,636
No.

639

Hey, Mark, what
happened with René?

648
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:03,000
Uh, gone home.

649
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:04,658
Her dad signed her out.

650
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:07,230
I've got this rule
out M.I. in One.

651
00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:10,201
Today is his 60th
wedding anniversary.

652
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:11,470
Sixty?

653
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:12,807
My record's 60 weeks.

654
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,777
I don't think I'll
ever get married.

655
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:15,746
Yes, you will.

656
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:16,915
I don't know.

657
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,820
All the marriages I
know are pretty rocky.

658
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:22,218
Well, thank you very much.

659
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,640
Jerry, I need the Olan chart.

660
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:27,535

are the lab results

661
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,772
from the MVA in Four?

662
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:31,242
I ate them.

663
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:33,246
Yeah, well, I need them.

664
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:36,954

665
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:39,391

668
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:43,532
Six minutes.

669
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:44,868

674
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:52,361
Uh, he's with a patient.

675
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:54,353
Could you please tell
him I'm looking for him?

676
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:57,292
Diane Leeds. Yeah. Sorry.

677
00:29:57,327 --> 00:30:00,890
Yeah, it's going to be
a little bit later than that.

678
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:12,721
Dr. Benton.

679
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:15,994
Shoot!

680
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,284
The, uh, the check
didn't bounce, did it?

681
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,816
It isn't going to, is it?

682
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,025
No. I... I just haven't had
time to make a deposit.

683
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,396
I'll, uh, take care of it
first thing in the morning.

684
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:26,476
Tomorrow's fine.

685
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,697
Look, I was hoping
to catch a ride

686
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,768
to the birthday party tonight.

687
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:33,038
She invited me,
and I'd like to go

688
00:30:33,062 --> 00:30:34,775
if you can give me a lift.

689
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,302
Where's your car?

690
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:38,705
In the shop.

691
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,644
My husband can
pick me up afterwards.

692
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,747
I didn't know you were married.

693
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:45,161
Well... I take it off

694
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:46,964
when I work with patients.

695
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:47,955
Mm-hmm.

696
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,428
Happy birthday, Peter.

697
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:54,367
You and your mother
have the same birthday?

698
00:30:54,403 --> 00:30:56,505
No. It's... it's a long story.

699
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,976
So, can you give
me a ride or not?

700
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:02,294
You know what,
um, I don't even know

701
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,898
if I'm going to be
able to make it,

702
00:31:03,922 --> 00:31:06,490
so maybe you'd better catch
another ride somewhere else.

703
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,331
So how long has
he had this cold?

704
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:14,657
Couple of weeks.

705
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:16,426
He keeps getting
sick this winter,

706
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:19,132
and his school says
he's falling asleep in class.

707
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,603
Dr. Ross, woman at the
front desk looking for you.

708
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:22,806
Says her name is Leeds.

709
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,343
Tell her I'll be there
as soon as I can.

710
00:31:25,378 --> 00:31:27,480
All right, kiddo,
open up for me.

711
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:28,716
Let's take a look.

712
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:31,055
Now, when was the last
time Billy saw a dentist?

713
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,041
Uh... I don't know.

714
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:35,397
Um... last year.

715
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,869
All right, kiddo, let's
put your shirt back on.

716
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:41,174
It's cold in here. Okay?

717
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,509
All right.

718
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:43,990
I think he's anemic,
Mrs. Larson,

719
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:46,128
probably because he's
not getting enough iron.

720
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,870
So he needs some vitamins?

721
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,708
Well, no. What he really
needs is a better diet:

722
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:53,058
some vegetables,
some grain, meat, milk.

723
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:54,160
He's malnourished.

724
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:56,035
I try to get him some
meat every week.

725
00:31:56,071 --> 00:31:58,624
You're going to have
to do more than that.

726
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,093
Are you on food stamps?

727
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,429
Mm-hmm.

728
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:03,411
How many kids do you have?

729
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:04,852
Four... and in the winter,

730
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:06,388
after I pay for the heat,

731
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,693
there is not much
left to go around.

732
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:09,962
Dr. Ross, that kid who fell

733
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,699
out of the window, I need you.

734
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:15,173
You're going to have to get
more food for your children to eat.

735
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:18,578
Lydia here is going to give you
the name of several food banks

736
00:32:18,614 --> 00:32:20,182
and some local church groups

737
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:21,685
who feed families.

738
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,087
Shelter? I won't
go to a shelter.

739
00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:24,301
You don't have to live there.

740
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:25,469
Just go there for the food.

741
00:32:25,493 --> 00:32:26,861
I can feed my kids.

742
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:28,475
Mrs. Larson, Your son's teeth

743
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:30,112
are rotting out of his mouth.

744
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:32,183
Get the food wherever
you can, okay?

745
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:33,708
Thank you, Lydia.

746
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:41,099
Kids starving to death
in downtown Chicago.

747
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:42,992
What? We got those X rays.

748
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,427
Neck film was fine.

749
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,900
So, we undid the backboard
and cervical restraint,

750
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,970
and we rolled her
over to check her back.

751
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:49,971
Yeah, and?

752
00:32:50,008 --> 00:32:51,786
Yeah, I think you
should see for yourself.

753
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,177
Mm-hmm.

754
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:54,414
Hey, honey.

755
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:56,952
Right over here.

756
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:59,589
Son of a bitch!

757
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,591
Doug!

758
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,262
Dr. Ross! Damn!

759
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:03,264
What is that?

760
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,666
Footprint.

761
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:08,808
Dr. Ross!

762
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:14,218
Thanks for coming.

763
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:16,188
Let me see your foot.

764
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:18,075
What? Hey!

765
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,110
Son of a bitch!

766
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:21,632
Doug!

767
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,936
Son of a...

768
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:25,985
Doug! Doug! Back off! Doug!

769
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:28,513
I'm all right!

770
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,050
I'm all right.

771
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:33,739
It's all right.

772
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:37,963
I'm all right.

773
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:09,591
Uh, I really screwed
up this time, huh?

774
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:13,063
Yeah, you did.

775
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,067
Is he going to press charges?

776
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:16,403
I doubt it.

777
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,641
I don't think he wants
his friends to know

778
00:34:18,676 --> 00:34:20,745
that he let a
pediatrician beat him up.

779
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,315
He's got other problems.

780
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,320
A couple of detectives
from Domestic Violence

781
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,925
talking to him in
the lounge right now.

782
00:34:27,961 --> 00:34:29,828
God, it's freezing out here!

783
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:32,334
I won't say I'm
sorry, 'cause I'm not.

784
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,003
Then don't.

785
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,339
So, what happens now?

786
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,811
I had to tell Morgenstern
what happened.

787
00:34:37,846 --> 00:34:38,858
What did he say?

788
00:34:38,882 --> 00:34:40,183
He wasn't very happy.

789
00:34:40,218 --> 00:34:43,322
I think you're looking
at ink blots, couch time...

790
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:45,626
probably Resident
Review Committee.

791
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:53,241
Your friend's still here.

792
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:55,043
What?

793
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,414
The brunette.

794
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:59,653
She's waiting for
you at Admitting.

795
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:04,662
I'm heading home.

796
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:06,277
Tell Rachel happy birthday.

797
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,935
It's her birthday, right?

798
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,874
Uh, yeah, I was supposed
to be there an hour ago.

799
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,555
Jennifer's going to kill me.

800
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:13,679
Tell her it's my fault.

801
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,049
I always do.

802
00:35:26,122 --> 00:35:29,125
Mr. Thornberg, you can't
smoke inside the hospital.

803
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,680
What are you going
to do, arrest me?

804
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:33,183
You could blow yourself up.

805
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:34,920
Well, it hasn't happened yet.

806
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,948
Mr. Thornberg, you
have lung cancer.

807
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:44,321
One more won't make
any difference now.

808
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,983
There, you see?

809
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:52,320
Now you don't have to arrest me.

810
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,729
BP's 110/70, pulse
108, resp 24, GCS. 15.

811
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,866
Defensive wounds on
hands and forearms.

812
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:10,104
He sounds stable. What
is he doing in Trauma?

813
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:13,020
Except for that knife sticking
out of his chest, yeah, he's fine.

814
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,523
He's had 15 liters
of oxygen by mask

815
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,531
and he's as high a kite,

816
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:16,611
so we had to restrain him.

817
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:18,202
All right. I think
it's in his heart.

818
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:21,693
Looky here... a swastika.

819
00:36:21,728 --> 00:36:24,481
I got a "Die, nigger, die" here.

820
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:27,854
How do you feel about Asians?

821
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:31,795
He took a crowbar to a
black kid on West Adams.

822
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,145
Another brother
jumped him with a knife.

823
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:37,306
Maybe somebody ought to
drive the knife all the way through.

824
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:39,544
All right, people,
let's do your damn job.

825
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:41,246
Get a CBC, type and cross-match

826
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:42,961
eight unit packed
cells, point eight narcan.

827
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:45,316
Check the glucose and get
a portable X ray down here.

828
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,974
And I mean now. Move.

829
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:56,476
Hey.

830
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:01,317
Are you all right?

831
00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:05,342
I'm fine. I, uh, hurt my
hand a little bit, but...

832
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:08,115
You wanted to
talk to me about...

833
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,684
It was about Jake,
but it can wait.

834
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,753
I'll come back tomorrow

835
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:12,690
if you promise not to
beat anyone else up.

836
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:14,928
That's not a daily event.

837
00:37:16,783 --> 00:37:19,770
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

838
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:27,462
Have someone
take a look at that.

839
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:28,768
It might be broken.

840
00:37:34,149 --> 00:37:35,734
Lydia,<i> como estas?</i>

841
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:37,716
<i>Muy bien.</i> I'm
going home, aren't I?

842
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:40,844
All right, Rolando, my man.

843
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:43,032
What's up, Jerry?

844
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:44,251
Easy day, huh,<i> esse?</i>

845
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:46,588
Yeah. When Benton
comes down from the O.R.,

846
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,828
let him know his sister's
been calling every five minutes

847
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:52,066
for, like, the last
two hours, will you?

848
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:54,181
Rolando, make sure
Mr. Thornberg in Two

849
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,350
gets moved upstairs.

850
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:57,120
Also, there's a
rule out M.I. in One

851
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:57,943
waiting on labs.

852
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,057
Can you call, please?

853
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:00,347
Ah... yeah.

854
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:01,427
Good night, all.

855
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:02,418
Good night. Night.

856
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:03,654
Who's on tonight?

857
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:04,656
Me and Benton.

858
00:38:04,691 --> 00:38:06,160
Good night, everybody.

859
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:07,528
Good night, Carol.

860
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:11,280
I don't think we lost
a single patient today.

861
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:12,337
No kidding. Really?

862
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:14,341
Benton's still got
that knife wound

863
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,476
up in the O.R.

864
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:16,623
Close enough.

865
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:17,714
Good night.

866
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:19,083
All right, Jerry.

867
00:38:20,488 --> 00:38:21,755
E.R.

868
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:22,891
Uh-huh.

869
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,505
The muscles of
the left ventricle

870
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:26,209
must be holding
the knife in place.

871
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:28,046
We'll begin with a
medium sternotomy

872
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,182
to expose the structures
around the knife.

873
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:31,986
Then we'll open
the pericardial sac

874
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,981
extract the knife,
tamponading the wound

875
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:36,127
with your finger

876
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:38,365
as you make horizontal
mattress sutures

877
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,135
to avoid the coronary arteries.

878
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,463
We'll be out of
there in no time.

879
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:45,668
Dr. Benton, your sister's

880
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:47,004
on line two.

881
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,224
I'll, uh, I'll have
to call her back.

882
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:51,929
You cut, I'll watch.

883
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:56,939
We don't accept children
over ten years old,

884
00:38:56,975 --> 00:38:58,893
so she'll have plenty
of kids to play with.

885
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:00,162
We're full right now,

886
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:02,466
so we put Tatiana
in the infant room.

887
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:04,770
We'll move her into
her own age group

888
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:06,674
as soon as there is an opening.

889
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:22,104
Hi, Tatiana.

890
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,308
<i>Tee</i> okay?

891
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:26,562
<i>Da.</i>

892
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,900
<i>Kak tebya zovut?</i>

893
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,152
Anna.

894
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:32,056
Oh, that's right.

895
00:39:32,092 --> 00:39:34,127
She's very pretty.

896
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,295
You speak Russian?

897
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,502
Oh, just a little.

898
00:39:38,538 --> 00:39:40,707
Just a little.

899
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:56,352
Oh!

900
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:02,241
Hey. Daddy.

901
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:04,501
Oh! Happy birthday.

902
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:06,038
Thanks. Bye.

903
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,808
Bye? Kiss first.

904
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,996
Thanks for getting
home in time to help.

905
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:20,131
I couldn't get away.

906
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,168
I'm sorry.

907
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:22,269
It's okay.

908
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:23,438
Craig helped.

909
00:40:23,473 --> 00:40:24,690
Craig?

910
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:27,829
You know, the other clerk.

911
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:36,596
So...

912
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:38,032
where is young Craig?

913
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,034
At the store.

914
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,548
We ran out of ice cream.

915
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,574
Rachel loved her gift.

916
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,478
What did we get her?

917
00:40:44,513 --> 00:40:46,114
Super NES.

918
00:40:46,149 --> 00:40:47,584
Thought we weren't
going to do that.

919
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:50,306
Well, she asked five times
a day for three months,

920
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:51,541
so I gave in.

921
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,426
So you found time.

922
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,463
Oh, that's from Susan Lewis.

923
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:05,534
Oh.

924
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:07,170
Don't start.

925
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,620
Judge Franklin asked me

926
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:17,624
to clerk for him
again next year.

927
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,628
And?

928
00:41:19,663 --> 00:41:20,847
I am going to do it.

929
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:26,191
No running in the house!

930
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:33,504
That's it?

931
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,674
You just decided?

932
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:38,214
Well, you made your
decision unilaterally.

933
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:39,850
Now I've made mine.

934
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:46,663
Did I miss It? Is
the party over?

935
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:48,199
About an hour ago.

936
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:50,537
Is she still up?

937
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,575
No.

938
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,179
She's asleep.

939
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,734
Jackie, I'm sorry.

940
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:01,920
I wanted to be here,

941
00:42:01,944 --> 00:42:04,814
but this man came into
the hospital with a knife...

942
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:07,051
Jackie, I'm
talking to... Jackie!

943
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:09,134
She's at that "not
talking" stage.

944
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:11,071
Now, trust me on this one, okay?

945
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,309
Why don't you just
finish cleaning up

946
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:16,102
give it a couple of
days, and I'll talk to her.

947
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:39,096
Got stuck in surgery, huh?

948
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:45,608
I couldn't be at my
mother's birthday party

949
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:49,349
because I had to save a
man with "Die, nigger, die"

950
00:42:49,385 --> 00:42:51,186
tattooed on his forearm.

951
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:04,228
That's my husband.

952
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,492
Good night.

953
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:37,876
Susan! Susan! Dr. Lewis!

954
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:39,211
Huh?

955
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:41,249
René is back.

956
00:43:45,174 --> 00:43:47,711
Pulse: 50. B.P.: 80/60.

957
00:43:47,746 --> 00:43:49,380
Respiration's 14.

958
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:51,050
René? René, what are you on?

959
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,620
Mr. Franks, what did she take?

960
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:54,156
What did she take, Mr. Franks?

961
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:55,559
I don't know. Pills, maybe.

962
00:43:55,595 --> 00:43:57,897
I heard a noise. I found
her in the bathroom.

963
00:43:57,932 --> 00:43:59,177
Where's her boyfriend?

964
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:00,267
I don't know.

965
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:02,506
All right, on
three, bring it up.

966
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,476
One, two, three.

967
00:44:04,512 --> 00:44:07,883
Repeat a tox screen, and BA.

968
00:44:07,918 --> 00:44:10,622
No gag. Let's intubate.

969
00:44:10,657 --> 00:44:14,228
René, we haven't
lost anyone today.

970
00:44:14,263 --> 00:44:17,200
We are not starting with you.

971
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:20,807
Prep for lavage.

972
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:32,062
René, you are not going
to die tonight, you hear me?

973
00:44:32,097 --> 00:44:33,230
Not tonight.

974
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:34,466
Get the charcoal.

975
00:45:06,395 --> 00:45:10,402
