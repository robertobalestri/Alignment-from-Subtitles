1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,369
<i>- Previously on</i> -
Where'd she go?

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,635
- Kisangani.
- How long will she be gone?

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,518
A couple weeks.

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,609
Everyone thinks I'm
better-suited for the lab.

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,830
Yeah, well, God forbid
you disappoint them.

6
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,238
Mom, guess what. Dad's here.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,046
- I failed my boards.
- What?

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,245
You're gonna be with Yuri and
me. Looking at effects of ketamine...

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,481
on cerebral ischemia
and tissue damage.

10
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,602
- What's happening to her?
- She's gonna be okay.

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:28,027
- Give the medicine a chance.
- That wasn't a real seizure.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,165
- The EEG doesn't lie.
- I'm Abby Lockhart from Psychiatry.

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,823
- I don't need a shrink.
- Now I'm fighting to keep my son.

14
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,206
The judge also said early July's
looking good for a court date.

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,279
- July?
- I'm trying to make it sooner.

16
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,540
Now, about the
exchange this afternoon.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,149
- I need another day.
- Kerry.

18
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,683
Get me another day.

19
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,720
Until the court determines
a permanent arrangement...

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,516
you get two weekends a month...

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,216
- It's not enough.
- At the discretion of the Lopezes.

22
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,295
I get to see my son at their
discretion. Does that make sense?

23
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,988
The worst thing would be
to violate the judge's order...

24
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,226
just as we're about to
go into a custody hearing.

25
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,333
Mrs. Lopez will pick
him up here at noon.

26
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,975
- This isn't right.
- No, it isn't.

27
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,239
But you'll get him
back in two weeks.

28
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,176
Until then, you have to
find a way to live with it.

29
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,149
Okay?

30
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,851
<i>Welcome to Chicago.</i>

31
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,184
<i>Please do not leave any personal
belongings unattended at any time.</i>

32
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,485
<i>Thank you and enjoy your stay.</i>

33
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,423
Daddy! Daddy!

34
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,860
John?

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,943
What if Watson had
listened? Where would we be?

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,584
No double helix,
no genome theory.

37
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:02,120
The other way around, I
believe. Watson was a skeptic.

38
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,383
- She's right.
- Just get another ELISA cooking.

39
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,221
I've got one here. Is
this the right antibody?

40
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,724
- What are you doing?
- Starting over a new setup.

41
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,059
Just what we need, another
med student with OCD.

42
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,203
We've checked all the reagents
and run this how many times.

43
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,633
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen times.

44
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,397
Eighteen's my lucky number.

45
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:23,066
Why are you using a human anti-XIAP
antibody with a murine substrate?

46
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,975
Your protocol says to use anti-MXIAP,
but this Eppendorf says anti-H.

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,379
- You sure this is the right reagent?
- Do you have a boyfriend?

48
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,986
- What's that?
- Mnemonics. I'm studying for the boards.

49
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,693
You haven't taken them yet?

50
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,090
I liked them, so I
figured I'd do it again.

51
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,556
Always go with TB.

52
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,159
If TB's an answer
option, it's usually right.

53
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,596
Looks like they're
ready for you in there.

54
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,134
Morning, dear.

55
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,903
Good morning.

56
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,236
Okay, Stanley's here.

57
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,277
- George is here.
- Hey, hey, who is he?

58
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,312
- We met last week.
- I don't remember.

59
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,109
I sat right there.

60
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,512
We don't remember you.

61
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,620
George was referred by the
ER. He has a problem with...

62
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,654
- Exhibitionism.
- Let's see it.

63
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,125
- I was over-sexualized at a young age.
- Join the club.

64
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,320
I also have manic tendencies.

65
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,956
Where's Larry?

66
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,802
Hello? Larry Jacobsen? Sad
guy, talks about death a lot.

67
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,334
- It ain't just talk.
- What?

68
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,603
He killed himself.

69
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,208
He took a bunch of pills,
drank a bottle of gin...

70
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,645
slit his wrists and jumped
into Lake Michigan.

71
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,115
Larry really wanted to be dead.

72
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,453
Oh.

73
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,520
Man. Uh, I...

74
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,488
Don't worry, dear. You're
really very good at this.

75
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,494
- Yeah. Everybody loves your sessions.
- Yeah.

76
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,689
Everybody except Larry.

77
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,887
No, coach is fine.

78
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,786
Uh... I'm traveling with a baby.

79
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,054
Do you have a row with
an empty middle seat?

80
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,028
Do I need to book
that right now?

81
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,067
Okay. Just hold on.

82
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,606
Elizabeth.

83
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,403
I hope I didn't catch you at a bad
time. I kept getting the machine.

84
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,137
Uh, I forgot to
check the messages.

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,245
I have Ella's baby things.

86
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,150
Come in.

87
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,149
I took out all
the girlie clothes.

88
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:26,158
Um, there are some
bibs, hats, pants, bootees.

89
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,760
My parents went mad for
bootees after Ella was born.

90
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,263
Oh, this is one of
my personal favorites.

91
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,935
Are you going somewhere?

92
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,763
I have a friend in Seattle.

93
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,429
It's a cardiologist that
I met in med school...

94
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,666
and she's just
dying to meet Henry.

95
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,275
Wow.

96
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,344
You need a passport
to fly to Seattle now?

97
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,448
Yeah, I lost my license.

98
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,442
Thank you for
dropping these off.

99
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,450
Are you all right?

100
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,818
I'm fine.

101
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:02,122
Well, how long will you be
gone? When will you be back?

102
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,127
I'm not sure.

103
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:10,270
Kerry, don't do anything
that you might regret later.

104
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,498
Thanks for the clothes.

105
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,637
What were you doing walking
down Michigan Avenue with a sword?

106
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,804
There were no buses.

107
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,041
Okay, I was more
interested in the sword part.

108
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,618
The enemy is coming,
but I will overwhelm him.

109
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,778
- When he's...
- What happened with the blood?

110
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,151
- Ask him.
- Attack like the sea.

111
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:35,318
- What happened with the blood?
- I was practicing for the battle <i>royale.</i>

112
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,488
- On yourself?
- No, my guinea pig.

113
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,793
His name was Cookie.

114
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,664
Thank you for clearing that up.

115
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,636
- I'd recommend taking him upstairs.
- Gee, you think?

116
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,037
- Thanks for coming. CHEN:
Twenty-nine-year-old woman...

117
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,906
- with tonic-clonic activity.
- This isn't the first time.

118
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,479
- Pulse ox, 98.
- Gave her two of Ativan en route.

119
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,844
- Did she hit her head?
- No, nothing like that.

120
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,384
- Another two of Ativan...
- Wait. Hold it. Hold it.

121
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,655
- She doesn't need Ativan.
- Abby, she's in status.

122
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,656
- Did we see you last time?
- I tried to talk to your wife, Mr...?

123
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,191
- Dunn.
- Dunn.

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,989
Haleh, take them to
Trauma 1. We'll be right there.

125
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,430
- She's having factitious seizures.
- Come again?

126
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,365
She came in the same way last
week and the EEG was negative.

127
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,869
- She's faking?
- No. It's a conversion disorder.

128
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,031
- Was she hospitalized?
- No, they took off.

129
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,200
- Can I try the husband?
- We'll up the oxygen, run some saline.

130
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,875
- BP's 120 palp.
- Shh. It's okay, Caroline.

131
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,539
No tongue biting
or incontinence.

132
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:33,778
All right. Let's up the O2 to five
liters and run in 500 cc's of saline.

133
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,387
- Saline?
- Let's see if it helps.

134
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,503
Is this the first seizure
since last week?

135
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:37,751
No.

136
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,417
She's been having three or four a
day. They usually stop, but not this time.

137
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,393
- Pupils equal and reactive.
- Mr. Dunn, can we speak outside?

138
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,398
Jordan. Jordan, squeeze my hand.

139
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,697
It's stopping. Is she okay now?

140
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,600
- For now, yeah.
- She needs a neurologist.

141
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,106
Your wife's condition is not neurological.
She's having pseudo-seizures.

142
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,541
We've been through
this. Did that look fake?

143
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,615
I'm not saying that. But last time Jordan
was here, she had a normal CT and EEG.

144
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,082
- Are you a psychiatrist or an ER doc?
- I'm a med student, actually.

145
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,778
- Could I talk to a real live doctor?
- Of course you can.

146
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,289
But any doctor's gonna tell you
the same thing I'm telling you.

147
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,257
If you want your
wife to get better...

148
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,022
she's gonna need to be
hospitalized in the Psych Ward.

149
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,666
- Abby, do you have a minute?
- Sure.

150
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,336
- Hi. Dr. Nelson, please.
- Have you spoken with Kerry lately?

151
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,345
Uh-uh. She was in this
morning pretty quickly.

152
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,676
I'm concerned, and frankly, I don't
know who else to talk to about it.

153
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,946
Is something wrong? Hi, uh, could
you ask him to come down to the ER?

154
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,249
Lockhart. I'm admitting
a patient. Thanks.

155
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,119
She seems extremely distressed.

156
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,958
- Well, she's in mourning.
- I know...

157
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,121
but I'm worried she's
thinking of running off with him.

158
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,626
Henry?

159
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,859
- Maybe you should call her.
- Me?

160
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,263
I tried talking to her,
couldn't get through.

161
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,101
Well, I'm sympathetic, but
maybe we should ask someone...

162
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,642
- who's, you know, a closer friend.
- Right.

163
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,709
Like who?

164
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,477
- Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,144
- How you doing?
- Good. How's Alex?

166
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,449
He wants to know if you
got that plasma screen.

167
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,184
- No, not yet.
- Sorry I haven't called...

168
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,694
but I've just been, you know,
trying to figure stuff out with Steve.

169
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,525
Sure.

170
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,190
I don't think he's gonna
be staying too much longer.

171
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:35,832
We're not together, you know, me
and Steve. He sleeps on the couch.

172
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,870
There's a woman in
1 admitted for seizing.

173
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,676
Could you let me know if
her husband's looking for me?

174
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,348
- See you later?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,022
- How's it going?
- Never better.

176
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,432
Oh, my God. What did you do?

177
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:06,072
Oh, not much, some
painting, redid the paneling.

178
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:10,904
I hung up those art-deco light fixtures
that you liked from Marshall Fields.

179
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,409
Wait till you see the nursery.

180
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,416
Did you operate the
screwdriver yourself, Mr. Fix-It?

181
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:22,283
Oh, hey, I'm a nesting
father-to-be. I'll go to any lengths.

182
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,116
So this is our home.

183
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,352
I wasn't sure if you
were coming in or not.

184
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,121
Neither was I.

185
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,529
Henry's grandmother is
coming to pick him up. I just...

186
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,363
Um...

187
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,734
Why don't you wait here, and I'll
come and get you when she shows up.

188
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,102
No, you have
your Psych rotation.

189
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:46,303
Yeah, but I'm waiting on my supervisor,
so I'm gonna be down here for a while.

190
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,246
I'm not sure I can do this.

191
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,985
Kerry, I know this part sucks,
but he's gonna end up with you.

192
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,415
You're saying
I'm not really sick?

193
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,785
No, what we're saying...

194
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,395
is we believe the cause of your
illness may be psychological.

195
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,054
I've never had trouble.
I've never been to a shrink.

196
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,893
That's what I told her.

197
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,969
- If you continue to have seizures...
- I don't wanna go to the Psych Ward.

198
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,265
- I'm not crazy.
- No one's saying that.

199
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,766
But you'll be safe up there
until we can figure this thing out.

200
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,844
And then after that...

201
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,243
you can go wherever you
need to go to get healthy.

202
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,185
Look, you can go home and
risk injuring yourself or your baby...

203
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,792
or you can come upstairs.

204
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,868
Okay.

205
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,742
I'll be back to take you up.

206
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,448
Perception of a psychiatrist,
bedside manner of an ER doc...

207
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,551
empathetic eyes of
an overworked nurse.

208
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,812
I'm the whole package. All I have
to do is actually pass my boards.

209
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,389
- Are you Abby?
- Yeah. I'll be right up.

210
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,492
Are you going to get
my grandson for me?

211
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,323
- Yes, I'll tell Dr. Weaver you're here.
- No, they asked me to look for you.

212
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,796
- I thought Kerry's trying to avoid us.
- No, she's expecting you.

213
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,835
- Well, then shall we follow you?
- Can you just wait right here?

214
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,528
- Why, is there a problem?
- No.

215
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,265
- We're here on time.
- She'll be right out.

216
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,991
- Is she here? Where is Henry?
- I asked you to wait outside.

217
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,325
- And I asked, where is she?
- You're going to have to wait outside.

218
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,432
If that baby's not
in our custody...

219
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,001
Weaver will be in breach of
a court-ordered agreement.

220
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,764
- Jerry, where's Weaver?
- I haven't seen her.

221
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,237
Why are you telling me this?

222
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,844
If you're doing anything to help
her, I'll come back here with an officer.

223
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,502
Shut up.

224
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,394
That's my boy. That's my boy.

225
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,028
Kerry.

226
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,235
He likes to be
held up to the sky.

227
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,969
That's my baby.

228
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,574
- What is that?
- Whoo.

229
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,576
It's from the ER. I
was hoping for a puppy.

230
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,579
- But I don't see any air holes.
- It's big.

231
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,148
And heavy.

232
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,910
Uh-oh.

233
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,419
- No. It's not.
- It's another crib.

234
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,054
- Hey, are we having twins?
- You saw the sonogram.

235
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,926
All right. I gotta get going.

236
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,756
- Where?
- I got a board meeting.

237
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,261
- Oh.
- I told you.

238
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,797
Yeah, right. Here, let me.

239
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,167
Oh, my God, John.
We're having a boy.

240
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,898
Yeah. I think you
mentioned that.

241
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:38,509
What is this? What? You
having a little prenatal jitters?

242
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,440
Well, you don't think
that maybe we...?

243
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,845
- What?
- We rushed into this.

244
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,384
Of course we did. But
we didn't overanalyze it.

245
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,920
We didn't reexamine
it. We didn't overthink it.

246
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,024
We just did it
because it felt right.

247
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,961
This is a life that
we're responsible for.

248
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,624
- You and me.
- We're ready.

249
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,459
Are you ready?

250
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,296
Hey, you wanna come with
me, see the house one last time?

251
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,530
- I don't think I need that.
- You can see me ruffle a few feathers.

252
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,801
- I don't think I need that either.
- You could meet my father.

253
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,968
Your father?

254
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:17,046
Jordan, Nick, this is Ken Sung.
He's the social worker I told you about.

255
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,479
Another expert.

256
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,281
He's here to talk to you about
how things were going at home.

257
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,914
- I understand you had a baby recently.
- Caroline.

258
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,621
That can be a hard transition.
How have you been getting along?

259
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,231
I've answered
that about 20 times.

260
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,061
We're good. Uh, I'm
self-employed right now...

261
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,965
so I'm home to help with
the diapers and everything.

262
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,663
I think he would
nurse her if he could.

263
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,507
Any financial stress?

264
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,342
We hired a nanny, but that's
getting a little too expensive.

265
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,744
Our neighbor Frances
gives us a hand.

266
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,246
Jordan, are you concerned about
your ability to look after Caroline?

267
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,980
What do you think?

268
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,593
As long as I'm sick, I can't
hold her. I can't take care of her.

269
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,027
- So you do wanna get better?
- What kind of question is that?

270
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,464
Sometimes patients get
sick, and they feel safer...

271
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,868
or more protected in
a hospital environment.

272
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,202
No, no, no. She
wants to get better.

273
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,037
Yeah. It's all I think about.

274
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,914
You're just another person
who thinks I'm faking, aren't you?

275
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,416
That's what you all think.

276
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,481
- It's not true.
- Then how come you can't fix it?

277
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,156
She can be treated as an outpatient,
but that's where things get dicey.

278
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,661
If she doesn't get better,
I have to file a report.

279
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,392
- You're gonna make everything worse.
- There's a potential danger to the baby.

280
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,127
What if she has a seizure
while carrying it down stairs?

281
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,865
- She's not a child abuser.
- My job is to protect the baby.

282
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,032
Is that how you'd approach
it if she had epilepsy?

283
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,178
If she wasn't compliant
with the treatment.

284
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:56,578
Okay. What if I could get her condition
under control before she leaves?

285
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,985
- She stops having seizures?
- Yeah. Then there's no more danger.

286
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,519
And nothing for
me to worry about.

287
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,056
Kem, this is my father.

288
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,257
- Hello.
- My pleasure.

289
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:18,427
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- Well, yes. Me too.

290
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,096
Well, we'd better get
in there, John. Here.

291
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,209
Hello, everyone. This is Makemba
Likasu. She's going to be sitting in.

292
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,415
Makemba.

293
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,588
I apologize. I don't
know all of your names.

294
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:42,854
And introductions
would take all day, so...

295
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,123
First item on the agenda.

296
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,264
Northwestern has agreed to take
over the management of the property...

297
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,064
for use as an institute of
advanced health studies.

298
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,539
You're selling Mother's house?

299
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,541
Donating it.

300
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,575
It will serve as a
conference center...

301
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,236
for various public health
issues and housing...

302
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,317
for visiting scholars and
experts on foundation fellowships.

303
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,416
I don't understand.

304
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,147
Which part?

305
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,421
This foundation was expressly
created by your grandfather...

306
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,619
to support arts and
cultural institutions.

307
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,390
And that's what we've been
doing for almost 50 years.

308
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,328
Well, time for a change, then.

309
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:25,263
You're going to unilaterally overturn
the legacy your grandparents left behind?

310
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,878
I'm not overturning anything.

311
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,498
I'm simply redirecting some
resources into other worthy causes.

312
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,939
What gives you the right?

313
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,273
My grandmother's
will gives me the right.

314
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,673
But if you don't believe
in what I'm doing here...

315
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,182
maybe it's time
you stepped aside.

316
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,621
Next.

317
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,187
Millicent dies, you run off
halfway around the world.

318
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,797
Disappear for months...

319
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,263
only to come back like
some sort of avenging angel...

320
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,198
- with a pregnant African girl in tow.
- Her name is Kem.

321
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,634
You back using drugs?

322
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,103
Hey, I made lunch.

323
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,945
- Thank you, but I have to be going.
- Oh, Dad, stay a while. Come on.

324
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,878
Thanks. I can't.

325
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,610
She left the money to me.
She left the house to me.

326
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,982
She trusted me to
make the right decisions.

327
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,523
I doubt she'd agree that's
what you're doing now.

328
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,656
Pleasure meeting you.

329
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,289
I look forward to getting
the wedding announcement.

330
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,801
Are you glad I came?

331
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,303
It really smoothed out
those rough edges, huh?

332
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,073
Soda machine stole my money.
- Sorry, George.

333
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,807
What are you gonna do about it?

334
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,181
Hello, I'm here to see the Dunns.
I'm their neighbor, Frances Burkett.

335
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,915
Hi. They're in Jordan's room.
It's right through here on the left.

336
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,093
Can you believe a dollar
for a soda and then no soda?

337
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,059
Do we have to keep having
the same conversation, George?

338
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,859
Kirkland is all set in 2. Young's getting
his IV meds in the Treatment Room.

339
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,025
Do you have a hammer?

340
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,262
- Why don't you watch TV for a while.
- I don't wanna watch TV.

341
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,772
- In one hour of TV...
- Mr. Dunn is in with Jordan?

342
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,443
Yeah, and the neighbor
brought the baby by for a visit.

343
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,652
- How's the studying going?
- Microcytic anemias.

344
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,719
Dr. Nelson.

345
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,622
- Please, we need some help in here!
- Oh, my God.

346
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,822
Come here. Oh, no, no,
no. I got you. I got you.

347
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,759
- That's it. I'm signing her out.
- Calm down.

348
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,963
I want you to call different doctors.
I want a neurologist right now.

349
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,470
- No!
- Your frustration...

350
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,234
could be exacerbating
the seizure. Wait in the hall.

351
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,402
It's okay, Jordan.

352
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,549
Jordan, it's okay.

353
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,283
When was her last one?

354
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,922
Two days ago, also
while he was visiting.

355
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,426
Looking for a stressor,
maybe he's right over there.

356
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,893
Yeah. She was fine
yesterday when he was here.

357
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,191
So, what's the difference
between now and then?

358
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,636
The baby.

359
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,706
We need to get her talking
about her past, her childhood.

360
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,320
Why won't it stop?

361
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,215
I just want it to stop.

362
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,499
I was doing some patties
and started to space out.

363
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,226
Got my feet tangled
up and started to slip.

364
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,497
Caught myself by putting
my hands on the grill.

365
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,765
- At home?
- No, I work at a burger joint.

366
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,910
Dr. Pratt's on the way.
Does he need an IV?

367
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,137
Just 50 of Benadryl, 6 of I.M.
morphine and Thermazine dressings.

368
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,909
- If you patch me up I can finish my shift.
- I don't think that's gonna happen.

369
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,416
- I need that job.
- All right, what do we got?

370
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,748
Elgin Gibbs, 17, burned
his hands on a grill.

371
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,686
- Elgin, what's popping?
- What's up, doc?

372
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,326
- No bullae or charred areas.
- Nothing circumferential.

373
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,086
- That good?
- You're golden.

374
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,593
Dr. Pratt.

375
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,299
Whoa. If your BP were
your IQ, you'd be a genius.

376
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,095
- Too high?
- Pulse is normal, it can't be from pain.

377
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,762
And you're too young to have high
blood pressure, E. So, what's the deal?

378
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,431
I don't know.

379
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:25,601
You using something?
Meth, coke, ephedrine?

380
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,440
No way.

381
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,181
There's no cops. I'm just
trying to get you fixed up.

382
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,783
I don't do that stuff.

383
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,546
Okay. We'll be right back.

384
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,483
Add a tox screen. I bet
you it comes back positive.

385
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,561
I've gotta run to the lab. I
shouldn't be more than 20 minutes.

386
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,628
- What?
- I've got mouse brain defatting...

387
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,826
in ethanol that have to be removed
in three hours for cresyl violet staining.

388
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,528
We've got a sick kid here.
Those mice are already dead.

389
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,641
- Experiments are time-sensitive.
- Hey, are you an ER doc or not?

390
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:59,142
Last time I checked, but
you're not the first one to ask.

391
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,177
Oh, sorry.

392
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,377
Are you off?

393
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,983
Are you on?

394
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,919
- I've been meaning to call you.
- Yeah, me too.

395
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,586
- I'll try you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

396
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,724
You should deal with
your slides and go home.

397
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,924
I'm working in the ER.

398
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,659
Then get back down there fast.

399
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:28,171
Yuri, say something.

400
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,334
Three minutes, total silence.

401
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:36,177
Maybe I need to up the dose. Talk to
me, man. You're always so nonverbal.

402
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,249
Colin, is he okay?

403
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,908
He's more than okay.

404
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,179
- Where did you get that monitor?
- Dog lab.

405
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,880
Dude, she should leave.

406
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:48,027
- It's okay. It's all good.
- It's not all good. What's going on?

407
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,295
It's a supplemental
study we're working on.

408
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,522
Ketamine has a lot of
potential applications.

409
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:56,132
Like for getting high.
I've heard of that.

410
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:56,863
No. No.

411
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:01,736
We're psychonauts,
astronauts of the mind.

412
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,366
We're explorers. Ketamine disrupts
downstream GABAergic connections...

413
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,480
gives us access to places we
don't normally have access to.

414
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,548
It leads to hallucinations
and dysphoria.

415
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:13,618
We control the dose. One of
us stays sober to record vitals...

416
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,982
observational data,
subjective experiences.

417
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,556
The unconscious
is the final frontier.

418
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:23,128
- So it gets under the external inhibitors.
- Yep, that's right. No more ego overlay.

419
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,396
The real you.

420
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,057
The real me?

421
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,227
- Can I trust you?
- Of course you can.

422
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,236
I'm scared.

423
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,369
What if I don't get better, if I
can never hold my baby again?

424
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:44,114
Jordan, I know this is difficult, but you
just have to try very hard. You have to...

425
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:48,687
I told you I am trying. You keep pushing.
I don't know what you want from me.

426
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,378
Well...

427
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,317
Okay, at some level,
we're all the same.

428
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,429
We all have things we
hide, things we keep buried.

429
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,264
- Like what? What do you keep buried?
- This is not about me.

430
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:05,427
You want me to tell you things, to trust
you, but you don't have to say anything?

431
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,937
Is that fair?

432
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,600
Don't you trust me?

433
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,979
Okay.

434
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,322
I can't follow through.

435
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,960
On what?

436
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,462
On anything.

437
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,865
Once something gets in my
way, it's like a chemical reaction.

438
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,007
I just shut down and I give up.

439
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,672
I'm just looking for an excuse
to stop because in the end...

440
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:51,545
it's easier to do that than to risk
being hurt or disappointed again.

441
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,083
You mean with men?

442
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,814
Men...

443
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,521
my career, my family.

444
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,392
Pick your poison.

445
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,702
So that's me.

446
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:18,335
Well, your family must be proud
that you're becoming a doctor.

447
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,001
Yeah.

448
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,227
Okay. Well, that's
enough for today.

449
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:47,567
- Well, you don't have to go.
- Well, we can talk some more tomorrow.

450
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,772
I...

451
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,082
I had a baby eight years ago.

452
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,883
His name was Charlie.

453
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,783
You have another child?

454
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,655
I did before I met Nick.

455
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,058
Uh...

456
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:17,567
When Charlie was 2 months
old, he stopped breathing.

457
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,103
I'm sorry.

458
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,238
The paramedics came and
worked on him, and the ER doctors...

459
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,347
but they couldn't do anything.

460
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,409
He died the same night.

461
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,951
What caused it?

462
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,589
They said it was SIDS.

463
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,588
Why didn't you
mention this before?

464
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,455
- I don't know.
- Don't you see the relevance?

465
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:51,468
No. That was just a terrible thing
that happened a long time ago.

466
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,766
- I love you, Neela.
- Yes, I know.

467
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,878
- You rock.
- Yes, I do.

468
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,104
You're curious,
aren't you? I can tell.

469
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,774
I prefer to leave the real me buried
under my inhibitors for the time being.

470
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:10,013
You're the coolest med student
we've had up here all year.

471
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,291
Uh. Tachycardia.
Mild side effect.

472
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,951
- It'll resolve soon.
- Don't.

473
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,722
188.

474
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,651
He should've normalized
by now. Do you feel all right?

475
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,965
Um, heart's pumping
a bit, but I'm okay.

476
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,232
- P-waves. Do you see any P-waves?
- P-waves?

477
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,137
Narrow complex. Lie down.

478
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,335
- Why?
- Get on the floor.

479
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:36,812
Hey, baby. Don't skip
all the foreplay now.

480
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,883
- He's fine.
- He's in SVT.

481
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,815
- What?
- Supraventricular tachycardia.

482
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,148
- Do you have any chest pains, dizziness?
- No.

483
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,847
Any medical conditions?

484
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,492
WPW, but it's no biggie.

485
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,651
It's just a short circuit
through my heart.

486
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,990
- You idiot! COLIN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

487
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:55,157
- You're making a big deal out of nothing.
- His BP's 95/60.

488
00:28:55,334 --> 00:29:00,170
No response to carotid sinus massage.
Okay, we're going to the ER. Bear down.

489
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,432
You were gonna be 20 minutes.
- I was.

490
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,021
That was an hour ago. - I know.

491
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,841
Take the bleeder. We're jammed
up and I need to push charts.

492
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:10,039
- We need the monitored bed.
- What's with the IV and the monitor?

493
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,013
It's not working.
I can still feel it.

494
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,516
Somebody tell me
what's going on.

495
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,711
He's in SVT. Won't
break vagal maneuvers.

496
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,879
- Need a bed.
- We were gonna keep this quiet.

497
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,582
- Who is he? Who are you?
- It started up in the lab.

498
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,694
- History of WPW.
- Up in the lab.

499
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,023
Yeah. We have special
projects on the side.

500
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,598
You boys doing experiments
on human subjects now?

501
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,696
- It's really starting to hurt.
- 90/55. Adenosine?

502
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,205
- What's that do?
- Blocks the AV node.

503
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,240
Can lead to V-fib if there's
anterograde conduction.

504
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,707
Six of adenosine going in.
- Jam in the flush.

505
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,373
Still SVT. Go again.

506
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,108
Double the dose.
I got the paddles.

507
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,618
- You gonna shock him?
- Hopefully not. Charge to 50.

508
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,415
Twelve mgs.

509
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,886
Mother of God!

510
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,329
- Did his heart stop?
- Just a glitch in his conduction system.

511
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:09,341
- Normal sinus. Feel better?
- Yeah.

512
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:10,908
I think.

513
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:19,412
Tox screen back on Elgin
Gibbs, burned-hand kid in 2.

514
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,918
Okay, thanks. Get him
registered and start a chart.

515
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,819
- Exam 4 is open.
- He doesn't need a chart or anything.

516
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,587
- We'll just get out of your way.
- You could revert back to SVT any time.

517
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,657
- Neela...
- You didn't say anything...

518
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,162
about registering.

519
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,437
Let me guess. Whatever you geeks
were doing up there was strictly illegal.

520
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,095
No, it's legitimate
science. Word.

521
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:45,142
- Did you just say "word" to me?
- Well, it wasn't exactly authorized.

522
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,212
We're saving lives and
you're playing Jekyll and Hyde.

523
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,147
- You wanna tell me what it was?
- Just... We don't wanna get kicked out.

524
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,882
Forget it. Just hang
down here for 20 minutes...

525
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,285
then get back to wiring
electrodes to your nuts for all I care.

526
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,684
- Thanks, man.
- Sorry about all this.

527
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,230
Hey, what's up, E?

528
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,866
- What's up, doc?
- How you doing?

529
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,003
- About the same.
- Well, we got some good news.

530
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,832
- Your tox screen came back negative.
- I told you it would.

531
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,634
Yeah, you did. I'm gonna
give you something for the pain.

532
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,972
Just take one if you can't sleep.
Otherwise, stick with the Tylenol...

533
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:23,081
and leave that dressing alone
till you come back for a check.

534
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,977
Dr. Pratt, do you have a minute?

535
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,085
- Maybe in a minute I might.
- Hey.

536
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,481
- Hello again.
- Elgin.

537
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,756
- Right.
- Why don't you recheck his BP.

538
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,653
You think I could
go back to work?

539
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,158
Not for a few days. Somebody
coming to pick you up?

540
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:39,093
Probably my mom, but most
likely she'll bring along the kids.

541
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,233
- Oh, you got brothers and sisters?
- Four of them. I'm the oldest.

542
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,838
My mother works graveyard so she
can be with the little ones in the day...

543
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,734
and I work nights
to do what I can.

544
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,841
- What about your pops?
- Never met him.

545
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,570
- So your siblings, their fathers...
- You know how it is, two fathers.

546
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,681
- Either one of them help out?
- C.C. used to, but he went away...

547
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,010
and I never met the other guy.

548
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,016
BP's still high, 162/94.

549
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,691
Well, at least
you're consistent, E.

550
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,554
Maybe it's just white coat fever.
- What's that?

551
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,691
Fear of doctors. I even get
it myself from time to time.

552
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,857
- We'll recheck it when you come back.
- All right, doc.

553
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,631
You ever seen hypertension
in a kid that age?

554
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,719
What do you care? You've
got mice to impregnate.

555
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,712
- Have I done something wrong?
- You tell me.

556
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,438
Gallant's in a war zone and
you're playing Madame Curie.

557
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,709
I never asked Michael to
cover for me, and I feel terrible.

558
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,648
Oh, yeah? I think
he feels worse.

559
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,652
Look, I don't think it's right
for you to hold me responsible.

560
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,757
Look, my friend took
a hit and he's gone.

561
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,223
But you're running around...

562
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,726
doing everything under
the sun except ER medicine.

563
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,261
Now, if that's how it's
gonna be, then fine.

564
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,061
But hurry up and decide.
You're taking up space.

565
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,213
Pudding and tea. Yum.

566
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,850
I don't like that
tapioca they give us.

567
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:10,318
Well, I'll put a special request in.
From now on, nothing but chocolate.

568
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:22,327
- I'd like to talk some more about Charlie.
- Come on. I told you what happened.

569
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,333
But you didn't tell
me how you felt...

570
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,202
- how you reacted to losing him.
- How would you react?

571
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,342
I think I would need
to talk to somebody.

572
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,508
Did you get any counseling?

573
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,045
I didn't need someone
to tell me how to cry.

574
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,250
If you can't talk,
you won't get past it.

575
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,317
I'm already past it.

576
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,756
Well, the mind is very complicated, and
I think yours is playing a trick on you.

577
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,228
That I'm sick because of something
that happened eight years ago?

578
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,392
I think there's a lot more going
on in there than you realize.

579
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,272
And there is a
medication I can give you...

580
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:06,434
that can help us learn more about
what you're feeling and thinking.

581
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,375
You mean bourbon?

582
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,342
It's called Amytal. It's
given intravenously.

583
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,385
It makes you kind of
sleepy, but it opens you up.

584
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,753
Once you reach that drowsy
state, I'd ask you questions...

585
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,089
and we'll see if we can learn
something we don't already know.

586
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,787
Would you be willing to do that?

587
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,301
How long has he been in there?

588
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,480
About half an hour.

589
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,774
Do you have an extra P-20?

590
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,579
Yuri's this close to
his Ph.D., you know.

591
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,318
He's author on a paper
coming out in <i>Stroke</i> next month.

592
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,290
Maybe he'll just
get reprimanded.

593
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,654
- Maybe.
- Maybe this'll teach you to cut that out.

594
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,290
- Shut up, man.
- It's a laboratory, not a playground.

595
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,663
He's an idiot.
He doesn't get it.

596
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,141
The NMDA receptor is
the key to understanding...

597
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,607
the neuropsychiatric filters that
separate us from our unconscious.

598
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,076
- I didn't say anything.
- It's cutting-edge stuff.

599
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,477
I don't think anyone
downstairs did either.

600
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:20,175
I like you guys. I really do.

601
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,811
I like working up here.

602
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:26,348
It's weird, but in some ways
I'm much more comfortable here.

603
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,460
Social Work is talking about placing
restrictions on her access to the baby...

604
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,461
and her insurance
coverage runs out.

605
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,328
- Sorry. I can't do it.
- Conventional therapy with Jordan...

606
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,366
could take months.
Sodium amobarbital...

607
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,299
is a way to jump-start
the process...

608
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,838
try to get to the core
issue of her reaction.

609
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:45,774
I'm glad to see you're prepared for
the boards, but this isn't the standard.

610
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:49,039
- It's not a cure.
- Like getting a girl when she's plastered.

611
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:52,946
That's an interesting analogy. Maybe
we could talk about that another time.

612
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,883
Plenty of mothers of SIDS
babies don't have a disorder.

613
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:59,615
Exactly. There's gotta be something
more going on that she can't access.

614
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,228
- Which is why we should use the drug.
- It's hocus-pocus.

615
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:07,389
Abby, even if it works, it could destroy
the therapeutic bond you've established.

616
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,330
- She wants to do it.
- Did you tell her it's not safe...

617
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,994
that there are risks if
the dose is not correct?

618
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,970
She knows, and we'll have
an anesthesiologist there.

619
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,739
No. I'm not signing off. You
have to find another way.

620
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,675
I kind of already did.

621
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,838
- Dr. Henriksen approved it.
- Henriksen?

622
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,746
What is he, 80 years old?
He'd sign off on a lobotomy.

623
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,411
He was also in the Army where
he saw Amytal used successfully...

624
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,558
a number of times in severe
cases of combat stress reaction.

625
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:36,217
Is it better to let them
take her kid away?

626
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:42,064
Another 25 q. five to 10 minutes.
How are you feeling, Jordan?

627
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,435
Like I'm floating.

628
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,333
What do you wanna talk about?

629
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,440
How'd you meet Nick?

630
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,448
I couldn't find a
token for the El...

631
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,778
and he offered me one
if I gave him my number.

632
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:05,187
So as this gets going,
she may say things...

633
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,222
which will surprise
you or upset you.

634
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,588
It won't hurt her, will it?

635
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,457
We won't let that happen.

636
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,656
Two years.

637
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,601
He's a great guy. He is.

638
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,672
- How about you? Ever been married?
- I'm divorced.

639
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,239
- Kids?
- No.

640
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,308
And what about you? You
just have the one, right?

641
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,779
Yeah, Caroline.

642
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,182
Charlie's gone.

643
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,580
That must've been hard.

644
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,892
The doctors, the paramedics...

645
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:51,895
they kept saying it wasn't
my fault. It wasn't my fault.

646
00:37:57,342 --> 00:38:00,335
Jordan, can you tell
me about the moment...

647
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:04,210
you realized there was
something wrong with Charlie?

648
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,314
Jordan?

649
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,250
Is she breathing?

650
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,519
Jordan, you all right?

651
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,193
- Do we have to stop?
- It's okay.

652
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,953
Okay.

653
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:19,354
I was holding him.

654
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,858
Tell me what happened.

655
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,799
Jake worked all
night at the bar...

656
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,169
and we had a fight that morning.

657
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,382
And he said that I
couldn't do anything right...

658
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,884
that I was a lousy lay.

659
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,749
I couldn't cook.

660
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:49,020
I couldn't keep the baby quiet.

661
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,997
Did Jake hurt you?

662
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,534
He hit me.

663
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,774
He hit me a lot.

664
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,046
And what about that morning?

665
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,976
He was asleep in the bedroom.

666
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,681
And the baby started crying.

667
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,824
And I was scared what
Jake would do if he woke up.

668
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,163
So...

669
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,598
Were you trying to
keep the baby quiet?

670
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,806
He kept crying.

671
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:44,679
I bounced him. I held him. I gave
him my breast, but he kept crying.

672
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,810
And then Jake...

673
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,122
Jake started yelling...

674
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:58,692
and throwing things, and he said he
was gonna come out and kill us both.

675
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:05,035
And so I held Charlie tight.

676
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:08,401
He was wrapped in a blanket
and I held him tight for a long time.

677
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:14,479
I just kept saying, "Shh, baby,
shh, you gotta be quiet now."

678
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,214
Until he fell asleep.

679
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:25,847
I thought he was asleep. I
thought he was just sleeping.

680
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,486
It's okay, Jordan.
You were afraid.

681
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,231
But I held him.

682
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:41,369
I held him too tight.

683
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,979
And you're afraid you're
gonna do that again?

684
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,660
<i>Hey, we're not in right now...</i>

685
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,864
<i>but leave a message for Kerry,
Sandy or Henry after the beep.</i>

686
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,537
<i>Kerry, it's Elizabeth.</i>

687
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,375
<i>Uh, you haven't
been in to work...</i>

688
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:26,450
<i>and I wanted to run the
monthly morbidity stats.</i>

689
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,644
<i>Oh, damn.</i>

690
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,853
<i>Kerry, how are you?</i>

691
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,891
<i>Look, I know
how dreadful it is...</i>

692
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:42,557
<i>when someone
you love isn't there.</i>

693
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:49,197
<i>So if there's anything I
can do, anything at all...</i>

694
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:53,368
<i>please, please call me.</i>

695
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,449
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

696
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:06,247
I hope this is gonna work
out, Abby. I think it will.

697
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,858
What do you mean? The
seizures are gonna stop.

698
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,256
That's not what I meant.

699
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,488
She's responsible for the death
of a child. I can't just ignore it.

700
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,758
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute. You... You said...

701
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:19,369
If she posed no further potential
harm, there'd be nothing to file.

702
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,200
But I can't in good
conscience say that right now.

703
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,271
She was a battered woman, Ken.

704
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:29,779
It's not gonna happen
again. She's a good mother.

705
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:35,113
I'll monitor the family, I'll keep CPS
apprised, and we'll see how it goes.

706
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,725
How's the husband?

707
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,534
It's a shock to him,
but I think he's relieved.

708
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:54,700
What you did was good medicine.

709
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:59,604
It might've been better
if I just left it alone.

710
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:03,305
It was a tough situation, but you
got to the truth. That's always good.

711
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:07,042
Well, too bad the
truth is so messed up.

712
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,077
You know, the cafeteria's
still open if you're hungry.

713
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,452
I could drill you on developmental
milestones, that kind of stuff.

714
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,650
The boards are laced with it.

715
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,559
- Too late.
- Too late?

716
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,165
- Why?
- Gotta go.

717
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,069
Lockhart, Abby.

718
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,500
Candidate identification number.

719
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:31,074
Keep it with you at all
times during the examination.

720
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,143
You must enter your
CID in order to begin.

721
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:37,305
Once you start a test block, you may not
take a break until the block is completed.
