1
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,817
Oh, look. Here
they are. Fantastic.

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,212
Hey. CORDAY: Hi.

3
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,413
Good morning, Ella.

4
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,560
- Hi.
- Happy birthday, Sydney.

5
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,390
- You ready for your party?
- She's been ready for a month.

6
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:33,330
We're going to the aquarium, and
then we're having a puppy party.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,264
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.
- I put her present in Ella's backpack.

8
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,872
- Thanks.
- You're awful brave taking this on alone.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,034
- Hey, you're welcome to come with us.
- Yeah, Mommy. Come with us, please?

10
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,203
Oh, Ella. I have to
work in the hospital.

11
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,614
I'd come if I could, but I have to
do a pancreaticojejunostomy at 9.

12
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,613
- No problem.
- I'll come another time. I promise.

13
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,189
- You have fun at the party.
- Okay.

14
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,291
Thanks, Dave. I'll
pick her up around 6.

15
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,758
- They'll be into their sugar rush by then.
- Marvelous.

16
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,420
All right, girls. Love you.

17
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,031
- Bye.
- Bye.

18
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,100
Do you think I could talk to the
Infectious Disease department?

19
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,568
It would be great to compare adherence
statistics for HIV patients in Chicago.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,298
- I could arrange that.
- And it would be helpful...

21
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,602
if I could spend time
in your clinical lab.

22
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,042
Though the chances of
us getting one are remote...

23
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,478
I'd love to take a look at the
current-generation flow cytometer.

24
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,710
Hand-counting lymphocytes under a
microscope is the best I can do now.

25
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,411
I gotta check with Dr. Weaver.

26
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,819
- Frank, have you seen Dr. Weaver?
- Try the lounge.

27
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,548
Be right back.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,558
Breakfast pirogi?

29
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:41,129
His dedication to the staff
and patients will be hard to...

30
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,328
- Kerry. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
- You didn't.

31
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,769
- Have you seen Dr. Lewis?
- No. I just got on.

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,239
Would you mind if
Kem observed today?

33
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,672
Yeah.

34
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,104
She has her Master's
degree in public health.

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,839
That's no reason to punish her.

36
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,075
Give the poor woman a credit
card, Carter. Let her have some fun.

37
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,653
I tried that. She would like to
speak to the Public Health nurses...

38
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,688
see how we track
communicable diseases.

39
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,349
Sure. Maybe she can
motivate some of these slackers.

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,926
- Frank, where's Lewis?
- Got me.

41
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:11,862
Okay, I want everybody in
the lobby at 9 for the dedication.

42
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,260
What dedication?

43
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,926
They're renaming the
hospital Romano Memorial.

44
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,801
- Not kidding.
- Where's Kem?

45
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,513
Do the patients with sexually transmitted
infections get routine HIV testing?

46
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,547
Sometimes. Depends
on the doctor.

47
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,880
- Do you refer them to your STI clinic?
- I don't think we have one.

48
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,885
- You talked to Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah. She said everything's fine.

49
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,526
- Kem's gonna be hanging out today.
- Why?

50
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,222
Morning, folks.

51
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,887
Ride-along? GALLANT: Yep.

52
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,067
Interns have to do paramedic
ride-alongs twice a year.

53
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,533
- Lets them see real medicine.
- Yeah, right.

54
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,537
You might want a couple
steroids before lifting this one, doc.

55
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,971
31-year-old male, fell
down a flight of stairs...

56
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,407
complains of back and
diffuse abdominal pain.

57
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,410
Frank, did any labs come
back on the Gorham kid?

58
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,849
- Frank? You all right?
- I think I'm having a heart attack.

59
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,214
- Are you kidding?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

60
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,483
Okay, here. Here, sit down. Sit
down. I need some nitro over here.

61
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,929
Oh.

62
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,928
That feels a lot better.

63
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,432
You know, I bet it was just
those breakfast pirogis. Thanks.

64
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,164
- Hey, check you out, Mr. <i>GQ.</i>
- What, you have a deportation hearing?

65
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,568
Have another pirogi, Frank.

66
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,607
Luka, could use a
set of hands here.

67
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,506
- I'm not on.
- Just for the transfer.

68
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,011
- Where's Dr. Lewis? ABBY:
Did you check the on-call room?

69
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,843
- She was sleeping.
- Are you kidding?

70
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,008
She didn't feel well.
Do you need something?

71
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,211
Yeah. I need someone
to run the department.

72
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,549
- Can't help you there.
- Hey, Susan.

73
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,954
The Medical Executive
Committee has authorized...

74
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,718
a nationwide search to look
for Romano's replacement.

75
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,228
Until we can find a suitable
candidate, we'd like you to step in.

76
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,563
Oh. Kerry, thank you for the
vote of confidence, but, um, I, uh...

77
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,295
I'll pass. I'm going home.

78
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,805
- It's an extra 3 grand a month.
- Do med students qualify?

79
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,206
I'm sorry, but I'm just not interested.
- Why not?

80
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,972
Um, I'm pregnant.

81
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,716
Cleanup on aisle five.

82
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,039
I'll phone upstairs as
soon as I'm done here.

83
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,204
Please let me sit up. I
can't catch my breath.

84
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,043
You got too much
weight on your chest.

85
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,878
We need to get an
x-ray of your neck.

86
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,818
- No, you don't.
- Yeah. We can use the NEXUS criteria.

87
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,050
If he's alert and sober without
any focal neural deficits...

88
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,924
distracting injury or neck pain, then
he's low risk for a C-spine fracture.

89
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,826
- Any pain in here, sir?
- No.

90
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,127
- What are you doing here today?
- I'm giving a lecture to students...

91
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,739
on clinical decision-making
without the use of ancillary tests.

92
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,170
Look towards me.
Now look at Dr. Kovac.

93
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,003
- Any pain there?
- No.

94
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,736
- That's cool.
- Our health-care system requires us...

95
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:49,576
- to diagnose with a minimum of tests.
- Maybe Kem can sit in on your lecture.

96
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,344
She's doing a little recon
in the hospital today.

97
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,652
- I never taught in a classroom.
- Oh, you're a natural.

98
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,757
Okay, his neck's
clear. Let's sit him up.

99
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,756
Ready? One, two, three, go.

100
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,494
HemoCue's 12.8.
Trauma labs drawn.

101
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,357
This is exactly what I'm talking
about. All he needs is a CBC and UA.

102
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,368
Abdominal pain meets trauma
guidelines. I'm sending a panel.

103
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,632
There's no rebound or guarding.
He doesn't need LFTs, amylase.

104
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,777
- Doesn't need to be typed and crossed.
- Nurses follow protocols.

105
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,605
- They're unnecessary.
- You know what?

106
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:22,146
Save the lectures for your med
students. The nurses don't want to hear it.

107
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,686
Weaver says to get your
butts in the lobby pronto.

108
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,952
Dr. Robert Romano was a
fixture in this hospital for years.

109
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,654
His dedication to the staff and
patients will be hard to forget.

110
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,299
And his generosity
continues even now.

111
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,560
- Hey, how you doing?
- Very good, thank you.

112
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,330
A significant portion of Dr. Romano's
estate was left to this hospital...

113
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,134
to further our service
of this community.

114
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:52,575
And to that end, I am pleased
to announce the creation of...

115
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:58,175
the Robert Romano Center
for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual...

116
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,718
and Transgendered Healthcare.

117
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,016
This new facility will provide
the latest in health services...

118
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,091
to those patients
and their families.

119
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,319
- She didn't.
- Oh, yes, she did.

120
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:11,863
All right, that's it. Back to work.
Pratt, you missed your appointment...

121
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,501
- with Bob Harris in Risk Management.
- I was busy.

122
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,161
I got you another appointment
in 30 minutes. Don't be late.

123
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,837
Is it just me, or do the
eyes seem to follow you?

124
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,671
Was Romano's prosthetic
arm destroyed in the accident?

125
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,403
- Why?
- Because if it wasn't...

126
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,413
it's gonna hunt Dr. Weaver
down and strangle her.

127
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,347
- He wasn't a big supporter of gay rights?
- Uh, no. Not really.

128
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,351
That's too creepy.

129
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,354
Did I miss the dedication?

130
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,016
More like post-mortem payback.

131
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,021
Oh, my God.

132
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,195
All right, looks clear to
me. What do you think?

133
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,736
I think we should
discuss it over dinner.

134
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,104
- Really?
- You like Moroccan?

135
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,573
I'll eat just about anything.
- Pratt!

136
00:07:56,743 --> 00:08:00,202
Approximately 20-year-old male,
feet versus tree at 30 miles per hour.

137
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,474
Was he thrown from a
car? This thing is frozen.

138
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,142
His buddies wrapped him up, tied him
to a toboggan and sent him down a hill.

139
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,720
He bounced off the tree
and wound up in a creek.

140
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,052
I can palpate a decent carotid,
but we can't get his arm out for a BP.

141
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,423
- It looks like bilateral foot fracture.
- We may have a spinal injury.

142
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,996
- Maybe we should get Carter.
- What's wrong with you?

143
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,462
Come find me later.

144
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,296
Get 10 liters of warm irrigation
solution so we can throw off this blanket.

145
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,168
And let's cut off this tape so
we can do a proper assessment.

146
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,072
I hate this time of year.

147
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,975
We must get 30 slip-and-fall
calls a week. Right, Bardelli?

148
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,581
- At least.
- Here's an idea.

149
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,914
If it's icy, and you're old, don't go
outside. Save yourself a broken hip.

150
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,113
I told you what would
happen if you didn't listen.

151
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,121
You call 911 for paramedics?

152
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,089
- Feel like a threat?
- Screw you!

153
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,819
Hello? Someone hurt in there?

154
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,191
Stop it! You're
hurting me. Stop!

155
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,094
I'll call the police.

156
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,761
Hold on. What are we
doing? We need to get in.

157
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,598
- Not till the police get here.
- What if he's hurting her?

158
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,300
We wait for the cops. EMT got
shot last year going in without backup.

159
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,103
- Open the door!
- Leave me alone!

160
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,644
Just shut up! Just
shut up for five minutes!

161
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,780
You enter two pages of demographics
for every patient that walks in?

162
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,045
- Yes.
- What do you do with the information?

163
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,212
That's really up to the
Public Health geeks.

164
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,621
Do you use it to track down patients
who leave without being seen?

165
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,455
You have to ask one of the docs.

166
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,995
So how many people leave
without seeing a doctor?

167
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,497
Look, lady, I just work here.

168
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,295
What kind of training
do you need for this job?

169
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,740
Dr. Weaver, do you know how many
patients leave without medical attention?

170
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,171
How about calling off
this grand inquisition?

171
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,642
- Somewhere around 5 percent.
- Some of us are trying to work here.

172
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,147
Hi. Uh, I just got off the
phone with Dr. Farina.

173
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,650
Someone's gonna phone me back
about letting you take a tour of the lab.

174
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,016
- That's great.
- You wanna catch Luka's lecture?

175
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,216
- I'll just have you paged.
- Luka didn't seem too keen on the idea.

176
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,226
- He's shy. He'll appreciate the interest.
- Kerry...

177
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,661
are we truly to believe that
Robert left a substantial donation...

178
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,028
to establish a gay
and lesbian center?

179
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,670
Gay, lesbian, bisexual
and transgendered.

180
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,169
Whatever the hell that means.

181
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,172
The actual designation was
left to the discretion of the board.

182
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,607
This is the one area where we
felt that County was truly lacking.

183
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,338
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.

184
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,613
Morales, the police
are here, man. Come on.

185
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,778
Just relax, man.

186
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,392
Listen, there's a woman inside.
It sounds like she's being killed.

187
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,257
This is the police
department. Open the door.

188
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,627
- Get out of here!
- This is my apartment!

189
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,927
- Back up.
- Back up.

190
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,501
Stop!

191
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,701
Sit down, sir! Sit down!

192
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,865
- She tripped.
- Ma'am, are you okay?

193
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,873
- He pushed me.
- She's drunk. She tripped.

194
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,877
- Sit down now, sir! WOMAN:
You're the drunk, you liar.

195
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,743
- You better take a look at her.
- I'm gonna kill you. Bitch.

196
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,076
- Quiet down.
- I swear to God I'll kill you.

197
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,712
- Enough of that.
- It's all your fault.

198
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:59,482
Patients with peripheral vertigo
do not require CT scanning.

199
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,391
What clinical test
will diagnose BPPV?

200
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,395
Anyone?

201
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,062
Sheila?

202
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,568
- Could you repeat that last part?
- Come on, guys.

203
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,469
Positional test for vertigo.

204
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,574
Rectal temp is 87.6.

205
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,082
- I think he's coming around.
- What's your name?

206
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,152
- Doug.
- You want to tell me what happened?

207
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,618
Talk to me.

208
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,188
Hockey initiation.

209
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,086
- I'm cold. PRATT:
We're working on that.

210
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,124
Pleural lavage with
bilateral chest tubes?

211
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,526
- No, let's do external rewarming.
- He's groggy and under 89 degrees.

212
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,496
- That's criteria for active rewarming.
- He's progressing.

213
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,262
Get a warming blanket,
heated IV fluids, and heated 02.

214
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,270
- What happened to him?
- Doug's friends took him sledding...

215
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:50,137
and he wound up swimming. Temp,
87.6. We're using passive rewarming.

216
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,939
- Rest of the vitals?
- BP is good, 112/78.

217
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,377
Pulse, 106. Sinus
tach on the monitor.

218
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,177
- Films? PRATT: Bilateral
calcaneal fractures.

219
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:02,311
And a compression fracture of
L5. Doug, can you wiggle your toes?

220
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,154
Can you wiggle your toes, Doug?

221
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,054
Let's get an MRI to rule
out spinal-cord injury.

222
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,323
No. Lumbar compression fractures
almost never have cord involvement.

223
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,728
- He can't move his toes.
- It's from the frostbite.

224
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,359
Try some warm-water immersion.
Yeah. DTRs are 2 plus and equal.

225
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,369
- How's the rectal temp?
- Pretty normal.

226
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:23,032
Good. Sacral nerves are intact.
S2, 3, 4 keeps the poop off the floor.

227
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,974
- Sensory loss in his toes.
- The distribution of a dermatome.

228
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,206
Warm up the toes
and reassess. No MRI.

229
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,977
- I can't feel my toes.
- We're warming them up, Doug.

230
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,055
No, I can't feel anything.
What's happening?

231
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,651
You broke both your
heels and a vertebrae.

232
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,162
- What, my back's broken?
- It's a compression fracture.

233
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,857
- Your legs took most of the impact.
- So am I paralyzed?

234
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,162
- We're still waiting.
- No, am I paralyzed? Just tell me.

235
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,835
- Get the MRI. DOUG:
Look, can you call my dad?

236
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,671
- Can somebody call my dad?
- But Dr. Carter said...

237
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,506
Just do it.

238
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,339
Dr. Pratt, you're a
hard man to track down.

239
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,882
Bob Harris. I'm with the
Risk Management department.

240
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,452
- I can't talk now.
- I realize you're busy.

241
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,089
I need you to write up your
recollections of a case...

242
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,124
regarding an MVA patient,
Martin Brodie. He suffered from...

243
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,786
Ankylosing spondylitis. The disease
turned the guy's neck into a breadstick.

244
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,195
Were the injuries from the car
accident exacerbated by his condition?

245
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,733
He came in having trouble
breathing. I tried to help.

246
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,066
- And there were complications.
- Look, I snapped the guy's neck.

247
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,571
Now he's a quadriplegic.

248
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,710
The insurance settlement on
this one is gonna be in the millions.

249
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:35,212
Do you have any idea how much 24/7
nursing care in a state facility costs?

250
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,215
Martin Brodie's a 19-year-old
boy looking at what?

251
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,877
Forty, 50 more years
of total paralysis.

252
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,951
Have your notes
on my desk by 9 a.m.

253
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,627
See you, bitch.

254
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,822
- Pupils equal and reactive.
- I hope he rots in jail.

255
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:56,299
Pulse, 105. BP, 118/82 with
decent sats around 94 percent.

256
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,495
Smells like her blood
alcohol's the same.

257
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:02,574
From what I can tell, these lacerations
are superficial and both her lungs are up.

258
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,472
Is there any chest
pain? Belly pain?

259
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,409
- Hey, Amy, stay with us.
- Where did he go?

260
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,175
- He's been arrested.
- Listen, she's gonna need a head CT.

261
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,344
Keep her on the monitor, stand by
with a tube in case she starts to go south.

262
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,691
Wait. Do you hear something?
Sounds like a kid crying.

263
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,026
Wait! Wait, wait! It's
just a kid. It's just a kid.

264
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,829
Drop the gun, son.

265
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,661
I thought you were my dad.

266
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,979
With a normal neurologic exam
and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15...

267
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:44,948
you do not need a head CT, and
you save $2000 in health-care costs.

268
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:49,021
We do about 10
unnecessary scans a day.

269
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,486
Dr. Kovac.

270
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,489
The costs to procure and
maintain the CT scanner...

271
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,993
are relatively
fixed, am I right?

272
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,656
- Yeah.
- So if you eliminated half the scans...

273
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,997
wouldn't that then double the
costs of the tests you did do?

274
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,969
I mean, there'd be no real
savings in health-care dollars...

275
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,666
and the patient would
be billed twice as much.

276
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,907
Wouldn't the real solution be...

277
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,311
to have several hospitals
share one scanner?

278
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,247
Did you send Mrs.
Wintermute to Radiology?

279
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,185
- No. I sent her home.
- What about her abdominal pain?

280
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,716
It was more
discomfort than pain.

281
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,885
Her husband's been off work
with a workers' comp claim.

282
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,893
Her son moved home
with his daughter...

283
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,864
- while going through a divorce.
- What, you get her whole family history?

284
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,596
Half the people that come in
here just wanna talk to somebody.

285
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,296
How's your son doing?

286
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,075
Fine. He hasn't given himself a
thoracotomy. That's good news.

287
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,577
- He'll probably end up a brain surgeon.
- Yeah. Or a grave robber.

288
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,581
You're a glass-half-full
kind of guy, huh?

289
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,379
- Hey, how's the teaching going?
- Ask Kem.

290
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,954
She seems to be
doing most of the talking.

291
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,217
- Yeah. She can be a little inquisitive.
- Yeah.

292
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,826
I'll talk to her.

293
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,726
Don't these patients
have primary-care doctors?

294
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,695
There's a three-month
wait to be seen at the clinic.

295
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,635
Hello, Mrs. Lemonier. I'm Neela.

296
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,972
I don't speak good English.

297
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,371
Can you tell me what's
wrong? Why you're here?

298
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,746
- My children are sick.
- You don't sound very well yourself.

299
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,254
She's from Haiti.

300
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,059
Do you recognize that?

301
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,255
- Pneumonitis?
- It sounds like pertussis.

302
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,798
- Whooping cough, really?
- Hey, there you are.

303
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:44,927
John, I think this woman
has pertussis. Is that possible?

304
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,800
Yeah. We get the odd case.

305
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,407
- In Chicago?
- Mm-hm.

306
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,736
- How's the lecture going?
- Interesting.

307
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,173
Luka's an excellent teacher.

308
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,146
I should get back, but I
think Neela needs a translator.

309
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,580
I think we can
probably manage that.

310
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,244
Dr. Farina is ready to give you a tour
of the Infectious Disease department.

311
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,323
- What about the lecture?
- I think he'll understand.

312
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,120
Hey, Neela, can you
take Kem up to five west?

313
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,627
- Certainly.
- If you see Luka, tell him I'm sorry...

314
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,698
- I missed the rest of his lecture.
- Find me when you're done.

315
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,528
Check out that woman.

316
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,630
Is that the domestic? - Yeah.

317
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,295
Superficial lacs, maybe a
broken arm. We got a kid too.

318
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,772
He almost shot
Gallant's head off.

319
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,543
So how are you liking Chicago?

320
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,807
It's very nice.

321
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,546
- How long have you been here?
- I've been in America for seven years.

322
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,951
Chicago for the last three.

323
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,648
Do you like it?

324
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,256
I still feel like I'm
getting settled in, but

325
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,626
it's quite pleasant
for a big city, really.

326
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,028
- Although it's not quite London.
- No.

327
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,293
Or Paris.

328
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,499
No.

329
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,663
It's much more
agreeable in the summer.

330
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,331
- A tad warmer too.
- That is good to know.

331
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,673
- And the people are friendly enough.
- Yeah.

332
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,838
They're larger than I
expected, the people.

333
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,183
Yeah. They're quite fond
of their giant portions here.

334
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,913
Big Gulp, supersize,
monster fries, all that.

335
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,389
I saw a woman drinking a
bucket of coffee this morning.

336
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,321
Actually, that's quite common.

337
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,027
- Is this a Med-Surg admit?
- Yep.

338
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:23,101
- Let's run in a gram of Ancef too.
- No. I just wanna go home.

339
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,534
Okay. I'll see what we can do.

340
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,674
How are we doing over here?

341
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,268
That's okay, Rudy. Dr. Carter's
one of the good guys.

342
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,537
He's gonna help out
you and your mom.

343
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,841
- Physically, he's fine.
- How are you?

344
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,881
My ears are still
ringing, but I'm cool.

345
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,214
- Did you call DCFS?
- Yeah.

346
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:45,722
Okay. Rudy, I'll be back in a little bit to
check in on you and your mom, okay?

347
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:50,863
Vitals Q 30 minutes and CBC in an hour
and set up a suture set with 4-0 nylon.

348
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,522
- Thanks. CARTER:
Doug, how are you feeling?

349
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,429
Better. Warmer. CARTER: Good.

350
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,866
Where is he coming from? - MRI.

351
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,802
- I said he didn't need that.
- Pratt thought otherwise.

352
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,572
Look, it's not my job to make
sure your residents listen to you.

353
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,747
I'm getting tired of doctors
thinking that we work for them...

354
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,545
- or that they can tell us what to do.
- The patients think it works that way.

355
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,416
- I'm staying out of this conversation.
- What's with Kovac...

356
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,616
and his holier-than-thou healing
hand? I'm getting sick of that.

357
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:23,320
Oh, I don't know. Those healing hands
have their good points. Right, Abby?

358
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,832
- Did you go out with Kovac?
- Briefly, yeah.

359
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,559
- And Carter?
- Yep.

360
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,466
- Abby's the ER slut.
- I went out with two doctors...

361
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,607
in the five years
that I've worked here.

362
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,107
Hey, Abby. Are we
still on for tonight?

363
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,938
- Yeah.
- Great.

364
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,109
We're studying.

365
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,945
And you shouldn't talk, Chuny.

366
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,620
Kovac gets around.

367
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,823
Our goal is to get all of our
triple-combination-therapy patients...

368
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,795
to an undetectable viral load.

369
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,662
I'd be ecstatic just to be
able to follow CD4 counts.

370
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,794
Would it be possible for
me to visit the AIDS ward?

371
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,462
It would if we had one.

372
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,542
Fifteen years ago we had an
entire floor of AIDS patients.

373
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,374
Now the few inpatients we care for
are on the general medical service.

374
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,140
We had a gentleman earlier
in the week with Kaposi's...

375
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,114
but he was discharged yesterday.

376
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,151
It is so different
from what I deal with.

377
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,949
I see thousands of deaths
from opportunistic infections.

378
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:27,218
Well, you're welcome to
observe in the outpatient clinic.

379
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,231
- These are your AIDS patients?
- Mm-hm.

380
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,996
Breath sounds diminished
on the left, I think.

381
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,696
He has a scar over his fifth rib.
- From a chest tube.

382
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,207
That's right. Some quack
stuck one in me last year.

383
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,073
You're not gonna do that, are you?
- Not if we can help it.

384
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,738
Did you send the human
toboggan for an MRI?

385
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,180
- I was trying...
- I told you it was unnecessary.

386
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,412
The guy started freaking out.
He was worried about paralysis.

387
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,852
- And you...?
- I was trying to be thorough.

388
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,585
So was I. Next time you disagree with
my orders, come and talk to me about it.

389
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,059
- Okay?
- Okay.

390
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,221
You ready to present this?

391
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,660
Neela.

392
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,030
Mr. Morgan is 64. He has
Wegener's granulomatosis...

393
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,569
which is an inflammation
of the respiratory tract.

394
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,537
- Vitals are in the normal range.
- He's only satting at 92?

395
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,701
- He's not taking any deep breaths.
- Because it hurts like hell.

396
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,905
- I told you that already.
- Sounds like pleural effusion.

397
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,112
- Yeah. He needs to do a thoracentesis.
- I've already paged Pulmonology.

398
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,720
That's good. As long as
Mr. Morgan doesn't mind...

399
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,857
gasping for air until
sometime tomorrow.

400
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,959
Tomorrow? I could
be dead by then.

401
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,964
He's had a number of bronchoscopies.
They put his lung down last year...

402
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,727
doing a thoracentesis and
had to put in a chest tube.

403
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,899
He'll be better off
if they do it upstairs.

404
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:46,372
He will?

405
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,565
- Yeah.
- Or you will?

406
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,233
You send a guy for an
MRI he doesn't need...

407
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,402
because you're
worried about paralysis.

408
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,275
Now you don't
want a thoracentesis.

409
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,973
- So?
- So sounds to me...

410
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,779
like you're still a little
gun-shy from, kkk...

411
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,649
breaking that kid's neck.

412
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,087
The man has tons of
scar tissue around his lung.

413
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,592
Besides, a thoracentesis down here
only opens him up for a risk of infection.

414
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,253
Okay.

415
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:16,464
I'll do it. Neela, would you set
me up for a thoracentesis, please?

416
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:21,904
Betadine the chest. Load up a
syringe with 1 percent of lido. I got this.

417
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,976
- I really don't mind doing it.
- I said, I got this.

418
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,472
Mr. Morgan. We're gonna sit
you up and drain some of the fluid...

419
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,447
- out of your lungs so you can breathe.
- It's about time.

420
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,520
- Does this guy know what he's doing?
- You are in good hands.

421
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,452
- Yeah.
- And I'll be back in a little bit.

422
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:51,131
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Hey, you back already?

423
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,772
- You should come and see this patient.
- Okay.

424
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,703
How did it go with Dr. Farina?

425
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,141
He was very nice and generous
with his time and his data.

426
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,804
But I'm still 10 years away
from the results he's getting.

427
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,386
Are you finished with
Mr. Yarrow? Leg lac in 2?

428
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,650
Yeah, he's good. Just
wash out the wound...

429
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,294
give him a tetanus
shot, 8 of morphine.

430
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,487
- Anything else?
- That should do it.

431
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,030
- Have you ever heard of Echo Free?
- Let me guess.

432
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,361
Something that Kovac
does instead of pain meds.

433
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,231
No. It's a club on LaSalle.
My friend deejays there.

434
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,500
A bunch of us are going tonight if you
don't mind hanging around with nurses.

435
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:33,043
I don't think I'd be much good
tonight. I'm having a bad day.

436
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,181
All the more reason
to go out with us.

437
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,680
Nurses make people
feel better all the time.

438
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,718
- Hey, Pratt. Pick up line six.
- Hey, take a message.

439
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,685
It's Dr. Chen. She's calling
from Shoo Goo... Kin Doo...

440
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,518
- Okay.
- Somewhere in China.

441
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,683
I have to take this.

442
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,024
Hey, what's up?

443
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,730
What? When?

444
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,360
- What room is Mr. Yardley in?
- I'm sorry.

445
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,904
Listen, it's not your fault,
Jing-Mei. You know that.

446
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,837
A pulseless foot?
You paged a surgeon?

447
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,443
You just stay focused on
getting your father better.

448
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,909
Dr. Lawson came and got him.

449
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,241
- No, no. I was talking to somebody else.
- Who?

450
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,385
The radiologist took him down
for an angiogram and wound up...

451
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,612
giving him angioplasty and
putting in a stint. He's good.

452
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,255
- Yeah, I know.
- That's wonderful.

453
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:20,120
Someone could have called
to tell me I didn't need to come.

454
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:23,262
Dr. Pratt, Mr. Morgan's
dropped his pressure, 86/66.

455
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,631
All right, look, I've gotta take
this. Here, talk to Dr. Chen.

456
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,767
Her mother just died.

457
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,035
All right.

458
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:39,406
Let's get Bordetella PCR,
pertussis serologies and a culture.

459
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,836
- Did you get all that?
- She has another kid?

460
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,473
Eighteen-month-old. He's
at home with her sick mother.

461
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,609
Well, they both need to come
in. They're both probably infected.

462
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:14,110
The grandmother won't come.
She doesn't trust American doctors.

463
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,113
That's a problem. Can't treat
them unless they come in.

464
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,343
- What if we go there?
- This is America.

465
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,987
We don't make house calls.

466
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,423
Don't.

467
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,923
What?

468
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,890
You know what.

469
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,091
I'm not leaving the hospital. Do
you see how many patients I have?

470
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,899
Okay, I mean it. Stop it.

471
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:45,303
Gallant, I need you guys
to make a run for me.

472
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,845
I'd like to stick around with Rudy
here. Just until DCFS shows up.

473
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:53,008
- After that, then.
- Carter! Pratt needs you in Exam 3.

474
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,020
- Sats, 78.
- It's a tension pneumo.

475
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,818
- Sixteen-gauge Angiocath and Betadine.
- He's not breathing.

476
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,460
- Should I bag him?
- It'll make the pneumo worse.

477
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,358
- Open a chest-tube tray. Size 8.5 gloves.
- Heart rate's dropping.

478
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,364
- Do you want a crash cart?
- All right, slow down. ABCs.

479
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,331
- I know what the problem is.
- Treat it.

480
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,730
No pulse.

481
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,666
- He's not breathing.
- Okay, bag him.

482
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,740
I knew this was gonna happen.
I wanted Pulmonology to do it.

483
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,910
It takes a minute for
the lung to re-expand.

484
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,672
- Chest tube is definitive.
- Pressure's 94/62. Coming up.

485
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,542
- Ten blade. SAM:
He's waking up.

486
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,309
- Let's run in the fluids.
- I've got a femoral pulse.

487
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:28,318
- Curved Kelly.
- Pressure's up. Sats, 82 and rising.

488
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:30,046
Twenty-eight French.

489
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,556
- Here, you want to sew this?
- Sure.

490
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,053
- Uh, where you going?
- This guy's good. I've got other patients.

491
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,098
- Uh, Dr. Pratt.
- I'll be back.

492
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,543
- Hey, have you seen Pratt?
- Nope.

493
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,948
- What about Kem?
- I haven't seen her either.

494
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,785
Maybe they're together. You need to
keep better track of your woman, Carter.

495
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,497
- Hey, Chuny. Have you seen Pratt?
- Sorry.

496
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,360
- We have rules too, you know.
- What are you talking about?

497
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:18,163
- What the hell's going on?
- The paramedics needed a translator.

498
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,806
- You took her with you?
- She's persuasive.

499
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,805
- She's febrile.
- She's also diabetic.

500
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,672
Weak pulse and was already
pretty out of it when we found her.

501
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,849
She was still talking
when we found her.

502
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,216
- I can't believe you would go out there.
- Temp, 40.2. Accu-Chek, 252.

503
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:40,382
A full set of labs. Pertussis PCR
and culture and blood culture.

504
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,154
- Sounds good. How long's she had that?
- Several months.

505
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,059
- Several months.
- She said people in the building are sick.

506
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,167
You exposed yourself to them?
Has she been coughing up anything?

507
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,893
Ectopy. CARTER: Ma'am?

508
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,895
Run in a liter wide open.
Get a 12-lead on her.

509
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,563
BP's dropping, 92/56.

510
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,710
Okay. She's septic
and hypotensive.

511
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,210
Let's mix up some dopamine,
titrate to a systolic of 90...

512
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,751
- 3.375 of Zosyn and 150 of gent.
- Pertussis is not a risk to my pregnancy.

513
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,219
- It could be TB.
- What am I exposed to back home?

514
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:14,622
Why don't you go ask Mrs. Lemonier if
her mother has any advance directives?

515
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:19,891
- You sure you two aren't married?
- Need a portable x-ray. Get him in! Pratt!

516
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,557
- I need another set of hands.
- I got a nasty head lac.

517
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,566
Get a med student to do it.

518
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,403
You need to sit down and
roll up your sleeve, Louie.

519
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,415
If you don't take your Epo
shot, you're gonna get sick again.

520
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:41,452
Do you want to end up in the
hosp...? Hey, hey. Help! Security!

521
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,613
Hey, Louie. Put her down,
or I'm gonna call your mother.

522
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,589
- Now say you're sorry.
- Sorry. Sorry.

523
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,923
- She didn't give me any gum.
- Well, that's no reason to pick her up.

524
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,964
Here. Sit down
and behave yourself.

525
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,397
- You okay?
- Yeah.

526
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,938
Louie's a lifter. He likes to
pick things up, including nurses.

527
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,838
You have to give
him gum before a shot.

528
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,601
Now you tell me.

529
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:13,281
Um, listen, about earlier, I don't want
you to get the wrong idea about Luka.

530
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:16,183
- He's a good guy.
- I'm not looking for anything right now.

531
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,824
Okay. I just thought
you should know.

532
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:22,325
Thank you. But independence
works pretty good for me.

533
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,486
Although I wouldn't
mind some regular sex.

534
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:27,997
No kidding. I'd settle
for irregular sex.

535
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,691
Can you help my husband?

536
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,837
- What's the problem?
- It's my leg.

537
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,099
- Did you fall?
- No, no. I think she shot me.

538
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,103
Mom's sleeping off her bender.
She got about 30 stitches.

539
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,180
Her head CT was negative.
Surgery wants to watch her overnight.

540
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,374
BP's 110/78 after three
liters. And her crit's 41.

541
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,678
Good. If they discharge
her in the morning...

542
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,651
why don't we keep
the kid with her?

543
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,690
DCFS won't let us do that. They'll
wanna place him into foster care.

544
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,853
- It's only one night.
- Then we need to admit him.

545
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,498
- What?
- He's looking a little dehydrated.

546
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:03,500
Complaining of abdominal pain.
Observe him overnight for a rule-out appy.

547
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,198
Look, if he was your kid?

548
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,535
I'll start a chart.

549
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,839
Hey, Rudy.

550
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:21,209
I got good news. You and your mom
can spend the night at my hospital tonight.

551
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,385
- You hungry? Anything I can get you?
- They took my gun.

552
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,660
Police took your father's
gun because it's dangerous.

553
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,660
You could hurt yourself
or somebody else.

554
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,322
How am I gonna protect my mom?

555
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,428
Look, buddy, your dad...

556
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,902
he's going to jail
for what he did.

557
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,135
Okay? You don't have to
be worried about him now.

558
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,502
He'll get out. He always does.

559
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,013
He turns off the lights so I
can't see him hitting my mom...

560
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,243
or find the phone.

561
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,410
But I can always hear him.

562
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,915
- Yo, Mike.
- Yeah, in a minute.

563
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,854
We gotta roll, man.

564
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,089
Look, I'll be back,
okay? I promise.

565
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,391
Everything'll be okay.

566
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,470
No cardiac motion, no effusion
or tamponade. Resume CPR.

567
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,801
- Zosyn is up. Another liter up.
- Another round of epi and atropine.

568
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,537
Could be massive PE or MI.

569
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,945
Hypovolemia possible.
Hypoxia possible.

570
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:29,145
No pneumo, hypothermia or tamponade.
- All right. Holding CPR.

571
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,450
- V-tach. I'll shock her.
- Charge to 360.

572
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,115
Clear.

573
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,489
V-fib. Clear.

574
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,456
- She's flatline. MARQUEZ:
Wanna pace her?

575
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,467
You ran it. You call it.

576
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,337
Time of death, 5:48.

577
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,309
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

578
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,076
Maybe if she'd come in two
weeks earlier, we could have...

579
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,476
- You ran a good code.
- Didn't help her any.

580
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,916
Carter, Abby needs you in here.

581
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,587
Two liters in. Pressure's
up to 120 systolic.

582
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,493
- Gram of Ancef. Update his tetanus.
- What's up?

583
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,931
You tell me. GSW with no
exit wound, I can't find the bullet.

584
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,037
Pelvic and chest
films are clear.

585
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,433
Maybe it migrated to the foot.

586
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,802
I checked. But let's
get a foot and a tib-fib.

587
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,638
- I didn't even want a gun in the house.
- Now I know why.

588
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,838
It was an accident.
I didn't wanna use it.

589
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,882
First HemoCue is 12.4.
Frequent PVCs on the monitor.

590
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,678
Repeat the HemoCue
in 30 minutes.

591
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,845
- Sir, do you have any heart problems?
- No.

592
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:40,390
- Do you use cocaine or crystal meth?
- No, no.

593
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,321
Ooh.

594
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,387
Bullet's in the right ventricle.

595
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,829
- Are you kidding me?
- What is it? Did you find it?

596
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,298
Mm-hm. Bullet traveled
up your femoral vein...

597
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,461
into the inferior vena
cava into your heart.

598
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,365
- What is that? ABBY:
Run of six, 100 of lidocaine.

599
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,703
- Can you get it out?
- He'll need an operation.

600
00:32:58,877 --> 00:32:59,874
On his heart?

601
00:32:59,898 --> 00:33:02,143
- The bullet is irritating
his heart. Right?

602
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,842
Yeah. Let's page Corday and
Cardiothoracic just to be safe.

603
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,146
And rebolus 50 of lido in five.
Help me roll him on his right side.

604
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,381
Will that help it to come out?
- No.

605
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,991
That should keep the
bullet from entering his lungs.

606
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,060
- Is that bad? ABBY:
Don't want that to happen.

607
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:20,359
- You put a bullet in my heart?
- Shot you in the leg. It was an accident.

608
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,228
- Um, you got this?
- Yep.

609
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,735
- Paramedics ran over our ball.
- Yeah. Well, it happens.

610
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,313
So seven is my record.

611
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,909
- What?
- We lost seven patients in one shift...

612
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,077
my second year of residency.

613
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,620
That supposed to cheer me up?

614
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,717
You know, when you
first got here, you were...

615
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:54,333
- dangerous, reckless and arrogant.
- Is this your idea of a pep talk?

616
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,932
Hey, we all get our
confidence rattled.

617
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,471
If you don't, you should worry.
It means you've stopped caring.

618
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,268
Believe me, you could do a
lot more harm playing it safe.

619
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,936
So we're damned if we
do, damned if we don't.

620
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:09,442
What do you want me to tell you?
That everything's gonna be okay?

621
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,082
That you're gonna get so good...

622
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,946
that nothing bad is ever
gonna happen again? Forget it.

623
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,612
This is what we do. If we're
successful in our jobs, then patients live.

624
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,485
And if we're not...

625
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,356
sometimes they die.

626
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,625
Or wind up paralyzed.

627
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,799
Did you do what you
thought was best?

628
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,465
Was there a chance that
you might have been right?

629
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,373
Afterwards, did you tell
the kid what had happened?

630
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,436
- Yeah.
- Then quit feeling sorry for yourself.

631
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,136
You're a good doctor.
Start acting like it.

632
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,494
Hey.

633
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,359
How's the daughter?

634
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,858
Better than I would be if
I'd just seen my mother die.

635
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,567
- Are you angry with me?
- No.

636
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,867
But I didn't expect you to be
doing paramedic ride-alongs.

637
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,874
Did you even eat lunch today?

638
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,309
- I'll grab something.
- You need to eat properly.

639
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,847
- You treat the woman with pertussis?
- Yeah. Why?

640
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,848
I think you'd
better get out here.

641
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,581
I don't know what
they're saying.

642
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,312
Who are "they"?

643
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,753
They're Mrs. Lemonier's neighbors.
I told everyone in the building...

644
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,488
they needed to be
examined, possibly inoculated.

645
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,189
You did?

646
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,097
- Now you're angry.
- I'm not angry.

647
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,864
Get everybody into Triage and round
up as much pertussis vaccine as you can.

648
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,167
- Can I help?
- Yeah.

649
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,311
- I love you.
- Yeah, yeah.

650
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,911
John, where's the man
with the bullet in his heart?

651
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,446
- He's gone.
- What, he's dead?

652
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,880
- No, no. They took him upstairs.
- Who?

653
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,244
- Dr. Lawson.
- Who the hell is this Dr. Lawson?

654
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,945
He's the new
invasive radiologist.

655
00:35:57,122 --> 00:36:00,456
I was supposed to pick my daughter
up. I stayed late because I was paged.

656
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,526
He wanted to do it
so you didn't have to.

657
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,400
What are you doing?

658
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,277
- You must be Dr. Corday.
- That's right.

659
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,437
Sorry. You got involved
in this case how?

660
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,413
I was downstairs. I
saw his chest x-ray.

661
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,451
Well, I was the
consulting surgeon.

662
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,248
This is the second patient of
mine you've poached today.

663
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,857
Got it.

664
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:36,228
Advancing the guide
sheath and moving south.

665
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,421
If there are options in treatment, we
should present them to the patient...

666
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,727
so that he can hear the risks
and benefits of both procedures.

667
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,928
I'm sorry. I thought
you'd appreciate...

668
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,300
having two fewer
procedures to do today.

669
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:52,410
The bullet's in the femoral vein.
You can have your patient back now.

670
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,437
- What?
- You can take him to the OR.

671
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:56,911
For a cutdown.

672
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,948
It's nice to finally
meet you, Dr. Corday.

673
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,109
I look forward to
working together again...

674
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,914
soon.

675
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,682
Good night.

676
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,135
- Hey, Dr. Pratt.
- Hey.

677
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:20,295
Hey, I just wanted to thank
you. You saved my life.

678
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,963
Not really.

679
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,508
I came in here a few hours ago with a
broken back, and now I'm going home.

680
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,976
You have a compression
fracture of your vertebrae.

681
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,706
Yeah, I know. But
I'm not paralyzed.

682
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:34,110
Thank you. You're the best.

683
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,154
Mom, can you hear me?

684
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:40,849
Mom, wake up.

685
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,153
- Mom.
- Hey, little man.

686
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:46,730
- What's happening?
- My mom won't wake up.

687
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,058
It's all my fault.

688
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:52,864
No, it's not. The doctors just gave
her something so she could sleep.

689
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,173
I couldn't protect her.

690
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,171
- That's not your job.
- Yes, it is.

691
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,472
She doesn't have
anybody else to do it.

692
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,580
Well, it says here you do a great
job of taking care of your mom.

693
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,219
Then why is she in the hospital?

694
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:15,020
Well, you know, sometimes things
happen that we have no control of.

695
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:18,322
Bad things. Even
when we do our best.

696
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:23,969
But I think your mom's lucky to have
somebody like you looking out for her.

697
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,174
Your arm may hurt and
may feel a little achy.

698
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,048
But it'll pass.

699
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,287
If it doesn't, you need to
come back to the hospital.

700
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,583
- Hey, Luka, you busy?
- No.

701
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,625
You mind helping
me examine patients?

702
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,695
They all may have been
exposed to pertussis.

703
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,695
- Why not.
- You don't mind?

704
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,891
No. This at least I'm good at.

705
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,231
- Hey, Kem enjoyed your lecture.
- Yeah, she's the only one.

706
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:02,863
I don't think I got through to any
of the others. Maybe it's the accent.

707
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,942
What the hell is this?

708
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,408
These people may be
infected with whooping cough.

709
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,105
Then they should be seeing
their primary-care physician.

710
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,544
From what I've seen...

711
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,878
you are their primary-care physician.
- Kem.

712
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,412
If you don't give them care...

713
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,887
they won't seek treatment, and
you'll have an epidemic on your hands.

714
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:22,425
- What Kem is trying to say is...
- She doesn't need you interpreting.

715
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:26,429
She's making herself perfectly clear.
You got your work cut out for you.

716
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:30,091
All right, do it, but do it quickly.
From now on, no one is going to Africa.

717
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,931
I'm tired of this
Dr. Schweitzer routine.

718
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,266
- Did I say something wrong?
- Not at all.

719
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,308
Eighteen-year-old Peter Spratt,
took a hockey puck to the face.

720
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,275
Looks like a mandible fracture.
He swallowed teeth and blood.

721
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,608
- Okay, I got this.
- He's not moving enough air.

722
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:47,274
- His jaw is too busted to intubate.
- Let's get a 7-0 ET tube and Surgilube.

723
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:48,977
- I'm going nasal.
- Pratt?

724
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,849
It's okay. Dr. Kovac showed me.

725
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,422
Tachy at 112, sats
are 92 and dropping.

726
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,322
Apparently, somebody's
been listening to you.

727
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,430
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

728
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,862
No worries. They're
just watching a movie.

729
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,863
Hi, Ella.

730
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,800
- Okay, time to go. Put your shoes on.
- It's almost over.

731
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,806
- How are the puppies?
- Messy. But the kids had fun.

732
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,444
- You want a piece of cake?
- No. I haven't had dinner.

733
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:17,207
In that case, how about a slice of
pizza? I'll even throw in a glass of wine.

734
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:18,782
All right, then.

735
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,148
So how was your
pancake-juju thing?

736
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,118
- My what?
- Your surgery.

737
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,190
The operation you
were doing this morning.

738
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:29,122
Pancreaticojejunostomy?

739
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,488
- You made that up, didn't you?
- Nope.

740
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,963
Come on, admit it. You have the
perfect job for getting out of things.

741
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,659
Who's gonna argue with a
surgeon? "I'm really sorry.

742
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:41,465
I'd love to help you move, but I have to
separate a pair of Guatemalan twins...

743
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,505
who are joined at the testes."

744
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:48,545
Ha-ha. Actually, a pancreaticojejunostomy
is a replumbing of the upper GI tract.

745
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:51,512
That sounds painful. Can
you get that from working out?

746
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:55,085
- Because my shoulder's been killing me.
- I believe that's called old age.

747
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,653
Ouch.

748
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,518
After I go to all the trouble of
making you this nice dinner.

749
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,751
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

750
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,018
Happy birthday.

751
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,227
Hey, Rudy.

752
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,863
- How you doing, man?
- Okay.

753
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,664
- You hungry?
- Mm-hm.

754
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:19,675
I went and picked us up some burgers
and French fries because I am starving.

755
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,204
I also got you this.

756
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,741
All right, take it.

757
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,855
So you don't ever have to
worry about the lights going out.

758
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,234
Busy. SAM: No kidding.

759
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,574
- How was your day?
- It sucked. Yours?

760
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,216
Same.

761
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:04,278
About this morning... - Forget it.
- No.

762
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,447
I know sometimes I
can be overzealous.

763
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:11,119
- Is that...? Is that the word?
- Don't know. Is that Croatian for "jerk"?

764
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:16,496
I'm sorry. I didn't want to
take my frustrations out on you.

765
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,499
Sometimes I just
feel very passionate.

766
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,581
John!

767
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,923
- Want a bite?
- No. What are you doing?

768
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,996
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- We are. I'm just famished.

769
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,362
- I needed something to hold me over.
- All this?

770
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:52,293
I couldn't decide. There
was too much to choose from.

771
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,703
- I got Twinkies, Ho Hos, MoonPies.
- This is all junk food.

772
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,605
I know. But it tastes so good.

773
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:05,315
I must be getting cravings. All I
can think about is chocolate. And sex.

774
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,517
- But I am so happy. Are you happy?
- Yeah.

775
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,325
Thanks for letting me
come to the hospital today.

776
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,154
I love to watch you work.

777
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,388
- You were such a stud.
- Oh, stop it.

778
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,658
It's all I could do to
keep my hands off you.

779
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:25,133
- That's it. No more sugar for you.
- Can I come tomorrow?

780
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:28,364
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

781
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,338
Because Dr. Weaver
said she'd fire me if you did.

782
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:34,069
- She didn't?
- Actually, she did. Yeah.

783
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,838
- I should talk to her.
- No, please don't. No.

784
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,985
What, did I do something
wrong? Did I get in the way?

785
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,712
Did I ask too many questions?
I asked too many questions.

786
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:47,017
- Did I ask too many questions?
- How many chocolate bars did you eat?
