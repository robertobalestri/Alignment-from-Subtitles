1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,268
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,569
My parents were in a car accident.
- I'm sorry.

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,939
It happened in some
province north of Zuzhou.

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:14,581
I'm pregnant.

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,085
- You did it!
- We have a baby.

6
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,282
<i>We love you.</i>

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,800
It's nice to finally
meet you, Dr. Corday.

8
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,589
I look forward to working
together again soon.

9
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,486
Can someone get
the door, please?

10
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,956
Get me the hell out of here!

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,464
- Nice place.
- It's okay.

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,450
Oh, God.

13
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:58,555
Nolan. Nolan, wake
up. It's happening.

14
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,630
It's freezing.

15
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,289
Did you turn the heat down?

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,659
Nolan, get up.

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,939
Rise and shine.
The baby's coming.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,075
We'll drop you at
Gram's on the way.

19
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,620
Hello. Earth to children.

20
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:31,822
You need to get dressed now.
Clay. Come on, get up, honey.

21
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,585
Clay?

22
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:38,130
Clay? Clay? Clay?

23
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,826
Clay? Oh, my God! My God.

24
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,702
Shannon? Shannon? Shannon?

25
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,806
Shannon?

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,338
Nolan!

27
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,581
Nolan? Nolan?

28
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,509
Nolan!

29
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,656
Nolan, wake up! Nolan?
Nolan? Nolan? Nolan!

30
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,248
The alarm didn't go off.

31
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,820
- What?
- It's time for you to leave.

32
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,219
- What time is it?
- Get your butt out of bed!

33
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,824
- Hey!
- Shh.

34
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,954
He might be up.

35
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,194
I didn't hear the TV.

36
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,462
That's probably why
you should get going.

37
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,130
- Can I at least get a shower?
- No.

38
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,280
I think I found a roach.

39
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,785
No, just an old raisin.

40
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,222
- Why are you up?
- Why are you?

41
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,386
I'm going to that stupid
aquarium thing with Oscar.

42
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,657
<i>The imagination you provide...</i>

43
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,768
- Alex.
- When are we gonna get a satellite?

44
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,964
We should probably talk.

45
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,600
They have, like, 1000
channels or something.

46
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,308
Hello.

47
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,184
I took out T-bones for dinner.

48
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,316
- Okay. I'll bring the ketchup.
- Over my dead body.

49
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,299
- What time should I pick you up?
- That's okay. I can take the El.

50
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,663
It's icy out. I wouldn't want
the little Martin kid getting hurt.

51
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,326
Don't do that.

52
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,497
- What?
- Make assumptions about last names.

53
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,835
Oh. Little Petey, then?

54
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,339
Little Jenny?

55
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,013
Until my name changes, if it
ever does, he or she is a Lewis.

56
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,515
- Whatever you say, Mommy.
- Don't do that either.

57
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,983
- Okay, I gotta go. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

58
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,955
Oh, hey. When are you gonna
introduce me to your old man?

59
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,658
He knows about me, right?

60
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,355
Did you tell him about the baby?

61
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,058
- Not yet.
- Don't you think you ought to...?

62
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,227
- I gotta go. Bye.
- Bye.

63
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,669
- Hey.
- Morning.

64
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,106
Am I late or are you early?

65
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,405
No point staying in
bed if you can't sleep.

66
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,277
Tell me about it. Chuck snores.
Either I need earplugs or...

67
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,284
- Separate bedrooms.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

68
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,218
So is this gonna be a rush,
or depress the hell out of me?

69
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,053
The latter. It's multiples
all from the same address.

70
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,890
Vicki Bennett, 38 weeks pregnant,
in active labor and fully dilated.

71
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,191
Why is this happening? Ah!

72
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,890
I'd say your baby was ready.

73
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,901
Breathe through the
contractions. Set up a fetal monitor.

74
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,630
So Mom's in labor. What's
wrong with everyone else?

75
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,775
Unknown. The family
was found unconscious.

76
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,638
- Was the heat on?
- It's 10 degrees.

77
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,037
- What's the story?
- Possible CO poisoning.

78
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,910
More family members coming in.
- Need some help here!

79
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,898
How long has he been seizing?
- Since we pulled up.

80
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,423
Altered mental status prior,
no signs of head trauma.

81
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,957
- He on anticonvulsants?
- Not according to his wife.

82
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,320
Eight- and 10-year-old...

83
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,826
are behind, out cold at the scene.
- What is it?

84
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,795
Looks like relative hypoxia.
I got this one. Take the kids.

85
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,435
Clay Bennett, altered, but
coming around. Nausea.

86
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,299
- Vital signs normal.
- Feel sick, dude?

87
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,575
- This one nauseous too?
- Complains of headache. Good vitals.

88
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,973
You take the boy, I'll
deal with the girl. What?

89
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,376
Hi, my name's Abby. We're gonna
try to make you feel better, okay?

90
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,808
- She's crowning.
- Where's my family?

91
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:28,080
- They're being taken care of.
- Fetal heart rate's at 105.

92
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,815
I don't understand what happened.
- We're not sure...

93
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,425
but you need to stay here.

94
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,323
Okay, let's get Mom on
100 percent 02 by mask.

95
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,259
- Labs?
- No one would wake up.

96
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,659
Neela, labs now.

97
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,132
CBC, type and Rh, UA and ABG
with carboxyhemoglobin level.

98
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,966
When a family passes out in winter, we
assume it's carbon-monoxide poisoning.

99
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,199
Happens if your heater
doesn't vent properly.

100
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,432
But I didn't pass out.

101
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,169
Fetal hemoglobin has
a higher CO affinity.

102
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,676
- What?
- In English.

103
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,646
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize, just explain.

104
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,808
The baby's blood took
the carbon monoxide.

105
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,352
That cleared it from your
body and kept you well.

106
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,552
Does that...? Does that
mean the baby got it all?

107
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,353
Okay, big push for the next one, Vicki.
- Oh, my God!

108
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,225
Here we go. Stand by with
a pediatric intubation tray.

109
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,991
- Enough.
- We need to get him...

110
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,829
on a non-rebreather
and draw an ABG.

111
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,233
- Neonatal laryngoscope?
- Bottom right.

112
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,839
- That's six of Ativan.
- Push another two. How's Mom?

113
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,805
Lucky she was pregnant.

114
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,411
- Pratt. Morris needs you in here.
- I'm a little busy.

115
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,638
Let me rephrase that.
His patient needs you.

116
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,043
Go ahead. I got this.

117
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,081
Hang Dilantin after
eight of lorazepam.

118
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,050
All right. Keep
Dad's airway secure.

119
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,018
- What's the problem?
- He won't listen.

120
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,887
- I want my mommy.
- Yeah, hold on. Girl with a headache.

121
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,824
Pulse ox, 100
percent on two liters.

122
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,987
- Do I have to draw a blood gas?
- You do.

123
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,826
- I told you.
- Her sats are normal.

124
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,333
Pulse ox measures oxygen dissolved
in the blood not bound to hemoglobin.

125
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,097
- It's normal in CO poisoning.
- I told him that too.

126
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,037
Damn! Who's the resident here?

127
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,840
- You okay?
- Is my family dying?

128
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,726
It sort of snuck up
on us, you know?

129
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,934
I mean, I don't... I don't think
either one of us planned it.

130
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,233
- Right?
- Right.

131
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,767
It happens.

132
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,806
People date.

133
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,948
You okay back there?

134
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,549
Yeah.

135
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,451
- You want to talk about this?
- No.

136
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,122
- He'll break down muscle cells.
- Open up the fluids. Come on, man.

137
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,960
- Enough is enough.
- Dilantin's in.

138
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,296
Any longer, we'll get
irreversible brain damage.

139
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,597
- So, what do we do?
- A drip and hope it works.

140
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,072
- How fast should I run it in?
- Wait, wait. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

141
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,007
Mr. Bennett, can you hear me?

142
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,012
Carboxyhemoglobin 35 percent.
He needs the hyperbaric chamber.

143
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,912
- Only if it's over 40.
- Or has neurologic impairment.

144
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,486
We don't know that yet. Keep him
on oxygen. We'll give him 30 minutes.

145
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,283
If he doesn't wake up quick,
then we'll talk hyperbarics.

146
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,154
Baby's distress
probably induced labor.

147
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,088
- It's a good thing too.
- You can do it.

148
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,494
Otherwise they'd all
be dead right about now.

149
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,996
- Fetal heart rate's down to 80.
- Why us?

150
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,037
Okay, you really gotta push hard
with this next one. Here we go.

151
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,637
Get ready with a
receiving blanket.

152
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,505
What did we do?

153
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:41,181
Okay, head's out. Bulb syringe.

154
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,709
One more push, Vicki.

155
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,515
Okay. It's a boy. Clamp.

156
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,192
We're good people.
We go to church.

157
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,851
Okay, hang in there, Vicki.
Neela, deliver the placenta.

158
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,520
Me? LEWIS: Yes, you.

159
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,127
How is he?

160
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,736
- He's having trouble breathing.
- One for color, one for tone.

161
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,066
- Zero for respirations. VICKI:
Something's wrong. What's wrong?

162
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,868
- Starting compressions.
- His heart isn't beating well...

163
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,841
- because it's been deprived of oxygen.
- And his brain?

164
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,046
Oh, God!

165
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,685
We need to intubate. Point-three
of epi and draw an ABG.

166
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,345
Let's see how much carbon
monoxide he's taken in.

167
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,856
Bad enough when residents are
late but when Attendings are late...

168
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,392
it sends a message
that time is amorphous.

169
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,325
Seven a.m. is 7 a.m., people.

170
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,864
- When Kovac's in, I wanna talk to him.
- Yes, ma'am.

171
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,661
Stop surfing the
web on County time.

172
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,066
- Oh, Dr. Weaver.
- Fair warning.

173
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:42,073
Henry's colicky, Sandy's pulling a 24
and I haven't had coffee. What do you want?

174
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,176
- Placenta's out.
- Neela, 20 of Pit.

175
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,246
- Why isn't he crying?
- He has a tube to give him oxygen.

176
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,245
Good strong pulse
and he's pinking up.

177
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,350
We'll find out how
your family's doing.

178
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,078
Mom's carbon monoxide is
in the safe range, 19 percent.

179
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,746
- How's our little hero?
- He's at 48.

180
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,755
- Coma range?
- Needs hyperbaric therapy.

181
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,417
- What's going on?
- Your son has a very high level...

182
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,086
of carbon monoxide we need to clear.
- Like diving.

183
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,563
- He needs a pressure chamber.
- Equivalent...

184
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,202
to 66 feet of water to get
three times more oxygen.

185
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,929
- Will he wake up then?
- We hope.

186
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,769
- Can I hold him?
- Yeah. You can touch him.

187
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,035
But the sooner we start the
treatment, the better the results.

188
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,274
- He's... He's beautiful.
- Yeah, he is.

189
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,746
- Sorry, we gotta go.
- We'll do everything we can.

190
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,216
- Neela.
- My baby...

191
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,952
Take this.

192
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,954
You did a NICU rotation?
I need you in the chamber.

193
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,120
- You sending me?
- A nurse will be with you.

194
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,766
- They're waiting.
- I thought an Attending should...

195
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,959
- No. A dive takes too long.
- How long?

196
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,127
A couple of hours.
Is that a problem?

197
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,076
- Okay.
- There you go.

198
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,111
Take off your gown.
Put on booties.

199
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,943
No lipstick, no makeup, hair
spray, nail polish, perfume.

200
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,140
- What?
- All flammable.

201
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,514
Removing watches,
jewelry, electronic equipment.

202
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,916
Any unfinished root
canals, temporary fillings?

203
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,183
- No. Why?
- Trapped air in the tooth socket.

204
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,657
It can expand. Do you
know how to clear your ears?

205
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,693
- I can't do this.
- Pinch your nostrils.

206
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,093
- Blow against your glottis.
- I can't go in.

207
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,928
- Are you claustrophobic?
- Is there time for a replacement?

208
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,593
What do you think? Come on.

209
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,613
- All right, hook him up to the vent.
- I'll set the clock.

210
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,544
- Patient and attendant set?
<i>- Go for it.</i>

211
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,848
You're not gonna panic, are you?

212
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,488
<i>Initiating pressurization.</i>

213
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,188
- Does it stay this loud?
- You get used to it.

214
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,191
I'm sorry. Can we stop now?

215
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,505
Ten feet. Do we have
a problem in there?

216
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,072
My ear's bothering me.

217
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,075
Take us up two feet. Hold
your nose. Blow to equalize.

218
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,373
I'm sorry. Please,
can we stop now?

219
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,040
Resume pressurization.

220
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,893
You really should be
on the postpartum floor.

221
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,189
Mommy!

222
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,493
It's all right.
Mommy's here now.

223
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,531
Everything's gonna be fine.

224
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,170
You're not helping by
not taking care of yourself.

225
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,069
- How is he?
- He's a little groggy.

226
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,071
- You just had a baby.
- If I can't be with my baby...

227
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,304
I wanna be with them.

228
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,315
Vitals q. 30 minutes,
CBC in two hours.

229
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,010
Mom's good and
cranky. How's Dad?

230
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:43,350
Just woke up. Neuro exam's non-focal.
Oriented to person, place and time.

231
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:47,255
He could still have long-term
neuro-psychological deficits.

232
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,397
- She know that yet?
- No. She doesn't need to.

233
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,265
- The girl's headache subsided.
- Yeah. How's the boy?

234
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,198
Hungry, wants a snack. But
he's worried about Mom and Dad.

235
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,472
- Yeah, me too. Any word on the baby?
- In the chamber.

236
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,074
- What's his P02?
- He has a name.

237
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,134
Samuel.

238
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,576
Can you make sure
whoever's with him knows that?

239
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,776
Of course.

240
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,943
- What's the verdict?
- Four hours at 100 percent...

241
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,612
they should all be clear.
The baby's another story.

242
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,782
Yeah. So how are you
doing with your pregnancy?

243
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,487
Oh, fine. You know,
tired. A little scared.

244
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,930
- About having one?
- About what happens after you do.

245
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,435
- Every winter it's the same thing.
- Is there any sort of air conditioning?

246
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,909
Temperatures go down, heaters
get turned up, people asphyxiate.

247
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,073
Why does it have
to be so hot in here?

248
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,948
When pressure rises in a fixed volume,
it's gonna get warm. Ideal gas law.

249
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,283
PV=nRT. What about it?

250
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,357
Okay. Time to give
the kid an air break.

251
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,960
- Prevents oxygen toxicity.
- I can hardly breathe.

252
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,461
- Too much and he could seize.
- How much longer?

253
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,997
Hour 40. LEWIS: Neela.

254
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,998
- Yeah?
- His name's Samuel.

255
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,500
- Sorry?
- The baby.

256
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,161
The mom wanted you to know.

257
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,799
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

258
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,843
Okay, good. I'll see
you in a couple hours.

259
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,339
Kerry, I examined Mrs. Krall
and she won't require surgery.

260
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,851
She passed her kidney
stone half an hour ago.

261
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,548
- She wants to turn it into a brooch.
- I'm sorry. What?

262
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,352
Okay, let me guess.

263
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,688
Henry has colic and
you're barely sleeping.

264
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,227
Yeah. Did Ella have it too?

265
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,023
And terrible teething.

266
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,393
It's no cakewalk now.

267
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:37,799
Tantrums, a constant
demand for toys, refusing to eat.

268
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,668
I hate to say it, but in
some ways, it gets harder.

269
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:46,176
It must be twice as hard by
yourself. You have any prospects?

270
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,477
I met a teacher
recently. He's a nice man.

271
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,981
Nice is good.

272
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,846
Yes, it's nice.

273
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,382
Okay, open up.

274
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,722
All right, there you go.

275
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,064
- Oh, with a minute to spare.
- That's me. Punctual.

276
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,861
Her dad says she
has strep. Later.

277
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,697
It's been going
around her school.

278
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,600
Okay, let's see.

279
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:16,834
Oh, 101.7. You have
a fever, young lady.

280
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,611
Anything else? Stuffy nose?

281
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,716
- No. It's just my throat.
- Okay, let's have a look.

282
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:29,754
Oh, looks pretty red. Doctor's
gonna want to take a culture.

283
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,750
How long's that gonna take?

284
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,393
Waiting room's pretty
packed. Six to eight hours.

285
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,895
- I just started a new job.
- It'll be okay, Daddy.

286
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,932
Why don't you two take a seat,
and we'll call you as soon as we can.

287
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,933
- Do you think Alex is okay?
- I don't know.

288
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,408
Maybe you should bring
him to my place tonight.

289
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,809
We can talk, watch
something on the big screen.

290
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,074
- I'm not sure.
- I'll cook.

291
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,276
Is this where I sign in?
- Uh-huh.

292
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,712
Can we talk about this later?
I need to get back to work.

293
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,552
How can I help you today, ma'am?
- Kovac.

294
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,926
- Morning, Kerry.
- I should be grateful it's not afternoon.

295
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,223
You're late, which makes
me late for a meeting.

296
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,128
Look for the deduction
in your paycheck.

297
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,498
Could be worse. She could
have an M16 strapped on.

298
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,933
What's this?

299
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,631
Place across the street
does dry-ice shipments.

300
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,842
It's a prenatal-care package for Kem.
Plus some stuff they need at the clinic.

301
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,274
SusPhrine, terbutaline.

302
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,076
Yeah, I hear they're really
desperate for roses in the Congo.

303
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,651
- How long has it been?
- Since we've seen each other?

304
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:39,451
Thirty-four days, 16
hours, 12 minutes.

305
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,927
But we e-mail each other.

306
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,757
She says she's
really starting to show.

307
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,328
All right, see you later.

308
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:53,972
Would you hand me a
tissue? He really misses her.

309
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:59,669
Married for 36 years. He gave
my mom flowers every anniversary.

310
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,542
- Swore he loved her till the day she died.
- Sounds sweet.

311
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,447
- Of course, he loved his girlfriends too.
- Just had you and your sister?

312
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,953
Yeah. Both raised by crazy people.
Couldn't have turned out different.

313
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,387
- They did their best.
- That's the scary part.

314
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,391
Twenty-something John Doe
found down behind a building.

315
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,029
Just like all weaklings!

316
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,688
Where is all this blood coming
from? GSW? Knife wound?

317
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,528
- He wouldn't exactly let us check.
- Fistfight maybe?

318
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,822
- The other guy won.
- Just let me go, please!

319
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,533
Altered and agitated.
Tachycardic at 128. BP, 160/92.

320
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,403
Gotta be on
something heavy-duty.

321
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,909
I hate your guts!

322
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,709
Sixty-six-year-old male, acute shortness
of breath, febrile, sats 94 percent.

323
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,476
I'm on my way out. Sorry.

324
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,212
- Bed-bound, secondary to pelvic fracture.
- Deb?

325
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,147
- Hey, Carter.
- How are you? When did you get back?

326
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,590
Last week. I couldn't leave
China until my father was stable.

327
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,230
- I'm sorry about your mom.
- She had a fatal PE.

328
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,663
And now my dad's got pneumonia.
I've been taking care of him at home.

329
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,565
- With nursing care?
- He doesn't want anyone in the house.

330
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,366
- It's been hard.
- Hey, Deb. Deb, how are you?

331
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,440
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

332
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,270
- Hey, Dr. C.
- Hey, Malik.

333
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,412
- Good to see you. You all right?
- Yeah.

334
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,748
Hey, Dr. Chen.

335
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,276
Sorry. What's the problem again?

336
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,514
My grandson is coughing too
much. I need to see Dr. Weaver.

337
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,159
She's not in.

338
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,528
My daughter said to
have her check him.

339
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,366
Ma'am, he'll be seen by a doctor,
but I can't guarantee which one.

340
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:34,438
Sandy and Dr. Weaver,
they live together.

341
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,204
Oh.

342
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,210
It's evil. You hear me?

343
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,942
Found a meth pipe. Wanna guess
what the tox screen's gonna say?

344
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,451
Do a full workup. He could just as
easily be that way from a head bleed.

345
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,455
- It's everywhere. It's everywhere!
- You want hard restraints?

346
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,217
Try Ativan first.

347
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,657
No free fluid,
Morrison's is clear.

348
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,660
- No signs of trauma.
- Where's the wound?

349
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,270
- What?
- I can't find anything.

350
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,162
Like, nothing, not a scratch.

351
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,962
It's demons! There's
demons all around us!

352
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,570
Hematocrit's normal.

353
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,139
So he's not bleeding
internally or externally.

354
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,800
- Hope he works in a meatpacking plant.
- Dr. Lewis. You got a minute?

355
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,209
Yeah. You know what? Call
the cops in case he doesn't.

356
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,179
- What's up?
- Nancy Natarelli, 42, with nausea...

357
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,319
vomiting and fatigue
times two weeks.

358
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:24,446
She's afebrile, normal vitals,
lungs clear, abdomen soft.

359
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:29,118
No CVA tenderness. Her meds
include kali phos and arsenicum.

360
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,158
Homeopathic stuff.

361
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,733
Oh, I got five kids at
home. I can't be sick like this.

362
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,993
That's a lot of diapers.

363
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,334
Who are you telling?

364
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:45,103
I had three of my own
already. These five are theirs.

365
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,643
You're pretty young
to be a grandma.

366
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,814
You think it's the side effects
from the St. John's Wort?

367
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,518
It's probably just a stomach virus.
We'll run some tests to make sure.

368
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,555
Why are you taking
it? Are you depressed?

369
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,790
Just thought I'd be
done raising kids by now.

370
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,327
Okay. We'll be back.

371
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,497
What? CBC, chem
panel, UA? Could be pyelo.

372
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,137
Yeah. Run a psych history and make
sure she's not clinically depressed.

373
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,542
- Dad's coming around.
- Okay.

374
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,873
- He's okay.
- All right, Vicki.

375
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,311
You need to stay in bed
and put your mask on.

376
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,214
- He's talking and everything.
- That goes for you too.

377
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,653
- How are you feeling, Mr. Bennett?
- Headache.

378
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,885
- What happened?
- Do you know what today is?

379
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,594
Wednesday.

380
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,596
Vicki said that the
baby saved our lives.

381
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,296
Yeah. He did.

382
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,337
Is he gonna be okay?

383
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,015
Staring won't make it go faster.

384
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,212
- Why are these chambers so small?
- I've been in smaller.

385
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,390
We're over halfway
there, okay? Relax.

386
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,050
Don't. You have no idea
how hard this is for me.

387
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,593
- You want some Valium?
- What?

388
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:13,699
- To calm your nerves?
- No, I just... I need to get out of here.

389
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,424
- Wait a minute.
- He's stable now.

390
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,627
- But...
- If I don't get out, I'll lose it!

391
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,238
- Do you understand?
<i>- Problem?</i>

392
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,570
- I'm stepping in the airlock. Bring me up.
- Are we okay with this?

393
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,712
<i>Yeah. Get Dr. Olivera
to take her place.</i>

394
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,946
Lucky for you it's easier
going up than going down.

395
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,378
Hurry, please.

396
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,977
Ascending.

397
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,754
<i>Tachycardia. Heart rate's 180.</i>

398
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,257
<i>- Is the other doctor en route?</i>
- Yeah. I paged him.

399
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:44,886
<i>Breath sounds decreased
on the left. P waves, not SVT.</i>

400
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,995
<i>He's got a pneumothorax.</i>

401
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,465
Forty feet. Do you
need a surgeon in there?

402
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,901
<i>- No. We need to re-inflate his lung.
- Pulse is weak and thready.</i>

403
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,967
- Bring me back down.
<i>- Descending.</i>

404
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,408
Open the crash cart
and prep the chest.

405
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,947
- PVCs. Are you coming back in?
- Just until the other doctor arrives.

406
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,244
Sixty feet. Sixty feet.

407
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,321
Ow!

408
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,517
My ear! I'm bleeding!

409
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,593
You perfed your eardrum. Don't
worry. It grows back. Come on.

410
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,696
<i>We're at depth.</i>

411
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,675
Subtle right-middle
lobe infiltrate.

412
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,575
Sure makes me appreciate
our healthcare system.

413
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,911
I had to wait a week for
a chest film in Zuzhou.

414
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,349
Low-grade fever. It's
probably just early pneumonia.

415
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,287
Or pulmonary embolus.
Can he get a V/Q scan?

416
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,622
Doesn't need one. D-dimer's
negative. He's low probability for PE.

417
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:53,731
Does he walk at all?

418
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,126
He can, but he won't.

419
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,827
And I can't make him.

420
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:03,837
Since his surgery, he's been
depressed, a bit demented.

421
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:07,636
Just stares at the TV.

422
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,340
So, what happened?

423
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,882
They skidded off some back
road in the middle of nowhere.

424
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,049
Car flipped.

425
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,858
My mom never
regained consciousness.

426
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,294
Jing-Mei?

427
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,761
I'll let you two get caught up.

428
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,103
Thank you, John.

429
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,707
What's going on?

430
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,841
I'm having my dad
checked for PE.

431
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,278
When did you get back?

432
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,477
Last Monday.

433
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,949
You should have called.

434
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,822
How are you, Mr. Chen?

435
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,548
- The ET tube's down too far.
- No, it's a tension pneumo.

436
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,185
- Give me a 22-gauge.
<i>- Are you all right in there?</i>

437
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,150
- Alcohol wipe.
- Sure you're up for this?

438
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,847
- Where the hell is Dr. Olivera?
- Coming in.

439
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,155
Finally.

440
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:40,272
- There. How's the heart rate?
- Back down to 128.

441
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,100
He needs a chest tube.

442
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,108
You start. I'll get
there as soon as I can.

443
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,269
Five centimeters of
water on the Thora-Seal.

444
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,510
<i>You'll be at depth in a minute.</i>

445
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,411
Perfect.

446
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,977
Sleeping like a baby now. No
sense in keeping him in here.

447
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:58,518
Pupils are 4 millimeters,
equal and reactive.

448
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,558
- And he has beautiful irises.
- Can you move him to Sutures?

449
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,719
- Sure thing.
- Just wait till he comes to...

450
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:07,628
and realizes we took his crystal
meth pipe. Won't be so cute then.

451
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,792
You have a standing
order for five of Haldol.

452
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,868
- You got it.
- Thanks.

453
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,297
Will he be able to tell
us what happened?

454
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,600
I doubt he'll remember.

455
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,971
- It's sad.
- What?

456
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,079
He's somebody's kid.

457
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,772
Morris, I got a call
that my son was here?

458
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,113
Yeah. He's in Curtain
1. He's really cute.

459
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,146
Florina?

460
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,120
- He just wouldn't stop coughing.
- Hi, baby.

461
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,819
- Handsome boy, Kerry.
- Thanks. I see he's eating okay.

462
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,621
But he was very uncomfortable.

463
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,731
His ears are fine.
Lungs are clear.

464
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,926
Belly's soft. It's probably
just a cold. Come here, baby.

465
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,664
I appreciate you
keeping them company.

466
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,810
Right. Nice to meet you.

467
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,674
Pleasure. He was
a very helpful man.

468
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,607
Grandma needs to get you home.
There are too many germs in this place.

469
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:04,519
Just keep the humidifier on and
give him Tylenol if he gets fussy.

470
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,422
But what you really need
is some sleep, sweetie. Yes.

471
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,496
Will you be home
late again tonight?

472
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,154
Probably not.

473
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:17,292
- He yours, Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah. All 16 pounds of him.

474
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:22,199
- How sweet.
- That's my... That's my guy.

475
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:26,209
Severa, how much morphine
did you give Dolly Zuzich?

476
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,438
Twelve milligrams.

477
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,384
Have you seen that little girl's father?
- She's not with them?

478
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,181
- No. Came in with her dad.
- Haven't seen her with anyone else.

479
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,198
- Christy, where's your dad?
- He's coming right back.

480
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,732
- When?
- After work.

481
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,069
- He just leave you here?
- I'm okay.

482
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,537
Come on. Let's get you inside.

483
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,408
Fifteen blade,
fifth intercostal.

484
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,482
- I hate doing procedures on infants.
- Getting more tachycardic.

485
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,643
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

486
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,412
- Kelly.
- Stay superior to rib.

487
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:13,353
What? You'll have to
speak up. Into the pleura.

488
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,721
Keep your pinkie in the
tract so you don't lose it.

489
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,920
- Inserting tube.
- Trachea's midline.

490
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,931
Can't thread it in. I can't see.
Wipe my brow. Wipe my brow!

491
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,167
<i>- We're equalized.</i>
- I'm here.

492
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,932
I'm in. 3-0 silk.

493
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,440
Heart rate's down to 110.

494
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,446
Hi, Dad. It's me.

495
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,777
I put that Foley in Babe
Grunhard. You owe me.

496
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:43,354
Oh, yeah. Could you give 40 of
prednisone to Peenie Sudar in 2?

497
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:46,788
No, me, Susan, your daughter.

498
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:51,021
What's up? Well, you know, not
much. I was just calling to check in.

499
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,256
- Tell him. NOLAN:
Excuse me, doctor.

500
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,924
Dad, you know what?
I'm sorry. I have to go. Bye.

501
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,626
You should be in bed.

502
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,863
We wanna know about the baby.

503
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,404
I will go check right now.

504
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,599
- Come back inside with me.
- Hey, Dr. Lewis.

505
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,300
- Yes?
- Natarelli's test results.

506
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,446
- Oh, young grandma?
- Yep. Now I know why...

507
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:10,242
she was more tired than
usual. Positive ICON.

508
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,078
You want me to tell
her? There she is.

509
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,711
I'll do it. Do me a favor, call the
chamber and find out how the baby is.

510
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,083
Yeah.

511
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,555
Nancy?

512
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,489
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

513
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,994
- Is something wrong?
- Well, that depends. You're pregnant.

514
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,832
No, I can't be. I'm on the pill.

515
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:34,065
Unfortunately, St. John's Wort can
make oral contraceptives ineffective.

516
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,507
Oh, my God! I'm pregnant?!

517
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,576
Coming through!

518
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:44,444
Yeah. You know, I'm sorry. Dr. Gallant
can answer any questions you have.

519
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,744
- I'll be back, okay? OLBES:
Clara Waskowitz, fifties.

520
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,683
- Stab wounds to neck, chest, abdomen.
- Blood loss?

521
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:52,086
Scene was covered
in it. BP's 78 over, palp.

522
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,123
- It was the drugs.
- Her lung's down.

523
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,626
- What's open?
- Nothing. Housekeeping's backed up.

524
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,195
Husband's in the next rig.
- It wasn't his fault.

525
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,301
- Multiple wounds. As many as the wife.
- Hard to tell who's worse.

526
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,460
Whoever did this must
have been really pissed off.

527
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,004
- Is it broken?
- Yep. That's what happens...

528
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,506
when you hit
someone with your fist.

529
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,770
Spare some change?

530
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,436
- Get a job, dude.
- What do you think you're doing?

531
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:21,887
How about you,
sweets? Feed the poor.

532
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,387
Leave her alone and get
back to your bed, okay?

533
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:28,659
I'm not talking to
you. I am talking to...

534
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,365
Get back to your bed, damn it!

535
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:37,797
- He spit on me!
- You're okay. You're okay, honey.

536
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,199
We'll get you
something else to wear.

537
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,341
Let's put on a gown.
Where are her parents?

538
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,636
Dad left her in Triage. I brought
her here, thought she'd be safer.

539
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,303
Okay. Let's do one
better. Find her a room.

540
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,540
Good deal.

541
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:55,149
Hey, I never got an answer.

542
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,755
- About?
- You know, some pasta, wine...

543
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:01,382
- a little Xbox for Alex.
- I don't think tonight will work.

544
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,495
Tomorrow night then?

545
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:10,396
Actually, I was thinking it might
be a good time to take a break.

546
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:14,835
- What?
- You know, just take it slower.

547
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,565
You know what I'm saying.

548
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,941
No, I don't.

549
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,711
We're not exclusive, right?
We're just, like, dating or whatever.

550
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:31,617
No commitments, no strings, no
co-parenting. Just keep it casual, okay?

551
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,514
Okay.

552
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,617
Sam! Dr. Kovac!

553
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,590
Double trauma. We
need more hands.

554
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,130
She's out. Come on,
Clara. Open your eyes.

555
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,203
I can't find a line.
- I'll do it.

556
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,467
- Forget the drugs. Let's tube her.
- BP's dropping, 54 systolic.

557
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,636
Suction on high. Need another
set of hands for this neck bleeder.

558
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,443
Bradying down. Fifty three.

559
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,380
Three went to the
right side alone.

560
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,713
Haven't seen this much
blood since this morning.

561
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,583
More crichoid.

562
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,546
Think that speed freak did this?

563
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,751
Who knows? 30
French and curved Kelly.

564
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,589
Can you see the cords?

565
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,960
Throat was slashed but
not the trachea. I'm in.

566
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,294
Me too. Mg of atropine.

567
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,567
The left lung is up.

568
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,138
He was pretty bloody. - Who?

569
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,673
Meth-pipe boy. And
he was hallucinating.

570
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,676
Laceration to the left axilla.

571
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,939
V-fib. LEWIS:
Paddles. Charge to 200.

572
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,983
Stabbing victim, right? Is
she a surgical candidate?

573
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,287
Not a very good one.

574
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,286
Clear.

575
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,982
- Still V-fib.
- Her husband's next door. Try him.

576
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,390
Charge to 300. Clear.

577
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,858
Ten stab wounds,
mainly abdominal.

578
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,000
Still hypotensive, 64/48.

579
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,465
Hang another two
on the rapid infuser.

580
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,967
Home invasion? Robbery gone bad?

581
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,799
Gotta be more
personal than that.

582
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,201
Where are you?

583
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,172
- Free belly fluid with hypotension.
- Urine negative for heme.

584
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,472
- Cops said their house was broken into.
- They could know who did it.

585
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,808
Good breath sounds. Red
line for an open laparotomy.

586
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,475
Hang two grams of cefotetan.

587
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,616
How come there's
only men in here?

588
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:13,619
- Ectopy.
- Probably ischemia from the hypotension.

589
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,956
- Let's do a subclavian.
- And keep the blood pouring in.

590
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,930
Clear.

591
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,834
- Asystole. It's been 40 minutes.
- And eight units of O-neg.

592
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:28,196
I guess that's it, Clara.
Time of death: 10:54.

593
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,372
Hope this wasn't evidence.

594
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:38,479
Look. I guess it was related.

595
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:43,681
Settle down. MAN:
No! Let me go! Let go!

596
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,448
Look, I didn't even do anything!

597
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,021
I didn't know them!
Let me go! Let me go!

598
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,722
- Hey. So, what's the story?
- Kid went nuts, stabbed his parents.

599
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,265
Killed one of them, right?

600
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,168
Starting to ascend.

601
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,433
- Thank God.
- You did great.

602
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:08,376
More like Samuel survived despite me.
- No, seriously. You did great.

603
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,878
- You okay?
- I'm feeling a little funny.

604
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,417
- Are you having chest pain?
- A bit.

605
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:18,353
- Abort ascent.
<i>- What? No.</i>

606
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,227
- There's crepitus and sub-Q emphysema.
- Probably blew out a few air sacs.

607
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,193
- Oh, no.
- Rapid ascent could collapse a lung.

608
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,457
We better do an
hour-long decompression.

609
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,759
Another hour?

610
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,967
How long will he be under?

611
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:35,335
Four hours. Make the
next units type-specific.

612
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,841
- We need to get his statement.
- This man's been stabbed 11 times.

613
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,673
Let him survive surgery first.

614
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,944
- Hello.
- Hello.

615
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,088
So, what brings you to the ER?

616
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,393
Transcatheter embolization of
pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.

617
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,765
That's quite a mouthful.

618
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,997
- And you?
- Stabbing victim.

619
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,265
Lacerated liver and
spleen, open laparotomy...

620
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,169
thoracoscopy and
pericardiectomy.

621
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,710
Push the executive
session to next week.

622
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,075
And tell Anspaugh
to contact me...

623
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,741
before scheduling meetings
I'm expected to attend.

624
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,520
Do you think you'd
like to go out sometime?

625
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:27,886
Sure.

626
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,553
Good.

627
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:36,195
- I'll call.
- Yeah, you do that.

628
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,005
I thought you were
dating a teacher.

629
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,098
I am.

630
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:50,247
Prostate cancer with back pain and leg
weakness cannot wait a day for an MRI.

631
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:53,385
- Sign here and here.
- You know, we're short-staffed too.

632
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,248
Dr. Lewis, we got
Chuck on line one.

633
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,323
You know what? I'll call him
back. You have five minutes...

634
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,790
to hire someone because
I'm sending this guy up.

635
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,328
- Rough day?
- Just typical.

636
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,863
Mom's staring at the
clock. About the baby?

637
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:11,401
- Oh, crap! How long ago was it?
- Two hours.

638
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,062
Just tell them I'm pregnant and
maybe they'll cut me some slack.

639
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,267
And I'll have someone bring
Mom down to the chamber.

640
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,410
Yeah, I'll get a wheelchair
and take her myself.

641
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,279
Are you almost done?
I need to check labs.

642
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,612
Can you use one of
the other terminals?

643
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,278
- What are you doing over here?
- None of your beeswax.

644
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,822
Dinovo's asking for a
new albuterol prescription.

645
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,620
Labs are back on our
orphan. Positive for strep.

646
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,764
We can't treat her
without parental consent.

647
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,626
What's wrong?

648
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,465
I'm okay.

649
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:48,170
You seem kind of...
Don't read into things.

650
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,035
Excuse me.

651
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,870
Hey, Mr. Grover, you're back.

652
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,037
Where's my daughter?

653
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,376
- Isn't it your job to know?
- Sorry?

654
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,643
- Dr. Kovac examined Christy.
- She has strep throat.

655
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,654
But worse, she's been
traumatized by being left alone here.

656
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,489
- What happened? Is she okay?
- She's fine.

657
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,891
No, she's not. There are drunks
here. Junkies. Psych patients.

658
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,032
Yeah, and doctors and
security guards and nurses.

659
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,328
She's 10. She could have wandered
away, been abducted, assaulted.

660
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,495
- Luka?
- What? He abandoned her.

661
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,630
I'm a single dad, okay?

662
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,639
I gotta feed my
kid, so I gotta work.

663
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,942
What can I do when it takes
six hours to see a doctor?

664
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:31,015
- Daddy!
- Honey! Are you okay?

665
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,673
Did anybody bother you?

666
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:35,218
Give her 250 of pen VK.

667
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,055
He responded
well to the therapy.

668
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:44,890
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay. It looks worse than it is.

669
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,997
- Are they ready yet?
- Yeah. They just came out.

670
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,932
- Hey. Is this Mom? LEWIS:
Yeah. Can she see him?

671
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,539
Yeah. He can see her.

672
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,006
He opened his eyes
a few minutes ago.

673
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,445
Hi, Samuel.

674
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:07,246
- It's Mommy.
- Spontaneous movement.

675
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,418
He'll need another round of
treatment tomorrow but he looks good.

676
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,659
When can he go home?

677
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:19,559
Three days. He'll need to be in
the NICU overnight for observation...

678
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,960
and you'll be in OB.

679
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:31,068
We didn't plan on having a
third. Thank God he came along.

680
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,789
Neela, what are you
still doing in there?

681
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:48,290
Possible pneumomediastinum,
among other things.

682
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,195
You should've had
someone replace you.

683
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,997
- Hi. Thanks, Gina. Hey.
- Hey.

684
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:03,004
- Bye.
- Bye.

685
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,774
How was the aquarium?
See any sharks?

686
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,244
Yep.

687
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:12,077
Maybe you and me could just
hang out by ourselves tonight.

688
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,118
We haven't really had a
chance to talk about things.

689
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,812
Like you and Luka having sex?

690
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:22,927
Well, that wasn't how I was
gonna put it. But, yeah, that.

691
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,154
What's there to talk about?

692
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,424
I don't know, how you feel.

693
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,300
Whether or not it hurts your
feelings or pisses you off or whatever.

694
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,372
I'm fine.

695
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,621
- How's the baby?
- Great. How's the rest of the family?

696
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,519
Just finishing dispo orders
on Dad and the other kids now.

697
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:58,026
Oh, man. What a hell of a
day. It's not even lunch yet.

698
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,994
You only got half a shift to go.

699
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,360
- When did you become so optimistic?
- Recently.

700
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,002
Dr. Carter, come have a look.

701
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,172
Kem? KEM: <i>John, is that you?</i>

702
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,971
Oh, my... Yeah! Oh, my
God! How did you do this?

703
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,478
I found out the
consulate had a web cam.

704
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,174
You look great. How are you?

705
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,343
She can hear me? JERRY: Yeah.

706
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,085
<i>See for yourself.</i>

707
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,088
<i>What do you think?</i>

708
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,694
How come some women
have little volleyball tummies...

709
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:32,922
when they're pregnant?

710
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,867
- Wow.
- And others don't?

711
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,430
<i>- I felt a kick yesterday.</i>
- Really?

712
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,434
High-speed MVA
with multiple fractures.

713
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,440
Oh, I got it.

714
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:48,108
<i>What do you think?</i>

715
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,713
I think you're both beautiful.

716
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:02,858
- You get the V/Q results?
- Normal. Negative Dopplers on the legs.

717
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,057
So no PE. That's good.

718
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,361
Well, he still needs to be admitted for
pneumonia, get him on IV antibiotics.

719
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,629
You knew that was gonna
happen. It's common at his age.

720
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,704
At least you're
amongst friends here.

721
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,641
So how long you gonna do this?

722
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,281
Take care of him 24/7?

723
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,749
You know there are
assisted-living situations...

724
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,649
My father's going to get better.

725
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,747
Jing-Mei...

726
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:45,768
I was at the hotel, asleep,
when my mother died.

727
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,932
She was all alone.

728
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,013
Breathe.

729
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,153
- Your breath sounds are equal.
- I'm fine.

730
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,619
But once we're out,
you'll need a chest x-ray.

731
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,418
- How much longer?
- Three feet and rising.

732
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,754
Come on. Come on.

733
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,328
If it is pneumomediastinum,
it'll resolve on its own.

734
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:16,025
- Excuse me.
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

735
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,037
Out of the way, please!

736
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,974
Hey. NEELA: Excuse me.

737
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,549
- Watch yourself!
- What the hell?

738
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,835
- Regular here?
- Yeah. Every Tuesday with his buddies.

739
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:56,463
- Black Hawks fan?
- Maple Leafs. Don't ask.

740
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:58,408
Hi, Dad.

741
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,808
I thought you said 6.
Ordered you a beer.

742
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:09,746
- There's someone I'd like you to meet.
- He's nuts! That was not a crosscheck!

743
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,220
<i>Lugay now in the box.
Shooting down across...</i>

744
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,819
- What?
- Chuck Martin. Pleased to meet you, sir.

745
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,961
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

746
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,065
You two had dinner yet?

747
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,578
I'm gonna have a baby and Chuck's
the father. You're gonna be a grandpa.

748
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:39,214
They couldn't score a
goal to save their lives.

749
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:45,421
- You marrying her?
- If she'll have me.

750
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,522
About damn time.
