1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,803
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,503
We belong together,
Sam, Alex and I.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,008
Sam knows that.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,008
- Two weekends a month...
- Not enough.

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,811
- At the discretion of the Lopezes.
- I get to see my son at their discretion?

6
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,977
- Does that make sense?
- The worst thing...

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,089
is violate the judge's order as
we go into a custody hearing.

8
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,097
Remember a kid with
high blood pressure?

9
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,716
Tell him to get to the clinic...

10
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,830
- sometime before he's 30. CHEN:
17-year-old with pulmonary edema.

11
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,863
- Elgin? WOMAN:
There's no heartbeat.

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,433
Not genetic. It
was just bad luck.

13
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,200
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,207
I haven't started yet.

15
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,811
Okay, little pinch.

16
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,004
Hey, you put in your
schedule request yet?

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,649
- Yeah, why?
- Because Alex has his teacher-parent...

18
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,876
thing next Monday,
and I'm on all week.

19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,884
- I can swap Friday.
- Find another nurse.

20
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,388
Can't have one of our interns
changing bedpans during their residency.

21
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,892
Yeah, I'm still waiting
for my board results.

22
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,358
Call the USMLE.

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,159
It's multiple choice, for
God's sake, not rocket science.

24
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,098
Okay. All done. All done.

25
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,572
You are God's gift to
nursing, you know that?

26
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,176
- So Monday for Friday?
- I thought you were starting.

27
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,314
Yeah, well, not till I pass my
boards. I can't quit my day job.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,346
- Morning.
- I thought you'd left already.

29
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,678
Orientation doesn't
start till this afternoon.

30
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,513
Figured I'd take
care of loose ends.

31
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,146
Return my microscope to the histology
lab, hand over supply-room keys...

32
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,226
- and sell my textbooks.
- This is your last day of freedom.

33
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,090
Why don't you read the paper,
go to the movies, sleep in?

34
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,529
Right, do as I say, not as I do.

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,694
- You find a place yet?
- I'll have a look while I'm there today.

36
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,832
- Are you a doctor?
- No, but...

37
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,168
Yes, actually, she's
just not on duty right now.

38
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,835
I got my hand slammed in a car door.
I'm supposed to get a dose of morphine.

39
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,675
If you just wait there, I'll
take care of that for you.

40
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,580
Refer to yourself properly. You'll never
gain any confidence with your patients.

41
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,220
Doesn't feel quite earned yet.

42
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,855
Fake it till it does.

43
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,720
- Where did you match?
- University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

44
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,225
Well, we'll miss you,
but I hear it's quite nice.

45
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,261
Yeah, a.k.a. rich and easy.

46
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,697
Unlike my friend Abby, who's decided
to stay at County and do God's work.

47
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,770
Just like the rest of us
suckers. Hey, check this out.

48
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,569
The doctor is in.

49
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:26,642
Five-speed automatic, 340
horsepower, 5.7-liter Hemi...

50
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,907
V8 with MDS and ESP.

51
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,778
I'm assuming those
are good things.

52
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,045
Man, this is tight.
What'd you drive before?

53
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,712
- Nothing. I finally got the prize.
- So you won this?

54
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,615
What? No. Paying for
it out of my own pocket.

55
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,727
Not everybody gets
money from Mom and Pop.

56
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,260
- Really.
- Really.

57
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,625
- Jing-Mei, take a look.
- I'm sorry, I'm late.

58
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,891
So are you leasing
this or did you buy it?

59
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,400
What do you think? I'm
still a resident, remember?

60
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,061
Hey, get that beast out
of here. This is a hospital.

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,902
Which is convenient because
if you ding this, you die.

62
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,603
- Hey, is this the intractable vomiting?
- Seventy-five, end-stage colon cancer.

63
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,577
Liver mets, fever
and abdominal pain.

64
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,978
I'd better go. There's a
patient I wanna check on.

65
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,119
Call me. Let me know
how it goes. Hold it.

66
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,345
BP's 92/64. Looks
pretty jaundiced.

67
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,150
- Who's your oncologist, sir?
- Don't have one.

68
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,782
Says that chemo wasn't working so
he signed himself out a few weeks ago.

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,453
- What about your primary-care doctor?
- Fired him. I wanted to die at home.

70
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,795
Called 911 anyway.
Guess he changed his mind.

71
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,874
- Need any help?
- Yeah, I do. Thanks.

72
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,057
Hey.

73
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,496
Thanks.

74
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,532
You stay in your
seat. Stay in your seat.

75
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,636
I need you to sit down
in your seat, okay?

76
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,501
- But, Mommy, I have to go.
- I know, honey. Just hold on. Okay?

77
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,666
I think my battery's dead.

78
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,973
Come on, lady. Move it!

79
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,480
- I think I have cables in here somewhere.
- It's okay. I got it.

80
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,589
- Dr. Carter, I was sorry to hear about...
- Thanks.

81
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,390
Wife says to let us know if
you need her to bring dinner.

82
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,398
We will. Okay,
we've got eye pain.

83
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,471
We've got swollen ankle,
excessive coughing, headache, gout...

84
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,631
- You all right?
- Headache. Yeah. How is Henry?

85
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,074
Haven't seen him all
week. We're in court today.

86
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,544
- Helps to keep busy.
- Yeah.

87
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,742
Okay, Chuny, fluorescein, saline
bullets and a Wood's lamp, all in Exam 4.

88
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,113
You got it.

89
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,119
We need paramedics. There's a
woman wedged between two cars.

90
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,952
She's awake and alert.
Yeah, State and 14th.

91
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,854
- Can you feel me touching
your legs? LINDA: No. No.

92
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,965
- Where's Michael?
- Are you having any trouble breathing?

93
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,101
- Get me out!
- How's the boy?

94
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,295
- I don't know. The door's jammed.
- I'll be right there.

95
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,769
Michael!

96
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,135
Okay, help is coming.
Just hang in there, okay?

97
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,504
That guy came barreling
through the cones.

98
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,169
- It's crazy.
- There's a first-aid kit in my trunk.

99
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,610
- Hurry.
- I'll get it.

100
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,613
Help me get it open. Come on.

101
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,488
- Michael.
- Hey, where do you think you're going?

102
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,184
Somebody stop him, damn it!

103
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,658
- Temp's up. One-oh-two-point-eight.
- No septic workup, though, right?

104
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,825
I don't need a workup.
I need ampicillin.

105
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,733
We can't give you anything
until the doctor examines you.

106
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,167
Now, is there anyone...

107
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,830
- you'd like us to call?
- No.

108
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,843
- Hi, Richard. I'm Dr. Chen.
- It's Mr. Gould.

109
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,505
Doesn't anybody teach
manners anymore?

110
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,844
Looks like you're a little
jaundiced, Mr. Gould.

111
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,985
- Any advanced directives?
- Yeah, DNR, but he wants antibiotics.

112
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:06,559
Sir, it's entirely possible these
symptoms are due to your colon cancer.

113
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,661
Antibiotics will do
nothing to help that.

114
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,126
I'm not ready.

115
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,733
We can figure out why you have a fever
or we can just treat you for your pain.

116
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,904
I said, I'm not ready!

117
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,333
Okay.

118
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:24,007
CBC, lytes, liver panel, blood cultures
times two, Zosyn 3.75 piggyback?

119
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,840
- Thought you were a nurse today.
- Abby's a nurse every day.

120
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,346
That's why she's
gonna kick ass as a doc.

121
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,179
How'd you score on the
boards? I never heard.

122
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:36,084
- Me either.
- Oh. Pretty close to the wire, isn't it?

123
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,885
Yeah. Listen, Dr. Chen,
is everything okay?

124
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,894
Um, give Mr. Gould two
liters of saline wide open...

125
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:46,693
10 of Reglan and four of
morphine once the pressure's up.

126
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,866
Hey. Where you been? Pardon me.

127
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,265
I took a few days off. My dad had
10 different doctor appointments.

128
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,170
- Nice car, by the way.
- Wait a minute. What happened there?

129
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,279
- Nothing, really.
- It doesn't look like nothing.

130
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,779
My dad's not sleeping well,
so I'm not sleeping well...

131
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,420
and I forgot to turn on a light
and ran into a door. Excuse me.

132
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,921
Dr. Pratt.

133
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,559
Damn, how many times I
gotta say goodbye to you?

134
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,422
I wanted to say bye to Elgin.

135
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,790
He's going home today.
Were you planning on it?

136
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,023
- Planning on what?
- Seeing him.

137
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,565
- Yeah, sure.
- Because he asked.

138
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,965
I get the impression
he looks up to you.

139
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,231
- Figured he was smarter.
- He could use a positive male figure...

140
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,568
in his life right about now.

141
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,542
Yeah, well, I'm
nobody's role model.

142
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,307
- Is he all right?
- Don't worry.

143
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,749
- They're taking care of him.
- Sir, clear the area.

144
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,754
- I'm a doctor.
- If this blade breaks you'll kiss metal.

145
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,619
- Please.
- Get your ass out of there!

146
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,818
Okay. Just hang on.

147
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,602
Okay, put direct pressure
on anything that bleeds.

148
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,071
Four of morphine and
one more liter of saline.

149
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,801
Get me the biggest
BP cuff you've got.

150
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,742
- How are you doing, Linda?
- Need to call my husband.

151
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,973
We will, but we need
to get you to a hospital.

152
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,414
Bolus saline on the pressure
bags. What's her BP?

153
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,578
108/70. Look, doc, we've protocols to
follow and you've broken most of them.

154
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,486
- Ten liters of O2. Let's go.
- Sorry, it's just us in the rig.

155
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,321
Oh, please, don't leave me.
- You can follow us...

156
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,123
- in your car if you want.
- I'm going with her.

157
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,869
Excuse me. Looking
for a kid named Elgin.

158
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,668
- Down at the end on the left.
- Thanks.

159
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,310
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What's up, doc?

160
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,710
How you doing?

161
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,182
Good. Just waiting on my mother
to come get me. My cousin's driving.

162
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,189
So, what have we
learned from all this?

163
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,022
Five a day, exercise some
and find myself a job...

164
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,321
at a vegetable stand
or something, I guess.

165
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,457
Good man.

166
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,635
Well, all right, then.
Take care of yourself.

167
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,635
Yo, doc, you got an
office somewhere?

168
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,999
Me?

169
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,666
We don't really have a doctor. I was
thinking maybe we could come see you.

170
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,517
Yeah, look. I just
work in the ER.

171
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:22,088
People come in, I see them once,
twice tops. That's it, you know?

172
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,690
Well, maybe we could
hook up something then.

173
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,519
The family clinic can help
you with whatever you need.

174
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,524
Just give them a call.
Tell them I sent you.

175
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,002
Stay on your meds.

176
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,106
- Guess he just got spooked.
- Midshaft clavicular fracture.

177
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,871
- That's a dangerous sport.
- He's usually steady...

178
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,378
except for that time
he refused to jump.

179
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,608
There's minimal
tenting. You're very lucky.

180
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,685
- This is not gonna need surgery.
- Broke my leg in two places.

181
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,255
Immobilization, Motrin for pain?
CARTER: Yep. Month in a sling.

182
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,517
The good news is
that will heal on its own.

183
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,161
But I'll miss the
Lamplight Classic.

184
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,565
- Get her a follow-up with Ortho.
- Be right back.

185
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,794
Wish I was that
fearless when I was 15.

186
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:14,065
- Is that fearless or is that reckless?
- She is fearless. I was reckless.

187
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,573
Hey, look, I didn't
wanna bug you earlier...

188
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,076
because you've heard
it from everybody, but...

189
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,147
Hey, Taggart, that juvenile
delinquent of yours is MIA.

190
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,079
- What?
- School called. He's a no-show.

191
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,049
Probably just out lighting fires
and torturing small animals.

192
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,815
- Alex playing hooky?
- More like his dad is.

193
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,891
Hey, it's me. Pick up.
Come on. Anybody home?

194
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,086
She's got it rough
with him, doesn't she?

195
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,129
Which one, the kid or the ex?

196
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,292
- Both.
- How are you and Kem doing?

197
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,406
- You'll get through this.
- Hey, Peaches and Herb...

198
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,944
multiple MVAs one minute out,
including a woman nearly cut in half.

199
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,979
Got control of the major
bleeders, but she's tachy.

200
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,141
We need Trauma, Ortho
and Vascular here now!

201
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,158
Thought you were working nights.
- I am.

202
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,757
Give her another five of morphine
and as much O-neg as you can get.

203
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,483
- Who do you got?
- Seven-year-old male...

204
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,755
unrestrained, tachy at 138. BP, 102/56,
multiple lacs to the scalp and face.

205
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,490
- It hurts.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Carter.

206
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,794
We're gonna take very
good care of you, okay?

207
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,934
- Who are you?
- My name's Abby. What's your name?

208
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,472
Antwan Coles, 20-year-old driver of
vehicle number three. Airbag deployed.

209
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:26,170
Vitals are good, but he's definitely
altered. Think I smell a little ETOH.

210
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,440
- How you doing, Antwan?
- Need to get me out.

211
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,878
No sign of head trauma.

212
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,143
Pinpoint pupils, shallow
resps, bradycardia.

213
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,843
- Push two of Narcan.
- Right here?

214
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,182
Yeah, unless you need
some practice intubating.

215
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,724
- You been shooting up, sniffing?
- No, nothing like that.

216
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,361
Pulse ox down to 82.
PRATT: Just give it a second.

217
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,394
Ah! PRATT: Come on. Let's go.

218
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,530
- You gotta back me up, brother.
- I'm Dr. Pratt.

219
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,262
You're under suspicion of DUI,
and you sure as hell ain't my brother.

220
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,808
I can't feel my legs.

221
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,747
- Got a flash.
- Am I paralyzed?

222
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,819
You received a lot of pain
meds, and you're in shock.

223
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,716
It affects your sensation.
- I'm in.

224
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,485
- Guide wire's ready.
- How's she doing?

225
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,160
Pelvic fracture by exam,
small fluid in Morrison's.

226
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,297
And hypotension. AP chest
and pelvis are on the way.

227
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,498
I'm Dr. Corday. I'm
a trauma surgeon.

228
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,134
You're bleeding internally.
We'll take you to the O.R.

229
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,565
What about my son?

230
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,505
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't know.

231
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,532
Michael's in good hands, Linda.

232
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,735
Distal pulses before
the cuffs were placed?

233
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,277
Ask Kovac. He examined her.

234
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,041
I couldn't tell. Take down
the cuffs, she bottoms out.

235
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,547
Wait till you're in the O.R.

236
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,881
Gram of Ancef, 200 of gent and
DT, if you haven't already done it.

237
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,114
- Why were you in the field?
- Good Samaritan.

238
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,224
Systolic's 74, pulse, 130.

239
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,724
Another unit of O-neg
and get the rapid infuser.

240
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,863
Got it. CORDAY: Page
Ortho down here 911.

241
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,759
Shallow resps,
good femoral pulses.

242
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,593
- You need the infuser?
- No. It's yours.

243
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,930
Tachy at 165, sats are only 84.
- Mommy!

244
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,538
- She's right next door, honey.
- Mommy!

245
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,402
I can't get the
labs. He's thrashing.

246
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,702
Belly's soft. Give him
two more of morphine.

247
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,811
Michael, we're gonna
make you feel better...

248
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:10,882
- but you got to settle down, okay?
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

249
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,583
He's on his way. Run
in a liter of warm saline.

250
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:16,313
Let's get this mask
back on you, buddy.

251
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,621
- Michael? Michael!
- BP's 74/37. He's bottoming out.

252
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,594
All right, we need to intubate.
Four-point-five uncuffed, 2 Mac Blade.

253
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,756
Come on! What are
we waiting for? Let's go!

254
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,132
Five cm lac over the deltoid.

255
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,934
Must've hit the doorframe
when he was trying to leave.

256
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,303
You don't know that.

257
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,139
- You don't know nothing, bitch.
- Hey, watch your language.

258
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,304
- No Attendings here?
- Got their hands full.

259
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,645
Urine tested positive for opiates.
Woke up cold with Narcan.

260
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,615
My guess, heroin by nose.

261
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,402
Get a CT, check for
bleeding or fractures.

262
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:50,746
Can I go after that?

263
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,585
Dog, you caused an accident.

264
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,319
No, an accident is when bad
things happen for no reason.

265
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,760
You were high
and ran into people.

266
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,956
Sew him up. Let
the cops sort this out.

267
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,693
- Decreased on the left.
- This one of the MVC patients?

268
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,804
- Mom's next door.
- Blunt chest trauma...

269
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,497
hypotensive, hypoxic
secondary to a tension pneumo.

270
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,699
- How old?
- Seven. Get an 18-gauge angiocath...

271
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,539
- and chest tube tray.
- Pulse is 78. He's bradying down.

272
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,772
That's gonna get worse till we
get compressed air off his chest.

273
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,474
- C-spine, chest, ab and pelvis?
- No, he's not stable.

274
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,517
Pulse ox, 84.

275
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,155
- I'll assist Dr. Carter. Ten blade.
- I got it.

276
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,813
- Dr. Weaver?
- Ten blade.

277
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:28,655
- You'll be late for court.
- I don't need any help with a chest tube.

278
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,161
- Good breath sounds.
- Systolic's drifting down.

279
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,050
- Another liter of NS.
- We need more O-neg.

280
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,168
- Is my husband here?
- Not yet.

281
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,064
Can you assist Dr. Carter?

282
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,672
- Ortho's here. We need bleachers.
- Get X-ray back to check line placement.

283
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,810
- Is he in trouble?
- No, it's just...

284
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,969
I'm afraid he's too
emotionally vulnerable.

285
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,842
Need an intubation tray.

286
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,177
- What, are you saying that he can't...?
- Do it.

287
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,013
- Wow, pretty ugly stuff.
- She can hear you. She is conscious.

288
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,815
Diastolic's dropping.

289
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,332
What happened
to Dr. Chen's face?

290
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,688
We might salvage with a BKA.

291
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:02,192
Which will be a nonissue when she
bleeds out from a massive hepatic lac.

292
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,762
Tube her, get her to
the O.R. for an ex-lap.

293
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,695
No. I wanna wait for my husband.

294
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,836
A laparotomy and a BKA.
We're double-teaming.

295
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,564
- What's BKA? What are they saying?
- You need surgery.

296
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,418
<i>And receive
placement assistance...</i>

297
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,888
<i>anywhere in the USA.</i>

298
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,687
<i>Don't wait any longer to
enter the exciting world of...</i>

299
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,626
Lost the pulse.

300
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,301
- That's P.E.A. Epi, 3 cc's.
- Starting compressions.

301
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,266
- Come on. CHEN: Abby,
check the Thora-Seal.

302
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,633
- That's not it.
- Maybe the tube's kinked.

303
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,740
- Or in a false tract.
- No, it's not it.

304
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,707
18-gauge angiocath and
another chest tube tray.

305
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,541
The mediastinum's not
widened. There's no crepitus.

306
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,945
- Holding compressions.
- V-tach.

307
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,881
- Charging to 40.
- Normal heart, no chronic lung disease.

308
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,078
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Clear.

309
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,917
- Still V-tach.
- Okay, come on. Needle. Let's go!

310
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,398
- Sinus at 58.
- Too slow. Another round of epi.

311
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,597
- Abby, that Gould guy's asking for you.
- Who?

312
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,902
- End-stage cancer with the antibiotics.
- Did you tell him I'm busy?

313
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,772
No, I wasn't gonna
deal with his ass.

314
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,641
Come on. Who's in and who's out?

315
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,282
- I'm in.
- Come on, .6 of atropine.

316
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,145
- You called?
- When am I getting my own room?

317
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,520
- It's noisy. It stinks.
- You'll get it when one becomes available.

318
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,752
- Don't patronize me.
- I'm not.

319
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,454
Fever's down. What do you need?

320
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,792
I dealt with a million
smart alecks like you.

321
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,798
Think you know
everything, you know crap.

322
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,528
Okay. Well, then, I'll be
back to check on you later.

323
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:56,267
- I was a teacher. Junior high. 37 years.
- I bet you were the kids' favorite.

324
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,536
- Weaver's on line one.
- Can you take a message?

325
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,441
She's in her car.

326
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,510
Hi, Dr. Weaver.

327
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,517
<i>Have you called the USMLE
for your board results?</i>

328
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,949
I haven't had a chance.

329
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,021
<i>- Well, are you going to?</i>
- Yeah. Fine.

330
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,124
<i>- Fine.</i>
- Okay.

331
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,326
- I'll be back.
- Whatever.

332
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,164
Frank, you have the number
for the USMLE around anywhere?

333
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,497
Do I look like 411? Here.

334
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,666
Let your fingers do the walking.

335
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:32,176
Excuse me, nurse. My
family was in an accident.

336
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,545
- Sinus.
- Weak carotid.

337
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,378
- It's better than nothing.
- 500 of NS, another HemoCue...

338
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,679
and let's get some
warm blankets.

339
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,651
- Heart rate's dropping. 48.
- Damn it!

340
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,587
- Starting compressions.
- All right, epi. Let's go. Mark time.

341
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,056
Michael?

342
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,922
- This the father?
- Yeah.

343
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,859
- What happened?
- Holding compressions.

344
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,091
He suffered severe trauma
to his chest in the accident.

345
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,895
His lung's collapsed, and
it's compromising his heart.

346
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,594
- We lost the pulse.
- Oh, my God.

347
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,070
- Let the doctors work.
- You have to do something.

348
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,402
- Pericardiocentesis needle.
- Not in tamponade.

349
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,976
I know.

350
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,012
Hey!

351
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,549
Open up!

352
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,385
You're home early.

353
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,253
What do you think you're doing?

354
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,087
We're watching TV. Why?

355
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,234
Because Alex is supposed
to be in school, that's why.

356
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,735
- Dad said it was okay.
- Well, it's not exactly his call, is it?

357
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,238
- I'm out of here. Later.
- I'll speak to you soon.

358
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,775
Can I speak with you a minute?

359
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,444
You can't do this. You can't pull
him out of school when you feel like it.

360
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,245
I wanted to take
the kid with me...

361
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,412
- You're high.
- What?

362
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,786
You smoked dope in front of him?

363
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:56,326
No, I went outside. I took a few
rips when he was watching TV.

364
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,465
- And it's no big deal, okay?
- Maybe not to you, but to me it is.

365
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,192
The reason I kept him out
was I wanted to take him...

366
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,202
Where? To an arcade or a movie?

367
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,500
- Or your dealer's house?
- To my interview, okay? Interview.

368
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,306
- All right?
- What?

369
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,206
He got, like, the
coolest job ever.

370
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,179
He's gonna manage this building and
they're gonna give him a place to stay.

371
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:20,615
Yeah, it's on upper Dearborn. It's
two-bedroom, two-bath, fully remodeled.

372
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,715
So now I can live with Dad too.

373
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,691
The judge will ask questions about
how you plan on caring for him...

374
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,126
while you're at work.

375
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,029
Meaning I'm less of a parent
if I have to hire a nanny.

376
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,329
- The Lopezes are retired...
- They're elderly.

377
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,701
They may not be alive long enough
for Henry to get to high school.

378
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,808
And can offer a
larger support system.

379
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,036
So now I'm being penalized
for not having a big family?

380
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,477
This is a conservative judge.

381
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,549
Her idea of what represents
the best interests to the family...

382
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,881
is pretty basic: two parents,
a man and a woman.

383
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,888
Unless she's planning to take the children
of every single parent in Chicago...

384
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,993
and place them with a heterosexual
couple, she's a hypocrite.

385
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,789
- I don't disagree.
- It's a myth.

386
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:07,627
This idea that there's some perfect
setting that everyone gets raised in.

387
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,894
You need to outline how
you're gonna provide...

388
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,628
a stable, consistent
lifestyle for him.

389
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,507
They brought him.

390
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,975
Sit back down.

391
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:24,174
If you interact, it could get volatile,
and that's not gonna help you in court.

392
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,182
He's grown.

393
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,327
You okay in here?

394
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,667
Who was that guy?

395
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,832
He's just some guy who had
a business proposition for me.

396
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:59,185
Look, Sam, just so you know, I
wasn't planning on staying, okay.

397
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,287
It just all kind of
fell into my lap...

398
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,551
which makes me think it
was supposed to happen.

399
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,290
You know, this manager
job is no great shakes...

400
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,862
but it'll keep me here
and, I don't know...

401
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,591
maybe I can go to night
school or something.

402
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,570
You know what Alex
said to me the other day?

403
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,103
What?

404
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,440
He said, "I love you, Dad."

405
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,778
Anyways, um...

406
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,249
I've got a bunch of furniture
with a buddy in Dallas...

407
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:43,556
and I figure I'd leave today, and
come back maybe this weekend.

408
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:50,092
Hey, maybe when I get back,
you and Alex can help me paint.

409
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,109
Sam.

410
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,777
Okay.

411
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,942
I'll see you soon.

412
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,482
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

413
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:17,187
I'm gonna take off. You
wanna walk me to my car?

414
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,525
Why can't I just go
to Dallas with you?

415
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,624
Because you got
school, that's why.

416
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,681
- You have to stay in bed.
- Need to use the restroom.

417
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,478
But you're dehydrated, and
your blood pressure is low.

418
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,622
- Let me get you a bedpan.
- Can't a person die with dignity here?

419
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,690
- I want a toilet!
- Okay, okay.

420
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,793
You have to let me help you.

421
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,024
Hold on.

422
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,967
So, what have I got, a week?

423
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,333
Three days, huh?

424
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,270
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

425
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,882
What subject?

426
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,550
Algebra.

427
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,550
Thirty-seven years.

428
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:25,924
Taught over 4000 13-year-olds.

429
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,194
What the hell for?

430
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,371
Well, I'm sure
you had an impact.

431
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,739
Oh, right.

432
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,347
And at the end, you're
alone, and you get cancer.

433
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:45,415
- I'm here.
- Yeah, only because you're paid to be.

434
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,782
- More laps and suction.
- BP's down to 78/40.

435
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,389
Ligate the femoral proximal
to the popliteal artery.

436
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,555
I can't control the
damn SMA bleeder.

437
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:58,755
Periosteum's shredded up to the midshaft,
and the perforating arteries are gone.

438
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:02,368
Dr. Kovac, you came after all.
- How is she?

439
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,698
On a scale of one
to 10, probably a four.

440
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,466
Repaired the spleen,
still oozing from the liver.

441
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,735
- Maxed out on dopa and Levo.
- Make that a three.

442
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,436
- Anything I can do?
- There's barely anything I can do.

443
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,946
Perry, start neo at
100 mics per minute.

444
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,214
That'll screw up
her distal perfusion.

445
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:23,049
Yes, well, the brain and heart
outrank the extremities, don't they?

446
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,589
- This is crazy.
- Atropine's in.

447
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,639
- He's got two chest tubes.
- Hold compressions.

448
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,423
- Pulseless.
- There's a huge air leak.

449
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,588
- He's got another pneumo.
- That's his third.

450
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:36,429
- Resume compressions.
- He's coding on and off for 40 minutes.

451
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,764
- Betadine and a 10 blade.
- Still P.E.A.

452
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,430
Another chest tube is not going
to fix it. His injuries are too severe.

453
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,601
- Somebody needs to talk to his dad.
- Well, think! I don't know!

454
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,007
- Another epi?
- No.

455
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,670
No.

456
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,577
Pulseless.

457
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,454
- I'm calling it.
- Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, okay.

458
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,352
We're pumping air in faster
than the chest tube can suck it out.

459
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,459
- What are you doing?
- Bypass the left.

460
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,117
Stick it all down
the right lung.

461
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,421
He's lacerated his left
mainstem bronchus.

462
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,825
Resume compressions.

463
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,160
Even if he did, he's been
deprived of oxygen too long.

464
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,926
Just give it 10 seconds.

465
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,702
Okay, hold compressions.

466
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:18,970
Got a pulse back, 82.
CHEN: Sats coming up.

467
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,943
Okay, call CT and Surg.
Let's redline him upstairs.

468
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,844
We saved him.

469
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,007
Mr. Pryor?

470
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,553
We think your son has a tear in his
airway and is gonna need surgery.

471
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,019
But he's gonna be okay?

472
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,490
The injury's very serious,
but we hope to be able to fix it.

473
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,986
- Do you know anything about my wife?
- Just that she's in the O.R.

474
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,156
Someone can take
you to the waiting room.

475
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,167
- Can I be with her?
- Um...

476
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,828
- Well, she is being operated on.
- She'd want me there.

477
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,999
- Dr. Carter, you got a minute?
- Uh, no, not really.

478
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,509
- It's about Jing-Mei.
- Can you give me a second?

479
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,978
Can you just have
a seat right there?

480
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,844
Yeah, did she seem okay to you?

481
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,349
No, neither one of us are
having our best day. Why?

482
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,511
- There's this bruise on her face.
- I saw it.

483
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,589
She says it was an
accident. I don't know.

484
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:05,917
She seeing somebody?

485
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,151
I don't think so. She's
focused on her dad.

486
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:11,388
- Think it was him?
- Maybe. Probably.

487
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,863
Look, I'd get into it myself, but
things are complicated between us.

488
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,198
- I don't think that she'll listen to me...
- Pratt, your DUI homeboy's back from CT.

489
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,102
- I'll talk to her.
- Thanks.

490
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:30,448
So looks like in addition to being high
on H, you were also legally drunk too.

491
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,847
How you think your boy
out there is gonna feel?

492
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,577
- You know what he says to me?
- What?

493
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,053
He said because it's my third
strike, I'm gonna have to do 25-to-life.

494
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:41,221
I'm 20 years old, doc.

495
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,224
- You hit a woman and a kid.
- Yeah, but life?

496
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,229
What, you think that's right?

497
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,061
I think it's the law. Hey.

498
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,136
Lido and a 4-0 Vicryl.

499
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,239
I ain't got nothing
nowhere anyway.

500
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,398
I mean, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

501
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,704
I don't know, go to
school, get a job maybe.

502
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,541
Yeah, right, man. Who
the hell's gonna hire me?

503
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,745
- You grow up in Winnetka or something?
- Cabrini-Green.

504
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,116
- So I don't wanna hear excuses.
- Oh, okay.

505
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,315
I guess that makes
you one lucky son of a...

506
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,584
Hey! It ain't about luck.

507
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,252
You know what? You right.

508
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,125
It ain't about luck.

509
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,268
I guess it's about not looking
back once you're gone.

510
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,937
Doc.

511
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,090
Mom? When are you making dinner?

512
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,453
- Mom?
- I'll deal with the clothes.

513
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:51,119
You put all the stuff that
you wanna keep in these.

514
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,821
- What?
- We're moving.

515
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,626
- No!
- Come on. Hurry up.

516
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,633
- I don't wanna go.
- You don't exactly have a choice.

517
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,137
- I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

518
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,140
- I like it here.
- Yeah, so did I.

519
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,004
- You're just being a bitch.
- What did you call me?

520
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,308
I'm sick of moving
because you're screwed up.

521
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,973
You know what I'm sick of, Alex?

522
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,278
I'm sick of pretending
your dad is a good guy.

523
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:18,151
I'm sick of keeping quiet about the crap
he's done and the stuff that he hasn't.

524
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,191
I'm sick of him tracking us
down every time he loses a job...

525
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,659
so he can buy you
presents to make you think...

526
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,027
he's actually a father because
he's not. He's a user, a loser...

527
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,498
and I am not gonna let
him turn you into one.

528
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,604
Now get your ass in that
room and start packing!

529
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:44,541
Last one. Cover with ABD
pads. I'll write post-op notes.

530
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,651
- So you saw the whole thing happen?
- Yeah, her car broke down.

531
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,982
- I stopped to help.
- She's lucky.

532
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:55,116
- Most people would've carried on driving.
- We've got an audience.

533
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,058
Must be the husband.

534
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,223
I'll go talk to him.

535
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,866
- How soon before she wakes up?
- That's hard to say.

536
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,701
- Mr. Pryor?
- Yes.

537
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,172
I'm Dr. Kovac.

538
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:14,871
I was with your wife at the scene of
the accident and during her surgery.

539
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,380
I'm gonna check
back in with you later.

540
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,609
Is she gonna be all right?

541
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:23,722
She suffered massive internal
injuries, and she lost a lot of blood.

542
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,382
- Oh, God.
- But we were able to stop the bleeding...

543
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,620
and we're confident that
she's gonna pull through.

544
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:34,927
But, uh, her legs
were severely injured...

545
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,537
and orthopedic surgeons
were not able to salvage them.

546
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:42,573
- What?
- We had to amputate.

547
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,138
In both legs?

548
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,245
I'm sorry.

549
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:03,217
Yeah, I took it a couple
weeks ago. Lockhart, Abigail.

550
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,757
I mean, I should've
gotten them by now, right?

551
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,765
Aren't you supposed to send
them to my home address?

552
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,800
<i>We sent them to
your work address.</i>

553
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,335
You're kidding.

554
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:15,440
Yeah, I will. Hey, Frank.

555
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,099
If I received a letter
here, would you tell me?

556
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,804
Hell, no. If a letter came, it
would be filed alphabetically...

557
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,111
in the mail drawer with everyone else's
crap. As if I didn't have enough to do.

558
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,083
Excuse me. I'm
looking for a patient.

559
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,746
Last name, Gould.

560
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,352
Let's see if he's awake.

561
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,327
Mr. Gould?

562
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,999
Who the hell is that?

563
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,001
It's your former student.

564
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,339
Hey, Mr. Gould.

565
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,447
Ed Minyard? I had
you for algebra.

566
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,641
In both '73 and '74.

567
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,987
Flunked you because you didn't
follow directions on your final.

568
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:06,023
Yeah, that'd be me.

569
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:11,154
- What are you doing here?
- I teach at Larchmont now.

570
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:15,664
Math, which is kind of karmic.

571
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:23,839
Someone called the school,
told us about your situation.

572
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,487
I've reviewed all the written testimony,
and I have follow-up questions.

573
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:41,183
Mr. and Mrs. Lopez, I
understand you're both retired.

574
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,850
Yes, Your Honor.

575
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,361
Can you describe your
physical condition currently?

576
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,829
My wife and I are both in
good health, Your Honor.

577
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,178
A statement from your
physician would verify this?

578
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,864
Yes.

579
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,396
Dr. Weaver, just to clarify.

580
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,566
Both your parents are deceased
and you have no siblings?

581
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,506
That's correct, Your Honor.

582
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,638
I'll take this under
submission, and parties

583
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:04,539
will be notified of
my decision when...

584
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,548
Your Honor?

585
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,051
I love my son.

586
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,713
Mr. Brooks, does your client
wish to address the court?

587
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,621
- No, Your Honor, she...
- And I loved Sandy very much.

588
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,591
- Kerry, please.
- Together, we decided to have a baby.

589
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:21,756
We chose a sperm donor, got
pregnant, had a miscarriage...

590
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,732
and together, we tried
it again. And that time...

591
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:29,068
thank God, we succeeded,
and we had Henry.

592
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,637
I was there when he
was born. I cut his cord.

593
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:39,216
We made our way through every
cold, every rash, every colicky night.

594
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,718
We fed our son and
changed him and bathed him.

595
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:47,255
We were a family,
whether any city, or state...

596
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:51,089
or country gives
us that recognition.

597
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,630
And we still are.

598
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,769
You'll be notified
of my decision.

599
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,636
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

600
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,110
All right, I'll be right back.

601
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,528
<i>- ER.</i>
- Yeah, can I speak to Dr. Kovac?

602
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,460
Yeah, just a minute.

603
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,327
For you.

604
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,530
- Hi, this is Dr. Kovac.
<i>- It's Alex. Could you come over?</i>

605
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,365
- My mom's freaking out. She...
- What are you doing?

606
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,668
Hello?

607
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:19,249
Surgery said that the
lung repair went very well.

608
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:26,055
He has my ears.

609
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,728
I was hoping he'd get my eyes.

610
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,260
Everything else was Linda.

611
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,265
That's probably a good thing.

612
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,467
You have kids?

613
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,403
No.

614
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,710
Honey?

615
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,608
I'm here, baby.

616
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:51,147
So is Michael. He's
right next to you.

617
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,817
What happened?

618
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,448
They had to take
your legs, honey.

619
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,827
But you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be good.

620
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,575
J, K...

621
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:19,668
- It's empty.
- Look under N.

622
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,973
- For Lockhart?
- For "Nurses."

623
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:36,784
Doctors' Lounge is on the third floor,
where I'm sure you'll be spending...

624
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,157
little or no time if you
know what's good for you.

625
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,325
My office is on the second floor, where
hopefully you'll spend even less time.

626
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,630
And in keeping with
orientation tradition...

627
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,138
some of our departing
third-year residents...

628
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,333
will escort you
to a local eatery...

629
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,343
where you will eat, drink
and pride yourselves...

630
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:58,973
on having matched at one of
the finest hospitals in the country.

631
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,611
So I'll see you all tomorrow
morning bright and early.

632
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,088
All right, who likes Mexican?

633
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,825
Make sure Dr. Goodman
sees me before he leaves.

634
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,691
We need the PPD
results from his file.

635
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:15,800
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Rasgotra.

636
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,232
Would it be possible to
speak with you privately?

637
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:22,636
Transitional internship
leading to Dermatology, right?

638
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,537
Right this way.

639
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,549
Ha!

640
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,316
Ha, ha! Ha.

641
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,546
- Good news?
- Yeah. I passed my boards.

642
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,815
- Really?
- Yeah.

643
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,251
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

644
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,524
Oh, God.

645
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,023
Sorry, I'm just...

646
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,737
- You going home?
- Yeah.

647
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,938
- Give Kem my best.
- I will.

648
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,041
Hey, Abby.

649
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,252
I never had a doubt in my mind.

650
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,291
Yeah!

651
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,561
So, what can I do for you?

652
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:28,662
I, uh, I don't know how
to go about this, but...

653
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:33,202
I never actually made
this choice for myself.

654
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:37,247
I mean, I told my parents in third
grade that I wanted to be a doctor...

655
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,384
and ever since then,
it's been assumed.

656
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,248
It's a good thing I never
said I wanted to join the circus.

657
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,122
I don't think I can do it.

658
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,061
I've been thinking about
it the whole way here...

659
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,258
and for the last
year, actually, and...

660
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,461
Are you withdrawing from
this residency program?

661
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,140
I'm sorry.

662
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,615
You're really leaving
us in quite a lurch.

663
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,150
What are you gonna do, then?

664
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,281
I'm not sure.

665
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:23,955
You understand you can't get
licensed without an internship.

666
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,992
I know.

667
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,969
You went to MIT after all.
- Yes.

668
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,763
What did you always used to say?
"Math is the true universal language."

669
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,469
"And love is for suckers."

670
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,043
Mr. Gould, this is Dori. She's
taking care of you tonight.

671
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:46,150
- Hi. ABBY: He's waiting
on a bed in Medicine.

672
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,617
You might wanna give them another call.
- Young lady?

673
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,689
- Me?
- Will you be my nurse again tomorrow?

674
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,993
No, I won't. Uh,
but I will be here.

675
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,323
Just ask for Dr. Lockhart.

676
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,001
Alex, come on. Get
in the car, please.

677
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:15,647
Alex, please. Come on, we'll
get something to eat on the way.

678
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,146
Sam! ALEX: Luka!

679
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,148
What happened? What's going on?
- Look.

680
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,288
- What are you doing?
- Alex and I have to leave.

681
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,990
- What?
- It's complicated.

682
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,025
- I don't understand.
- No one does.

683
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,561
I can't let it happen. I
can't let him get to my kid.

684
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,390
I'm sorry.

685
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,832
- I don't wanna go!
- Wait. Why are you doing this?

686
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,336
Sam, talk to me. Hey.

687
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,407
Sam!

688
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,180
Hi.

689
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:03,658
Hi. We're running
low on ibuprofen.

690
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,494
Is that right?

691
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,597
I know it's none of my business.

692
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:13,169
You know, I was just
trying to give him a bath.

693
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,863
Was it an accident?

694
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,833
He doesn't know what
he's doing anymore.

695
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:22,013
Did you talk to anybody about
it? Because I think you should.

696
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,012
I'll be okay.

697
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,708
Wait. Hold up.
Hold up. Jing-Mei.

698
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,548
Look, call his nurse. Ask her to
stay an extra couple of hours...

699
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:33,715
so I can take you to
dinner and we can talk.

700
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,859
Jing-Mei, I'm
still your friend...

701
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,895
whether you wanna
believe that or not.

702
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,571
Pratt.

703
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,711
Cops need you to sign
off on your DUI ghetto kid.

704
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,779
- He's medically clear, right?
- Sutured and good to go.

705
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,595
She should have been here
by now, man. What time is it?

706
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,993
- Just about 5.
- What's up, doc?

707
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,759
- Did he get his discharge instructions?
- Four hours ago.

708
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,630
Can't get in touch with my
mom. Phone ain't working.

709
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,099
You need a ride?

710
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,103
- I got the Chrysler outside.
- For real?

711
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,107
- Zero to 60 in 5.6 seconds.
- Let's go.

712
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,411
Yo, this is one nice ride, man.
This is the best I've been in.

713
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,448
- Hey, is your safety belt fastened?
- Like this song right here?

714
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:33,846
Wanna turn it up, bro?

715
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,919
Hands don't even
have to leave the wheel.

716
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,248
How many speakers you got?

717
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:40,186
Eight with a subwoofer
and 380-watt digital amp.

718
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,689
You're gonna blow them out...

719
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,919
not to mention our
high-frequency hearing.

720
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,326
- What'd you say?
- The lady wants it down a notch.

721
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,090
- Is that better?
- Thank you.

722
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,029
All right, all right,
keep your shirt on.

723
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,110
Hey, jack off! Try to
pay attention to the road!

724
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,646
- What's your problem? Get out of here.
- Pay attention to this.

725
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:07,411
- Oh, nice.
- All right, we're out of here.

726
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,619
See you, suckers!

727
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,657
Feel that Hemi power,
baby. It's a beautiful thing.

728
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,489
Do you wanna slow down now?

729
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:21,531
Pratt, slow down.

730
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,836
There, everybody
happy now? Okay, good.

731
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,003
Greg.

732
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,174
- Son of a bitch!
- He's shooting at us!

733
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,679
Get down! Come on. Hold on.

734
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:39,951
We gotta get out of here!

735
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,386
Hold on!

736
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,256
Where is he?

737
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:51,886
We gotta get away from him!
