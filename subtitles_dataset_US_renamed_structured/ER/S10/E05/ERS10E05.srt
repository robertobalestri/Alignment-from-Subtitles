1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,234
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,171
- I made a few decisions.
- Like what?

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,969
I need you to cosign a loan.

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,214
Sneaking out of
the house like this...

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,577
feels a little unseemly.

6
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,416
You say unseemly, I say sexy.

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,255
Are you glad to be home?

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,758
Yes and no.

9
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,054
<i>I miss it.</i>

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>You're a part of something that's
in constant motion over there.</i>

11
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,900
<i>Any break from it
you get is a luxury.</i>

12
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,009
Okay, dump it. Now.

13
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,352
It looks like a
loser. Right. Right.

14
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,753
Last time I take a
tip from a contractor.

15
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,260
Jeff, come on. I'm on the El.

16
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:05,729
The car is gone. Will you just
please...? Just get rid of this.

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,097
No more damn cartoons!

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,135
Don't you know
what they're doing?

19
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,570
Sir, please stop hitting that.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,231
Luka, I heard you
were back today.

21
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,241
Relax. We've all
been here a while.

22
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,777
Someone redecorated?

23
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,212
- Different furniture, same patients.
- They send signals through...

24
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,248
- Call Weaver.
- Nice to see you too, Frank.

25
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,115
Wonderful to have you
back, Dr. Kovac. Call Weaver.

26
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,280
You're Dr. Kovac? Archie
Morris, one of the new R2s.

27
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,119
Hey, Morris, can
you take this guy?

28
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,386
- Sorry, lab run.
- We need to see him now.

29
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,822
Ducklings could use some guidance.
We've been short on Attendings.

30
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,433
- Where'd they put the lounge?
- You should check in with Weaver first.

31
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,936
What are you, an idiot? They use
the coyote as a messenger of evil.

32
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,803
- Relax, Mr. Yurman. YURMAN:
"ACME" is a Cyrillic acronym.

33
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,335
All Hallow's Eve, and
the loonies are loose.

34
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,574
Please. Somebody
help me, please.

35
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,842
I need help. Oh, God.

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,248
Oh, God, he fell out
of the shopping cart.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,515
- I must not have strapped him in right.
- Did he hit his head?

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,522
I'm not... I'm not sure.

39
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,126
I saw it. He hit his head.

40
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,326
- Did he cry?
- No. He was just quiet.

41
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,966
- What does that mean? KOVAC:
IO kit and a Pedes bag mask.

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,363
What should I tell Weaver?

43
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,129
Excuse me. I'm looking
for the charge nurse.

44
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,467
Charge nurse? We
have a charge nurse?

45
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,110
Uh, "Abigail Lockhart"?

46
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,474
I think she's off today.
Come back tomorrow.

47
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,886
He was going nuts, so
we locked him inside.

48
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,452
I'm gonna pepper spray him.

49
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,613
What happens when
that stuff gets all over?

50
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,486
He's throwing
sharps. Let them do it.

51
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,890
- We got patients with allergies.
- Got a better idea?

52
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,120
Chuny, five of Haldol.
Go. Come on, baby.

53
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,031
- What are you doing?
- We're going in. Hold this.

54
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,900
You do the honors. When you
see the opening, go for his thigh.

55
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,836
We're going in now. Let's go.

56
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,973
Get off me, Taliban pigs!

57
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,810
Morris, what are you
doing? Get in here! Now!

58
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,350
- I have a nuclear device.
- What are you doing?

59
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,512
And I'm not afraid to use it.
- Morris, make it happen!

60
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,715
- Get off me!
- Hold his head.

61
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,484
Who are you?

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,720
The thigh! The thigh!

63
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,869
Got it.

64
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,206
Oh, please tell
me you work here.

65
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,268
Sam Taggart, new nurse.

66
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,560
How much longer, little girl?

67
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,762
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're
still about 20 down on the list.

68
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,574
- Twenty minutes?
- I'll see what I can do.

69
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,443
So, what's today's excuse for Triage
being a stinking cesspool of humanity?

70
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,808
The health-care system?

71
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,007
If things back up,
stab these deadbeats.

72
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,344
That'll have them
running to Northwestern.

73
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,817
Can you check out this lady?

74
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:50,583
Shallow forehead lac from a fall,
doesn't look like she needs stitches.

75
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,158
Do a quick exam, I'll take
care of the Steri-Strips.

76
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,760
Dr. Kovac needs me in Trauma.

77
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,762
Frank, which Attendings should
I be focusing my rage on today?

78
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,126
I just came on.

79
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,291
Kovac is in 1, baby
with head trauma.

80
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,130
Colonel Kurtz? I
thought he was dead.

81
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,272
Hey, look at that. Nice hand.

82
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,306
- You wanna see it in action?
- You have to buy me a drink first.

83
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,875
Good breath sounds, sats 94.

84
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,705
BP's up to 130/85.

85
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,371
Okay, get a collar on him,
and, uh... Your name again?

86
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,950
- Neela.
- Neela, tell me why is he hypertensive?

87
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,280
- Intracranial hemorrhage?
- Another mg of Ativan.

88
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,979
- It's okay. Mama's here.
- Heard you had a trauma. Need a hand?

89
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,690
Load him with 20 per kilo of
phenobarb. Answer the phone.

90
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,489
Heart rate's down to
120. Tone's decreased.

91
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,628
- No hemotympanum.
- What does that tell you?

92
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,792
- No basilar skull fracture.
- Is everything in his brain okay?

93
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,871
Dr. Weaver holding for you.

94
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,134
One thing at a time. We'll get
a CT and wait till he wakes up.

95
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,377
I'll take it in the hall, Morris.
Wait here till I get back.

96
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,377
Is it all right if I
draw the blood?

97
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,743
Uh, kids are tough. It's
not a good student case.

98
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,045
- You're students?
- She is. I'm a doctor.

99
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,212
Resps are still shallow.

100
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,050
Biceps contraction
flexes the elbow.

101
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,353
Momentary pause locks the
elbow, activating the terminal device.

102
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,156
Biceps opens the hand.
Triceps closes the hand.

103
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,662
Hey, check out RoboDoc.

104
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,391
How do you have time to loiter
around making comments...

105
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,696
- when 2 is waiting to be dispo'd?
- I'm good at prioritizing.

106
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,841
Rule out bowel obstruction,
still waiting on a Surgical consult.

107
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,772
- I didn't see him with an NG tube.
- I didn't drop an NG tube.

108
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,742
- Think Surgery might expect you to?
- Let's see what they say.

109
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,246
No, do it and see if you
can get through a shift...

110
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,441
without pissing off
the other departments.

111
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,746
You should grease that.
You're getting squeaky.

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,048
Get out of here! Where was I?

113
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,851
Oh, yeah. Okay, co-contraction
releases the elbow.

114
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,517
Biceps flexes the elbow.

115
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,891
I wouldn't use
that to do a rectal.

116
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,930
Sats are dropping. Down to 86.

117
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,731
- Is he moving air?
- Eighty-five, 84.

118
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,373
- What's happening?
- Eighty-three.

119
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,030
- He's apneic.
- Trouble breathing.

120
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,439
Get me a 4-0 ET tube
and a Miller 1 blade.

121
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,738
- You're going to intubate?
- What are you doing?

122
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,439
We're putting a tube in his
airway to help him breathe.

123
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,379
I can't see anything.
I need suction.

124
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,042
- Heart rate's above 100.
- Maybe we should get Kovac.

125
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,213
I tried to tell the kid that his
seizing was inconvenient for you.

126
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,292
Luka. Luka, that
R2 is intubating.

127
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,223
I'll call you back.

128
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,796
Sats are down to 75.
- Okay, stop.

129
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,458
- I'm almost there.
- Pulse is dropping to 86.

130
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,469
Stop. He's starting
to brady down.

131
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,233
The apnea's probably
transient. Just bag him through it.

132
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,001
- Everything okay?
- It's okay now.

133
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,577
Sats are coming up, 83, 84.

134
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,683
- Why don't you step outside for a while?
- No. I'm not leaving him.

135
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,445
Why don't we go sit out in the hallway?
I can get more information from you...

136
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,284
and I think your son might
be a little more comfortable.

137
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,427
With a sedated baby, you
need to try bagging first.

138
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,471
- I thought his airway was...
- I know what you thought.

139
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,373
We were late. We
were in a hurry.

140
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,776
Henry's school had a
Halloween barbecue, and...

141
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,481
I should've strapped
him in better.

142
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,980
We forgot to pick
up the hot dogs.

143
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,881
Why don't you go get your mom a soda?
The machine's right around the corner.

144
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,723
- She doesn't drink soda.
- How about some bottled water?

145
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,635
Mrs. Martin, are you okay?

146
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,339
Uh...

147
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,699
Um...

148
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,878
My therapist prescribed
me, um, Zoloft.

149
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,209
Maybe I'm... Maybe
I'm not reacting well to it.

150
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,647
Zoloft?

151
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,819
I've been a little down.

152
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,482
My husband and I
are getting divorced.

153
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,689
He's trying to
take the kids away.

154
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,655
That must be hard.

155
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,670
Yeah. We were
together for 12 years...

156
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,704
and suddenly one day
he wakes up hating me.

157
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,341
I don't know what happened.

158
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,506
I'm sorry I have to ask this,
but have you been drinking?

159
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,176
No.

160
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,382
I can smell it on your breath.

161
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,086
I'm just trying to
help you, Paula.

162
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,587
Seventy-one-year-old
male, vomiting for five hours.

163
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,385
Tachy at 114, BP 116/72.

164
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,721
Put him in Curtain 1.
I'll be there in a minute.

165
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,426
I wasn't drunk. I really wasn't.

166
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,730
Would you take a
blood alcohol test?

167
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,195
Can you make me do that?

168
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,103
That's not the best answer.

169
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,072
No.

170
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,105
I made a mistake.

171
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,709
Okay. I'll be back when I
hear anything about Adam.

172
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,289
- Okay.
- Here, Mom.

173
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,049
Drink this.

174
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,063
Look, stop handling
me. I can do it by myself.

175
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,725
Ben Hollander. Neighbors called
911 when he didn't answer the door.

176
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,303
Resps are 18, 100
percent on room air.

177
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:09,568
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis. Have you had
any fever, loss of appetite, dizziness?

178
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,769
I mean, all this over
a bad plate of shrimp?

179
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,506
Pratt asked if you'd check
again on his Surgery consult.

180
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:18,811
- Can't someone else do it?
- Abby's off, the new girl's on Triage...

181
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,750
- and no one else speaks English.
- Okay.

182
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,753
All right, you can sit up now.

183
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,087
- How's the baby?
- He went to CT.

184
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,359
Whoa.

185
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,258
Have you had any dizziness?

186
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,162
No, no. I just... I
just got up too fast.

187
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,270
The ST segments look odd.

188
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,997
PVCs and scooped STs.

189
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,540
Dig toxicity?

190
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,473
Are you on any medications?

191
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,772
Something for cholesterol...

192
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,849
a few others for
blood pressure...

193
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,715
gout, water pills...

194
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,653
and I dissolve a pill
under my tongue...

195
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,452
for an allergy.

196
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,021
Digoxin?

197
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,488
It's a heart medicine.

198
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,164
Sounds... Sounds familiar.

199
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,794
Okay, we're gonna give
you some fluids now.

200
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,639
- Glenlivet, I hope.
- More like Gatorade.

201
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,536
And we'll need an
EKG and a blood test.

202
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,301
Look, is all that necessary?

203
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,470
Just humor me. Keep him on
a monitor and get a dig level.

204
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,979
I'd rather go home.

205
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,642
Not until we know you're better.

206
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,755
- What do you have, Gallant?
- Mr. Hernandez twisted his knee.

207
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,153
We're waiting on an x-ray.

208
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,658
I wanna be sure there's
not an avulsion fracture.

209
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,262
- What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a carpet installer.

210
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,332
- Do you like it?
- Makes you appreciate standing up.

211
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,937
It's anserine bursitis. Cancel the
x-ray and put him on Indocin for a week.

212
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,663
- How'd you diagnose that?
- Focused history and physical.

213
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,171
No x-rays in the Congo.

214
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,038
I smelled alcohol on Paula
Martin's breath, the baby's mom.

215
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,579
- She didn't seem drunk, just upset.
- I think we should call Social Work.

216
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,613
The baby needs to
be admitted overnight.

217
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,184
Let the floor team deal
with it. We've got patients.

218
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,945
It'll fall through the cracks.

219
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,350
So, what, we turn this
into a bureaucratic mess?

220
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,524
I just don't want the kids to
come back with something worse.

221
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,922
Fine. Make the call.

222
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,563
Gallant, will you help me
in Exam 2 with skater boy?

223
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,528
Neela, give me the history.

224
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,863
Epigastric pain, improved with
GI cocktail. Chem-20's pending.

225
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,937
- She speaks English pretty good.
- Better than you, in fact.

226
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,370
So, what did you hope
to find out from the labs?

227
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,908
He was in pain. I was
worried about pancreatitis.

228
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,878
- But he improved with the antacids.
- Hey, is that Pratt in there with Lewis?

229
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,705
No, it's Gallant.

230
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,613
Oh, I always get those two
mixed up. Must be the goatee.

231
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,413
Send him home on an H2 blocker.

232
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,250
We weren't supposed to
discharge until the labs were back.

233
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,415
Yeah, that's why Triage
looks like a refugee camp.

234
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,616
Ha!

235
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,888
Get his phone number and call
him back in if his labs are abnormal.

236
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,588
But trust me, they won't be.

237
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,757
The whole staff should
go to the Dark Continent.

238
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,267
Where is my Surgical consult?
- Your consult?

239
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,770
Exactly my question, doctor, and
I use that term loosely. Follow me.

240
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,409
Your upright abdomen
shows a few air-fluid levels.

241
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,171
In all likelihood, this patient
of yours has an ileus...

242
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,644
- leading you to...?
- Admit to Medicine.

243
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,908
Do not pass "Go," do
not occupy another bed...

244
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,917
and stop waiting for Dr. Godot
to come down from Surgery...

245
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,921
Except that I'm not comfortable
dispo'ing until he's cleared by a surgeon.

246
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,753
- Fine, allow me.
- No. Someone who still has privileges.

247
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,020
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice costume. You're a day early.

248
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,529
I do have the privilege to make
your life the 10th circle of hell.

249
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,497
You need an assessment on
a possible bowel obstruction?

250
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,366
- Pardon me?
- I started my Surgical rotation today.

251
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,939
- I'm back in med school.
- Really?

252
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,133
- Lovely. GALLANT:
Congratulations.

253
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,279
Could you breathe for me, sir?

254
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,647
You waited three and
a half hours for Abby?

255
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,815
I never meant to quit med school,
and it seemed like the right time.

256
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,356
- I have one year left.
- Where'd you get the money?

257
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,892
Begged, borrowed,
threatened my ex-husband.

258
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,256
Good for you.

259
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,523
As soon as I paid up,
they put me on rotation.

260
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,428
And Corday sent you
down for a consult.

261
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,535
She was jammed. She figured I
could handle a bowel obstruction.

262
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:57,932
- So no more nursing?
- No.

263
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,597
I'm still gonna be taking a few
shifts for a while. I need the money.

264
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,903
- Wow, you must feel great.
- I do. And tired.

265
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,411
I was up studying the
branches of the facial nerve.

266
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,776
- We have a parotid resection later.
- Oh, yeah.

267
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,248
Ten zebras bit my cockatoo.

268
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,048
It's a mnemonic: T-Z-B-M-C.
Mnemonics got me through med school.

269
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,886
- Are you from the OR?
- No, I'm not, but she is.

270
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,460
Crush victim, looks like
an intra-abdominal bleed.

271
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,462
- Hypotensive, 92/60.
- Pulse 115 after two liters.

272
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,862
- Open an adult intubation kit.
- Any LOC?

273
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,299
Denied normal mentation
and vitals on scene.

274
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,904
You're the consultant? - Yep.

275
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,768
- Coat looks good on you.
- Primary survey complete?

276
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,137
- I'm fast, but not that fast.
- Then get faster.

277
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,863
- Sats are dropping.
- Sorry.

278
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,447
Oh, goody. Surgery's here.

279
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,106
- BP, 64, systolic. KOVAC:
Both lungs are up and clear.

280
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,718
- Heart tones good. ABBY:
Trachea midline, no JVD.

281
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,320
Infuser's primed.

282
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,650
Belly is distended,
tender and tense.

283
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,156
Surgical candidate or piece
of meat, Miss Lockhart?

284
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,055
Pulse, 120.

285
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,963
I'm gonna consult my Attending.

286
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,861
Well, this should be the
Butcher of Birmingham herself.

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,597
I have a crush victim, hypotensive,
with an ecchymotic belly and a deep lac.

288
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,105
- You might wanna...
- Yeah, thank you. That's enough.

289
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:12,177
She'll be up with an intubated Surgical
patient and her tail between her legs.

290
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,847
Any idiot can see this
patient is on his way to the OR.

291
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,245
He needs a Foley and
an NG tube, chop, chop.

292
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,377
Where can you find a nurse when you
really need one? Hey, how about you?

293
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,019
- Excuse me?
- That's okay. I'll get the Foley.

294
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,921
There's nothing sexier than
a mute girl covered in blood...

295
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,187
so keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

296
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,631
You sound just like a guy
I used to date. He's dead.

297
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,768
No gag. Time to go tubular.

298
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,368
Let me take Abby through this.

299
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:40,132
Why don't you tube this guy and
leave the mentoring to me, okay, Tarzan?

300
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,832
Okay, get me the
end-tidal C02 detector.

301
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,844
Either fetch me some urine, or
don't let the door hit you on the ass.

302
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,383
Okay, big tongue, big cords.

303
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,543
- You're in.
- Bag him up.

304
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,282
It's okay, Adam.
You're just tired now.

305
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,694
Don't wake him
up, okay, sweetie?

306
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,834
How was the CT?
Is his brain okay?

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,559
There are some good signs...

308
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,500
but we're gonna
have to wait to be sure.

309
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,339
Paula, Social Work's
coming down to talk to you.

310
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,945
- You called them?
- I am concerned about your drinking.

311
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,908
I told you.

312
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,744
- You've been under a lot of stress.
- I don't need to talk to a social worker.

313
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,580
- It doesn't help.
- There have been prior incidents?

314
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,647
Are you in the CPS database?

315
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,658
It was nothing.

316
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,593
Let's go, Kovac. We're
not on Zulu time here.

317
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,197
Pressure's holding,
104 systolic.

318
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,493
- How far up the tube?
- Until you run out.

319
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,159
- Almost done.
- No, done. Tape it. Now let's go.

320
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,772
Dr. Romano, Dr. Anspaugh
is waiting upstairs for you.

321
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:50,569
He needs surgery now, not
when she learns how to tie a knot.

322
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,206
That is some poisonous, one-armed
midget you got running this place.

323
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,713
- Damn it.
- Luka, Weaver's looking for you.

324
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,375
- I'll call her back.
- She's in the hall.

325
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,551
You're fine here, right?

326
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,282
You're fine.

327
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,117
Uh, I need some Xeroform.

328
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,422
- She'll also need some Elastoplast.
- I'm on it.

329
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,227
- You're Samantha?
- Sam.

330
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,934
Neela. If you need any help...

331
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:19,402
Thanks, but more likely than
not, it'll be the other way around.

332
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,937
We need to set some guidelines.

333
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,577
- Road burn in 2 is gone?
- He skated out an hour ago.

334
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,576
I need a guarantee
of 36 hours a week.

335
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,045
Dr. Kovac, this
lady's waiting a while.

336
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,480
My name's Athena,
like the goddess.

337
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,483
I'm getting to her.

338
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,452
- How about 72?
- Seventy-two hours?

339
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,056
Rule out epi in Curtain 4?

340
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,921
- Still waiting on CT.
- Since 9 a.m.?

341
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,655
- I'll do six 12s a week, every week.
- You trying to buy yourself a burnout?

342
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,130
Hey, in Africa, I did 18 hours a
day every day. This is a piece of pie.

343
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,792
Cake.

344
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,404
Let's pretend CT was
down. What do you do then?

345
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,666
- Send him to another hospital?
- It's too much.

346
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,072
I want to work. I need the money.
Does he have rebound tenderness?

347
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,507
Obturator and psoas signs?

348
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,411
I'll also require four weeks' notice
next time you decide to skip town.

349
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,849
Hey, give me the shifts, and I'll
do even better. I'll give you eight.

350
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,181
Because two months
from now, I'll be gone again.

351
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,449
- Two months?
- I'm going back.

352
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,526
Before you order a $3000 test,
you should do a thorough exam.

353
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,993
To Africa? For how long?

354
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,133
I don't know. I'll see when I get there.
- Can you sign these?

355
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,666
Acute CVA, esophageal impaction.

356
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,703
- Fine, but I'll need it in writing.
- Yeah, draw up a contract.

357
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,533
Dislocated thumb, urticaria.

358
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,199
And from now on, you'll be
answering to Dr. Romano.

359
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,436
Then we should
definitely talk about a raise.

360
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,548
Two months ago, Henry
burned his hand while left alone?

361
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,207
I had a job interview.
There was something on TV.

362
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,515
He tried to make grilled cheese while
I was out. I was only gone an hour.

363
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,555
Our database also turned up an incident
at school, no one came to pick him up.

364
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,388
A teacher took
him home with her?

365
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,120
For a few hours
till I could get there.

366
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:55,132
Kyle, my husband,
was supposed to do it.

367
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:01,635
Unfortunately, based on this pattern
and Dr. Lewis' suspicion of alcohol use...

368
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,710
we'll need to remove the children from
the home pending further investigation.

369
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:09,953
What?

370
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:12,677
Since the father's
able to provide care...

371
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,753
Adam and Henry will
be placed with him.

372
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,191
I'm not...

373
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm not a bad mother.

374
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,364
It's just for a little while, Paula,
until you can get back on your feet.

375
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,758
Most cases like this are
resolved within six months.

376
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,436
I... I had breakfast
with my lawyer.

377
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,903
We had to go over the papers.

378
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,271
Do you understand
what I've told you?

379
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,209
He ordered me a bloody mary.

380
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,244
He said everything
would be okay.

381
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,554
Do you play the drums?

382
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,860
No.

383
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,553
My dad hasn't
moved his stuff out yet.

384
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,433
So that's your magic wand.

385
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,198
Do you believe in it? Magic?

386
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,138
Some sorts, I suppose.

387
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,746
Yeah. Me neither.

388
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,174
Henry.

389
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,775
I'm sleepy, Mom.

390
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,477
I know.

391
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,155
- Hey, big guy.
- Dad.

392
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,694
Hey, buddy. You okay?

393
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:35,428
Adam fell out of the cart.
He hit his head on the floor.

394
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,906
- How is he?
- He's making some eye contact.

395
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,009
It's a good sign.

396
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,346
- I'm sorry.
- You wanna mess up your life, fine.

397
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,845
I was upset. I just
came from my lawyer.

398
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,353
- Adam was crying.
- So it's Adam's fault?

399
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,754
- It's my fault?
- I got here as fast as I could.

400
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,757
How come it's never
your fault, Paula?

401
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,225
It's never your fault.

402
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,772
A little suck here, Annie.

403
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,138
- Ally?
- Oh, it's Abby.

404
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,778
Tenth unit
type-specific going up.

405
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,880
You know, Elizabeth, if I had
another inch, I'd be a happy man.

406
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,951
Maybe then you wouldn't
feel such a need to show off.

407
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,849
Slide the stick
another centimeter.

408
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,785
Damn it. Give me your hand.

409
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,481
Easy, ducky, I got it.

410
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,388
Okay, folks. Here
we go, new target.

411
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,120
Six centimeters of IVC
repair in 30 minutes.

412
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,855
- Thirty minutes?
- Dr. Dorset?

413
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,330
I'm not sure you
have the stamina.

414
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,402
It's your wife on the line.

415
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,509
Take a message.

416
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,574
Leave your reading
glasses at home?

417
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,514
Well, they really
don't help that much.

418
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:04,245
Is your vision better on the periphery?
I can look with the ophthalmoscope.

419
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:08,087
Not unless you know a cure
for macular degeneration.

420
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,032
Well, there are a lot
of new treatments.

421
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,601
Photodynamic therapy, rhuFab.

422
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,203
That's for... That's for wet MD.

423
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,306
I... I have the dry kind.

424
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,838
How far along are you?

425
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,802
Far enough.

426
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:33,386
The paramedics brought this
in. It's an empty bottle of digoxin.

427
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,784
- Oh, congratulations. Mystery solved.
- The prescription was filled yesterday.

428
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,520
Uh... Can...? Can I go now?

429
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,724
I'm worried it
wasn't an accident.

430
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,456
Excuse me?

431
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,123
Have you had suicidal thoughts?

432
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,462
Yes. Yes, in the...

433
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,731
In the seventh grade. I
was a... I was a pudgy child.

434
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,872
If you don't answer, I'll put
you on a psychiatric hold.

435
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,636
Have you ever
considered suicide?

436
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,275
Look, I'm a 71-year-old
man who's going blind.

437
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,647
I've considered everything.
I'd be... I'd be crazy if I didn't.

438
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,947
Dr. Lewis, hot MI rolling in.
- Okay.

439
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,422
Do me a favor. Will you talk to
someone about these issues?

440
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,255
- What issues?
- Your diminished visual capacity...

441
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,227
your compromised ability to
self-medicate, the depression.

442
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,293
Let... Let me see
if I understand.

443
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:28,135
You won't keep me here
involuntarily if I volunteer?

444
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,902
My way will take a few
hours. If I put you on a hold...

445
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,272
you'll be here for three days.

446
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,521
Dad, he looked at me.

447
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,693
Hey. You okay, little
man? Are you okay?

448
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:10,308
Mom! Adam's waking up. Mom!

449
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:15,183
- Paula?
- I forgot something in my car.

450
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,127
I've been here a month,
and I hate the place.

451
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,569
That's a step up. You hated
your internship after the first day.

452
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,550
Mom. Mom!

453
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,093
Oh, my God. HENRY: Mom!

454
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,556
Here, take him. - Mom!

455
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,597
Mom! Mom!

456
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,394
Get me an ambu-bag and a gurney!

457
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,969
Mom! Mom!

458
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,964
Mom!

459
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,171
Mom!

460
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,745
Luka!

461
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,871
Paula? Paula, can you hear me?

462
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,585
Partial- and full-thickness
burns over 90 percent of her body.

463
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,482
Singed nasal hairs,
soot in the mouth.

464
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,145
Move those people away!

465
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,813
Oh, the smell.

466
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,391
Don't breathe through your nose.
- I saw him.

467
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,052
Give her something for pain.
- I saw him see me.

468
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,097
- 130/85.
- Okay, push 10 of morphine.

469
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,326
Someone put up a screen here.

470
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,437
Paula, you have a lot of burns
over your body, including your throat.

471
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,407
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

472
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,169
- Take him and get him cleaned up.
- Really, I'm fine.

473
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,039
All right, just dress it here.

474
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,240
Am I going to die?

475
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,648
We need to put a
tube down your throat.

476
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,986
- You won't be able to talk.
- How long?

477
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,527
I'm dead, aren't I?

478
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,187
Mrs. Martin, do you
want us to intubate?

479
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,630
No, I need to talk to my
son. I want to explain.

480
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,600
Poor chest excursion. She
might need an escharotomy.

481
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,706
Paula, can you feel this?

482
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:51,139
She burned all her nerve
endings. Prep a Betadine 10 blade.

483
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,006
Get ready to intubate.

484
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,991
- Step away, Morris.
- She has 90 percent surface-area burns?

485
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,719
Ten percent chance of survival.

486
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,659
For what, a few
days in a burn unit...

487
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,163
till she gets septic and
dies from the infection?

488
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,234
The lady doesn't wanna be tubed.

489
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,462
She's suicidal. That overrides
her right to refuse care.

490
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,970
I thought she was
that baby's mother.

491
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,701
Oh, God.

492
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,373
Hey, loose lips.

493
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,745
Corday around? I have
some postop films for her.

494
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,752
Why don't you leave them here?
I'll make sure she sees them.

495
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,919
I'm in no mood for a
demonstration of female solidarity.

496
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,090
Elizabeth.

497
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,665
Elizabeth. Can you
slow down, please?

498
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,529
She's doing an
elective at Boston.

499
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,761
She's a student?

500
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,436
Things have been very,
very strained between us.

501
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,008
I haven't slept with her. It's been,
like, weeks. Months, I meant months.

502
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,679
So, what did you do, hide
her pictures in a drawer?

503
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,179
It was a cabinet, actually.

504
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,651
Uh... You're not
gonna call her, are you?

505
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,756
Come on. You
gotta be kidding me.

506
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:17,090
Coffee. Is it too
bloody much to ask?

507
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,743
We had a shot. It says here that most
blunt abdominal injuries die at the scene.

508
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,411
That's blunt aortic injury.

509
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,316
Oh, right.

510
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,416
Thanks.

511
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,087
Still, he probably would've
thrombosed in postop anyway.

512
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,734
Well, it's a
complicated procedure.

513
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,340
Yes, more so today than usual.

514
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:08,347
And to think that I was
worried about it being too soon...

515
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,239
when the real problem was I was
allowing myself to feel something...

516
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,579
for an absolute...

517
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,949
Bastard?

518
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,350
Jerk?

519
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,227
Wanker?

520
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,766
I knew it. I knew it.

521
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,030
There's no shame in that.

522
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,099
- Sats 97 on 100 percent.
- Urine output?

523
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,870
Uh, over 100 cc's per hour.

524
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,479
We'll wait to intubate her
until she's seen her kids.

525
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,745
Henry?

526
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,612
I'm gonna go see him right
now. I'll be back in a minute.

527
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,048
Come on, guys. Get back to work.

528
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,152
- Want me to talk to the father?
- No.

529
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,988
- You seem a little...
- No, I'll do it, Luka.

530
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,461
I don't know if that kid should go
in, it could traumatize him further.

531
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,657
So could never seeing her again.

532
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,893
I shouldn't have called
Children's Services.

533
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,833
You were looking
out for those kids.

534
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,906
The fact that she did
this proves you were right.

535
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,566
Yeah, all it did was
cost them their mother.

536
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,784
Can you take Henry
to the family room?

537
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,816
No, I don't wanna go.

538
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,855
We have a TV and candy in there.

539
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,392
Dad?

540
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,829
You know what, buddy? Do
me a favor. Come over here.

541
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,658
Watch over Adam for me, okay?

542
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,801
Call the Burn Unit and make
sure they have a bed ready.

543
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,566
God...

544
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:44,103
what the hell happened here?

545
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,208
I knew she was
messed up, but I...

546
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,242
I never imagined
anything like this.

547
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,350
- How is she?
- She's not doing well.

548
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,316
She told him to lie.

549
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,887
They didn't go back for hot dogs.
She wanted to pick up some beer.

550
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,737
Adam's gonna be all
right. He's responding well.

551
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,135
I should never have
filed for custody.

552
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,935
I should've grabbed these
kids and run away somewhere.

553
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,710
She wants to see Henry.

554
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:27,147
Look, Mr. Martin, I know this is a
very difficult time and you're angry...

555
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,820
but she's going to die...

556
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,923
and you need to think about
what's best in the long run.

557
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,922
She wants him to
see her like that?

558
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,621
She wants to say goodbye.

559
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,564
No.

560
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,860
I won't.

561
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,468
Well, no one's gonna make you
do anything you don't wanna do.

562
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,670
I don't want to.

563
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,675
Please.

564
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,675
- I heard she was nuts.
- I heard we were taking her kids away.

565
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,973
- That'd make anybody nuts.
- To do a kamikaze...

566
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,982
- in front of your own son?
- I don't know. Never been there.

567
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,449
Where? I'll take you.

568
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,417
Ha-ha. Yeah, I bet you would.

569
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,421
- New girl's kind of intense, huh?
- I wish this shift was over.

570
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,956
Why don't you call it a night?

571
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,855
I don't want everybody
to think I'm a wuss.

572
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,121
- It's too late for that.
<i>- Some Kind of Wuss?</i>

573
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,525
Isn't that a movie?

574
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,598
So they move that
psycho-mobile yet?

575
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,429
The bay's clear. They'll be
towing it out in a little while.

576
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,537
She couldn't park
around the corner, huh?

577
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,640
- You sure you should be doing that?
- You said you were a doctor.

578
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,868
- I am a doctor.
- Then what are you?

579
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,172
That's a good question. How's
that for wound approximation?

580
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,942
- Utah Arm's working for you, huh?
- Better than you are. Finish this for me.

581
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,313
Hey, what are you doing?

582
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,681
Scar control.

583
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:39,382
Hey, Chuny, can you get me some
4-0 nylon and a fresh needle-driver?

584
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,687
I thought Romano was doing that.
- Yeah, right. He was.

585
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,727
Would you get Dr. Lewis for me?

586
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,831
She's in with another patient.

587
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,558
She said it would be three
hours. I've been here four.

588
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:53,933
The counselor's on his way,
sir. Just a little longer. I promise.

589
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,409
This patient is one
of ours from today?

590
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,849
I think I remember her.

591
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,886
- How long was she in Triage?
- Not sure.

592
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,684
GCS, 223. Left pupil blown.

593
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,191
Whoa. Careful, sir.

594
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,426
Okay, hold it. Get me her chart.

595
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,726
Anybody here
recognize this woman?

596
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,498
Both of you, come with me.

597
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,599
Head lac and a hangover.

598
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,870
Spontaneous resps,
but hypoventilating.

599
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,571
- You knew about this patient?
- I'm not sure. Maybe.

600
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,273
BP's up, 177/96.

601
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,112
She was waiting for 11 hours
and left without being seen.

602
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,255
I don't know. What's her name?

603
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,056
Athena.

604
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,753
Like the goddess.

605
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,724
Hypertensive, bradycardic.
Lady's got a massive brain bleed.

606
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,763
- Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.
- 8-0 ET tube and a mac three.

607
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,457
- You better let me do that.
- It was my miss. Let me try.

608
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,365
- Etomidate and sux.
- Heart rate's 54. Systolic's 198.

609
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,299
- I can't see crap.
- Careful, watch the teeth.

610
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,369
Fifty-one, 48, 47.

611
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,739
Okay, okay, I see cords. Tube.

612
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,746
- It won't pass.
- V-fib. Lost the pulse.

613
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,287
- The tube is too big.
- Starting compressions.

614
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,253
Okay, settle down.

615
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,820
One milligram of
epi, charge to 200.

616
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,996
In.

617
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,259
Clear. KOVAC: Clear.

618
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,298
He's awake and alert.

619
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,100
Oh, God.

620
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,468
Thank you.

621
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,615
Can I see him?

622
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,691
Can I touch him?

623
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,795
- Yeah.
- Sure.

624
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,469
He's been reaching out at
objects and looking back at people.

625
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,304
He's going to be
fine, Mrs. Martin.

626
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,517
Oh, that's the tears.

627
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,158
Henry?

628
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,126
He's pretty upset.

629
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,329
He won't come in?

630
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,726
No.

631
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,002
Mmm.

632
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,036
It's better.

633
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,055
I need to write something.
Can you help me?

634
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,492
Can you help me write for him?

635
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,755
- I can write it down.
- Dr. Lewis.

636
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,363
Yeah.

637
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,631
Henry.

638
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,267
Try to forget.

639
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,443
Remember I love you.

640
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,855
Charging to 360.
Clear. KOVAC: Clear.

641
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,454
No rhythm. No pulse.
Another round of epi?

642
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,890
No. COOPER: Asystole.

643
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,928
How about dopamine?

644
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,658
It's almost an hour. We're done.

645
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,564
A five-minute physical exam
could've picked up the bleed.

646
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,302
We would've had time to operate.

647
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,676
Instead, she waited 11 hours
and left without being seen.

648
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,949
This woman had
nowhere else to go.

649
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:02,318
And if we can't find a way to take
care of people like her, nobody will.

650
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:24,072
Get me out of here! Why
are you experimenting on me?

651
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,802
Please, somebody!

652
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,277
Somebody, help!

653
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,313
Honey, I need you!

654
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:35,250
He's taking me away!
He's getting me out of here!

655
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,719
Take me away!

656
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,252
Can you get that guy back in
here? Hey, Morris. Hey, hey.

657
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,328
Morris, hey, hey.
Where are you going?

658
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,522
We still got two hours.
Triage is backed up.

659
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,360
- I've had enough, okay? I quit.
- What?

660
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,196
We didn't get this
far to walk away.

661
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,929
- You've been carrying me this far.
- No, I haven't.

662
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,698
And I am sick of being carried!

663
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:59,003
Morris, you bailing?

664
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,239
Let him walk.

665
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,947
Don't miss your train, sweetie.

666
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,780
Hey, he's just
testing you. Morris!

667
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,957
- You're just testing him, right?
- Mm-mm.

668
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,030
Great. That worked out well.

669
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,929
- Listen, everybody's not cut out for this.
- Yeah.

670
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:27,264
Let's get back to work, and
remember, the jury's still out on you.

671
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,177
No one's answering at his home.
You don't have a car, do you?

672
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:38,644
I knew I should've put him on hold
or had a guard sitting by the door.

673
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,752
Hi, this is Dr. Lewis
from the County ER.

674
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,980
I need a unit dispatched
for a possible suicide.

675
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,714
I'm on hold.

676
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,883
Paula's on a vent. They're
ready to move her to the Burn Unit.

677
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,495
Did you write down
everything she needed to say?

678
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,255
I'll give it to Mr. Martin.

679
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,662
Tell Paula that I'll come
check on her later...

680
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,702
and have them page
me if anything happens.

681
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,798
- You guys going on a run?
- Just brought one in.

682
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,703
Can you do something for me?

683
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,852
Is there a problem?

684
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,966
Hey, are you contemplating
a career change?

685
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,967
- Yeah, something like that.
- This is Dr. Corday.

686
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,502
Elizabeth's fine.

687
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,299
Pleased to meet
you. Sam Taggart.

688
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,237
It's her first day.

689
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:41,044
Yeah, you have that
County glaze about you.

690
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,646
I hope it wasn't too terrible.

691
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,880
It's not like my last few jobs.

692
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,144
I'm used to getting hit hard.

693
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,154
MVA, GSW, knife in the eye.

694
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,219
Here...

695
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,385
you get a chance to catch
your breath, clear your head.

696
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,259
Yeah, that's what I love
about County, all the quiet time.

697
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,056
Yeah.

698
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,134
- So you used to be a nurse?
- I still am, I guess.

699
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,399
I'm gonna be taking
shifts for a while.

700
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,673
- You in transition?
- Kind of.

701
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,076
That's a good place to be.

702
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:21,075
We're on our way to grab
something to eat. You want to join us?

703
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,080
I still got a few hours to go.
I'm just waiting on my guy.

704
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,319
In fact, here he is.

705
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:32,089
You two have a good night.
- You too.

706
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,036
- Is this your new hospital?
- Yep.

707
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,001
It's even crappier
than the last one.

708
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,606
Hey, watch it, kiddo.

709
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,374
We can't take care of
them if we never see them.

710
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,639
Cooper, there. Neela, there.

711
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,874
Gallant, over there.

712
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,815
Neela, you with us? Neela?

713
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,489
Yeah.

714
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:01,921
We'll provide good care,
and we're gonna do it faster.

715
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,529
Everybody, listen up.

716
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,360
We're gonna form a line down the hall,
and you'll be examined three at a time.

717
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,901
- I was here before them.
- Really doesn't matter, sir.

718
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,234
By 10:00, everybody here will
have been examined by a doctor.

719
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:21,802
I waited over three hours.
No one... No one came.

720
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,006
I kept... I kept my promise.

721
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,674
Thank you. You could've
answered the telephone.

722
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,581
I like music when I work.

723
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,419
- Is this your job?
- No, no, it's just a hobby.

724
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,493
I used to make
architectural models.

725
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,758
You're retired?

726
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,063
You need two good eyes
for that... That kind of work.

727
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,000
Do you know of Crown Hall?

728
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,902
Down at IIT?

729
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:53,101
Yeah, that was designed
by Mies van der Rohe.

730
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,611
Yeah, I've heard of him.

731
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:00,216
Mies and I worked
together in the '60s.

732
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,113
This is beautiful.

733
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:06,121
Mies lived his life by
the laws of architecture.

734
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,988
Order, space, proportion.

735
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,894
- One, there has to be an...
- Is someone pouring your pills for you?

736
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:17,297
Internal logic, an
order, in any design.

737
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:21,530
I can set you up with a weekly
pill-dispenser to avoid any mishaps.

738
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:25,268
Two, space is the
real work of art.

739
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:29,312
The building merely
exists to shape it.

740
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:33,474
I could also arrange for
a visiting nurse to stop by.

741
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,415
And three, proportion.

742
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:39,318
Always be aware of how
the structure fits into the...

743
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:40,787
I wanna help you.

744
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,221
The world around it.

745
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,227
Is that your boyfriend?

746
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,657
Uh, no, it's a patient.

747
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,829
I thought I was the only one.

748
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,628
I have to go. She's dying.

749
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:56,502
I need you to promise me you're not
gonna kill yourself in the next 72 hours.

750
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,269
But Monday would be okay?

751
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,412
I'm off the hook by then.

752
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,341
Oh, so this is kind of
a career move for you?

753
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,918
Okay, it's a deal.

754
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,087
- Tinea versicolor?
- It's a superficial fungal infection.

755
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,285
Clotrimazole cream
twice a day for two weeks.

756
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:19,090
Shouldn't we take a scraping?

757
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,596
No reason to. Just treat it.

758
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,698
- It's killing me.
- Vesicles on the drum.

759
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,100
Bullous myringitis
caused by mycoplasma?

760
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,604
Erythromycin for 10 days.

761
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:34,201
- Leftover Chinese food.
- My husband never throws anything out.

762
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,678
Benign belly. Compazine
suppository and check posturals.

763
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,442
What are you nutmeats doing?

764
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,518
Clearing Triage.

765
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,118
Excellent.
