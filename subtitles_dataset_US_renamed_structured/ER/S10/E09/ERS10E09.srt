00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,371
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,441
No!

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,511
I'm good at the
academic stuff, you know.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,616
But you're good with everything
else. We could help each other.

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,048
We're going out.
You're still coming, right?

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,552
I'd rather not go out with
someone right now, okay?

7
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,921
You're probably not his type.
Besides, he's my friend, not yours.

8
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,716
Hey.

9
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,861
Hey, buddy, wake up.

10
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,822
Come on. We gotta get going.

11
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,557
It's Thursday.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,528
- It's a late day.
- Not for me.

13
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,401
I gotta get to work. Come on.

14
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,070
Rise from the dead, King Tut.

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,750
"17a-Hydroxylase deficiency"?
They've got to be kidding.

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,889
- What number are you on?
- Forty-one. You?

17
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,786
Fifty.

18
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,525
- What, are you finished?
- Yep.

19
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,787
Allergic reaction in 3
needs more Benadryl.

20
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,555
Lab lost the urine
for Mr. Perkins.

21
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,858
- I'm not on yet.
- According to Weaver, you are.

22
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,466
- I'm taking a test.
- Done!

23
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,863
"Pompe"? "Dupuytren"?
These are diseases?

24
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,629
- That's a hard one.
- And no helping.

25
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,865
You guys aren't Googling
each other, are you?

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
- We're taking our practice boards.
- Save it.

27
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,144
Your nursing shift
started two minutes ago.

28
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,780
- I'm almost there.
- Hank Benitez. Shortness of breath.

29
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,610
- Needs to be vitaled.
- Can you grab that off the printer?

30
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,048
- Hi.
- I have work in an hour.

31
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,586
- I think you better call your boss.
- Morning.

32
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,223
Hey, Michael.

33
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,919
Oh, Gallant, you got a
message from Valerie.

34
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,323
Valerie, huh?

35
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,488
Flight's at 3:10. Says
she can't wait to see you.

36
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,162
What? She's my sister.
Stop looking at me like that.

37
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,237
- Oh, your sister.
- Younger or older?

38
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,102
- We're twins.
- What's she look like?

39
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,800
- Picture me in a dress.
- You trying to freak me out?

40
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,415
Once when I was in high school I
had to wear fishnets and stilettos.

41
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,447
It was for a musical.

42
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,518
I'd like this
conversation to be over.

43
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,278
Have you ever shaved your legs?

44
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,013
It feels funny.

45
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,692
Looks like there's a
memorial for Romano today.

46
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,157
- Poor man.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:44,230
He must've really hurt a
helicopter in his previous life. Ha!

48
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,201
What? Did you tell these
people about karma?

49
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,338
If you're concerned about karma,
I'd stop making jokes like that.

50
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,373
The memo says Elizabeth helped
organize the memorial service...

51
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,010
today at the
hospital chapel at 2.

52
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,203
Somebody should go.

53
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,813
Oh. Uh-uh.

54
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:04,748
Come on, you guys.
Come on. We'll draw straws.

55
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,199
- Morning, Dr. Corday.
- Morning.

56
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,733
What's that for?

57
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,030
It's for the people
who died in that crash.

58
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,660
Johanna Lambright, 17
years old, passenger...

59
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,494
- high-speed MVA with PSI.
- Seat belt but no airbag...

60
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,638
tachy at 126, BP,
115/72, resps, 20.

61
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,068
What's your name?

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,573
Johanna. Where's Thomas?
- Her boyfriend.

63
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,643
He was hurt bad.
You have to help him.

64
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,337
- He's right behind us.
- Thomas Yoder, 17-year-old driver...

65
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,743
MVA, GSW right chest.

66
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,749
- Stab wound to the right flank.
- Triple crown. Take him in 1.

67
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,683
- Needled in the rig. Sats, 83.
- Kerry, do you have a minute?

68
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,414
- We're good.
- I'll be right there.

69
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,787
I was thinking, um...

70
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,158
you and Robert had a long
history. Complicated, I know.

71
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,529
I was wondering whether you
wouldn't like to say a few words today.

72
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,833
I'll certainly try to be there.

73
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,271
It only seems right that one
of you should eulogize him.

74
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,934
He did end his life
working down here.

75
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,805
I'll make sure we honor that.

76
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,884
- Should we intubate?
- Decreased on the right.

77
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,180
Chest trauma,
hypotension, hypoxia...

78
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,220
pneumothorax, unless
otherwise proven.

79
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,621
I can guess who aced
that test. Sterile sevens.

80
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,886
- You haven't scored them.
- Pulse ox down to 86.

81
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,122
- We swap papers to avoid cheating.
- Ten blade and a curved Kelly.

82
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,130
- I don't cheat.
- I do.

83
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,065
Susan, everything all right?

84
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,364
Uh, yeah, great, as soon as I
get this tube in. Thirty-two French.

85
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,873
I was thinking that one of us
should speak at Robert's memorial.

86
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,705
- You'd be great.
- I was thinking you.

87
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,246
- Me? 0 silk.
- Yeah, why don't you let me secure that.

88
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,213
Go run the board.

89
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,520
And you might want to start
preparing some remarks.

90
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,023
Johanna. Is she...? Is she hurt?

91
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,926
She's okay. She's
just next door.

92
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,664
We shouldn't have been there.

93
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,768
I was waiting in the car.

94
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,302
I heard gunshots, and
then Thomas came running.

95
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,273
And we drove away
as fast as we could.

96
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,205
This cut goes down
through the galea.

97
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,107
Make sure you irrigate it and
close it as a separate layer.

98
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,178
Looks like you have a fan.

99
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,410
Xeroform and Elastoplast.

100
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,181
Occlusive dressing over the stab wound.
- How's he doing?

101
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,723
- Lovely breath sounds.
- CT's ready for him.

102
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,021
I've got meetings this morning, but
I'm on pager if you need me to cover.

103
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,390
- Cover?
- Robert was supposed to be on today.

104
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,027
So I'm grading your paper?

105
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,570
- I'm doing Neela's.
- She's doing mine.

106
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,299
Could you grade it before
lunchtime? I'm feeling anxious.

107
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,445
Johanna, we're taking your
boyfriend to get some x-rays.

108
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,137
- What's the plan? GALLANT:
CT of head and abdomen.

109
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,781
You sure?

110
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,442
With the head lac and the
possibility of intraperitoneal injuries...

111
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,814
Are you sure?

112
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,320
I know how you feel
about tests, but I'm sure.

113
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,391
Good. I completely agree.

114
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,501
Forgot to turn it off.
Sorry, it's from London.

115
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,798
Abby, can you take over for me?

116
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,017
What language is that?

117
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,976
Punjabi. She's Indian.

118
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,110
A little bit of pressure.

119
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,117
No, I said I can't come.

120
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,860
- Math test.
- Maybe it'll be a snow day.

121
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,122
Hit the books, kiddo.

122
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,696
Tough love, huh?

123
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,995
Hey, Frank, will you post this for me?
- Sure.

124
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,702
- "Microwave, 100 bucks"?
- Yeah, I need to unload...

125
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,535
- some stuff before I head back.
- When are you leaving?

126
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,508
Sometime in January. Waiting
for the Alliance to notify me.

127
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,341
"Bose speakers, 80
bucks, fish tank, 200."

128
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,348
- "42-inch plasma screen"?
- Why would you get rid of that?

129
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,316
Hey, the Congo is
not exactly HD-ready.

130
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,719
So how much for the TV?
- Make me an offer.

131
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,324
- No school today?
- It starts late.

132
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,797
Why is that?

133
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,562
Because the teachers
need to talk about us.

134
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,798
What's the matter?

135
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,740
I have wrestling in gym today.

136
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:34,244
- I hate wrestling.
- Never much cared for gym class myself.

137
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,877
What a shocker.

138
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,079
Ankle fracture in Sutures
needs reduction and casting.

139
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,347
- Guy messed it up pretty good.
- Can I come?

140
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,990
No.

141
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,098
There's nothing wrong
with that kid's arm.

142
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,523
It hurts, okay?

143
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,015
I did your ankle. Be a
good patient and go to sleep.

144
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,828
Can I at least get some Valium?

145
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,333
It'd be much easier to
just go to your gym class.

146
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,938
There's a kid there,
Ernie Kendrick.

147
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,903
We call him Osama.

148
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,269
He hits hard.

149
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,105
If your mom sees this, we're
both dead, you know that?

150
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,276
I'll wait in the lounge till
I need to catch my bus.

151
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,715
So you're going back to Africa?

152
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,446
- Yep.
- For how long?

153
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,853
- Not sure.
- Is it a vacation?

154
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,393
- No, it's work.
- What kind of work?

155
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,393
Like I do here.

156
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,929
Isn't it really gross?

157
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,091
Aren't there, like, a
lot of sick people there?

158
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,998
That's why they need doctors.

159
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,432
You went there before?

160
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,971
A few months ago.

161
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,268
Did you ever see a lion?

162
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,735
How about a hyena?

163
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,647
- Sounds like Africa kind of sucks.
- I need you to sign off a dispo.

164
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,983
- I thought you weren't presenting to me.
- I got over it.

165
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,055
- What do you have?
- 72-year-old guy...

166
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:53,716
with three weeks of cough and tactile
temps. Z-Pak, home, follow-up with PMD.

167
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,953
You can't send home
an elderly patient...

168
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,961
with fever and cough
without a chest film.

169
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,793
I knew I should've
waited on Lewis.

170
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,434
Excuse me, coming through.

171
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,331
Got a guy with
four severed digits.

172
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,505
Genius tried to cut
ice with a chainsaw.

173
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,334
Looks like they've
got it covered.

174
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,907
Sam, I need ten of morphine.
- Got it.

175
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,009
Try rock salt next time.

176
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,342
- You got the fingers?
- Right here, big Slurpee special.

177
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,414
What's up with shorty's wrist?

178
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,576
My mom twisted it
when she was drunk.

179
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,948
Lounge. Go.

180
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:28,856
Full trauma panel, order a hand
series and page the replantation service.

181
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,993
We just wanted to
try some pot, that's all.

182
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,658
You went to the South
Side to score drugs?

183
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,566
We heard that
was the place to go.

184
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,172
So you're from India?

185
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,106
My family lives in London now.

186
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,040
Chicago's as far
as I've ever gotten.

187
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,205
How long have you and
Thomas been dating?

188
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,819
Um, a year, but we
grew up together.

189
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,148
Our families live on
the same road in Arcola.

190
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,122
- It's about three hours from here.
- When did you move to Chicago?

191
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,227
Well, I've been
here a few weeks...

192
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,386
just, you know, hanging out.

193
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,825
Your boyfriend got lucky.

194
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,797
The bullet collapsed a lung
but didn't hit anything critical.

195
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,402
The bad news is my leg's broken.

196
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,300
- You can handle that.
- Yeah, but they're going to admit me.

197
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,567
For a few days, till your
chest tube comes out.

198
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,177
In the meantime, we'll
need to phone your parents.

199
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,571
Uh, my folks don't have a phone.

200
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,148
His either.

201
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,645
Is there somebody
else we can call?

202
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,747
- The Fishers.
- No, Thomas.

203
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,482
You don't have to call anybody.

204
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,423
Uh, actually, we do.
You're both minors.

205
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,425
Talk to our folks, Jo.

206
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,565
We just need to be more careful.

207
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,129
I'll give you a
neighbor's number.

208
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,931
Ten cc's of lidocaine. Hand
surgeon's on his way down.

209
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,667
Let's update his tetanus and
give three grams of Unasyn.

210
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,607
You two going to
Robert's memorial?

211
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,645
- Uh, yeah.
- Sure.

212
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,179
Did he have any family?

213
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,942
Not that I'm aware of.

214
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,619
Another 3-0 Vicryl.

215
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,153
Median and ulnar blocked.

216
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,954
Is that Sam's little boy?

217
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,951
- Should you be here? SAM:
Dori, toss me that bag of saline.

218
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,023
No. Bye.

219
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,633
Got you a Zerowet for
irrigation. Hand-Ortho down yet?

220
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,635
- Still waiting.
- I hope Alex wasn't in your way.

221
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,864
- Nope, no, not at all.
- He's just curious.

222
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,703
Okay. Old man with belly pain.
Do you start with LFTs or a CT?

223
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,139
- Hypotensive?
- I think so.

224
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,804
- Back pain?
- Aortic dissection.

225
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,550
- Where is this patient?
- No, it was a practice test.

226
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,277
I totally blew it.

227
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,319
It's my understanding
we're in good shape.

228
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,788
Nice, clean amputation,
just distal to the MCPs.

229
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,587
Well, we'll be taking you
up right away, Mr., uh...

230
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:46,256
Kohler. And we only
recovered three fingers.

231
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,333
No, no, there are...

232
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:49,928
three.

233
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,229
- There were four. SURGEON:
There are three now...

234
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:58,344
so either we lost one, or a finger
thief made off with an intact middle digit.

235
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,844
Excuse me.

236
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,851
Alex?

237
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,488
Alex!

238
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,354
Get the hell back here.

239
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,254
Don't screw around with
me. Empty the backpack.

240
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,661
- Where is it?
- What?

241
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,856
- You know what I'm talking about.
- I don't.

242
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,502
The paramedics brought
in a guy with four fingers...

243
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,331
three of which are on ice.

244
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,268
- Maybe a dog ate it.
- Alex.

245
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,372
- What finger did you lose?
- Ring any bells?

246
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,841
I gotta catch my bus.

247
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,681
Did I say you could have this?

248
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,376
No.

249
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,386
Don't I always get
you whatever I can?

250
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,989
Yeah.

251
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,651
Then why do you steal stuff?

252
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,723
Come on, Alex. This
is serious. Where is it?

253
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,834
I don't know.

254
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,565
What's in your pocket?

255
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,131
<i>How long ago was the injury?</i>

256
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,543
There's still time. Abby,
can you help me with this?

257
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,736
This is really above
and beyond, isn't it?

258
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,643
I was thinking. You'd be a
good person to say something.

259
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,910
- Say something?
- You know, at this thing for Romano.

260
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,314
Oh, you're kidding, right?

261
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,081
No. I think it would be
nice coming from a nurse.

262
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,053
Dr. Kovac?

263
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,325
Tell me you did not put
a splint on my kid's arm.

264
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,092
I'm sorry, we are busy trying
to find a man's finger now.

265
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,996
The reason it's
missing is because...

266
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,899
instead of studying, he's
off with you playing doctor.

267
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,040
- What?
- Not like that.

268
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,207
He's getting beat up
at school. I was just...

269
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,939
Oh, what, he told you his Osama
Kendrick, evil-wrestler story?

270
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:44,448
Please. He made it up.
He makes lots of stuff up.

271
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,617
- I'm sorry. I'll take it off.
- No. You stay away from him, okay?

272
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,055
If the kid took the finger, we
need him to tell us where it is.

273
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,057
He won't tell me.

274
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,734
Alex?

275
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,301
- It's in the refrigerator in the lounge.
- What?

276
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,971
I put it there because I
know it needs to stay cold.

277
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,244
- In the fridge or the freezer?
- Fridge. Behind the juice.

278
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,945
You give it up to him like
that after stonewalling me?

279
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,113
- Well, he asked nicer.
- That's it.

280
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,259
- Mom, stop it.
- Get on that bus right now.

281
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,327
- I'll speak to you later.
- Leave me alone.

282
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,658
We'll talk later. FRANK:
You're a real Mister Rogers.

283
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,426
Hey, 5-to 6-year-old girl,
brady with a rate of 32, no BP.

284
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,662
GCS 3, hypothermia. Couldn't get
a line in. She's too clamped down.

285
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,931
- What's her name?
- Jane Doe, history unknown.

286
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,027
Found her in the
bushes in Lincoln Park.

287
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,510
- Any idea how long she was out there?
- Too long.

288
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,614
Warm blankets, warm saline.
Get a bear hug in here right now.

289
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,661
- She's like ice.
- Let's get ready to tube her.

290
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,842
Abby, you do it.

291
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,953
I'm not on my med
student rotation today.

292
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,453
Okay, so you're a
nurse who intubates.

293
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,289
Okay. Miller 2 and a 5-5.

294
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,021
- Anything in her pockets?
- No keys, no coins, nothing.

295
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,429
- Rate, 38 on the monitor.
- Faint pulse, 1 cc of epi.

296
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,593
- Don't have a line. IO won't flush.
- Try the other side.

297
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,966
- Any identifying marks?
- Not that I could see.

298
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,166
All right, pick it up, Abby. We'll
give meds through the ET tube.

299
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,038
Rectal temp: 86.7.

300
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,009
- We need those blankets.
- I'll go.

301
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,205
Cricoid pressure.

302
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,383
Where did that cop go?

303
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,042
- He's calling missing persons.
- I'm in.

304
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,622
Bright yellow. Good job, Abby.

305
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,793
Somebody's gotta
be looking for her.

306
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,531
Yes, County General in
Chicago. They're both here.

307
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,135
Mm-hm. Neela Rasgotra.

308
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,170
Thank you.

309
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,965
- Is somebody coming for them?
- He said he'd notify their parents...

310
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,906
but he wasn't sure how soon
they'd be able to hire a car.

311
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,070
What was your call
about? In the trauma room?

312
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:57,684
Oh, my sister and her husband
in Chandigarh have had a baby.

313
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,382
Well, congratulations.
You're an aunt.

314
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,920
There's a Sikh ritual,
a naming ceremony.

315
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,921
My parents want
me to go to India...

316
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,083
- so I can be there.
- You don't wanna go?

317
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,058
I can't just take two weeks off.

318
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:13,560
Anyway, guilt calls are just
their way of keeping me close.

319
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,702
Well, it's nice to know
that they miss you.

320
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,201
Yeah, and at times, suffocating.

321
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,236
They don't understand
that doctor thing, huh?

322
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,708
They run a restaurant in South
Hall. I'm the first professional...

323
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,438
the first to live anywhere
other than India or London.

324
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,516
On the one hand, they're proud.
On the other, it scares them.

325
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,617
How are you feeling, Thomas?

326
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,449
- Like I have a tube in my chest.
- I spoke to Mr. Fisher.

327
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:40,457
- Said he'd pass the word to your families.
- They'll make us go home.

328
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,618
Are you runaways?

329
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,094
You wouldn't believe
it if we told you.

330
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,789
- Thomas, shut up.
- Try me.

331
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,900
We're Amish.

332
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,867
- Know what that is?
- It's a religion.

333
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,597
It's a good one.

334
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,402
It's all about taking
care of each other...

335
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,774
- protecting each other.
- Living separate from the outside world.

336
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,778
So you did run away.

337
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,974
We're on <i>rumspringa.</i>

338
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,382
When you get to be 16, you can
do whatever you want for a while...

339
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,215
- experience stuff.
- You decide...

340
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,880
whether you wanna be
in the community or not.

341
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,119
A little dose of teen rebellion
so you won't be tempted later?

342
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,796
After it's over, you'll
be a good Amish.

343
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,995
- She's in V-tach.
- Charge to 60.

344
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,967
- What do you have?
- Jane Doe found in the park. Hypothermic.

345
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,574
We gave two rounds of
epi, only access is IO. Clear.

346
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,732
- Still V-tach.
- Up to 120.

347
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,750
How long was she out there?
- Don't know.

348
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,141
Clear.

349
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,741
- Got a pulse. Rate's 67.
- Pratt, get a central line kit...

350
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,785
- and throw in a femoral.
- Couldn't find any reports...

351
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,649
matching her description.

352
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,950
Abby, prep for a peritoneal
and pleural lavage.

353
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,093
- Now what?
- They're checking old reports...

354
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,956
- one week at a time.
- Let's hear a BP and a repeat temp.

355
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,689
- Maybe she's from another state.
- Check with AMBER Alert.

356
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,029
We'll get in touch with other
agencies if we don't turn up anything.

357
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,882
- How's she doing?
- She's still here.

358
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,973
Get a DPL kit and chest tube tray,
and more blankets. Come on, let's go.

359
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,498
I think the police are
handling this in the right way.

360
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,473
Somebody threw her away.

361
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,545
Maybe the parents are in trouble.
Maybe they're sick or injured.

362
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,012
Maybe she's a foster kid
that got passed around...

363
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,243
from place to place until her
case worker loses track of her...

364
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,014
- and she falls through the cracks.
- That's possible.

365
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,148
So check the CPS foster
files, the federal database.

366
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,557
I wanna help, but there's not much
I can do without a name or an ID.

367
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,561
There must be
pictures of these kids.

368
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,667
- Not that I have access to.
- Ken, come on. You're a smart guy.

369
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,996
- Get access.
- Before we go snooping around...

370
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,197
in the foster system, let's
explore our more likely options:

371
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,842
Ditched by her parents
or abducted by relatives...

372
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,070
- or maybe she's even a runaway.
- Oh, she's 6 years old.

373
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,244
Okay.

374
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,220
I'll get a fingerprint card, and I'll
see what strings I can pull at CPS.

375
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,787
Thank you.

376
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,214
Fourth one I've ever smoked,
and already it's getting old.

377
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,379
Your mom's on her way.

378
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,552
I love my family.

379
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,786
I love where I'm from.

380
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,964
But the coolest thing
that happened to me...

381
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,566
was placing second in
the annual cheese festival.

382
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,293
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

383
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,635
She'll want me to go back.

384
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,769
She'll, um, see this
as a sign from God.

385
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,876
It's up to you, isn't it?

386
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,773
It's not so easy.

387
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,040
If you choose not to be
Amish, you're shunned.

388
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,576
The community
turns its back on you.

389
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,652
Even your family?

390
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,151
Everyone.

391
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,556
See, out here...

392
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,557
it's scary...

393
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,259
but it feels full
of possibilities.

394
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,400
How can I go back there and
pretend that this doesn't exist?

395
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,631
How does Thomas feel about it?

396
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,440
He's had enough.
He wants to go home.

397
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,941
Do you love him?

398
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,187
What would you do?

399
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:07,116
I may not be the
best person to advise.

400
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,186
I'm a Chicago medical
student of Punjabi extraction...

401
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,762
by way of London, England.

402
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,797
A bit of a mess, really.

403
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,263
If I were you...

404
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,838
I'd go home.

405
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,169
Your chest pain may
be something serious...

406
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,609
- called a pulmonary embolism.
- What's that?

407
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,545
A blood clot in the lungs. I'm
gonna send you to Radiology...

408
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,810
- for a pulmonary angiogram.
- More x-rays?

409
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,545
I know, I'm sorry. This
is the last time, I promise.

410
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,781
- I sure hope so.
- Could you take Mrs. Benitez...

411
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,949
and her son to the family room?
- Come.

412
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,687
- See you later, Dad.
- Order some pizza, amigo. I'm hungry.

413
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,662
So if this angio thing
is positive, then what?

414
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,562
It would confirm he
has an embolism.

415
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,033
We'll stop the clot with
a drug called heparin.

416
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,899
I'll let you know
when he comes down.

417
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,700
- You can wait in here.
- Thank you.

418
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,000
You sent that guy up for
a pulmonary angiogram?

419
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,409
Dr. Lewis wanted to be
sure before heparinizing.

420
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,843
What's your opinion?

421
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm not sure my opinion matters.

422
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,743
Luka, you got a minute?

423
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,479
If you don't think it
matters, then it doesn't.

424
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,147
I took a half-shift. I've
gotta get home before Alex.

425
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,822
- I'm sorry about the splint.
- Look...

426
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,658
I appreciate you trying to be his
friend. I don't want things to get weird.

427
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,231
You're a good guy, I'm sure, but
you don't know crap about raising kids.

428
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:30,707
So thanks for the help, but
no, thanks. I got it covered.

429
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,142
Okay.

430
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,013
All right. I'll see
you tomorrow.

431
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,382
- Abby, where's Lewis?
- Exam 3.

432
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,958
- Do we have premixed heparin drips?
- I'll check drug lockup.

433
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,959
Hey, so the police found
a couple from Rogers Park.

434
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,793
Their 4-year-old daughter disappeared
two years ago, hasn't been seen since.

435
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,300
- The profile matches.
- She's missing that long?

436
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,938
Yeah, they're bringing them
in. I wanted you to know.

437
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,973
- Thank you.
- I got a page my sister was down here.

438
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,804
- Frank took her to the lounge.
- You guys meeting us later?

439
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,776
- Definitely.
- Abby? Neela?

440
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,041
- Soon as my shift's over.
- I'll try.

441
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,309
- See you there.
- And what am I, invisible?

442
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:19,722
I believe my daughter Johanna is
here. She's with a boy named Thomas.

443
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,384
I'm the one who left the
message. How was your trip?

444
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,161
- Fine. KOVAC: You're
losing time, Susan.

445
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,628
I can take you to them.

446
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,630
Heparinization's
not a benign therapy.

447
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,496
Neither is all this testing.

448
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,001
He has a history of GI
bleeding from ulcers.

449
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,934
A high probability of
pulmonary embolism.

450
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,508
By the time you wait for Radiology,
you're gonna end up with bigger problems.

451
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,112
Or I could give him heparin, and if
it's not PE, he'll be puking blood...

452
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,715
from taking a dangerous
drug he didn't need.

453
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,348
Next time you feel like discussing
my orders with another doctor...

454
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,114
- don't talk to Kovac.
- No, I...

455
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:56,190
Both families agreed it's
time for you to come home...

456
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,526
so that you can be
baptized and married.

457
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,133
I thought that we
get to decide when.

458
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,462
You got yourselves in trouble.

459
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,127
You could've been killed.

460
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,474
I know you're mature enough to
see that this isn't the life for you.

461
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,681
- Is everything all right?
- The Amish lady's working on them.

462
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,341
- Who, the religious cultists?
- It's not a cult.

463
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,784
- More like a club.
- Oh. Hey.

464
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,349
- Here you go.
- How did I do?

465
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,550
- Oh, pretty good.
- Ninety-seven...

466
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,989
- Yep.
- Percent.

467
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,756
- What?
- Um, Neela.

468
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,633
So?

469
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,799
Not bad, 93 percent.

470
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:44,273
Sorry, I haven't finished yours
yet. I'll find you when I'm done.

471
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,211
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,716
It's so good to see you.

473
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,882
Hey, Val, I'm sorry. I got hung
up with a patient upstairs and...

474
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,255
It's okay. My
plane got in early.

475
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,862
So everything went fine?

476
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,863
Yeah, you know, crappy
flight, but it's all good.

477
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,762
It's all good. Hey, listen.

478
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,562
I was thinking,
after my shift...

479
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,365
that we'd go to this place,
Ike's, and catch dinner?

480
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:14,939
- Great.
- Hey, Mike.

481
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,099
Kinsey in 4 is waiting
on a wound check...

482
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,902
and a doggy bag of Percocet.

483
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,843
And why am I the last one
to hear that your sister's hot?

484
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,849
I'm sure he's got his reasons.

485
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,418
I'm sorry. I didn't
see you sitting there.

486
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,353
I'm Dr. Greg Pratt,
your brother's mentor.

487
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,516
Ha! Yeah, right.

488
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,323
- Pleased to meet you, Dr. Pratt.
- No, call me Greg, Valerie.

489
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,597
Call me Val, Gregory.

490
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:46,394
Okay, hey, I'm all over this Kinsey
thing. Uh, is there anything else?

491
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:50,134
Yeah, in fact, I was thinking about
heading over to Ike's after work...

492
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,402
you know, play some
pool, get some drinks.

493
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,810
- I was wondering if you'd like would go.
- Actually, we were planning...

494
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,815
- on getting some dinner there already.
- What a coincidence.

495
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,579
Well, I actually spread
the word around a little bit.

496
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,086
Really? It didn't get to me.

497
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,725
- It all works out, then.
- Great.

498
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,986
Look forward to
seeing you later.

499
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,765
He'll need to stay
upstairs for a few days.

500
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,062
Is there a phone I can use?

501
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,638
That's okay? You can do that?

502
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,265
We don't hate technology. We just
don't allow it to take over our lives.

503
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,002
There'll be a phone in his room.

504
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,773
I'll be back down
once I have him settled.

505
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,643
What's up with the Pilgrims?

506
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,082
Thomas is going back to
Arcola once he's recovered.

507
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:37,280
- And Johanna?
- She's thinking it over.

508
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,617
Abby, this is Larry
and Judith Anderson.

509
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,921
You're the nurse who's
been working on Kendra?

510
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,156
Kendra. Yes, I am.

511
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,325
- Can we see her?
- Yeah. Kendra hasn't spoken yet.

512
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,939
We'll have a better idea of how she's
doing once her temperature comes up.

513
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,666
- ER.
- That the Jane Doe girl's parents?

514
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,708
Guess she's not a
Jane Doe anymore.

515
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,779
Hold. Dr. Lewis, do you have
a patient up in Angiography?

516
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,280
- Uh, yeah, Hank Benitez.
- He's crashing.

517
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,217
Lost his pressure after
the first dye injection.

518
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,155
- He's in PEA. Had an amp of epi.
- Okay, let's tube him.

519
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,695
- He's got urticaria.
- Must've thrown a big clot.

520
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,958
Probably an anaphylactic
reaction to the dye.

521
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,068
Benadryl and steroids?

522
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,664
He should have been heparinized.

523
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,569
He has classic signs of an allergic
reaction. What does this look like, Neela?

524
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,676
- Hives? I'm not certain.
- V-tach.

525
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,573
Charge to 200.

526
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,977
Last BP was 78/44.

527
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,146
Best we've had so far.

528
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,463
Oh, no. Oh, God, no.

529
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,827
It's okay. I think
she's gonna be fine.

530
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,370
- It's her. It's her.
- No, honey, it's not.

531
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,737
- Well, it could be.
- It's not, Judith. It's not.

532
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,276
Maybe she just
changed, you know?

533
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,277
- Maybe she's different.
- No, Judith. Judith, no.

534
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,848
This is not our daughter.

535
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,997
- Hold compressions.
- Still V-fib.

536
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,661
Clear.

537
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,507
- Asystole.
- It's been 45 minutes.

538
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,305
Okay, I'm calling it.
Time of death, 7:08.

539
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,573
One shot of heparin
could have prevented this.

540
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:46,480
That's crap, Luka. He was killed by
an anaphylactic reaction to the dye.

541
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,450
- Because of an unnecessary test.
- Stop.

542
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,285
It's not about PE, and it's not about
anaphylaxis. It's about this man.

543
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:58,493
I'll go and inform his
family that they've lost him.

544
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,833
Hey. I heard.

545
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,276
Yeah.

546
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:17,883
A woman I know at CPS has been letting
me go through past foster-care records.

547
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,814
I haven't come up
with anything yet.

548
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,216
A little girl disappears
and nobody notices?

549
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,317
I'll keep looking.

550
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,355
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

551
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,854
I've had enough. You wanna
go get a drink with Gallant?

552
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,727
Thought I'd hang around, make
sure she gets up to the PICU.

553
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,561
Can't a nurse do that?

554
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,861
I am a nurse.

555
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,063
And you're a med student.

556
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,385
Hey. You guys
headed over to Ike's?

557
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:57,580
Yeah. Gallant's sister's
in town. He's buying.

558
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,418
So I hear.

559
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,753
I'll, uh, catch up.

560
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,060
Johanna?

561
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,171
Tell Thomas I
said to get better.

562
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,773
Thank you, doctor.

563
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,136
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lambright.

564
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,539
She's the oldest.

565
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,701
I have six other children.

566
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,646
They were so happy when I
told them she was coming home.

567
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,740
She's a good girl, ma'am.

568
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,152
She'll be all right.

569
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,423
You can't make them
stay if they don't want to.

570
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,227
Someone will be back for
Thomas when he's better.

571
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,668
Stern is ready to be DC'd
soon as the UA's back.

572
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:27,574
Kovac is here. Hey, Kovac,
it's Sam. Her son is MIA.

573
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,180
Sam?

574
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,839
What?

575
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:35,287
No, hey, listen, just calm down.

576
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,855
- How long ago?
- Hey, Kovac.

577
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:39,951
Uh...

578
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,357
- No, no, I haven't. Just relax.
- Kovac!

579
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,324
He's here.

580
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,469
How was school?

581
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,274
I had to go to gym.

582
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,850
I got pinned by some
kid in, like, ten seconds.

583
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,446
I don't think you
should go back to Africa.

584
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,717
- No?
- I heard it's dangerous.

585
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,492
- Your mom's worried.
- She's a loser.

586
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,029
Hey.

587
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,524
She does a lot.

588
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,202
Is that why we're
always moving around?

589
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,397
Leaving places as
soon as I've got friends?

590
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,667
She does what she
needs to take care of you.

591
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,334
She wishes she never had me.

592
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,385
Mike. I see you
got here before me.

593
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,031
- You guys met my sister, Val?
- Frank introduced us.

594
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,030
- Neela and Abby, right?
- Mm-hm.

595
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,726
- How long are you in Chicago for?
- A month.

596
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,869
I teach special
needs kids in DC.

597
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,637
- I'm taking a seminar at Northwestern.
- Very nice.

598
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,074
- You guys gonna stay for a while?
- Yeah.

599
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,576
I'll be back in a minute.

600
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:13,276
So Mike never told me that
your mother was so beautiful.

601
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,716
- Our mother?
- Yeah, well, she'd have to be...

602
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,788
to have a daughter
like you, right?

603
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,953
Don't hold back, Greg.

604
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,024
- Drink?
- I'm with you.

605
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:30,201
Do you think it's bad I'm not
going home to the Punjab?

606
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:34,669
Personally, I never miss a Sikh
naming ceremony, but that's just me.

607
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,066
They're going to choose
a name for my niece.

608
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,074
They don't even need me there.

609
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,804
- Do you have nieces or nephews?
- My brother's single.

610
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,812
- Where is he?
- Minnesota.

611
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,951
Do you see him much?

612
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,747
Not now, no. I'm trying to
let him get his stuff together...

613
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,948
- while I get my stuff together.
- Me too.

614
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,917
I'm trying to get my
stuff together too.

615
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,262
Let's all of us get
our stuff together.

616
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:05,771
- Do you miss them, your family?
- Sure.

617
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,803
Me too.

618
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,438
Did you ever get around
to scoring my test?

619
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,840
Uh... Yeah. Here.

620
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,990
Fifty-two?

621
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,522
I got a 52 percent?

622
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,261
Think of it as half full.

623
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:46,474
I'm sorry I wasn't
there, Elizabeth.

624
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,478
You weren't the only one.

625
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,879
He had nothing
but this place, Kerry.

626
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,751
No wife, no kids.

627
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,260
Everything he ever
had, he lost here.

628
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,133
At the end of a life, you'd
think there'd be more to say.

629
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,063
He'll be missed.

630
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,165
Whether we realize it or not.

631
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,843
You got pissed off
at Kovac and Lewis?

632
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,040
- I didn't mean to.
- So, what did they do?

633
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,378
They looked at me like
they couldn't believe it.

634
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,418
Like, "You're not
supposed to get angry."

635
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,216
- What's happening to our little girl?
- That's how it is.

636
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,519
- Except there's different versions of it.
- What's she talking about?

637
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,925
- I have no idea, but she's on a roll.
- "Oh, she's a sweet Indian girl.

638
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:15,192
Poor thing probably grew up
begging for scraps in Calcutta."

639
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,393
- You mean you didn't?
- I've never even been to Calcutta.

640
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,932
Or, "She's the well-educated British
girl, proper, soft-spoken and docile."

641
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:26,738
- With a very good vocabulary.
- I'm not... I'm not any of those things.

642
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,881
I'm not Indian. I'm not
British. I'm not American.

643
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:33,416
- So, what the hell are you?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

644
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,418
Do you ever feel like you
don't know who the hell you are?

645
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,559
No. But I'm very well-adjusted.

646
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,451
- You about ready to go?
- Yeah.

647
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,428
Thanks, everybody.
It's been fun.

648
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,228
Sorry. I've completely
monopolized the intercourse.

649
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,166
Yeah, I think it's about
time for me to go too.

650
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,966
- I'll walk out with you guys.
- Discourse.

651
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,239
Do you want your
chair from the car?

652
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,969
No, I'll be fine.
I'll use the sticks.

653
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,777
I need a little help sometimes.

654
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,912
Do you have a cigarette?

655
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,819
- No.
- Thank God.

656
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,323
The car's just
around the corner.

657
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,623
I'm a little tired. Can
you pull it around?

658
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,143
You want me to go get it?
- Yeah, do you mind?

659
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,898
Michael. Get the car, okay?

660
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,497
Yeah, be right back.

661
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,373
Hope I didn't come off
sounding too insensitive.

662
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:37,539
You know, I'm just
doing me, talking my crap.

663
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,150
- I didn't realize...
- What, how easy it is for me...

664
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,014
to get a seat on the subway?

665
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,553
You flirted, I flirted back.

666
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,019
I know.

667
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,853
I still think I sounded
kind of wack because...

668
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,621
Greg, I was diagnosed
with MS when I was 22...

669
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,991
and before that, I
was a normal girl.

670
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,723
Very normal.

671
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,835
I didn't grow up limited, so I
don't think of myself that way.

672
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,704
How advanced is it?

673
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,709
I have a couple of
relapses a year...

674
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,368
but I'm still fully functional.

675
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,573
How's that for a pickup line?

676
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,252
Don't get me wrong,
okay? You look good.

677
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,856
Very good.

678
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:24,728
- But I just don't want to complicate...
- It's not killing me.

679
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,358
At least not anytime soon.

680
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,234
So I'm just getting
on with things.

681
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:41,243
Get ready for bed.
I'll be back in a minute.

682
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,211
Don't ever do that to me again.

683
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,775
Brush your teeth.

684
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,457
Is he okay?

685
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,219
Silent treatment.

686
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,226
He'll be fine tomorrow.

687
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,892
- Look, I didn't mean to be a bitch before.
- You weren't.

688
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,560
You know, I don't worry about
not having a man in my life...

689
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,698
but maybe he needs one. Maybe
I'm not paying enough attention to that.

690
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,605
Better no man
than the wrong one.

691
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,144
Yeah, his father wasn't
much of a father...

692
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,445
or anything else.

693
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,745
But he had a truck
and a pierced tongue...

694
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,616
and an endless stash of weed.

695
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,614
I was 15 years old.

696
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,532
So you and Alex
grew up together.

697
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,759
Oh, I'm a good
big sister, but...

698
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,928
I'm not sure how
great a mom I am.

699
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,573
Parents always worry about that.

700
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,300
I see him sitting in some
shrink's office in ten years...

701
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,741
talking about what a
job his mother did on him.

702
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,972
Kids are resilient.

703
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,057
Look, I know I said I
didn't need any help...

704
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:03,657
but... tonight I did.

705
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,561
So thanks for the help.

706
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,812
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah. I appreciate it.

707
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,454
- Good night.
- Good night.

708
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,646
Just one more stick.

709
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,054
- No pain here?
- Mm-mm.

710
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,285
- How about here?
- Mm-mm.

711
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,998
Dr. Weaver.

712
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:51,133
It's okay, sweetie. Haleh,
airway box and bag mask.

713
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,840
I know, I know.

714
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:57,073
You don't need that to help you
breathe anymore, do you? Let go.

715
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,740
- Ready when you are.
- Good.

716
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:05,020
I want you to cough, and then
I'm gonna pull this tube out.

717
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,920
On three, cough for me.
Ready? One, two, three.

718
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,758
Good. Good girl,
good girl. There we go.

719
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,767
All right.

720
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,199
Clear breath sounds.

721
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,535
Sats look good.

722
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,177
It's okay, honey.

723
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,905
You're in a hospital.

724
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,647
What's your name? Can
you tell us your name?

725
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,546
Dr. Weaver, LOL in 3
is coughing up blood.

726
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,190
Uh, Haleh, check
an ABG on 14 liters.

727
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,238
Amanda.

728
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,558
I love you, kiddo.

729
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,270
More than anything.
