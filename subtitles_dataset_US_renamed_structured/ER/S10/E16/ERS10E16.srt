1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,234
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,807
I'm Gillian. I was working with
Luka and John in the Congo.

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,571
We really don't have a
chance to talk about things.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,304
Like you and Luka having sex?

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,914
We're not exclusive, right?

6
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,519
No commitments, no
co-parenting. Keep it casual, okay?

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,085
My dad's got pneumonia. I've
been taking care of him at home.

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,823
I met a teacher
recently. He's a nice man.

9
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,426
- You think you'd like to go out sometime?
- Sure.

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,358
Hey, Abby. You're
gonna be a great doctor.

11
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,404
- Thank you.
- It's Dum Ke Pasanday.

12
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,010
One of my student's
parents gave me the recipe.

13
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,668
So...

14
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,315
where were you born?

15
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,950
Tell me about your parents...

16
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,517
your first kiss.

17
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,621
You're terrible at small talk.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,988
Oh, they're quiet. We have to
take advantage of every minute.

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,157
All right.

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,422
Sussex, father's a surgeon...

21
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,161
mother's a university
professor in mathematics.

22
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,804
Impossible.

23
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,434
First real kiss.

24
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,504
Neil Mitchell...

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,977
seventh grade.

26
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,782
Your husband. It
was cancer, wasn't it?

27
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,989
So you're divorced.

28
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,227
That's the story on
the school parking lot.

29
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,026
But we were never
actually married.

30
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,965
She left when Syd
was 3 weeks old.

31
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,733
And Melissa was only
20. She was scared.

32
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,675
Is it too spicy?

33
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,241
You... You like
Indian food, don't you?

34
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,541
Yes.

35
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,517
I'm sorry. I... I thought...

36
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,052
because you were English.

37
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,750
I thought all Brits liked...

38
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:07,522
- Here. Let me fix you something else.
- No, no. It's lovely.

39
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,398
Daddy, we're tired of drawing.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,041
Well, then, how about a movie?

41
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,144
I'm here.

42
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,147
Hi.

43
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,852
Hi.

44
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,516
I should've called.

45
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,354
Alex went to the movies with Austin,
and I hadn't seen you in a couple days.

46
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,560
- Yeah, I've been working nights.
- Yeah. I'm on days.

47
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,735
I thought you might wanna
get some dinner or something.

48
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,467
I can't.

49
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,368
Yeah. I guess... Yeah.
I should've called first.

50
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,477
No big deal. I will...
I'll see you at work.

51
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,044
- Sorry.
- No. No. Please.

52
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,979
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah. See you.

53
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,717
- Is the food here?
- No.

54
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,558
Oh, too bad. I'm starving.

55
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,914
Mr. Welling, calm down, then I can help.
- Why can't you help me?

56
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,822
I told you. The VA
burnt all my files.

57
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,622
Now, my back is killing me.

58
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,628
- I can barely walk.
- You're standing.

59
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,962
- Look. It's a miracle.
- Morris, look, the guy needs Psych.

60
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,832
They've seen him five
times in the last three months.

61
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,802
Are you having any
suicidal thoughts?

62
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,533
Hell, no. I'm not gonna kill
myself. I'm gonna kill him.

63
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,301
BP's elevated. We
can call Medicine.

64
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,605
- See if they have a bed...
- Why do you care?

65
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,514
I'm gonna frag his redheaded ass.
Then I'll piss all over his useless corpse.

66
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,220
Mr. Welling. Hey,
Mr. Welling, wait.

67
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,289
I'm gonna make you cry.
- Oh, my.

68
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,324
Nothing like the smell
of crazy in the morning.

69
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,462
- Back on days?
- Yeah. Till 6. You?

70
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,192
- Seven.
- Olecranon bursitis can go after Ancef.

71
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,634
And bleeding esophageal
varices is on hold for the GI lab.

72
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,535
Can I at least take
off my coat first?

73
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,902
Altered LOL is getting
sedated and scanned.

74
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,203
- She needs a Foley and an NG.
- Thanks.

75
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,040
See you.

76
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,706
Dr. Kovac, I need you to
eyeball a perilunate dislocation.

77
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,374
- What's this?
- I don't know.

78
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:22,683
Weaver's office decided to box up all
the applications for the past 10 years.

79
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,757
- I called to have them picked up.
- Frank?

80
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,986
And it would be my
privilege to call again.

81
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,761
You check his
neuro-circ, I'll block him.

82
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,061
What is with all
these boxes, Frank?

83
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,497
That's where I keep my
lists of idiotic questions.

84
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,931
Dr. Chen, this is Eliza.

85
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,697
Two-centimeter laceration
through the vermillion border.

86
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,067
I just split my lip is all.

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,675
- I promised we could see her quickly.
- Oh, hi, Eliza.

88
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,745
Let me see. Oh, looks like
something got you pretty good.

89
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,710
- She wasn't aiming at me.
- Who?

90
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,248
I think she had an
altercation with her girlfriend.

91
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,012
Lesbian catfight. Somebody
grab a video camera.

92
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,678
Chuny, can you please
put Eliza in Curtain 1...

93
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,087
and draw up 10 cc's
of 1 percent with epi?

94
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,521
Sure. Come on.

95
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,754
Wanna get her settled? I'll talk
you through a three-layer closure.

96
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,129
Want me to call Social Work...

97
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,224
see if we can get her in one
of those BBL support groups?

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,369
Big Black Lesbian?

99
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,705
You know what?
You're a horrible man.

100
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,405
You think it's pleasant
being greeted every day...

101
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,807
with a fusillade of homophobic,
xenophobic ranting from a bigot?

102
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,609
From now on, I expect nothing from
you except silence. Blissful silence.

103
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,643
Wow. Must be somebody's
time of the month.

104
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,449
So Gillian left me a message.

105
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,560
I didn't know she was in town.
She wants us all to have dinner.

106
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,424
I need two-doctor consent for
an unaccompanied 13-year-old.

107
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,465
- Sure. We can talk later about the...
- Yeah. Right.

108
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,161
Dr. Carter, you think you
have a second to look at him?

109
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,011
Dr. Carter, they're
one minute out.

110
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,906
Sorry. EMS is bringing in
a probable septic patient.

111
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,510
He came in on a bus all alone.

112
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,147
He's kind of freaked out.

113
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:59,141
Woke up with right-sided testicular
pain. The school nurse sent him in.

114
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,780
No nausea, no dysuria,
no trauma, not on any meds.

115
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,691
Any nausea?

116
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,157
No. I said that.

117
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,023
Hey, Brian. This is Dr. Kovac.

118
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,134
- He's gonna check you out.
- Hi, Dr. Kovac.

119
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,497
Nice to meet you.

120
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,662
So you're having some pain, huh?

121
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,102
It hurts a lot.

122
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,309
Did the school nurse
call your parents?

123
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,671
No. I live with my dad.

124
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,337
He had a meeting this morning in
Detroit. He's probably still on the plane.

125
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,314
Anyone else I can call? An
older brother or sister, neighbor?

126
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,816
No, ma'am. Thank you.

127
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,418
Okay, Brian. Let's take a look.

128
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,990
Sam? Can you get a
container for the UA?

129
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,358
Sure.

130
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,695
Don't worry, Brian.
Dr. Kovac is the best.

131
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,932
She's really hot.

132
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,475
Charlie Taslitz, 42,
fever and hypertension.

133
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,876
Baseline brain injury,
but he's taken a nosedive.

134
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,700
Tried four sticks, I
couldn't start a line.

135
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:03,693
Where's this blood from?

136
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,477
- He pulled out his PICC.
- You're his nurse?

137
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,078
- Daughter. I take care of him.
- Nice and easy. One, two, three.

138
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,486
- Good. CHEN: All
right. He's burning up.

139
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,149
Sepsis on top of the blood loss.

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,386
- Rectal Tylenol?
- Yeah. And CBC, lytes...

141
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:19,693
type and cross for four, blood cultures
times two, and hang Zosyn and vanc.

142
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,233
- How you doing, Mr. Taslitz?
- He can't talk anymore.

143
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,362
He can't walk, move or anything.
- Stroke?

144
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,269
No. He crashed his forklift two
years ago. Steel crushed him.

145
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,069
- He got brain damage.
- Dr. Chen.

146
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,003
Ooh. John?

147
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,210
- Do you clean his G-tube site?
- Twice a day.

148
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,009
Used to be at an extended-care
facility, but I wanted him home with me.

149
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,020
- They showed me how to do everything.
- Grab a fresh tube.

150
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,680
BP's 82/58.

151
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,225
Hang 2 liters of saline.
- I don't have a line.

152
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,394
- Are you hurting him?
- Try the antecubital.

153
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,294
- I did. It's completely sclerosed.
- We have to go central.

154
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,728
Grab a kit.

155
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,368
Dahlia, your father has very low
blood pressure and a serious infection.

156
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,803
- That's why I called 911.
- We need to give fluids and antibiotics.

157
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,408
Even if we do, there's a
chance his heart could stop.

158
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,273
- Has he discussed his wishes?
- I told you. He doesn't talk.

159
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,540
- Temp's 103.4.
- Does he have a DNR?

160
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,447
- A "Do not resuscitate" order?
- Nothing like that. You have to help him.

161
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,952
Okay. CHEN: Page Corday.

162
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,489
Could you see through
someone's clothes?

163
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,958
Nope. Doesn't
work. Already tried.

164
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,259
How you doing, Brian?

165
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,298
Much better. Thank you.

166
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,060
Morphine's kicking in.

167
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,830
I'll go check on your
urinalysis, okay?

168
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,568
- I'll page Urology.
- No.

169
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,142
- Ultrasound is normal. Not surgical.
- Doppler's not 100 percent sensitive.

170
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,280
- Especially with that edema.
- He's got a positive Prehn's sign...

171
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,906
normal cremasteric reflex, low-grade
temperature. Probably epididymitis.

172
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,485
He has a possible torsion,
and a six-hour window.

173
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,487
- He could lose his testicle.
- We wait for his urine, okay?

174
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,091
- Are you mad at me?
- He's got a good blood flow.

175
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,991
No. Not for that.

176
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,492
For coming over last night.

177
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,360
No. That was fine.

178
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:02,366
Because what I said before, I didn't
mean we shouldn't see each other at all.

179
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,671
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

180
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,206
You want things to be casual.

181
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,275
Right, but...

182
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,214
if it's a choice between
something serious or nothing...

183
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,478
maybe serious is the way to go.

184
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,224
Sam. SAM: Yeah. I got it.

185
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,556
Sam?

186
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,993
Maybe you should page Urology.

187
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,565
- You think?
- Yeah. Better to be safe.

188
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,644
He wasn't MVA. The
guy was just sitting...

189
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,000
on the curb when we got there.

190
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,197
Adam Grant, 61-year-old
slip-and-fall with no LOC.

191
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,366
BP, 136/72. Pulse, 106.

192
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,069
<i>Mucho</i> ETOH onboard.

193
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,875
- Nice breath.
- Tequila. Breakfast of champions.

194
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,382
Sam, start an IV, hang a
banana bag and call CT.

195
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,043
You guys hear on the news?

196
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,213
Some guy robbed the National
Guard Armory, stole a freaking tank.

197
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,915
I mean, it's all over the news.

198
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,525
A "tank" tank? MORALES: Yeah.

199
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,857
George Patton, big turret,
armor, treads, the whole deal.

200
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,022
- Come on, big guy.
- You got this?

201
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,667
Yeah.

202
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,233
You have beautiful skin.

203
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,566
Leave me alone, Morris.

204
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,770
Thing's gigantic.

205
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,708
Sixty tons of
American firepower.

206
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,438
Don't hit the newsstand.

207
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,516
<i>I can see police
clearing the road.</i>

208
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,562
Anybody need any kindling?
- Excuse me.

209
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,918
- What? What?
- Look.

210
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,215
<i>No, it doesn't look like it. No.</i>

211
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,883
<i>Chicago police have just released
the name of a suspect, Anthony Welling.</i>

212
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,291
- Oh, crap. FRANK: Hope
he doesn't have any ammo.

213
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,192
The National Guard
says he doesn't.

214
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,730
We're gonna believe them?

215
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,198
They're the ones that let
him steal the damn thing.

216
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,803
<i>Chicago police have said
Mr. Welling is the man...</i>

217
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,963
- Where's he headed, do you think?
- Here.

218
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,439
What?

219
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,441
He's headed here.

220
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,578
- Tell him.
- He said he was gonna get a tank...

221
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,945
and blow my ass up.

222
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,986
<i>At the National Guard
Armory in broad daylight.</i>

223
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,193
- Kelly.
- Tank's moving pretty fast.

224
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,287
Yeah. It has a top speed of 35
miles per hour on the open road.

225
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,058
That's what they said on CNN.

226
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,830
I had an '88 Civic
that couldn't do 35.

227
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,199
He's tachy, 130.

228
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,635
Are you hurting him?

229
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,708
We numbed the skin.

230
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,741
Cordis introducer.

231
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,573
His pressure's
down to 74, systolic.

232
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,009
Why don't you wait outside.

233
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,377
- We'll find you when we're done.
- I wanna stay.

234
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,746
- Excuse me.
- He gonna be okay now?

235
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,753
We can give him medicine
and fluids, but he's still very sick.

236
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,857
He's strong. You don't know.

237
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,926
Okay, 4-0 Vicryl
and a needle driver.

238
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,857
Oh, what a mess.

239
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,265
- You doing hernia repairs in the ER now?
- No. Mr. Taslitz needed access...

240
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,403
- for blood and pressors.
- I'm here to replace his PICC line.

241
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,405
I put it in three months ago.

242
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:57,272
Oh, thanks for stopping by, but he
has a lovely femoral cutdown instead.

243
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,503
Dress the wound
and repeat the crit.

244
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,381
I... I don't appreciate
you poaching my cases.

245
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,852
And when your cutdown
gets infected, call me.

246
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,686
I can assure you I
washed my hands.

247
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,053
You still on for dinner tonight?

248
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,087
You find a sitter?

249
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,960
- Yes.
- Great.

250
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,226
Well, I'll call you about 7.

251
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:28,367
He's doing better. His
pressure's up to 88/57.

252
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,873
How do they do that?

253
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,238
- Who?
- Men.

254
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,313
They argue with you one minute,
and chat about dinner the next.

255
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,574
You're asking the wrong girl.

256
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,947
Mr. Taslitz's tachycardia's
resolving, and he's starting to perfuse.

257
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,247
Thanks. Transfuse
to a crit above 30...

258
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,084
- then titrate the dopamine.
- Okay.

259
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,318
But he better start making urine
soon, or he's gonna need dialysis.

260
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,756
Yeah.

261
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,989
Dr. Chen, I don't think the
daughter really understands...

262
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,962
how serious her
dad's condition is.

263
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,268
Well, he's responding to
treatment. He's got a good chance.

264
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,236
At what? Being in a vegetative
state the rest of his life?

265
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,433
He didn't sign an advance
directive. His daughter's responsible...

266
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,475
- for his medical decisions.
- She's 19.

267
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,171
- She knows her dad better than we do.
- Okay.

268
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,180
So if he arrests,
do we shock him?

269
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,115
Yeah. If that's what she wants.

270
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,988
He's turning right on Wells
again. He keeps going in circles.

271
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,355
The guy's probably
just out having fun.

272
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,258
Doesn't he have a
map in there? GPS?

273
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,026
He's got GPS, night
vision, laser targeting.

274
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,465
And this one uses those
uranium-tipped shells too.

275
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,605
He starts shooting,
you grab your gonads.

276
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,702
Rollingdeath.com.

277
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,811
All right. Back to work, people.
It's not the moon landing.

278
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,610
Where is this lunatic?

279
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,340
He's crossing Monroe.
Six miles as the crow flies.

280
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,543
- How long till he gets here?
- He won't. We got roadblocks.

281
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,985
He's coming here, we'll feed him
onto Eisenhower, force him out of gas.

282
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,157
That's your plan?
Let him run out of gas?

283
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,692
They're getting a helicopter
with a gigantic magnet.

284
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,454
Really?

285
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,200
Dr. Lockhart, you treated
him. What was his story?

286
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,236
There was no explanation for his pain.
He was angry because we couldn't help.

287
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,569
There was nothing wrong. You
tell me to dispo patients faster.

288
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,038
Never said you did anything.

289
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,542
Hey. Hey, he's about to
hit the roadblock at Adams.

290
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,682
<i>The driver has yet to challenge
any roadblocks. Incredible.</i>

291
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,340
- Damn.
<i>- It does seem the police are powerless...</i>

292
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,181
<i>- to stop this vehicle...</i> WEAVER:
You got a plan B, detective?

293
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,186
Oh, my god. He's...
He's coming for us.

294
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,052
Not us, pal. You.

295
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,187
I've built models of Shermans
and Tigers, but never an M60.

296
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,888
My son's almost your
age. He makes models.

297
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,865
He likes to blow them
up with firecrackers.

298
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,095
Figure out what's
wrong with me yet?

299
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:42,400
Your urine test came back,
and it's positive for chlamydia.

300
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,168
What's that?

301
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,570
It's a sexually
transmitted infection.

302
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,378
You having sex, Brian?

303
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,907
I hook up sometimes.

304
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,881
With who?

305
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,220
Girls in my class,
like, after school.

306
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,188
Girls? Like, more than one?

307
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,223
You're 13.

308
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,230
How do I get rid of it?

309
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,928
- You don't have to cut anything, do you?
- One dose of antibiotics, you'll be cured.

310
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,707
- Cool.
- Cool?

311
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,105
You have to tell these
girls to get treated, okay?

312
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,040
Chlamydia can be very serious.

313
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,580
We'll get you some STD
handouts to give to them.

314
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,074
Okay.

315
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,088
A 13-year-old kid
with chlamydia?

316
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,090
Consent him for an HIV test,
and give him some condoms.

317
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,660
- Is this what I have to look forward to?
- Dr. Kovac?

318
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,125
See you later.

319
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,723
Nineteen-year-old female with
buttock pain after ice-skating pileup.

320
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,097
Minimally displaced
coccyx fracture.

321
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,434
Give her some Naprosyn
and a doughnut cushion.

322
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,139
What's this? Duplicate films?

323
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,140
No, twins.

324
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,939
- Blond twins.
- Coming through.

325
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,447
- They never came for the boxes?
- I'm filing them under D for dumpster.

326
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,518
Just put them in a
storage room, okay?

327
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,655
- Hey.
- I had to drop off my <i>carte jaune...</i>

328
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,087
at the consulate and
the traffic's awful, so...

329
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,454
- Yeah. Someone stole a tank.
- I know. I heard.

330
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,461
Americans and their big cars.
Do you have time for coffee?

331
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,030
Double MVA rolling up.

332
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,293
- Sorry, we're kind of swamped.
- Okay. Later, then. Around 6?

333
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,131
- Okay.
- I wanna do something fun, like dancing.

334
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,829
Okay?

335
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,607
- Bye. PICKMAN: BP,
102/78 after 2 liters.

336
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,771
- Tachy at 112. CARTER:
Easy, Mr. Rojas. He's behind us.

337
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,278
I got this. Help Pratt.

338
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,316
- Who was that?
- She's Gillian.

339
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,479
Oscar Rojas, 7 years old,
pinned behind the passenger seat.

340
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,625
GCS, 15, and
respiratory distress.

341
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,191
One, two, three.

342
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,563
Easy, Mr. Rojas. Tell him
we're taking care of his son.

343
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,161
- Bilateral femur fracture.
- Probably pelvis too.

344
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,167
He screamed when
we put him on the board.

345
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,797
- Calm down.
- Head-on collision?

346
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:57,205
- No. Ford truck versus M60 tank.
- Your boyfriend better learn to drive.

347
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,913
Equal and reactive. Good breath
sounds. Neela, what do we do?

348
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,208
Full trauma panel.

349
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,682
C-spine, chest and AP pelvis and
a Foley. Chuny, grab a central line.

350
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,931
- Set up rapid infuser.
- He should be okay with two...

351
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,153
- large-bore peripheral lines.
- He's running people over out there.

352
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,593
He wants you to
find his wife, Maria.

353
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,991
Find her. And see if
Luka needs a hand.

354
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,399
Frank, can you
locate a Maria Rojas?

355
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,671
You have the area
code for Guadalajara?

356
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,397
Just find this
man's wife, please.

357
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,175
Hello.

358
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,076
Hold on a minute.

359
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,773
- I'm calling from...
- Oscar.

360
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,798
I need you to take
deep breaths, Oscar.

361
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,562
I knew her before in
Africa. She's just visiting.

362
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,035
- You want blood?
- Yeah. Two bags of O-neg.

363
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,068
I need a suture kit.

364
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,879
Multiple rib fractures.
Flail segments on the right.

365
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,947
Hey. What the hell was that?

366
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,782
I need a suture kit, please.

367
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,319
I'd like it on a Mayo
stand with 3-0 Vicryl.

368
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,855
- You two need me to call Dr. Phil?
- Sats are falling, 88 percent.

369
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,745
- Prep for a chest tube.
- Breath sounds down on the right.

370
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,127
All right, Oscar. I'm gonna put
some cold stuff on you, okay?

371
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,636
Oscar, this is gonna
pinch a little, okay?

372
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:42,111
You have to stay still, okay? No,
no. You have to stay still, okay?

373
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,584
- Chest tube, Pratt. Push the lido.
- He keeps moving.

374
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,777
I'm not cutting this kid
without numbing him.

375
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,117
BP's falling fast. Sam, get
Chuny to get some help here.

376
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,020
She's busy. Grab
the portable oxygen.

377
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,660
He's on a wall line.

378
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,819
Come on, do something.

379
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,497
There's your <i>papi,
mijo</i>. See him?

380
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,936
See him?

381
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,070
Do it.

382
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,006
Daddy's right there.
- Ten blade.

383
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,381
Shh. Daddy's right there.

384
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,122
Okay. Get Plastics
to check this facial lac.

385
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,723
I'll call.

386
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,832
Oh, my God.

387
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,127
Frank, wake up.

388
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,796
Come on, Frank.

389
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,496
Breathe.

390
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,733
I need some help in here!

391
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,740
What now? What did he
do? Choke on a doughnut?

392
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,476
Draw troponin, lytes, CPK,
coags, type and cross for four.

393
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,181
- What happened?
- He's having a huge anterior MI.

394
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,533
- Grab a gurney. NEELA:
Spontaneous resps on 10 liter...

395
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,253
non-rebreather. Last BP, 102/60.

396
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,671
- He needs metroprolol.
- As soon as the bradycardia resolves.

397
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:03,958
- Push 5000 of heparin.
- Done.

398
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,361
Oh, no. MI? PRATT: How'd
you guess? Come on. Up.

399
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,728
I gave him 325 of
aspirin. He's on O2.

400
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,097
Call Cards. We got
one for the cath lab.

401
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,068
All right, everybody
grab hold. Ready?

402
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:17,142
He sucks down fried chicken
for 30 years. Now we gotta pay.

403
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,273
Try to slide him up.

404
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,908
- Pratt, you go with him.
- I have patients.

405
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,313
I'll cover. Stay with him.
I want somebody there.

406
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,316
Is there anyone we
should call? Family?

407
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,082
The only thing I know about his
miserable life is that you just saved it.

408
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,059
An hour ago you told me not to
worry. Now you want me to evacuate...

409
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,166
- because you can't stop one wacko?
- Consider it a precaution.

410
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,792
I got snipers up on the roof with
snowplows blocking my ambulance bay.

411
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,667
Dr. Weaver, if I'm endangering
lives, I'm willing to leave.

412
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,607
Why don't you stand in the middle of
Lakeshore Drive. Play Tiananmen Square.

413
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,909
She has a boyfriend.

414
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,571
- That's nice.
- You said you didn't wanna be exclusive.

415
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,116
- I said it four days ago.
- I forgot she was coming.

416
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,583
You know what? I don't care.

417
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,016
- It's fine, Luka.
- It's fine?

418
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,521
Think I care how many
French girls you're screwing?

419
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,455
You already nailed
every nurse in the ER.

420
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,261
Dr. Kovac, sir?

421
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:16,502
I called. They took the bus over.
You said they need to get treated?

422
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,467
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac.

423
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,200
It's very important for all
of you to get checked today.

424
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,141
Because Brian gave
us chlamydia, right?

425
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,047
Listen, I... I know
you're all experimenting...

426
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:36,178
but having sex at your age and with
people you don't have any feelings for...

427
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,693
You... You may regret it later.

428
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,735
Hey. Look who's awake.

429
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,206
I'll call your daughter
for you, all right?

430
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,374
Whoa. You need that
line for your medication.

431
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,722
Do you wanna be
treated, Mr. Taslitz?

432
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,160
If your heart stops...

433
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,665
or you stop breathing...

434
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,929
do you want us to use heroic
measures to keep you alive?

435
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,676
Or should we stop?

436
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,373
Blink twice if you
think we should stop.

437
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,352
There's the
occlusion right there.

438
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,115
Connie?

439
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,692
Hey. What's up, Frank?
You're in the cath lab.

440
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,192
What are you doing to me?

441
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,590
You had a heart attack.

442
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,530
If we can open up the blockage in
your artery, it'll save you from surgery.

443
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:58,736
LAD's down to nothing. Those
cells are marching through single file.

444
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,430
TIMI, zero-to-one flow.
- What's that mean?

445
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,633
You are gonna give
a 2b/3a inhibitor?

446
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,904
You just watch the pretty pictures,
and leave the medicine to me.

447
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,106
- PVCs. KAYSON:
Another 50 of lido.

448
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,716
- What's happening?
- Pratt...

449
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:15,048
you are disturbing my patient,
and bugging the hell out of me.

450
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,449
Why don't you wait outside.

451
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,989
Fine with me.
Take care, big man.

452
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,386
Please.

453
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,289
Don't go.

454
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,431
Please stay.

455
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,889
Think I'll stay a few minutes...

456
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,059
if you don't mind, doctor.
- I do mind.

457
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,726
Tough.

458
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:49,220
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

459
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,157
Well, at least the ER's slow.

460
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,618
Closed to traumas, closed to
transfers, closed to ambulances.

461
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,786
Thank you, Dr. Morris.

462
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:01,422
Hey, IR called about
Mr. Rojas, the driver that he hit.

463
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,661
They embolized a small retroperitoneal
bleeder. He's gonna be fine.

464
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,773
- What about his son?
- Still in surgery.

465
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,936
I pulled his old charts.

466
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,673
The tank guy.

467
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:18,477
Back strain, broken finger, nosebleed,
five Psych consults, no admissions.

468
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,881
Distant history of cocaine
and amphetamine abuse.

469
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,522
Probably nothing that
would've convinced Psych.

470
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,284
Pressured speech, paranoia
and delusions of grandeur.

471
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,484
- Abby.
- I missed a drug-induced psychosis.

472
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,889
Psych saw him five times.

473
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,894
He never met admission criteria.

474
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:36,299
- Don't beat yourself up over this.
- I'm not beating myself up.

475
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,867
The guy came here looking for help, I
let him go. That's just what happened.

476
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,633
Dr. Carter.

477
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,138
Dr. Carter.

478
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,741
Sam's looking for you.

479
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:51,372
And Mrs. Delyanov has tight wheezing
and her urticaria is back. She's on...

480
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,349
Excuse me. Do either of you
work in the Emergency Department?

481
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,682
- Yeah.
- I'm trying to find my husband.

482
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,518
- What's his name?
- Francis Martin. He works here.

483
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,559
My daddy answers the
phone. He's in charge.

484
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,430
- Frank?
- Yes. Frank Martin.

485
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,896
Someone just called
and said he was sick.

486
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,699
I'm very sorry. He
had a heart attack.

487
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,503
Oh, my God.

488
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,163
He's up in the cath lab now.

489
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,865
Oh, my God.

490
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,011
What are they doing to him?

491
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,909
Angioplasty. It's a procedure
where they take a balloon...

492
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,107
and unblock a blocked
artery in the heart.

493
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,618
The cardiologist can explain.

494
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:30,881
- Neela, will you take them upstairs?
- Yeah. I'll show you where to wait.

495
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:35,025
- Mr. Taslitz, can you hear me?
- He blinks all the time.

496
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,527
- It doesn't mean anything.
- His systolic's only 62.

497
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,097
His P0-2's even less. He
was satting well before.

498
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,824
He was alert.

499
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:46,698
Mr. Taslitz, I want you to
blink twice if you can hear me.

500
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,300
- He's not following commands.
- I connected.

501
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,706
He wants his suffering to end.
- What's up?

502
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,470
- You guys need me?
- No.

503
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,874
I asked him to come.

504
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,778
- He's my patient, Sam.
- I just wanted someone more objective.

505
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,717
- Pressure's bottoming out to 40.
- No pulse.

506
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,287
It's P.E.A. What are we doing?

507
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,083
Starting compressions.
Amp of epi.

508
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,919
- This isn't what he wants.
- Epi, Sam.

509
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,961
Guide wire's
through the occlusion.

510
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,664
Wonder what's for dinner.

511
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,631
You're hungry?
That's a good sign.

512
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,008
They used to fly us in a hot meal
every time we were in a firefight.

513
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,940
He's looped on the Versed.

514
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,477
Let's hear some vitals.

515
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:32,016
- ACT's 220, pulse, 87, respirations, 24...
- Tay Ninh Province.

516
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,915
Second of the 22nd
Mechanized Infantry.

517
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,254
I'd hear those first enemy
rounds, "Pop, pop, pop."

518
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,423
So you know how
to use a bazooka.

519
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,825
- They could use you outside right now.
- It's funny, when you're...

520
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:49,426
that close to dying...
I'd be thinking:

521
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,930
"I wonder if it's
beef stew tonight."

522
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,966
You're not dying, Frank.

523
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,472
Vessel's pretty angulated.
Want a shorter stent?

524
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:00,010
No. It has to cover the lesion if we're
gonna prevent acute re-occlusion.

525
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,977
I can wiggle it in there.

526
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,313
Half of my unit was black.

527
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:07,282
They were all cocky
SOBs, just like you.

528
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,512
Some of your best friends, huh?

529
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,446
Yeah.

530
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,521
Shanks...

531
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:17,162
he was shot right
through the left eye...

532
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:20,731
February 12, 1967.

533
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,629
Davis...

534
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,503
Bauer, Woodward.

535
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,800
None of them made it.

536
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,002
None of them.

537
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,647
All right. That looks good.
Inflate to 15 atmospheres.

538
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,384
You know what you are, buddy?

539
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:47,149
You are what those
boys could've been.

540
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,162
Frank.

541
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,594
Frank. KAYSON: He's out.

542
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,530
Inject contrast.

543
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:58,902
Pulse is up to 125.

544
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,336
- Pressure's dropping. Sats 85.
- He's perfed.

545
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,738
- He's bleeding into his pericardium.
- Give me a covered stent now.

546
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,378
Pressure's 65 over nothing.

547
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,673
Maxed out on dopamine
and Levophed. No pulse.

548
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,607
How much longer we going?
- Okay.

549
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,116
- Holding compressions.
- No.

550
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,219
V-tach. Charge to 200.

551
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,753
Do it. Shock him. CHEN: Clear.

552
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,695
- No change. You're torturing the guy.
- Keep going, please.

553
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,792
- Charge to 300.
- Last time.

554
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,192
Clear.

555
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,230
- Sinus tach.
- We got your father's heart beating...

556
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,269
at a normal rhythm,
but he needs medicine...

557
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,533
- to keep him from another arrhythmia.
- Don't stop.

558
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,142
Don't stop.

559
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,737
His heart is beating.

560
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,318
Run a liter of saline wide
open. Lord, another one.

561
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,080
- Can't you stay in the ER?
- Family's here. What happened?

562
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,226
Artery's so calcified the stent
cracked it. Muffled heart sounds.

563
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,417
Tamponade.

564
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,071
Heart's surrounded
by pressurized blood.

565
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,894
- It needs to be drained.
- Run dobutamine, 10 mics.

566
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,795
- Pericardiocentesis.
- I'll get it.

567
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,968
Needle to me.

568
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,832
You, stop.

569
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,974
This is not the ER. We do
things a little more controlled here.

570
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,133
- Let me help.
- Pressure's dropping, 80/45.

571
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,755
- You have to up his cardiac output.
- I'll have a stent in 90 seconds.

572
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,145
He doesn't have 90 seconds.

573
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,579
- Systolic's down to 71.
- I can draw off 50 cc's.

574
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,843
- That'll buy us some time.
- Dr. Kayson?

575
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,755
- Don't lacerate another coronary.
- All right.

576
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,031
- PVCs. KAYSON: You're
putting him into V-tach.

577
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:37,693
Okay, once you get ectopy on the
monitor, you just pull back a little...

578
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,468
- and like magic.
- BP's coming up.

579
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,268
- Ninety-eight over 60.
- Almost 30 cc's of blood out.

580
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,562
- O.R. 4 is ready.
- All right. Let's roll.

581
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,772
One lucky needle doesn't
make you a cardiologist, Pratt.

582
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:51,973
Where is he?

583
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,641
On Ashland.

584
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,617
It's the only way he can
come. The roads are all blocked.

585
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,458
They'll stop him. They will.

586
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,831
He can't get past the snowplows.

587
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,336
Now they can
throw his ass in jail.

588
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,002
What he needs is an eval
and a Psych admission.

589
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,240
What kind of eval does he need?
"Have you ever stolen a tank?"

590
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,731
Oh, God.

591
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,739
Oh, my God.

592
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,079
You'll have to stay back.

593
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,220
Forty-one-year-old
male, three GSWs.

594
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,619
- Where was he hit?
- Chest, neck, shoulder. BP, 108/72.

595
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,851
- Tachy at 112.
- Arterial bleeder. I need more gauze.

596
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,586
Deep breaths, Mr. Welling.

597
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:46,857
- I said I was coming back.
- I can't get a radial pulse.

598
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,126
- He's not going anywhere.
- Cuffs stay put.

599
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,896
Mr. Welling, you need
intubation, a chest tube and O-neg.

600
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,403
Morris, get your ass over here.

601
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,064
BP, 78/56.

602
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,553
- Two units on the rapid infuser.
- He's hard to bag.

603
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,155
Can't get a good seal with this blood...
- I need suction.

604
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,442
Two more, then he's tubed.

605
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,378
- Sats are falling to 86.
- Tube him?

606
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,094
I got this. Let's push some sux.
- Crichoid pressure?

607
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,383
- Yep.
- Easy. He has a GSW to the neck.

608
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,420
BP's falling down with his sats.

609
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,991
Lot of blood in there.
Okay, Yankauer.

610
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,626
Got it.

611
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,227
Okay. I am in. Bag him up.

612
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,601
Good breath sounds on the right.

613
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,430
Sats are only 68. Not coming up.

614
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,835
- Might have pneumo on the left.
- Prep chest tube.

615
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,736
- I'll do it.
- No. Carter...

616
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,433
- he's not.
- He was my patient.

617
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,239
- Yeah. He was, and look what happened.
- Morris is up.

618
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,937
Chuny, set him up with Betadine.

619
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,674
- Betadine and a 10 blade, please.
- Heart rate's only 48.

620
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,820
- All right. Fifth intercostal space...
- In the midaxillary line.

621
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,285
I know.

622
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,493
Blunt dissection.
Stay superior to the rib.

623
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,957
I got it.

624
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,289
Thirty-two French
on a curved vascular.

625
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,625
Run of six.

626
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,972
- I can't get it in.
- I'm losing the pulse.

627
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,108
- Carter.
- He's got it.

628
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,373
- Keep your finger in the track.
- Chuny, open the crash cart.

629
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,447
- Stand by to start compressions.
- No. I'm in.

630
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:11,950
- Hook up the Thora-Seal.
- Right.

631
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,557
Sats up. Sinus tach's 113.
CARTER: Nice work, Morris.

632
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,779
Hang two more units.
Let's get him to the O.R.

633
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,789
Strong carotid, good breath
sounds, BP's up to 60 systolic.

634
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,620
- Kick the brake. Are we clear?
- Yeah.

635
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,193
- Can I scrub in?
- No.

636
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,658
He's... He's gonna be
okay. We saved him.

637
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,908
Luka...

638
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,374
- GYN's admitting one of Brian's friends.
- PID?

639
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,209
Upper-tract chlamydia with
a huge tubo-ovarian abscess.

640
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,543
They'll try antibiotics.

641
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,515
I hope she doesn't need surgery.

642
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,655
She could lose a tube.

643
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,856
Fun.

644
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,092
Going home?

645
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,320
Another hour.

646
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,198
Wanna get some coffee?

647
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,065
I'll wait.

648
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,336
No, thanks.

649
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,609
- Hi.
- Hey.

650
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,180
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

651
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,120
Okay. Let's go.

652
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,032
Thank you.

653
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,967
It's very kind of
you to sit with us.

654
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,981
It was always my worst nightmare
when Frank was on the police force...

655
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,880
that I'd get some
call from the hospital.

656
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:58,482
Can't ever stop
worrying, can you?

657
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,618
Dr. Pratt will find us
when he has any news.

658
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,566
You know, Frank...

659
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,973
took this job because he wanted
to put more money away for Janie.

660
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,635
It's all he ever thinks
about, is his Janie.

661
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,572
I'm sure he talks
about her all the time.

662
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,439
Yes.

663
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:30,483
But he loves it here.

664
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,954
Comes home with
stories all the time.

665
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,653
He always makes the
workday very interesting.

666
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,924
You're Neela Rasgotra, right?

667
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,095
Mm-hm.

668
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:50,672
Frank always says
how bright you are.

669
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,034
And how well you're doing.

670
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,146
That's very kind.

671
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,544
Yeah.

672
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,290
Frank's always been
a people person.

673
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:23,306
They should be taking him
up to the ICU in about an hour.

674
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:27,145
He won't open his eyes anymore.

675
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,176
He might have suffered
more brain damage...

676
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,649
when he wasn't getting oxygen.

677
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:41,056
After he gets out of the hospital, it'll
be hard to take care of him at home.

678
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,759
We can help you find a
good long-term facility.

679
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,228
Dahlia.

680
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,768
Do you think people
get what they deserve?

681
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,480
No. Not really.

682
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,348
I was 17 when he got hurt.

683
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:13,052
Tim Landau called
from the floor of the shop.

684
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:18,057
I thought it was Dad calling to
see if I was home from school.

685
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:22,033
He called every day
since the fifth grade.

686
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:28,537
He wanted me to be
there when he got home...

687
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,642
because my stepmom
would still be at the restaurant.

688
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,211
So we'd be alone.

689
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:39,582
You and your dad?

690
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:44,316
I'd take a shower
and wait in my room.

691
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:49,220
He liked it when
I left my hair wet.

692
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,496
We can go to Beat Kitchen
or Liquid. I heard it's very hip.

693
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,230
Dancing?

694
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,238
You just wanna go home?

695
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,577
We can dance there.

696
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,357
You don't wanna dance.

697
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,254
- Gillian.
- Are you in love with her?

698
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,454
The nurse?

699
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,939
You know...

700
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,272
I'm jealous.

701
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,639
I don't have any
right to be, but...

702
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,646
yeah.

703
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,800
<i>You're okay.</i>

704
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,306
But we had to open up your
chest to bypass the blockage.

705
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,675
So no more nachos,
no more piroghis.

706
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,823
Remember, today is the first
day of the rest of your life, Frank.

707
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,625
I'm in hell, right?

708
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,921
You killed me.

709
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:36,190
You and your faithful
Indian companion.

710
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,528
Daddy?

711
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,174
Daddy?

712
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,668
I wasn't scared. I wasn't.

713
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,781
That's my good girl.

714
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:58,179
You're my... My brave girl.

715
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,057
Hard to believe
he was an officer.

716
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,889
And a husband and a dad.

717
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,691
And a bigot.

718
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,264
That too.

719
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,699
- Bypass went well?
- Yeah.

720
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,804
Less than 30
minutes of pump time.

721
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,064
Kayson says you're
banned from the cath lab.

722
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,606
Nice work, you two.

723
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,235
Dr. Corday, they
need you in O.R. 1.

724
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,743
I'm already late for dinner.

725
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,279
They said it was 911.

726
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,281
So the guy's head comes off...

727
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:32,424
and then these spider
legs grow out. It's really cool.

728
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,718
You should probably
close your eyes.

729
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,554
Luka.

730
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,794
Hey.

731
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,558
We rented <i>The Thing</i> and <i>Evil
Dead II.</i> Have you seen them?

732
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,827
- Nope.
- Well, Mom got me McDonald's...

733
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,632
- but you could probably order a pizza.
- Alex, why don't you head upstairs.

734
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,671
Isn't Luka coming up?

735
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,709
Put the popcorn on. Two and
a half minutes on high, okay?

736
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,148
It's cold.

737
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,014
They said it was gonna snow.

738
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,586
Luka, I'm tired.

739
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,124
Gillian went to a hotel.

740
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:12,829
She was at your apartment last
night, wasn't she, when I came by?

741
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,090
Yeah.

742
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,462
You talked to me and
closed the door. And like...

743
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,930
five minutes later...

744
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,272
I was probably
still on the stairs.

745
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,437
I'm sorry.

746
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,610
God, I am so stupid.

747
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,477
I really...

748
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,315
Whatever.

749
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:48,125
You came here to say something,
so say it. It's freezing outside.

750
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:51,864
I screwed up.

751
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,398
I just wanted to apologize.

752
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:57,506
Okay.

753
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,804
Sam.

754
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,212
Just tell Alex I said...

755
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,050
Just tell him I'm
sorry I couldn't stay.

756
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,195
Sure.

757
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,412
Hey.

758
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,015
His movies scare
the crap out of me.
