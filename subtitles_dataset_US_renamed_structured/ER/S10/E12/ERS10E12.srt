1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,065
<i>Previously on</i> ER: -
And welcome back.

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,233
- How have you been?
- Good.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,640
- I'm back in med school.
- Really?

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:16,011
I know I'm supposed to feel like
I wanna carry a baby. But I don't.

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:20,712
Once that baby's inside of
you, it's... I mean, it's incredible.

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,413
Kerry, I don't want it.

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,026
Abby, would you be interested
in studying together sometime?

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,960
- Sorry?
- I'm good at the academic stuff, you know.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,862
But you're good with everything
else. Maybe we could help each other.

10
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,830
Okay.

11
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,271
Four-day-old full-term male.
Mottled, lethargic, retractions.

12
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,502
NICU been called?

13
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,389
They're on the way.
Pratt's intubating.

14
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,906
- Suction. Tube's too big. Give me the 3-0.
- I'm Dr. Carter. What's his name?

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,381
Jacob.

16
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,215
It won't advance.

17
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,380
Sats are good, try again.

18
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,152
Anatomy's distorted.
Here, go for it.

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,022
- Just brought him home.
- He started gasping...

20
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,062
while I was feeding him.

21
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,568
Okay, Pratt, bag him.

22
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,107
- Equal breath sounds.
- 200 of cefotax for presumed sepsis.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,079
- Where the hell is NICU?
- Is he gonna be okay?

24
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,717
We're taking care of him.

25
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,912
Systolic murmur, weak femoral
pulses, distress while feeding.

26
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,817
- What's your diagnosis?
- Ductal-dependent cardiac lesion.

27
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,960
Matt Gillespie, R3, Pediatrics.

28
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:37,422
Sam, PGE infusion
at .05 mics, quickly.

29
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,829
Oh, doing your
NICU rotation, huh?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,265
Just when I was used to
my double life in the ER.

31
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,632
- What's happening?
- We think Jacob...

32
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,330
- has a heart problem.
- You think?

33
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,941
ABG's back, metabolic
acidosis, minus 18.

34
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,600
What does that mean?

35
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,110
It means his body's not
getting enough oxygen...

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,614
but the breathing tube should
help. Sam, 10 of bicarb, 50 of saline.

37
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,945
I only have two hands
and he only has one line.

38
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,086
- Abby, bag him.
- Tell Cards to meet us in the NICU.

39
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,690
Start the Prostins on the way.
- We'll take it.

40
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,952
- We don't need help.
- If he starts crashing...

41
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,959
you'll need extra hands.
- Push this.

42
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,689
It can be difficult to diagnose
congenital heart disease.

43
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,959
His doctor saw him
yesterday. She missed this?

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,296
Sometimes symptoms
don't present right away.

45
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,803
- How serious is this?
- We don't know yet.

46
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,964
Cards will meet us just in case.

47
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,372
- In case of what?
- Cardiology will talk to you.

48
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,977
I want to know what's going on.

49
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,979
- It's possible he may need a septostomy.
- What? A what?

50
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,676
- Everybody off the elevator. Out!
- I can explain everything to you.

51
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,318
- Mean's down to 34.
- He needs pressors.

52
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,252
Aeration's good, sats are 93.

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,824
He's in very good hands.

54
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,994
Back off the FIO2. We
don't want to flood the lungs.

55
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,136
He'll be okay once
he's got the Prostins.

56
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,828
- When'd you two start your rotation?
- Five minutes ago.

57
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,373
Well, the NICU's great: intubations,
chest tubes, umbilical lines.

58
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,512
You'll get to do all sorts of
teeny, tiny, kick-ass procedures.

59
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,372
- Cards is waiting and Raab is pissed.
- You trying to give him a pneumo?

60
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,546
- Good luck.
- You're gonna love it.

61
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,585
- Let's get out of here.
- I hate the NICU.

62
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,188
Those guys are screwed.

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,100
Humphrey Fowler,
ex-33-weeker, day of life: 58.

64
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:07,941
Status: post-RDS, on vanco
for MRSA, day 19 of 21.

65
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,748
- Who names their kid Humphrey?
- It's the last one.

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,649
- Post-op, day 46 for CCAM repair.
- CCAM?

67
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,881
Congenital cystic
adenomatoid malformation.

68
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,617
Was on the oscillator,
weaning the map and amp.

69
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,989
Born with one lung.
Other than that, he's great.

70
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:25,394
- Okay.
- You didn't keep flow sheets, index cards?

71
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,591
- It's all up in here.
- Tell me you're joking.

72
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,966
You don't need any paperwork for
this kid. Bad hypoxic encephalopathy.

73
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,936
His brain's mush.

74
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,735
But his vitals are good.
He can go on indefinitely.

75
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,277
- Family won't withdraw support?
- Two months and about $2 million later...

76
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,938
Mom's still holding
out for a miracle.

77
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,385
They're here every day.

78
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,181
He's a paperweight.
There's nothing to do.

79
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,815
Come on, they're waiting for us.

80
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,291
Thank you so
much for joining us.

81
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,590
I'm Dr. Raab, director
of Neonatology.

82
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,290
We round twice a day, 7
and 4. You will come ready...

83
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,699
to present overnight data
and exams on your patients.

84
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,341
Everyone scrubs for a full three
minutes before you enter the NICU.

85
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,772
No jewelry on the
hands, spreads bacteria.

86
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,777
- Not even my wedding band?
- No, and cut your fingernails.

87
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:16,439
In 1993, two children were
abducted from this unit.

88
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,778
Explains the little LoJacks
around their ankles.

89
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,478
You will be issued
a code for this door.

90
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,955
- Do not give your code to anyone.
- I tattooed mine on my scrotum.

91
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,684
No one will ever see it there.

92
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,385
Dr. Gillespie, back already?

93
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,224
Another month in the box.

94
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,696
Your standup routine might
go over on other rotations...

95
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,961
but the NICU is a tough room.

96
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,662
- Who do we have here?
- Lloyd Roberts, ex-38-weeker...

97
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,899
admitted for TTN and detox.
- What's TTN?

98
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,804
Transient tachypnea
of the newborn...

99
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,309
results from delayed
clearance of fetal lung fluid.

100
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,471
Good. Continue, Kate.

101
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,980
Born to 23-year-old G4P4 mom who
used meth and heroin during pregnancy.

102
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,049
Do we need to keep
our voices down?

103
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,191
Confidentiality
doesn't exist here.

104
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,384
The quieter we talk, the harder
they listen. Kate, your plan?

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,495
DC the O2, continue
amp and gent...

106
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,325
advance the feeds,
morphine taper.

107
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,195
- Did you name him yet?
- Everyone, meet Virgie.

108
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,861
Twenty-years-plus as a NICU nurse.
Her mission: to protect the babies...

109
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,404
from the likes of you.

110
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,405
Haven't had a Thor in a while.

111
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,374
We have a tradition of giving
the babies tough-guy nicknames.

112
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,878
Hard to fight with
a name like Lloyd.

113
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,008
Latest gas on Jacob Kolber.

114
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,778
Acidosis is worse.

115
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,218
What was the final
read on the echo?

116
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,187
Come on, people,
who picked him up?

117
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,624
Lockhart, he's yours.
Go. Examine your patient.

118
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,592
Cardiology confirmed
a critical coarct.

119
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,198
- Which is?
- A narrowing of the aorta...

120
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,301
usually at the
ductus arteriosus.

121
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,936
- And why do we care?
- Because blood can't get to...

122
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,868
the lower half of the body.

123
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,799
Why is that bad?

124
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,373
His legs need blood.

125
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,980
If you don't know, don't guess.
Decreased perfusion means acidosis...

126
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,615
shock and heart failure.

127
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,580
His means have
been drifting down.

128
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,655
Lungs are wet. I can
barely palpate the femorals.

129
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,417
Ten of bicarb, start dopa at
12, crank up the Prostins to 0.1.

130
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,605
He needs the O.R.

131
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,731
The cardiologist said
to try medicine first.

132
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,230
- Medicine isn't working.
- CT Surg said they'll...

133
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,564
- get to him in the next 48 hours.
- This boy can't wait 48 hours.

134
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,503
If not to the O.R., they can take him
to the cath lab for dilation and stenting.

135
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,939
- Stenting?
- Another way to open a blockage.

136
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,069
- Blocked? You said it was too narrow.
- So narrow, blood isn't getting through.

137
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:31,844
Tom, send off LFTs and creatinine.
Check for end-organ damage.

138
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,481
You got it.

139
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,487
I want to talk to that
cardiologist again, all right?

140
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,626
Mr. and Mrs. Kolber,
Jacob is very sick...

141
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,853
but all this is really
a plumbing problem.

142
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,997
Nothing that a CT
surgeon can't fix.

143
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,759
- Surgery will cure him?
- It should, yes.

144
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,599
Dr. Lockhart, he
needs a nickname.

145
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,097
How about Jake?
Sounds tough to me.

146
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,768
Jacob to Jake. Very creative.

147
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,939
Thin mec, Delivery Room 3.

148
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,614
What are you waiting for? Go.

149
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,952
Fifty cc saline
bolus. Push it, Tom.

150
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:18,190
Dr. Lockhart, what are you waiting
for? Go. You could learn something.

151
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,197
I'd like to stay
here, if that's okay.

152
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,235
Covering deliveries
is part of your job. Go.

153
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,204
Tom, we need another
i-STAT to see where we are.

154
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:30,071
- Dr. Raab...
- And he needs a Foley and another PIV.

155
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,144
I can do that. He's my patient.

156
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,215
Get CT Surg on the phone and tell
them your patient needs the O.R. right now.

157
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,411
Not in 48 hours...

158
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,988
not sometime today, now.
- I'll be right back.

159
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,752
So when the DR phone rings
we drop everything and run?

160
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,987
Yep, 24/7. It means some
potentially sick-ass baby's being born.

161
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,041
Kid ends up fine,
but you never know.

162
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,259
Can I do the intubation?
If it's indicated.

163
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,834
Oh, you like this stuff.

164
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,403
- The technology's fascinating.
- What's wrong with us?

165
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,541
We should be in the easy, lucrative
specialties: Derm, Radiology.

166
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,678
Okay, little gunner, welcome
to your very first delivery.

167
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,782
Matt, just in time. Six
weeks early, no prenatal care.

168
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,941
- You have a boy.
- First get rid of the gunk.

169
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,088
And dry him like crazy. Warms the
baby up and reminds him to breathe.

170
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,689
- Good pulse but the cry's weak.
- It's all about ventilation.

171
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:23,023
- Get them to breathe, the rest follows.
- Decel down to the 20s.

172
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,256
- Got it. One more big push.
- Hand me the bag.

173
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,128
- You can do better than that. Wake up.
- Matt.

174
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,846
- Head's out, here we go.
- We were visiting my cousin.

175
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,395
- Baby come too soon.
- Don't worry.

176
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,200
Just needs help getting started.

177
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,037
- Thirty-two-weekers usually do fine.
- Matt, it's twins.

178
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,703
Dude, thanks for the heads-up. We
would have brought down a second team.

179
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,145
Neela, second setup.
You know what to do.

180
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,252
Okay, buddy, you just
bought yourself a tube.

181
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,251
Call the NICU for backup.

182
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,052
It's a girl.

183
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,091
This baby's not breathing.

184
00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:00,064
A NICU admission is like running
a marathon without training.

185
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:04,830
It's an endurance test for
patients, for families, and for you.

186
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,338
Eat when you can, sleep when you
can, and when it's time to go home...

187
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,841
get the hell out of here.

188
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,406
Let's round.

189
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:18,582
Jiang Han's up to 1830
grams. Room air, q.3 feeds.

190
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,482
Ah. Feeder and grower,
behaving himself nicely.

191
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,217
Inga's ABG.

192
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,595
Sister's a mess.

193
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,288
Inga?

194
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,195
- Inga?
- You had to come up with nicknames...

195
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,201
and you failed
to. Dirk and Inga.

196
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,170
I was going to call her
Surinder. It's Punjabi for "warrior."

197
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,708
- You're thinking too much.
- Inga doesn't sound tough.

198
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,745
Neela, present your patient.

199
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,815
Her pneumonia is worse.

200
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,281
Acidotic. Ventilation's crap.

201
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,380
Pa02 in the 40s all day.

202
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,044
I think we should consider ECMO.

203
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,856
Cardiopulmonary bypass?

204
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,561
Isn't that incredibly
dangerous on a 2-kilo kid?

205
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,130
We need to do something before the
prolonged hypoxia causes brain damage.

206
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,697
- Who can tell me the risk of ECMO?
- Overwhelming infection.

207
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,565
Could happen
anyway, ECMO or not.

208
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,347
Head bleed.

209
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,400
Parents could end
up with a little potato.

210
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,305
- We'll get daily head ultrasounds.
- Won't prevent a bleed...

211
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,504
- just detect it after.
- She was well till she became bacteremic.

212
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,081
It's risky, but ECMO
could get her through.

213
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,575
She's not getting enough oxygen.

214
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,254
- If we do nothing, she'll die.
- Are you sure?

215
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,220
How can anyone be sure
about something like that?

216
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,289
Neela, call the profusion team
to start ECMO. Rounds are over.

217
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,555
Thanks.

218
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,433
She already thinks I'm an idiot,
so there's really nothing to lose.

219
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,072
I have your sign-out.
You should get out of here.

220
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,333
I need to talk to Inga's
parents about ECMO.

221
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,672
I'm gonna be here all night
anyway. Go. I'll talk to them.

222
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,404
No. I'll do it.

223
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,115
- Did you change Rocky's diaper?
- Yeah.

224
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,786
- Why did you do that?
- Because it was dirty.

225
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,889
My ins and outs are all off now.

226
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,619
All right. I'm sorry.

227
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,292
Not good enough. Go find it.

228
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,951
- It's in the trash.
- Find it, weigh it, and I might...

229
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,824
let you get some sleep tonight.

230
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,935
Mr. and Mrs. Tseng.

231
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,305
Sorry. Do you have the
results back on the cardiac cath?

232
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,443
Cards will talk to you as soon
as they have an official report.

233
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,102
I've been waiting. I'll
take an unofficial report.

234
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,077
I'll ask Abby if she's heard.

235
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,649
- I need to talk to you.
- Waiting's driving me crazy.

236
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,250
The waiting is hard.

237
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,320
You know how long it takes to
recover from something like this?

238
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,457
- A rough estimate?
- It's too soon to say.

239
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,456
Would you two come with me?

240
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,092
How long you been here?

241
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,863
Eight days. We were visiting from
Suzhou in China when the babies come.

242
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,662
Are they doing okay?

243
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,867
- Our son is very strong.
- Mr. Tseng?

244
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,609
ECMO stands for Extracorporeal
Membrane Oxygenation.

245
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,685
- Ready for circuit.
- The machine puts oxygen in the blood...

246
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,912
and sends it back
to Inga's body.

247
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,957
It does the work of her heart and lungs.
- Let's go. I'm clamped on high.

248
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,686
I know it looks scary,
but it's her best chance.

249
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,330
- Chance of what?
- A good outcome.

250
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,461
She be healthy?

251
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,499
- I hope so. TOM:
Chow time for Dirk.

252
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,501
One of you want to feed him?

253
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,601
- I go. JANE: I've
got control down low.

254
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:31,142
- Releasing arterial.
- Releasing venous.

255
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,280
Clamping bridge.

256
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,541
ECMO on, 20-25.

257
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,714
It'll be a while before we know
how she's going to respond.

258
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,616
I'll let you know.

259
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,226
If she was born in China,
she'd already be dead.

260
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,862
You don't know that.

261
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,634
My husband and I are lucky.

262
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,936
We went to school, we
have jobs as teachers.

263
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,573
But it's not like here.

264
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,984
We wanted our daughter
to be born in America...

265
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,517
so she'd have more options.

266
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,554
And she already does.

267
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,755
We don't have
hospitals like this.

268
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,964
It wasn't an accident, then.
You meant to deliver here.

269
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,732
We sold everything to
come stay with my aunt...

270
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,396
have the babies in Chicago.

271
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,271
You're just going to
start over, with nothing?

272
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,707
Her life will be better.

273
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,084
Isn't that why your parents
sent you to this country too?

274
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,254
- Tom, can you help me out?
- Not now. Gotta hang vanco.

275
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,699
Transducers, art
lines, no butterflies.

276
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,861
They're in the cabinet
by the sinks on the left.

277
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,296
Been here for nine weeks.

278
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,765
Thanks.

279
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,811
- Hi.
- Hi.

280
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,108
Just came to check on Jacob.

281
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,979
He looks great.

282
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,917
His suck is still weak, but
Abby tells me to keep trying.

283
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,886
- He'll get there.
- You keep trying.

284
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:28,050
It says here that he may need
surgery again in a few years. Is that true?

285
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,458
That sounds like a
question for Cardiology.

286
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,590
Occasionally the area where the aorta
was repaired gets blocked from scarring...

287
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,794
but usually they can take care
of it and avoid another surgery.

288
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,632
That's good to
know. Thanks, Abby.

289
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,843
I better get back to
work. But I'll be by later.

290
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,039
It was nice to see
you, Mrs. Kolber.

291
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,549
Looks like you're
doing well here.

292
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:58,013
- Right.
- Abby, take a look at the CO2.

293
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,943
Back off on the rate,
check it in an hour.

294
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:01,967
You got it.

295
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,795
Parents love you. Nurses
wouldn't give you the time of day...

296
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,697
- unless you knew what you were doing.
- Yeah?

297
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,703
Tell that to my Attending.
You should see me on rounds.

298
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,877
So Kem and I had our first official tour
of the labor and delivery suites today.

299
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,775
How can you call
one room a suite?

300
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,350
- They're counting the bathroom.
- Ah.

301
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,782
- You're gonna be a dad.
- Yeah.

302
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,594
- How's it feel?
- Scary.

303
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,600
Especially in this room.

304
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,165
I start thinking about all the
things that can go wrong...

305
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,397
all the mistakes you can make.

306
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,866
You're gonna be a great father.

307
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,202
Full-term forceps in 2.

308
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,139
That's my cue.

309
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,312
Hey, Abby.

310
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,722
You're gonna be a great doctor.

311
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,757
Okay. Let's go. Baby time.

312
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,556
Can't. Got a finger in this
kid's pleural cavity. You go.

313
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,030
- Alone? Is that even legal?
- I'm right behind you.

314
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,601
Get set up, I'll meet you there.
- I'll go with you.

315
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,433
- Are you kidding? You have to go home.
- You can't go to a delivery on your own.

316
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,772
I dream about blood sugars, TPN
orders, gent doses, boxed kidneys.

317
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,244
Get used to it if you're
going into neonatology.

318
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,007
I haven't slept well for days.

319
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:34,347
You know, all this whining about
how tired you are, but you never leave.

320
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,013
I hate to break it to you, but we'll
make it through this night without you.

321
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,783
Just trying to help.

322
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,291
NICU's here.

323
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,797
Thirty-five-weeker, maternal
diabetes, failure to progress.

324
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,872
I thought this was
just a forceps delivery.

325
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:50,368
That too.

326
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,664
Here comes a contraction, Sarah.

327
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,267
That's it, baby. Big
push. We're almost there.

328
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,602
What do you mean "we"?

329
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,972
Hi, I'm Abby from the NICU team.

330
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,807
- Something wrong?
- We're called for forceps deliveries.

331
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,541
- It's standard procedure.
- Baby's heart rate's dropping.

332
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,310
Let's go. Baby's getting tired!

333
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,579
She's not the only one.

334
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,314
Nuchal cord. Bad decel, 54.

335
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,322
Okay, Sarah, one more.

336
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,124
That's it.

337
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,053
Here she comes.

338
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,832
Okay, Sarah, one more.

339
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,161
That's it.

340
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,963
Here she comes.

341
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,672
A girl? It's a girl?

342
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,307
It's a girl!

343
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,103
- It's a girl! DEREK:
Good work, baby.

344
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,802
Good work.

345
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,510
Poor tone. Check the heart rate.

346
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,185
- I can't feel it.
- Well, listen, then. Shallow resps.

347
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,015
How is she? How's my girl?

348
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,156
Come on, baby. Wake up.

349
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,350
Wake up.

350
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,016
Hold on, I'm
gonna get a picture.

351
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,025
- Neela, what's the pulse?
- I'm counting.

352
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,164
It's not that hard. Tap it out.

353
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,433
Where the hell is Matt?

354
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,126
Oh, look at all that hair.

355
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,602
I'm sorry, I'm going to
need some room, okay?

356
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,331
Okay.

357
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,445
She's okay.

358
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,013
You hear that baby?
She got some lungs.

359
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,446
Everything cool? - Yeah.

360
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,280
She's gonna have to come
upstairs to monitor her sugars...

361
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,184
but, yeah, she looks good.

362
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,050
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

363
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,164
Girl, you look just like your
daddy. Except three shades lighter.

364
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,529
Babies are supposed to be
light when they're born, I told you.

365
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,697
Don't listen to your
daddy, Daphne.

366
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,305
You're perfect.

367
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,968
It's Matt.

368
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,304
He's a little late.

369
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,678
It's Inga.

370
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,651
- What happened?
- Hypertensive. Crit bottomed out.

371
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,087
- Ultrasound shows huge brain bleed.
- Are you sure?

372
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,487
Yeah, like we said, it's
always a risk with ECMO.

373
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,424
- She's got to come off.
- She'll die.

374
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,757
We can't leave her on,
the bleed will get worse.

375
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,595
- Hey, Matt, they need you in L&D.
- There's a C-section. I gotta go.

376
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:06,000
Order 20 per kilo of packed
cells. I'll be back soon.

377
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,101
Surgery's on their
way to decannulate.

378
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,776
- I talked everyone into this.
- Nobody, not even you...

379
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,311
could talk Raab into ECMO if
she didn't think it was the right thing.

380
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,339
She's seizing. 0.5 of Ativan.

381
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,917
- I can't take a verbal from a student.
- Raab's gone, Matt's in a delivery.

382
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,282
- I could lose my job.
- She's seizing.

383
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,789
That's the least of her worries.
Let's see what Matt says.

384
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,894
- Versed will do the same.
- You can't without a cosigned order.

385
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,962
- Watch me.
- I'm telling Dr. Raab.

386
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,428
You do that.

387
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,965
- She'll kick you guys off the rotation.
- Kick me off.

388
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,627
- Neela has nothing to do with it.
- What am I going to tell her parents?

389
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,769
Versed's in.

390
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,710
- Go home.
- "Mr. and Mrs. Tseng, I'm sorry.

391
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,213
- I screwed up. Inga's brain is toast."
- Stop it. You didn't do this.

392
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,613
- I've gotta call them.
- Just go. Raab will do it.

393
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,152
- They should hear it from me.
- You're a med student.

394
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,289
The Attending can
handle it. Just go.

395
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,559
Good night, Neela.

396
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,478
Excuse me, can someone
get the door, please?

397
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,513
Hello? Anyone?

398
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,278
Get me the hell out of here!

399
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,830
Oxygen is perfect the whole
time. When can we take Dirk home?

400
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,663
- As soon as Dr. Raab writes her a note.
- Thank you, Neela.

401
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,368
Inga's not breathing
over her ventilator at all.

402
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,270
That's not a good sign, is it?

403
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:53,173
It'll take time before we know how much
neurological function she'll get back...

404
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,007
but her lungs are much better.

405
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,047
- She's a strong girl.
- Yes, she is.

406
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,186
- I'm waiting for Dirk's discharge summary.
- I'll get on that.

407
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,653
Cher's a lovely name,
it's just how you spelled it.

408
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,849
I just wanted it
to be different.

409
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:11,322
Okay. As long as you're aware.

410
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,689
Poor Chair, she's doomed.

411
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,960
Hopefully she'll meet a
nice Ottoman someday.

412
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,036
Heard any funny
dead-baby stories lately?

413
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,038
Here's a good one: Inga's
hydrocephalus is worsening.

414
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:23,540
EEG shows continued
seizure activity.

415
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,544
She's not dead, but she might
never wake up. It's a real laugh.

416
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,046
Bad day, Neela?

417
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:36,018
Millions of dollars keeping these babies
alive. Half die anyway. Why bother?

418
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,380
Time for rounds.

419
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,394
Forty years ago, Inga was considered
a micro-preemie, borderline viable.

420
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,226
In many parts of the
world, that's still the case.

421
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:52,736
We saved her so she can endure a lifetime
of seizures, lung disease, cerebral palsy.

422
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:57,570
We gave Inga a chance. Her brother's
going home today, a normal kid.

423
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,907
But Inga's here now, gorked
out in a level-three nursery.

424
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,605
Look, we do our best.

425
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:08,379
Some kids will end up hospitalized
for life, and some will go to the prom.

426
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,023
Neela, there are no
guarantees in this work.

427
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,627
If you can't live with that, I
suggest you become a bank teller.

428
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,557
We'll pick up again
when I get back.

429
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,794
Don't listen. My cousin's a bank
teller. Got held up at gunpoint last year.

430
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,430
Still here? I discharged
Daphne an hour ago.

431
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,940
I'm just waiting for the
nurse to take out that IV.

432
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,773
- I can do it.
- You're letting a student touch your IV?

433
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,414
That's brave.

434
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,774
She's territorial. They
teach that in nursing school.

435
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:42,888
Abby, we need you over here.

436
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,953
- Just keep some pressure there.
- Okay.

437
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,783
Come on, come on.

438
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,658
- She's gonna miss you guys.
- No, she won't. She'll be home.

439
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,800
He's been tachypneic,
sats dropping. He's tiring out.

440
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,630
- Put him back on O2? TOM:
He's going to need more than that.

441
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,132
- Diastolic is in the teens.
- Widening pulse pressure.

442
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:05,142
Okay, 50 cc's of saline cultures,
start him on amp and cefotax.

443
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,643
What's happening, Abby?

444
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,445
- He's apneic. Pulse down to 105.
- Bag him.

445
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,484
- Five As and Bs in the last hour.
- Did anybody page Raab?

446
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,622
- 911.
- Okay, Mrs. Kolber... Kyle?

447
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,521
Jacob's having trouble breathing
likely due to blood infection.

448
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:23,288
- From what?
- We sent out cultures.

449
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,454
- He was okay. ABBY:
Sepsis can come on quickly.

450
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,965
We're starting antibiotics, but we
have to put the breathing tube back.

451
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:33,003
- We were talking about going home.
- He's tough. He'll get through this.

452
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,007
Get together.
Photo for the wall.

453
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,775
Smile.

454
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,339
Fentanyl's in.

455
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,111
Go ahead, Abby.

456
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,217
One more with Dr. Neela.

457
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,358
- Oh, it's okay.
- We insist.

458
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,695
- Suction.
- Take your time.

459
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,889
- Heart rate's good.
- Smile.

460
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,369
I see the cords. Tube.

461
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,174
Goodbye, Jiang Han.

462
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,212
Ready to see the outside world?

463
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,880
We're going to keep calling him
Dirk since the name has bring him luck.

464
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,415
Thank you, Dr. Neela.

465
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,054
Mei Fan.

466
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,641
Mei Fan?

467
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,021
I want you to have this.

468
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,747
- Thanks.
- It's strange to be going.

469
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,427
Lots of parents are nervous
when their babies are discharged.

470
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,528
It'll be great. You'll
love having him home.

471
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,427
I know you're right.

472
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,091
Bye, Neela.

473
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,261
See you tomorrow.

474
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,910
What are my vent settings?
- 24 over eight.

475
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:30,318
We'll adjust from there. Order
a Versed drip and a chest film.

476
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,117
You wanna call the tech?

477
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:36,626
Okay, nothing to do now but
wait for the antibiotics to kick in.

478
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,457
I don't know if I can
take another round of this.

479
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,230
Sit.

480
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,318
One of those better be for me.

481
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:05,285
I just needed to get
outside for a minute.

482
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,189
The NICU's so
confining, claustrophobic.

483
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,160
There's a reason why
Matt calls it the "the box."

484
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,824
- Raab's right, you know.
- Did you eat anything?

485
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:20,001
I like science, complete
answers, a plan for everything.

486
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,937
I can't deal with uncertainty.

487
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,671
It gets easier.

488
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,335
I planned neonatology
since I started medical school.

489
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,379
I'm supposed to be loving this.

490
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:34,145
Well, the whole purpose of rotation
is to try on different specialties.

491
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,187
- I mean, it's okay if you don't...
- I had a baby brother.

492
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,019
He died when he was 6 days old.

493
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,384
I was only 3.

494
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,660
Oh.

495
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:49,995
I remember sitting in my mom's
hospital room eating ice cream.

496
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,028
But I don't actually
remember him.

497
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,367
The NICU's just so sad all
the time. How can you stand it?

498
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,514
I don't know.

499
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,515
When I was an OB nurse,
preemies freaked me out.

500
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,882
I thought they looked like frogs. I was
pretty sure I was gonna hate the NICU.

501
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,553
But you don't.

502
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,721
No, I don't.

503
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,221
It's not just about the babies.

504
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,198
You know, so much of it is
about taking care of the parents.

505
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:29,334
And it turns out tragic family
dynamics are my specialty.

506
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,506
It's Matt. There's a delivery.

507
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,877
Full-term, mom's febrile,
PPROM, suspected chorio.

508
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,042
- Good work, Sandy.
- Oh, my God.

509
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,745
We're almost there.
Honey, we're almost there.

510
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,914
The little boy
is officially here.

511
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,925
- You did it.
- We have a baby.

512
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,932
Amniotic fluid's clouding.
Kid's had late variables.

513
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,700
Abby?

514
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,203
- Wait, you're bagging him?
- You need to wait over there.

515
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,936
No, that's my son. I'm a doctor.

516
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,446
- It's okay, Matt. It's okay.
- Honey, what's wrong?

517
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,778
Just a little blow-by.
Let them work.

518
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,982
What's wrong?

519
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,249
He's too quiet.

520
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,654
Give him a minute.

521
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,589
Good chest excursion.

522
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:29,793
Thank you very much.
That's what we like to hear.

523
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,403
Congratulations, Mom.

524
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,864
And Mom.

525
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,475
He's beautiful.

526
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,839
- Is he really all right?
- He'll go upstairs for antibiotics...

527
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,508
because of the chorio. But
right now, he looks great.

528
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,987
I love you.

529
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,492
I had no idea.

530
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,355
Nobody did.

531
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,659
Would you like to cut
the cord, Dr. Weaver?

532
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,008
Hello, Henry.

533
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,375
Hey.

534
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,350
- Your usual.
- Thank you.

535
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,182
Bad night?

536
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,718
Jake is maxed out on dopa
and epi, third-spacing like mad.

537
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:05,557
In the past two hours, his belly blew
up in front of our eyes. I think it's NEC.

538
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:09,224
- Surgery's on their way.
- God. His parents here?

539
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,701
No, they're on their way. I finally
convinced them to go home...

540
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,772
and then I had
to call them back.

541
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,238
- Any word from Inga's parents?
- No.

542
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,844
Three days and not
a single phone call.

543
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,004
KUB on Jake Kolber. Free air under
the diaphragm and pneumatosis.

544
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,082
Oh, damn it. He's perfed.

545
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,584
Pedes surgery's gonna meet
us in the O.R. Come on, let's go.

546
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:34,284
- Can we wait for his parents to see him?
- His bowel's dying, there isn't time.

547
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:37,986
We need to save the viable tissue
before there's nothing left to save.

548
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,627
He's thrombocytopenic.

549
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,201
Platelets and FFP
are on hold in the O.R.

550
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,270
Abby, where are you going?
- To surgery.

551
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:51,740
His intestines were injured and
they need to cut out the injured part.

552
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,972
I'm Dr. Corday. The injury's compromised
your son's already tenuous condition.

553
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,242
The sooner we get him
to the O.R., the better.

554
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,715
Okay.

555
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:04,118
Hey. Would you like to see
your little brother up close?

556
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,656
Abby.

557
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:09,090
Kids aren't allowed in
NICU. Just five seconds.

558
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,423
There he is.

559
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:20,134
- Can he hear me?
- Yes, he can.

560
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,945
It's okay. You won't hurt him.

561
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,476
I'm Miranda, your big sister.

562
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,817
Come on, honey.

563
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,970
- Thank you, Abby.
- Thank you.

564
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,953
Good morning.

565
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,856
Morning.

566
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,356
Where is your prayer group?

567
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,698
I told them not to come.

568
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,739
I think he's getting
a diaper rash.

569
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,409
I'll order some nystatin.

570
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,618
He's 3 months old today.

571
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,051
You should go home.

572
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,528
I thought that...

573
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,495
if I prayed hard enough...

574
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,032
if I showed God how
much I believed...

575
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,178
You must be exhausted.

576
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,381
I don't want him
to suffer anymore.

577
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,950
My patient has been bumped three
times for so-called emergencies.

578
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,187
Been waiting over 24 hours
for ORIF, happened again.

579
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,925
- Came up to see what's so important.
- Jake Kolber.

580
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,632
It's the congenital-heart-disease
baby you guys admitted to us.

581
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,467
Do you remember?

582
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,941
No.

583
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,977
Circumferential
necrosis to the jejunum.

584
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,911
There's really nothing viable here.
- Damn.

585
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,211
Abby? The bowel's
completely infarcted.

586
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,116
I'm sorry. We're closing.

587
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,425
So that's it.

588
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,973
Can't live without a gut.

589
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,574
I'm sorry.

590
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,653
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go tell the family.

591
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,815
Give yourself a minute. They
don't need to hear this immediately.

592
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:30,485
What am I to do, go out and get a
latte while they wonder what's going on?

593
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:34,497
All right, listen. Maybe you would want
to wait for the Attending to tell them.

594
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,499
Is that what you would do?

595
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,006
Kyle.

596
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,516
Oh, God.

597
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,624
Oh, my God.

598
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,874
Is this the Chinese interpreter?

599
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,640
Excuse me.

600
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,414
No, I don't understand
what you're saying.

601
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:28,786
I've already called them.
I was connected to you.

602
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,846
Please don't put
me on hold again.

603
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,045
Hello?

604
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,306
Yes, I'm still here.

605
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,749
I'm not sure if I need
Mandarin or Cantonese.

606
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,338
How long will it take?

607
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,976
An hour, maybe longer.

608
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,748
You helped this family, Abby.

609
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:08,148
They will remember you
for the rest of their lives.

610
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,750
Yeah.

611
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:15,383
I'm hoping you'll give
neonatology serious consideration.

612
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:20,429
Are you mocking me? Because
it's really, really not a good time.

613
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,766
No.

614
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,302
You're one of the best
students I've ever had.

615
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,042
Thank you. Bye.

616
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,452
- What?
- The Tsengs have gone to China with Dirk.

617
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,986
- What?
- That was Mrs. Tseng's cousin.

618
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,989
They went back yesterday. She
doesn't know how to reach them.

619
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,059
Come on. We've got work to do.

620
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,660
Tell me this is our last day.

621
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,998
- Good morning. How's Henry today?
- He's great.

622
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,697
He's raring to get out of here.

623
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,470
All cultures came back negative, but
we need to treat for another seven days.

624
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,977
Unless you two
allow us to do the LP.

625
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,045
I do taps on babies all day in the
ER and never think twice about it.

626
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,711
Just do the spinal tap. We
wanna take our baby home.

627
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,187
- Okay. Abby, you're on.
- Okay.

628
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,890
Dr. Raab, I would be more comfortable if
you did the procedure, if you don't mind.

629
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,859
No problem. I'll be
back after rounds.

630
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,500
Okay, thanks.

631
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,492
Let Abby do it.

632
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,035
Kerry.

633
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,695
It's okay, Sandy.

634
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,275
What's going to happen to Inga?

635
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,851
If she survives, she'll
either be adopted...

636
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,252
- or put in a long-term care facility.
- Should I call Social Work?

637
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,050
Go ahead, but nobody's
going to China to look for them.

638
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,252
Her mother wouldn't
leave her here.

639
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:00,887
They're young, scared. Maybe they
think Inga would be better off this way.

640
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,864
- In a hospital, alone?
- If you were in a foreign country...

641
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,130
with no money, no job, and
no place to live, who knows?

642
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:11,401
- You might do the same thing.
- No, I wouldn't, and neither would you.

643
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,444
You can't begin to know
what you would do...

644
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:18,276
and you don't know the first thing
about me. People are complicated.

645
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,748
That's not an excuse
for abandoning a baby.

646
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,378
Neela, if you stay that judgmental,
you're gonna hate this job.

647
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,896
CSF on the first attempt with
Dr. Mom breathing down your neck.

648
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,659
I'm impressed.

649
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,463
You should see how good
I am when I'm not post-call.

650
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,072
Wait a minute. You stuck
a needle in my kid's back...

651
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,300
and you've been
working for 36 hours?

652
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,842
Actually, it's only
been 31 hours.

653
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,445
Tube four, crystal clear.

654
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,576
Owen Miller. Bad
hypoxic brain injury.

655
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,152
Mom's your real patient.
She's letting go, needs help.

656
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:59,758
- Mrs. Miller, this is David. DAVID:
Hi. I'm your new medical student.

657
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,985
Ex-34-weeker with mec
asp and pneumomediastinum.

658
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,426
Got him off high
frequency last night.

659
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,929
- "Mec asp"?
- Meconium aspiration.

660
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,568
It's a foreign language,
but you'll pick it up fast.

661
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:13,603
Zero red blood cells.
Champagne tap.

662
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,572
Hey, before we go, do
you mind taking a picture?

663
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,076
- Thanks.
- Get your butt back down to the ER...

664
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,276
where you belong.

665
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,615
- Bye.
- Bye.

666
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,019
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

667
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:11,190
- You all signed out?
- Yeah.

668
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,827
Ever been to the Sky Bar?

669
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,031
This is disgusting.

670
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,670
I told you.

671
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,772
Why are cigars
associated with babies?

672
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,101
This stinky thing has
no place in a nursery.

673
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,641
It's Freudian.

674
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,507
Something about men wanting
to have sex with their mothers.

675
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,877
Thank you. You know what else I
don't get? Why we're drinking cider...

676
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,611
instead of champagne. You're supposed
to get champagne for a champagne tap.

677
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:39,019
- Is Weaver that cheap?
- Weaver knows I don't drink champagne.

678
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,326
So you still thinking
about neonatology?

679
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,359
Not in a million years.

680
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,365
I hope you didn't let
Raab discourage you.

681
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,024
It's more than that.

682
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,865
She thinks you should
go into NICU, you know.

683
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,206
Yeah.

684
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,703
You should.

685
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,873
No, thanks.

686
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,625
I bet every Attending
tries to recruit you.

687
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:08,419
Oh, please.

688
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,645
Look who's talking.
Your mind is a sponge.

689
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,882
Maybe, but...

690
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,550
you've got that thing.

691
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,029
I don't know what it is, but
it's much harder to learn.

692
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,635
I think all that cider's
going to your head.
