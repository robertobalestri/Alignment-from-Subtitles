1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,101
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:08,333
See? Didn't even hurt.

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,507
What should I tell Weaver?

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,280
Whatever you want.

5
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,682
Someone has died.

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,882
- Who?
- Someone named Kovac. A Dr. Luka Kovac.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,990
You're gonna go back there?

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,538
- Why? CARTER:
Because I left him there.

9
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,997
- Left him where?
- At the clinic in Matenda.

10
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,448
You sober?

11
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,063
- I'm sorry?
- You look sober.

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,598
I make it a rule to always
land in Kinshasa drunk.

13
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,467
It's my third.

14
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,571
Steve Davidson.

15
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,803
- John Carter.
- Shell? Xerox?

16
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,775
No?

17
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,846
You give me a
second, I'll figure it out.

18
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,313
I would say Coke out
of Atlanta. Am I right?

19
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,781
The new bottling plant.

20
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,947
Sorry, no.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,318
<i>Excusez-moi.</i> May I have
another Dewar's, please?

22
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,322
Could I get you something?

23
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,995
Okay, I give up.
Who are you with?

24
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,927
I'm just here on
a personal matter.

25
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:44,502
Well, there's not much
competition for the seats, is there?

26
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,101
I guess the "see a brutal
genocide" tour package...

27
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,937
didn't sell very well.

28
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,673
So, what about you?

29
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,806
Why are you going to the Congo?

30
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,113
I'm with the embassy.
Financial liaison.

31
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,280
Furthering the American
investment interest abroad.

32
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:08,725
Spreading the democratic
ideals one Big Mac at a time.

33
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,628
<i>Merci.</i>

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,525
So a personal matter, huh?

35
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,694
A friend of mine was murdered.
I'm gonna go bring him home.

36
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,070
I'm sorry to hear that.

37
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,505
If you need to see a familiar
face while you're in Kinshasa...

38
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,875
- you give me a call.
- Thanks.

39
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,986
John! John.

40
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,671
So, what happened?

41
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,248
We don't know.

42
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,348
What about Patrique?

43
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,513
He's still missing.

44
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,219
Was the Red Cross able
to recover Luka's body?

45
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,523
Excuse me.

46
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,864
Ten thousand people have
been killed in the last two weeks.

47
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,030
There are many bodies in Kivu.

48
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,561
How much longer
do we have to wait?

49
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,206
It's the Congo. Could be days.

50
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,003
How are you feeling?

51
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,877
Terrible.

52
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,379
- Who are we waiting for? I...
- Please.

53
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,814
- No more talking.
- Gillian?

54
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,855
Dr. Carter. Nice to meet you.

55
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,361
Please.

56
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,399
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>
ANDRE: <i>No, I'm afraid not.</i>

57
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,902
After numerous attempts...

58
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,940
we were able to
negotiate a passage...

59
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,873
into the Mai
Mai-held territory...

60
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,412
to evacuate wounded
noncombatants.

61
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,879
The Mai Mai provided us
with a list of the known dead.

62
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,250
- That's it?
- They also provided us...

63
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:27,758
with some personal
items to identify remains.

64
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,086
Can we get the body back? Are
there ways that that can be arranged?

65
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,626
Yeah. I'm sorry.

66
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,726
When the fighting stops, we'll
make every effort to identify remains.

67
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,233
How long will that take?

68
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,895
- I have no idea.
- Days? Weeks? Months?

69
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,304
Someone from the negotiating
team might know more.

70
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,773
Can we speak with them?

71
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,304
They're in Kisangani.

72
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,641
Debbie? ANDRE: And Gerard.

73
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,150
Have you tried Bob Chase
from the American Embassy?

74
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,151
He has contacts with
the Congolese army.

75
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,113
He may be able to help you.

76
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,755
Who's Debbie?

77
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,354
She's with the Red Cross
field office in Kisangani.

78
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,797
You'd like her.

79
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,265
She's your type.

80
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,995
What's my type?

81
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,613
We shouldn't have
left him out there.

82
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:56,339
- He didn't want us to stay.
- Should've stayed anyway.

83
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,550
Then you'd be dead too.

84
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,800
Gillian, we have to go, or
we won't get back before dark.

85
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,806
Go, go, go.

86
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,888
What should I tell Weaver?

87
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,891
Whatever you want.

88
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,696
Can I tell her
you're coming back?

89
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,927
I don't know.

90
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,601
Don't do anything stupid.

91
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:58,345
- Like what?
- Like getting yourself killed.

92
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,765
<i>He wasn't an American citizen?</i>

93
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:33,072
<i>No, but he'd been living and
working in the States for years.</i>

94
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,166
You might have better
luck at his embassy.

95
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,546
It's tough to make inquiries on
behalf of citizens of another country.

96
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,678
Does Croatia have an
embassy in the Congo?

97
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,447
Croatia?

98
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,920
No.

99
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,649
He was a close friend?

100
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,784
Yeah. We've worked
together for years.

101
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,496
The Mai Mai believe that foreigners
are looting the Congo's natural resources.

102
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,771
They see us as the enemy.

103
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,806
It is very dangerous
for Westerners.

104
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,608
Can some sort of exchange
be set up for the dead?

105
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,512
I mean, aren't those
things normally done?

106
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,486
These guys don't know about
the Geneva Convention, doctor.

107
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,147
Most of them don't
know about shoes.

108
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,653
- Nothing?
- He said to be patient.

109
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,596
What?

110
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:33,305
Excuse me. Can you tell me,
is Mr. Davidson working today?

111
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,704
What did Bob Chase tell you?

112
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,407
That we'd have to be patient.

113
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,544
I'm sure that he
knows better than I.

114
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,979
There have to be other
channels that we could pursue.

115
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,520
Have you tried the U.N.
offices or the Red Cross?

116
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,023
Yeah. We've been bouncing
around from office to office all day.

117
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,524
Well, I'm sure they're
trying everything they can.

118
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,793
Look, Dr. Carter.

119
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,697
I am not suggesting this...

120
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,035
but my experience has been that
there's not much in this country...

121
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,938
that can't be bought.

122
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,916
- What's he saying?
- Well, he's just a little concerned...

123
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:30,086
that you're gonna walk around
Kinshasa with $20,000 in your pocket.

124
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,427
What does he expect me to
do with it, stick it in my shoe?

125
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,570
Well, it may not be safe to carry
that much cash in the Congo.

126
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,932
It's not safe to carry that
much cash anywhere.

127
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,700
But I don't think the Mai
Mai take traveler's checks.

128
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,876
You can't afford to put
$20,000 on your credit card?

129
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:11,701
FAC. Government soldiers.
Heading west, away from Kivu.

130
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,572
They're retreating.

131
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,243
The Mai Mai will
come again soon.

132
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,733
Oh, God. CHARLES:
Refugees from the fighting.

133
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,209
More come every day.

134
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,715
The hospital is worse.

135
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,892
I'll put these in your room.
- Give me that big one.

136
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,587
Thanks.

137
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,679
- Still working bankers' hours, I see.
- Hello, doctor.

138
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,073
- I'm so sorry about Luka.
- How are you holding up?

139
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,145
- Doing what we can.
- I brought you some things.

140
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:39,150
Sterile gloves, needles,
catheters, syringes...

141
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,794
IV ceftriaxone and Cipro.

142
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:46,456
DPL sets, suture
kits, old pulse ox.

143
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,602
Ooh. Look at this. Microscope.

144
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,938
Tried to get a portable x-ray,
but it wouldn't fit in my carryon.

145
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,166
- Where did you get all of that?
- My hospital in Chicago donated it.

146
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,675
- Do they know they donated it?
- Yeah, more or less.

147
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,113
You busy?

148
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,377
Ten-year-old with an abdominal
GSW and gross hematuria.

149
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,713
- I'm not a surgeon.
- Dominic's been assisting...

150
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,219
and he never finished
the sixth grade.

151
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,865
We still have
enough amoxicillin?

152
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,598
Are you feeling
all right, doctor?

153
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,443
I'm just tired.

154
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,878
I'll need help. Set me up with
lidocaine, a suture kit and a scalpel.

155
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,346
You'll be fine.

156
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,718
<i>Base to mike one. Luka,
Patrique, are you there?</i>

157
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,088
<i>Luka, are you there? Over.</i>

158
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,631
Mike one to base.

159
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:34,531
<i>Luka, the fighting is getting
heavy east of you. Copy.</i>

160
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,875
- Copy that.
<i>- Have you had any problems?</i>

161
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,808
No, no. Patients are improving.

162
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,073
I'm gonna revise the flap on
the little girl in a few minutes.

163
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,549
<i>You warned Patrique
what he's in for, right?</i>

164
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,088
He's tough. He'll be fine.

165
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,657
I should go, save
the batteries. Over.

166
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,266
<i>Okay. Be safe. Clear.</i>

167
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,798
Yeah, you too. Out.

168
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,964
Doctor?

169
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,768
Doctor?

170
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,604
There she is.

171
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:55,353
- Debbie.
- Hey. Gillian.

172
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,453
This is Dr. Carter. He
was a friend of Luka's.

173
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,697
- I'm very sorry, Dr. Carter.
- Thank you.

174
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,166
The ICRC in Kinshasa said that
you were part of the negotiating team...

175
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,465
that you might have some information
about what happened to Luka.

176
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,076
No, sorry. They just gave us
the list and a few personal items.

177
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:21,146
Steve Davidson, American Embassy,
said maybe you could get us into Kivu.

178
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,374
I'm trying to recover
Dr. Kovac's body.

179
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,643
And I've brought a substantial
amount of cash along...

180
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,051
to spread around if
you think that might help.

181
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,582
- How much cash?
- Twenty thousand dollars.

182
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,858
Wow. That's a lot of cash.

183
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:44,367
I work for the Red Cross, doctor. Our
safety is dependent on our neutrality.

184
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,938
If the armies or militia
involved in this mess...

185
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,836
knew we gave
money to the enemy...

186
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,341
money used to buy weapons
or food, we'd be dead.

187
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,104
And I don't mean
dead in the water.

188
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,611
I mean "head mounted
on a sharpened stick" dead.

189
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,484
- Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
- You didn't.

190
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:06,057
I was led to believe that money
can be helpful in situations like this.

191
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,931
- So, what'll it take to get his body back?
- Time.

192
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,658
- How much time?
- It's hard to say.

193
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,402
- Thanks, Debbie.
- Sure.

194
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,411
I told you she was your type.

195
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,708
What? Not at all.

196
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,441
Hey!

197
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:36,686
Richie Rich. We've been negotiating to
get back into Kivu for more of the wounded.

198
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,722
I could use a doc to
help transport them.

199
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,291
Somebody in the camps might
know something about your friend.

200
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,522
Okay. Thanks.

201
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,259
- She's definitely not my type.
- Yeah, right.

202
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,285
Dr. Luka. Doctor.

203
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,423
- Doctor. Please, we have to go.
- What?

204
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,920
- You have a fever. Malaria?
- I'm fine. Why did you wake me?

205
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,930
The Mai Mai are in Masenga.
They are burning the village.

206
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,270
- You were pretty hard on him.
- Who?

207
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,780
John.

208
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,684
- He's cute, don't you think?
- Not again.

209
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,948
What was the last one?
The surgeon from Atlanta?

210
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,789
Turned out he had
a wife and five kids.

211
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,261
So?

212
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,477
- You need medicine.
- I took Pansidar.

213
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,280
- We have some IV quinine left.
- Save it for the boy.

214
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,642
He's getting better.
- I'm not that sick.

215
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,215
- I'll go get it.
- No!

216
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,382
Save it for the boy, okay?

217
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,522
Oh, my God.

218
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,597
You guys burned the
clinic to the ground?

219
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,135
You guys...

220
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,034
You guys keep burning down hospitals.
Where you gonna go when you get shot?

221
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,740
Where are you gonna go
when your mothers get sick?!

222
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,884
Dr. John!

223
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,985
He says many people died here.

224
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,697
They took the bodies to Kasese.

225
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,493
He thinks they're still there.

226
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,219
Doctor.

227
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,361
- What time is it?
- Early.

228
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,131
- Where is everyone?
- They left.

229
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,672
- Where did they go?
- They didn't want the Mai Mais...

230
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,332
to find them with us.

231
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,368
With me, you mean, huh?

232
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,173
- They should go too.
- They are worried about you.

233
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,213
- Give me your arm.
- Why?

234
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,317
You need medicine.

235
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,044
I told you to save the
quinine for the boy.

236
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,988
I gave him one bag and kept the
other for you. Give me your arm.

237
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,722
They should go while they can.

238
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,662
No!

239
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,034
You too. Go. I'll be fine.

240
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,710
Leave me the radio. Take
them to safety. I'll be all right.

241
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,542
We don't have the radio.
We must've left it at the camp.

242
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,582
When Charles come, he'll look for us
at the clinic first. It should be safe now.

243
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:12,282
The Mai Mais would have
already stolen everything and left.

244
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,892
He's dead, doctor. I know
you wanna get him back...

245
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,120
but Kasese is 10
miles from here.

246
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,624
I stopped in Matenda
because it was on the way.

247
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,598
Give me a vehicle. After
we've triaged, I'll have it back.

248
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,898
No, okay? No. And don't
make me regret bringing you.

249
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,234
She won't do it.

250
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,406
What's her complaint?

251
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,609
She's afraid she
might be pregnant.

252
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,115
She was raped. They all were.

253
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,920
There are more
injured down there.

254
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,172
<i>Bonjour.</i> I'm gonna
examine you, okay?

255
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,345
Gillian!

256
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,542
- What?
- Gillian!

257
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,445
I know you, don't I?

258
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,683
They were at the clinic when
we left. The boy had pertussis.

259
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,066
The Mai Mai came.

260
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,943
I think they have gone.

261
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,505
Keep walking.

262
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,831
Keep going.

263
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,019
Do you want a beer?

264
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:07,890
Beer. It's warm, tastes like
formaldehyde, but it's wet.

265
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,569
No, thanks.

266
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,069
What is that thing, a radio?

267
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,075
IPod.

268
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,080
- Digital music player.
- Fancy.

269
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,611
What are you listening to?

270
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,949
Les Nubians. The Nubians.

271
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,393
- No Dixie Chicks?
- No Dixie Chicks.

272
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,619
You don't like the Dixie Chicks?

273
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,895
So they just left him there?

274
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,732
In the jungle?

275
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,843
The Congolese were afraid to
be found with Luka and Patrique.

276
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,611
And that's all he knew?

277
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,947
That's all he knew.

278
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,784
Do you ever get worried that these guys
are gonna get bored and start shooting?

279
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,992
I don't think about it. If I did,
I'd probably never leave Seattle.

280
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:15,733
You know, I consider myself
reasonably well-informed.

281
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:20,302
But before I came, I hadn't
heard a thing about the Congo.

282
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,242
Nobody at home gives a
damn what happens out here.

283
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,009
There's no oil here.

284
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,642
Millions of people
are slaughtered...

285
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:34,114
and we're too busy
eating Happy Meals.

286
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,986
What are you doing here?

287
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,356
You don't seem the type.

288
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,831
What's the type?

289
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,999
Macho adrenaline junkies and
"save the world" peacenik freaks.

290
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,368
Which one are you?

291
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,669
Which do you think?

292
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:06,007
I don't know what
I'm doing out here.

293
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:12,080
I've been seeing this woman.

294
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,826
She's great.

295
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:19,224
But it ain't good...
for her or for me.

296
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,735
It's simpler here.

297
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:29,371
People need help.
I can help them.

298
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:40,881
I'm sorry. I think I'm tired.

299
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,951
You should get some rest.

300
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,391
I'm getting you up early. We'll
take the Rover to Kasese...

301
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,362
while they load the trucks.

302
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,835
See what we can find out.

303
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,603
Thanks.

304
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,827
Is she still in there?

305
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,993
Yes.

306
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:36,333
You speak English?
Please, I speak no French.

307
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,910
Do you know what are
they going to do with us?

308
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,178
They're waiting for someone to
come and tell them what to do.

309
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,886
Can you tell them
I'm a geologist?

310
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,545
I'm not involved in the war.

311
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,016
I'm only here for rocks.

312
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,833
Another truck with soldiers.

313
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,617
They are coming.

314
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,116
Can you see?

315
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,517
No.

316
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,013
Oh, God.

317
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:01,320
They are coming back.

318
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,282
Damn, Gillian, how can you
smoke this early in the morning?

319
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,678
So, what made you
change your mind?

320
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,784
About what?

321
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,223
About coming out here.

322
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,153
You've come a long way. I figured I
could help you get the last few miles.

323
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,734
Here we go.

324
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:27,874
What was this place?

325
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,942
A school, I think.

326
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,354
He says the bodies
from the clinic are inside.

327
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:44,218
You don't have
to. We can just go.

328
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,882
- Are you religious, Patrique?
- No.

329
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,427
I was raised in the Church.

330
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,125
Catholic.

331
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:27,796
I used to go twice a
week with my mother.

332
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,413
It was beautiful.

333
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,612
I liked the music, the singing.

334
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,627
- Do you still go?
- No.

335
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,089
I stopped when my
children were killed.

336
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,660
I couldn't believe in a God that will
allow such a cruel thing to happen.

337
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:13,510
It's really hard to feel the Holy Spirit's
presence on a day like today, huh?

338
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,671
I'm sorry, Patrique.

339
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,338
I shouldn't have let you stay.

340
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,870
Oh, my God.

341
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,925
Gillian, stay outside.

342
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,823
It isn't him.

343
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,660
- What?
- This isn't Luka!

344
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,495
What?

345
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,297
Ask him! Was he there
when these men were killed?

346
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,060
This man. This man.
Did you see this man?

347
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,974
Where is this man?

348
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,908
What's he saying?

349
00:36:57,182 --> 00:37:01,142
- What's he saying?
- He says that Luka is a priest.

350
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,311
- A what?
- A priest.

351
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:09,920
No, no. Don't you... No, no, no!

352
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:15,565
No! Please, please. No, no, no.

353
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,618
Luka.

354
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,226
Is he alive?

355
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,408
Thank you.

356
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,713
Thank you.

357
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,380
Hey. LUKA: Hey.

358
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,517
How you feeling?

359
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,811
Terrible.

360
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,614
Where am I going?

361
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,848
Home.

362
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,149
Where's that?

363
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:46,992
America. Got a medical transport plane
in Kinshasa waiting to take you back.

364
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:50,260
- Expensive.
- I know somebody who knows somebody.

365
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,508
Give this to Abby
when you see her.

366
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,541
You're not coming?

367
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,210
I think I'm gonna stick
around for a while.

368
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,684
If she asks... just tell her...

369
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,849
Tell her I was lost,
and now I'm found.

370
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,068
Thank you.

371
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:53,060
Well, back to work.

372
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:58,929
You really don't like
the Dixie Chicks?

373
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,264
Everybody likes
the Dixie Chicks.

374
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,903
- Everybody?
- Everybody with any taste.
