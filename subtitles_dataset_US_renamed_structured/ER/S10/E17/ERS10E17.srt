1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,832
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,465
If it's a choice between
something serious or nothing...

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,168
maybe serious is the way to go.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,340
- You still on for dinner tonight?
- I thought you were dating a teacher?

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,418
I am.

6
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,144
Take care, big man.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,551
Please, don't go.

8
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,215
Chuck and I are gonna have
a baby. You'll be a grandpa.

9
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,384
- You marrying her?
- If she'll have me.

10
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,641
- That's it.
- What is that?

11
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,022
Little bit of Sikh rap.

12
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,598
- Wait.
- He's stable. He's fine.

13
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,541
I know. But...

14
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:35,861
If I don't leave, I'll
lose it! Understand?!

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,638
Kertzenstein, Lester.

16
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,407
Lester. Lester, Lester.

17
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,211
- Very polite.
- He should try Pathology.

18
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,718
That way his patients
die before he gets to them.

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,651
I heard he wants
Radiology anyway.

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,984
Second tier. Lockhart, Abby.

21
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,321
- Very strong clinical skills.
- Efficient when she needs to be.

22
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,166
Knows where to spend her time.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,328
Only one still not sure
about Abby is Abby.

24
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,165
Does she want
Emergency Medicine?

25
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,204
As much as she wants anything.

26
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,775
All right. Rank to
match. Rasgotra, Neela.

27
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,407
- Intelligent, very sweet.
- Studious.

28
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,040
Studious? She's the
smartest one on the floor.

29
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,581
Come on.

30
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,452
She could be more assertive.

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,561
She has a tendency to hang
back, avoid getting into traumas.

32
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,129
She's cautious. It's good.
- She's not ER.

33
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,063
She'll be a star in internal
medicine or research...

34
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,067
something using your intellect,
but she's not an ER doc.

35
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,468
Since when did intellect become
a liability to working in the ER?

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,541
There was a memo
while you were in Africa.

37
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,212
Because I think she's excellent.
She basically saved Frank's life.

38
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,143
She's thoughtful,
but she's deliberate.

39
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,215
Is that code for
passive and slow?

40
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:00,445
- She's a student. She's gonna get faster.
- And in four months she'll be a doctor.

41
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,214
I say rank to match.

42
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,914
That's not the consensus.

43
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,089
The consensus is wrong.

44
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,718
Okay. The NRMP list doesn't
have to go out right away.

45
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,956
Carter, change our minds.

46
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,966
At least you have time for
your reclamation project.

47
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,799
I'm on a plane
to Africa tonight.

48
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,804
- For how long?
- About a week or so.

49
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,272
How's Kem doing?

50
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,809
Pregnant. Asked me to
fill a suitcase full of Ho Hos.

51
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,573
- Save some for me.
- Need you to sign off on these dispos.

52
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,411
My shift's over. Fourteen
hours isn't enough?

53
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:34,077
Dr. Carter, 27-year-old healthy
male, knee versus circular saw.

54
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:38,248
- Chuck said he'd wait for you outside.
- Chivalry. Time of death, 8:07.

55
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,065
- How long has he been here?
- Sat in Triage for seven hours.

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,097
- And back in a room for the last two.
- Good luck, Carter.

57
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,823
You irrigated, yeah?

58
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,992
I was concerned that the
lac might extend to the joint.

59
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,003
- For nine hours?
- I thought I should wait on you.

60
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,334
You think Ike Ryan's
serving burgers this early?

61
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,101
I really need a burger.

62
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,767
What is up with you?

63
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,381
I think we got a case of
sympathetic pregnancy going on here.

64
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,810
Excuse me?

65
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:08,547
I have all the symptoms. Nausea,
gas, increased salivation, cravings.

66
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:12,352
- I gotta pee all the time.
- You had all that before I got pregnant.

67
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,020
You know, I have to sit down.
Just get me whatever you're getting.

68
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,689
All right. See, we're
together in this.

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,372
Morning.

70
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,976
Morning.

71
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:35,005
- When are you due?
- Another month or so.

72
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,811
I love kids. When my wife
was pregnant with ours...

73
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,316
it was the best thing ever.

74
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,548
- Yeah. It's pretty great.
- We're divorced now.

75
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,022
Oh, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,592
Women are never more beautiful
than when they're pregnant.

77
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,494
Wish it felt that way.

78
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,158
Hey...

79
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,164
don't let anyone ever
tell you you're not sexy.

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,037
Because you are sexy.

81
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,740
Thank you.

82
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,882
Any real man knows that there's
nothing better than making love...

83
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:13,578
to a round, smooth,
nurturing mother-to-be.

84
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,382
I hope you don't take
that the wrong way.

85
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,925
- There's a right way?
- I didn't mean to offend you.

86
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,353
- You know what? It's okay.
- Can I touch it?

87
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,522
- Excuse me?
- Your belly. Can I touch it?

88
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,635
- Hey, what's going on?
- You know what? We need to go.

89
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,431
- What are you doing?
- I was just talking to the lady.

90
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,868
He wanted to touch my belly.

91
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,531
- Is he hitting on you?
- Ease up. I don't see a ring.

92
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,768
Oh.

93
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,979
- God, my lip.
- Must be the hormones.

94
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,600
It was flagrant assault. I called
the cops. My lawyer's on the way.

95
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,403
- You molested me first.
- I asked you an innocent question.

96
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,012
- It was not innocent.
- That caveman...

97
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,081
decked me for exercising
my freedom of speech!

98
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,014
Long as I'm stitching your lip,
you have no freedom of speech.

99
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,778
He was defending me!

100
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,322
You didn't need defending.
I was just being friendly.

101
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,727
Order a nasal series and let me
know when his x-rays are back.

102
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,495
- What a creep.
- Could have punched him in his teeth.

103
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,998
- That way they can't talk.
- He apologize?

104
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,104
- No. But he called the cops.
- To what? To turn himself in?

105
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,137
No. Come on. We
have to have a little chat.

106
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,002
No, I understand.

107
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,634
You have a great time.
Yeah, next weekend.

108
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,440
- Morning.
- Hey there.

109
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,607
- What's wrong?
- It's Alex's birthday tomorrow.

110
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,048
- Yeah, I heard.
- I wanted to throw him a party.

111
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,223
But Austin's his only friend and
his folks are taking him skiing.

112
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,052
- Get him a clown.
- Yeah. Good idea.

113
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,558
What's wrong with a
clown? Kids love clowns.

114
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:38,562
Next time inject five cc's of fluorescein
and observe under a Wood's lamp.

115
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,496
- I wasn't sure.
- Then come find me, don't just wait.

116
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,069
I didn't want to
interrupt the meeting.

117
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,741
Neela, we were ranking
fourth-year med students in there.

118
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,377
And everybody agreed
you're really bright and we like...

119
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,739
- Someone spoke poorly of me?
- Nobody particular.

120
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,348
- Dr. Chen? She's had it in for me...
- Neela.

121
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:59,316
You have to be more decisive.
Okay, you have to be more proactive.

122
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,011
They feel I'm too passive?

123
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,315
Tell you what, next four
hours, you're a doctor.

124
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,857
Carry a minimum of
three patients at all times.

125
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,824
Rescue 37, county
base, go ahead.

126
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,020
Start workups, order
their labs and meds...

127
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,564
and present back to me only after
you put your own plan into action.

128
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,259
- Today, you're a shark.
- Shark?

129
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,701
- Keep swimming or die.
- County General, over.

130
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:22,001
Car versus nursing home medivan.
Getting the driver, two passengers.

131
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,438
Anybody unstable?

132
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,273
- Good vitals on all. ETA, nine minutes.
- Got the first one.

133
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,178
Okay. So work up these three. In fact,
just work up these two. That's enough.

134
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,875
And then go help Gallant.

135
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,949
Hey, Mike.

136
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,091
Leaving that stripper in Curtain
4 with the broken toe for you.

137
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,750
- Try not to T.U.B.E. her.
- What are you talking about?

138
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,091
Totally Unnecessary Breast
Exam. Avoid your worst impulses.

139
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,790
- I think you're projecting.
- Michael, hi.

140
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,459
New-onset seizure.
Needs to go to Medicine.

141
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,868
Post-op appy with fever needs a
belly CT. Call me if there's a problem.

142
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,905
- Got you.
- Feel like getting breakfast?

143
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,704
- Maybe another time.
- Deb, lady waiting for you in Triage.

144
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,472
- Gallant can take her.
- It's not a patient. She's a nurse.

145
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,343
She says she works for you.

146
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,613
Have a good shift, Neela.

147
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,253
Lucia?

148
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,721
- Sorry to bother you.
- Something happen with my dad?

149
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,292
No. The night nurse
agreed to stay late.

150
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,392
I'm not coming back.

151
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,625
Your father won't wear the
diaper. He throws food at me.

152
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,497
When I try to help dress
him, he yells very bad words.

153
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,504
I appreciate your patience.

154
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,141
You know, this isn't really him.

155
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:32,609
I know he's a very good man,
Dr. Chen, but I can't do it anymore.

156
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,308
If you could just give me a few
days until I can get a replacement...

157
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,009
Here's my address. You
can send my last check there.

158
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,177
- And give him this for me.
- Lucia...

159
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,686
I pray for him.

160
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,957
I don't like working on old
people or children or drunks.

161
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,433
And what's with all the sick
people? They make it such a drag.

162
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,802
He's just motivating you
for the match rankings.

163
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,501
You know, maybe they're right.
Maybe this job's just too fast for me.

164
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,526
Too unpredictable.

165
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,646
It's a big hospital. If
ER's not a good fit...

166
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,042
Then what?

167
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,807
NICU made me
wanna jump off the roof.

168
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,509
Pedes is full of screaming
brats and parents...

169
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,053
and ob-gyn's a lifetime of
overnights and malpractice suits.

170
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,717
I could go into research or teaching,
but is that really why I became a doctor?

171
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,722
I'm sorry. Were
you talking to me?

172
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,464
This place is so up and down.

173
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:33,129
I mean, you learn to ride
through the rough days. I did.

174
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:37,209
- You were probably good from the start.
- Are you kidding me?

175
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,472
I came in young,
dumb and scared.

176
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,913
At least you... You're
good with the books.

177
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,019
You really like it here?

178
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,178
I wouldn't stay if I didn't.

179
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,316
Luis Sanchez, MVA passenger...

180
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,927
deformed upper right leg,
probable femur fracture.

181
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,824
- No!
- Give anything for the pain?

182
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,226
- Pressure's too low, 90/70.
- From a nursing home?

183
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,232
- Make it stop! It hurts!
- Is this a change in mental status?

184
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,428
I don't think it's from the crash.
Home said he fell in December.

185
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,166
- Can you call my wife? I have a wife.
- Figured he had some kind of brain injury.

186
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,401
Lower-extremity fracture,
borderline pressure.

187
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,944
Need to rule out
intra-abdominal bleed. Trauma 1.

188
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,914
- Two more MVA's rolling in behind me.
- Okay. On my way.

189
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,303
- Can we medicate?
- Once his pressure's up.

190
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,059
- Here's the SonoSite.
- Two liters of saline wide open.

191
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,886
Maybe we can draw up analgesics?

192
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,186
- Luis, do you have any allergies?
- I don't know, I don't know.

193
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,794
Are you taking any medications?

194
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,365
- Mary gives me my pills.
- What kind of pills?

195
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,694
Blue and green and three white.

196
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,769
Morrison's good.
No blood in the belly.

197
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,700
- Pressure's up to 100.
- Morphine?

198
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,864
Need a med list and
allergy history first.

199
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,532
- Make it stop! It hurts!
- Pocket doppler and Surgilube.

200
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,373
- I don't like...
- Cole's potassium is 3.2.

201
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,879
- Forty of K-Dur.
- Suze, I'm not gonna do it.

202
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,210
- Then he'll press charges.
- I have other things.

203
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,819
- We should press charges.
- This is Neela from County.

204
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,081
- For having a disturbing pickup line?
- I need to speak to a nurse.

205
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,556
- I believe the name's Mary.
- Just say you're sorry.

206
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,719
- Valproic acid level for Mr. Bernstein.
- Done with your freak.

207
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:06,424
Give a half bolus, seven per kilo
IV. When will the nurse be available?

208
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,625
Can you read me the
list from the chart then?

209
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,394
- Why not?
- Can Mrs. Herrero eat?

210
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,334
Two-gram sodium
diet, 1800 calorie ADA.

211
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,509
Sorry you had a bad morning,
but Luis Sanchez had a worse one.

212
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,338
So could you please fax us
the med list as soon as possible?

213
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,745
<i>Screw you! You
want it, get your ass...</i>

214
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,252
How about a magician?
Magicians are cool.

215
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,654
Last year he wanted a pig embryo.
You really think a magician's gonna do it?

216
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,420
Lucy Kilmer, another van
passenger from the nursing home.

217
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,030
History of laryngeal cancer,
complains of low back pain.

218
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,996
- Where was she sitting?
- Middle row.

219
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,658
- Vitals good, resps 12.
- Any belly pain, ma'am?

220
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,266
No, I'm okay.

221
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:50,542
- Carter needs help with the van driver.
- I have just the thing for him. Paintball.

222
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,269
Good idea. Put
a gun in his hand.

223
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,506
- Fifty more of fent is in.
- Got a flail segment with hemopneumo.

224
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,810
Betadine and
size-eight sterile gloves.

225
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,584
- What do you need?
- Tachy at 126.

226
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,212
The guy next door needs
meds but there's no drug records.

227
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,222
- Call the nursing home.
- I did. They'll get back to me.

228
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,986
- You tell them it was urgent?
- They seem very disorganized.

229
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,789
I'll need a second Thora-Seal.

230
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,023
You keep paperwork
on the patients you drive?

231
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,134
- He's not breathing.
- In-line traction. Get ready to bag him.

232
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,167
I need a doctor.
Trouble with a trach.

233
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,965
10 blade and a 32 French.

234
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,663
- Carter.
- Neela, go with Sam.

235
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,038
- BP holding at 126 systolic.
- Okay, bag him up.

236
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,907
- Trach's out.
- She must have pulled it.

237
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,979
She needs a new one.

238
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,140
Number-four shiley, uncuffed.

239
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,825
- Okay, I'll call a doctor.
- No, no. I can do it.

240
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,430
- You need some Surgilube.
- Right.

241
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:49,160
Okay, ma'am, extend your
neck and look up at the ceiling.

242
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,826
On your third breath. Ready?

243
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:56,671
In, out, in, out. Big breath in.

244
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,508
- Pulse ox coming up.
- Let's tie it in.

245
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,907
Got it.

246
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,676
Thank you.

247
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,889
Doctors? We don't
need no stinking doctors.

248
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,193
- Neela!
- She could use some ice chips.

249
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:19,225
Sats are coming up. Transport information
on the passengers. Found it in his jacket.

250
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,423
Go! Go!

251
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,344
Into the pleural
space, chest tube's in.

00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,132
Up to 120.

253
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,364
Discharge summary
from the last hospital visit.

254
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,973
- When was it?
- Three weeks ago.

255
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,303
- Good. Good enough.
- Mr. Anderson's vomiting blood in CT.

256
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,413
Okay. Titrate morphine to
pain. Start with four milligrams.

257
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,379
Hemocue's 15. I don't think
he has any internal bleeding.

258
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,750
Stop. Not the morphine.

259
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,150
Nausea and vomiting with morphine
during his last hospitalization.

260
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,382
What do you wanna do?

261
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,817
I'll be right back.

262
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,589
Jerry, tell him. JERRY: It
is not unmanly to apologize.

263
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,083
Just do it and let's get
out of here. I'm exhausted.

264
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,723
Okay. I'm going in.

265
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,961
- Dr. Gallant go to CT yet?
- Yeah, he's there.

266
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,399
Has there been a fax for me?

267
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,938
Price list from Crazy
Joe's Party Supplies?

268
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,406
Who knew piñatas
were so expensive?

269
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,603
- Damn it. LEWIS:
Everything okay, Neela?

270
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,407
Got it taken care of.

271
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,914
Neela, Mr. Lavecchia's
urine's four-plus for blood.

272
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,349
- Kidney stone, 30 of toradol.
- I pulled Demerol.

273
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,079
No. Give the Toradol 15
minutes before we try narcotics.

274
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,588
- All right. I'll put it away.
- No, I'll take it.

275
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,656
Pain scale, eight out of
ten. Give him something.

276
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,300
Discharge summary says
he got post-op Demerol.

277
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,935
Good. How much?

278
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,331
Abby, triple-lumen CVP kit?

279
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,938
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.
- Please.

280
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:38,135
- Please stop hurting. Please.
- All right, Luis.

281
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,179
This is going to make
you feel much better.

282
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,678
It's so sweet to
see them growing.

283
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,482
- Babies?
- Men.

284
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,215
Dr. Lewis, Mr. Hemorrhoid
in 3 is asking for you.

285
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,191
Oh, no. I'm not here.
I left an hour ago.

286
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,262
- Crazy bastard! Get off me!
- Pull his hair!

287
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,062
Chuck, stop!

288
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,304
Oh, my God.

289
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,475
Stop it, Chuck.

290
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,506
- Get your hands off me!
- Come on. Come on, guys.

291
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,640
- Come on, Chuck.
- Okay. All right, all right.

292
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,524
It don't hurt no more.
You made it go away.

293
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,659
Isolated femur
fracture awaiting Ortho.

294
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,887
No evidence of occult blood loss,
vitals stable, medicated for pain.

295
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,896
Good. Wheezing in Two,
sudden-onset visual loss in the eye room.

296
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,297
- Which one should I take?
- Both.

297
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,334
Keep it up.

298
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,503
- I never touched the guy.
- Says you handled him aggressively.

299
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,376
- She handled him?
- Yeah, in his dreams.

300
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,018
- There are potential lawsuits here.
- You're kidding me.

301
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,848
He's threatened to sue the
hospital, Emergency Department...

302
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,683
city, county and
fire department.

303
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,189
- I'm not even on duty.
- I need this to go away.

304
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,692
- Either I get the lawyers down here and...
- No, fine, I will talk to him.

305
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,956
- What? No. No.
- No, he's weird, he's not nuts.

306
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,862
I will talk some sense into him.

307
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,775
- Hernia's trapped outside the abdomen.
- That bad?

308
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,935
- You ready to round?
- Deep breath, Bobby.

309
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,306
- Better?
- Yeah, thanks.

310
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,644
A surgeon will come. Straightforward
procedure, nothing to worry about.

311
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,182
- Cool.
- Inguinal hernia?

312
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,116
Incarcerated. Reduced
without sedation. The kid's tough.

313
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,849
Twenty-year-old asthmatic
came in with a sat of 89.

314
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,483
On his third albuterol with
atrovent, received sixty of pred.

315
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,653
Aeration's improved
but still 92 on room air.

316
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,162
- Call Medicine?
- On their way.

317
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,064
- Can I get some more water?
- Tiger Lily Lee, 24, cotton mouth.

318
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,063
- I'm, like, parched all the time.
- History of polydipsia...

319
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:51,643
led me to check her blood sugar,
642. New-onset diabetes. Not DKA yet.

320
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,007
- You should give 10 units...
- Of regular insulin...

321
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,412
two liters of saline, and I
consulted Endocrine. Back to bed.

322
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,677
Great. You can
send it to this address.

323
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,684
Hey. SILVIO: Oh, Neela.

324
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,379
We're on our way out.

325
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,185
- She's looking much better.
- Yeah. Back to her usual self.

326
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,352
Viral gastroenteritis. I consulted
Kovac as you were too busy.

327
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,020
Thanks for your help, doctor.

328
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,189
Mr. Silvio, four
ounces every hour.

329
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,029
And don't let her chug, because
she'll just throw it back up.

330
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,604
- Rehydration, avoided IV, out in an hour.
- The girl is on fire.

331
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,865
- Yeah, you told us so.
- I told you so.

332
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,961
- Told you what?
- Nothing. Attending gossip.

333
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,705
- Hey, did you check out the van driver?
- Yes.

334
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,113
He needs an exploratory
laparotomy. We're moving him up.

335
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,718
So?

336
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,754
His lungs re-expanded,
350cc's out the left tube.

337
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,358
No, no, no. Not that.
Last night. The surgeon.

338
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:44,531
Oh, it was... splendid.

339
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,394
Is that British for
sweaty and hot?

340
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,263
- I don't kiss and tell.
- Abby.

341
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,872
Radiology's bouncing back your patient.
His temp's up and he's unresponsive.

342
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,736
I'm gonna need some dirt later.
- Our gift shop sucks.

343
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,035
Couldn't find anything?

344
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,235
Novelized version of
<i>The Matrix Reloaded.</i>

345
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,644
I had them fax over a
menu so you could see.

346
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,712
Mr. Hyde's Tavern.

347
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,648
It's a haunted-mansion
restaurant.

348
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,287
Strawberry blood
shake? Tarantula fries?

349
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,946
That's cool, right?

350
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,558
I want it to be something
he'll remember. Special.

351
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,558
What? A blood
shake's not special?

352
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:19,995
This is Frederika Torrez. Hurt her
ankle during tennis team practice.

353
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,929
- Who put this on?
- Sister Margaret. She's my coach.

354
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,629
- Did she come with you?
- She's out in the waiting room.

355
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,399
Did you roll it inside or out?

356
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,772
- I can't really remember.
- The toenail's bruised.

357
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,474
Did you do anything
else besides twisting it?

358
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,240
I don't think so.

359
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,984
Are you sure you didn't jam
your toe or kick something?

360
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,186
Okay. There's this really creepy
guy who keeps on flashing us...

361
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,256
during practice from
outside the fence.

362
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,793
You know, opening his coat, and
he's naked underneath. I mean, totally.

363
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,090
- It's really gross.
- Yeah, I bet.

364
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,393
Sister Margaret called the cops but
he got away before they showed up.

365
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,164
So today we just got sick
of it. We all ran after him...

366
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,364
and got some whacks
in before he got away.

367
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,008
You beat this man up?

368
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,407
Sister Margaret also teaches
us self-defense. She's cool.

369
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,510
How bad did you hurt him?

370
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,042
I'm pretty sure
we kicked his ass.

371
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,019
Need a little help here. He's
unresponsive. Temp's 105.8.

372
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,952
He didn't have a
fever before. Luis?

373
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,456
He needs a septic workup.

374
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,026
CBC, blood cultures times
two, cathed UA, spinal tap?

375
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,527
- Rule out encephalitis and meningitis.
- Oh, no!

376
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,995
- All right, roll him.
- Ativan?

377
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,657
- Four mgs.
- Push it. Is he on phenothiazine?

378
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,668
- What does the medical record say?
- I'll see if it came in.

379
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,032
You didn't get it yet?

380
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,540
- Headache's worse.
- I'll get you another shot.

381
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,109
- Did you look at my x-rays yet?
- Soon, Mrs. Jenkins.

382
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,545
- Slow down, you're showing us up.
- Luis is seizing.

383
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,046
- Who?
- Brain injury guy.

384
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,979
- I thought he was stable.
- Not anymore.

385
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,471
- Six of Ativan on board.
- Another gram of Dilantin.

386
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,317
- Med list.
- Why didn't you have it?

387
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,014
Fax wasn't in. Driver's record
was only three weeks old.

388
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,420
All right, read it to me.

389
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,322
Baclofen, omeprazole,
Keflex, tolderodine.

390
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,726
The only thing new is his
anti-depressant. Phenelzine?

391
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,231
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitor.
- What did you give him?

392
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,232
- Morphine.
- Need to think about an airway.

393
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,893
- No, Demerol.
- You gave Demerol?

394
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,370
- He had nausea with morphine...
- Serotonin syndrome.

395
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,668
- What?
- Never give Demerol with an inhibitor.

396
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,937
- It can be fatal. ABBY:
Let's get him on O2, 15 liters.

397
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,672
Okay, spinal tap.
Come on, prep a drape.

398
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,446
Your better half got that
idiot to drop the whole thing.

399
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,610
She did? What do we have to do?

400
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,686
You don't have to do anything.

401
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,598
- You mind if I lift your shirt up a bit?
- Don't push your luck, creep.

402
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,799
<i>You are dead.</i>

403
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,644
Don't worry. I'll get Chuny
to put battery acid in his IV.

404
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,304
Hey, Jerry, will you
check on my x-rays?

405
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,883
- What's up with you?
- I defended Susan from some freak.

406
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,453
And ended up
getting her molested.

407
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,783
I can't watch this anymore.

408
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,450
George Deakins, mugged under
the Michigan Avenue Bridge.

409
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,256
Lovely day. You'd think you
could take a walk by the river.

410
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,162
- Could you remove your coat, please?
- I'd rather not.

411
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,963
In order to examine you, I
need to listen to your chest.

412
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,805
It's all right, George.

413
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,179
They steal your clothes?

414
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,752
Yeah.

415
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,411
Okay, get him a drape.

416
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,318
Cocktail napkin ought to do it.

417
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,959
So they scratched you up pretty
good. How many guys were there?

418
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,860
Must have been,
like, four or five.

419
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,433
With long nails
and a tennis racket?

420
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,597
So, George...

421
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,170
you're a sports fan?

422
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,312
- Fluid looks clear.
- BP's sky high, 220/140.

423
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,679
Start an esmolol drip.

424
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,509
Hypertension part
of the syndrome?

425
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,048
Who pushed Demerol for you?

426
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,697
- Nobody. I did.
- There was no nurse?

427
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,772
- I was called out.
- It's not Abby's fault.

428
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:05,347
- I'm capable of pushing pain meds.
- Shouldn't push without a history.

429
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,221
- I didn't wanna wait. He was in pain.
- Who did you speak to?

430
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,316
The receptionist.

431
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,224
So you didn't actually
talk to a doctor...

432
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,695
- Dr. Carter...
- I couldn't.

433
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,697
No. You can't take
no for an answer...

434
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,803
- when you have an unstable patient.
- I gave her the order.

435
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,400
I thought you said morphine.

436
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,142
Neela saw it was
contra-indicated, so I changed it.

437
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,835
And what? You forgot?

438
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,810
I was a bit preoccupied.
Had someone crashing in CT.

439
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,348
Dr. Gallant... Myoclonus
and hyper-reflexia here.

440
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,214
Isn't there a serotonin
antagonist we can give him?

441
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,252
- We just have to wait.
- For what?

442
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,381
To see if he lives.

443
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,383
<i>When can I go?</i>

444
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,590
Talk to the police first.

445
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,893
The police? About my mugging?

446
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,865
Yeah.

447
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,274
- Still haven't left?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

448
00:22:58,444 --> 00:22:59,742
I am going to kill you.

449
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,074
Baby, please, I am sorry.

450
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:06,777
Listen. Come on. Don't be like that.
Who knew that guy was such a whack?

451
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,784
How does a guy get
to be such a freak?

452
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,423
- Born with a Y-chromosome?
- Oh, so all men are twisted?

453
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,286
- You said it.
- You hate men?

454
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,259
If it weren't for sperm and
heavy lifting, you'd all be useless.

455
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:20,098
I can't wait to pop this baby out
so men will quit looking at me...

456
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,098
like I'm Mother Teresa
or the <i>Maxim</i> cover.

457
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,601
It's not just men. The
world is full of degenerates.

458
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,262
Yeah. And the sad part is
they always get away with it.

459
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,172
Get him! Get him! Get him!

460
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:36,943
Temp's still up, 104.

461
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,052
Another 200 of IV dantrolene.
How come there's no written order?

462
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,711
We were busy. I
called it out on the run.

463
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,983
Demerol, 50 milligrams IV
push. Verbal order at 10:23.

464
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,318
Dr. Gallant, can I speak
with you for a moment?

465
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,329
- You're right. It was more like 10:45.
- Pulse ox down to 82.

466
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,062
- He's not moving any air.
- Too much Ativan?

467
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:58,466
Or neurologic damage from hyperthermia.
Let's open an intubation tray...

468
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,503
bag him on 100 percent.

469
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,637
His wife and daughter are here.
- Suction's ready.

470
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,209
Call Respiratory for a vent.

471
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:08,143
- Sats are up to 89 with bagging.
- Take them to the family room.

472
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:10,146
Neela, you're doing
the tube. Let's go.

473
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,395
Welcome to the perv
ward, Mr. Deakins.

474
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,464
- You put me in a special room?
- Don't worry. They're all special.

475
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,126
Pervert's a relative
term, honey.

476
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,141
Call me honey again, I give you the
longest Foley catheter in the world.

477
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:36,542
Neosporin to the lac. BID.

478
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,336
So I've got our problem solved.

479
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,244
- Alex's birthday party.
- Thanks for the help, Luka.

480
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,677
But I think it's my problem.

481
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,149
You see, that's
your first mistake.

482
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,315
Anyway, a plan is in motion,
arrangements are being made...

483
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,014
and everything is under control.

484
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,751
Keegan's CBC isn't back yet
and I need a head CT on Hong.

485
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,953
Do me a favor? Check
my departure time?

486
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,860
- What, are you flying through Paris?
- Amsterdam.

487
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,260
Hello!

488
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,363
- Frank.
- Hey, Frank.

489
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,506
- What's up? How are you?
- Thought I'd stop on my way from rehab.

490
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,266
- How's that going?
- How do you think?

491
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,900
They split me open like a Montana trout.
You don't just bounce back, you know?

492
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,276
- Wanna see my scar?
- No. Guy in Two might wanna touch it.

493
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,879
- You look good. You do.
- I can do two miles on the treadmill.

494
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,580
I haven't been able to
do that since, well, ever.

495
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,993
- Where are my last two paychecks?
- Been holding them for you.

496
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,390
- Where? In your wallet?
- When are you coming back?

497
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:34,623
I don't know. Rehab's like a vacation,
my old police benefits are a charm...

498
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,565
I don't really miss
this sideshow.

499
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,967
- Is Dr. Pratt around?
- He's off today.

500
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,536
- Tell him I owe him a beer.
- Sure thing.

501
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:51,274
My doctor's not ready for me to come
back to work yet. It's gonna be a while.

502
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,514
But I do miss everybody.
I just wanted to say that.

503
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,281
Four-year-old, left
upper quadrant pain.

504
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:00,426
Found with shortness
of breath, confusion.

505
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,562
He kept asking for me even
though I was standing right there.

506
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,460
- Tachy at 144, resps 42.
- BP, 86/55.

507
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,726
- When did your tummy start hurting?
- No, Mommy, no.

508
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,235
She's on her way, buddy.
He's not making any sense.

509
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,649
- Any medical problems?
- No. Always been healthy.

510
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,266
Seventy-seven systolic.

511
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:19,139
- How are you doing, Tevin?
- I don't like horses.

512
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:23,043
He's altered. Have an intubation
tray ready and squeeze in those fluids.

513
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,912
- Do you know what this is?
- Your son's spleen is enlarged.

514
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,613
It may be acting like a sponge,
soaking up his blood so it can't circulate.

515
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,313
So, what can you do to stop it?

516
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,460
Hopefully transfusions will keep
him stable until we know the cause.

517
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,254
First liter in.
Pulse in the 70s.

518
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,590
Okay, keep the NS
coming. Femoral-line kit.

519
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,289
I'm with him every day.

520
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,477
I take care of him. Nothing
like this has ever happened.

521
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,596
Does your son have a history of
thalassemia or sickle cell disease?

522
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,264
- My wife has the trait, I tested negative.
- I wanna go on a Ferris wheel.

523
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,741
As soon as you're better, buddy. I
don't know what that other thing is.

524
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,142
Thalassemia. It's a
hereditary anemia.

525
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,749
Here you go. Talking to
him's the best thing you can do.

526
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,114
- Blood's here.
- Line's in. Run them on the infuser.

527
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,983
Occult trauma? Should
we call in social work?

528
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,626
I don't know. Could be
malignancy, hemoglobinopathies...

529
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,489
- That's some differential.
- Yeah.

530
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,654
Add a sickle screen
and HIV to the labs.

531
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,926
We didn't realize Luis was
recently put on phenelzine.

532
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:20,436
An interaction between the drugs
creates the condition serotonin syndrome.

533
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,772
You get very sick.

534
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,608
- Like when they gave him the morphine?
- Worse.

535
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:31,614
You get high fever, high blood
pressure, rapid heart rate, muscle spasms.

536
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,776
- How long does that last?
- A few days at least.

537
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,854
But it's very serious.

538
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,992
Up to 30 percent of the people
with serotonin syndrome die from it.

539
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:44,322
- So 70 percent survive?
- Yes, ma'am.

540
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,166
They didn't think he'd ever
wake up after the fall, but he did.

541
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,794
Good. Good. That
means he's a fighter.

542
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,466
He's really smart, you know?

543
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,637
I mean, he was gonna go back
to school before the accident.

544
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,645
Then I got pregnant again.

545
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,316
My dad hired him on
at his roofing business.

546
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,148
Don't usually
work when it's icy.

547
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:13,884
But there was a job that he
wanted to finish before Christmas.

548
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,094
- Why say you did this?
- It doesn't change anything.

549
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,164
- I'm partially to blame.
- It's okay to lie?

550
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,666
- Do you want to match or not?
- Only if I deserve to.

551
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,168
You do. So let this be my fault.

552
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,830
Patellar dislocation in
Curtain 4 needs a reduction.

553
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:32,000
- How's Luis?
- He's stable.

554
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,005
It's looking pretty good.

555
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,718
- Is there something I should know about?
- No.

556
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,082
You did what you were told.
Gallant's supervising resident.

557
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,351
Should have known not to order
up a drug without a medical history.

558
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,358
He didn't. I did.

559
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,896
You ordered the Demerol?

560
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,928
I assessed it, I
ordered it, I pushed it.

561
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,899
And you didn't run it by
an Attending or a Resident?

562
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:04,400
- No.
- Because I asked you to be autonomous?

563
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,711
Found an Arabic interpreter
for your belly-pain lady.

564
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,050
Thank you. All right, we need
to talk about this, the three of us.

565
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,712
- Everything okay?
- Fantastic.

566
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,288
Oh, Lavecchia's results.
Kidney stone from this morning.

567
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:21,723
No hydro, pain-free with Toradol
and ready to go home just like you said.

568
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,294
Didn't need the Demerol
after all. Still have the vial?

569
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,955
- I'll put it back in lockup.
- I used it for a patient.

570
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,124
Sam, did you get
labs back on Tevin?

571
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,401
- How's Tevin doing?
- He's doing much better.

572
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:40,944
- I wanna go home.
- Mr. Walker.

573
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,241
Hey, wanna pick out a sticker?

574
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,754
Tevin tested positive
for sickle cell anemia.

575
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,414
That's impossible. I told
you I don't carry the gene.

576
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,192
Maybe there was a
mistake with your test.

577
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,525
Maybe there was a
mistake with your test.

578
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:01,929
What your son has, splenic sequestration,
is consistent with sickle cell.

579
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,660
- A form that's very manageable.
- You're not listening.

580
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,931
I told you I went to a genetic
counselor. He said I'm not a carrier...

581
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,099
that our son could not get the
disease unless both parents are.

582
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,007
That's true.

583
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,273
So what? You're
saying I'm not his father?

584
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,349
What I'd like to do is send his
blood for a more advanced test.

585
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,481
Just to be sure.

586
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,457
Send my blood too.

587
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,323
Test me again.

588
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,293
Neela. Carter wants to
talk to me after my shift.

589
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,064
- I told him what happened.
- You what?

590
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,799
I didn't think it was
right for us to lie about it.

591
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,001
Nobody needed to
know. That was the point.

592
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:50,138
Please, someone! Please
help! Something's wrong!

593
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,645
He went into V-tach.
Unsuccessful cardioversion at 200.

594
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,299
- Get him off the vent, bag him!
- Please. He can't die.

595
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,085
Charge to 300. Clear.

596
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,523
No change. Try 360.

597
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,991
- Need any help?
- Amp of epi after the next one.

598
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,527
Charged. NEELA: Clear.

599
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,532
- V-fib, 100 of lidocaine.
- This is not supposed to happen.

600
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,999
Go and find Dr. Carter now.

601
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,694
- Let's go, 360 again.
- Clear.

602
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,202
Come on, hit him again, 360.

603
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,866
Clear.

604
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,577
Still in fib. CARTER:
Three sixty again. Clear.

605
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,180
Asystole.

606
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,250
- How long has it been?
- Shall we try the high-dose epi?

607
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,625
- Forty-two minutes.
- Run the dopamine. We still have time.

608
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,663
- Or we can pace him.
- Neela.

609
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,132
- Let's try pacing him.
- Tie off the lines...

610
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:48,706
leave the ET for the coroner. Carter,
inform the family and then meet us.

611
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,685
Are his tests back?

612
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,793
They confirmed my diagnosis.

613
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,194
The good thing is most kids do very well
with folate and prophylactic antibiotics.

614
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,528
Good. That's good.

615
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,137
I also ran your blood through.

616
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,632
- The tests indicate that...
- Is there anything affecting my health...

617
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,142
that I need to know about?

618
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,276
Not really. No.

619
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,880
All that piece of paper is gonna tell
me is whether or not he's got my genes.

620
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,683
Either way, he's still my son.

621
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,851
I'm his father.

622
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,153
From a medical standpoint,
it's a bit more complicated.

623
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:47,732
Liza... My wife and I, we...

624
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,767
We went through a rough
patch about five years ago.

625
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,298
We broke up for a few weeks.

626
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:57,237
She got pregnant right
after we got back together.

627
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,969
We've been happy ever since.

628
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:07,050
She's gonna want to know
about Tevin's condition.

629
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,148
I'll tell her that
I'm a carrier.

630
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,524
He got it from both of us.

631
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,322
And he's gonna be okay.

632
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,033
He's in here, Mrs. Walker.

633
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,568
- Honey, is he all right?
- He's fine. He's fine.

634
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,041
Did you get his labs back?

635
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,375
- Is he the father?
- Yeah.

636
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,946
Hey, I didn't mean to keep
ragging on your suggestions before.

637
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,685
- Maybe Mr. Jekyll's isn't a bad idea.
- Mr. Hyde's.

638
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,455
Look, I know I'm not
exactly Carol Brady.

639
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,292
So I really wanted
it to be special.

640
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:58,460
It will be. Be ready to go in a half-hour.
I have to pick something up, okay?

641
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,497
Was the med list current?

642
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,394
I think we should
stick to protocol.

643
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,843
As the Attending, I'd like to review
this with my staff before we do this.

644
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,606
Was the med list current or not?

645
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,441
It was recent. It wasn't
completely up to date.

646
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,416
And no one checked
with the nursing home?

647
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,180
- I tried.
- You tried?

648
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,583
- Abby, why didn't you push the meds?
- I was called out.

649
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,853
But the result wouldn't
have been any different.

650
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,997
As the nurse, it's
your responsibility...

651
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,098
to double-check
allergies and interactions.

652
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,858
I thought that had
been done to the...

653
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:32,266
It's a case of managing a patient's
pain with incomplete information.

654
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,463
I suspect a jury
won't see it that way.

655
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,006
- Who made the decision?
- I did.

656
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,803
You did?

657
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,704
So now we let medical students
push pain meds without supervision?

658
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,315
- That's not what happened.
- I was with a patient.

659
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,123
Neela did exactly what I told her.
- Actually, that's not...

660
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,653
You need a few minutes
to get your story straight?

661
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,862
What does it say in the chart?

662
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:01,697
Exactly what I've been saying. I
ordered the drug, and Neela pushed it.

663
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,996
And is that accurate?

664
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,231
Like I said, I
wasn't in the room.

665
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,378
- Simple question. Is it accurate?
- As far as I know...

666
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:14,740
yes.

667
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,922
A young man comes in here
and dies of a lethal drug reaction...

668
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,184
that could have been
prevented with one phone call.

669
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:33,759
Next time why don't we just send a
blank check to the family's attorney?

670
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,265
Mom! Mom!

671
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,100
- Son of Sam is back.
- Mom!

672
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,902
- What are you doing here?
- Luka picked me up. It's amazing!

673
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,408
- We gotta go, though!
- Hold on.

674
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,707
- I'll take those.
- If we hurry, we can get there by 11.

675
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,009
What are you talking about?
What are you wearing?

676
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,448
Luka said I have to wear
a life vest for the boat.

677
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,951
Boat? What boat?

678
00:35:56,121 --> 00:36:01,116
Isn't it awesome? It's bigger
than our whole apartment.

679
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:05,594
Wow. You really went
a whole other direction.

680
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:09,758
A weekend in the great outdoors.
Fishing, camping, burning s'mores.

681
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,904
- S'mores. Do you know what that is?
- White thing on a stick.

682
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,937
Come on, you gotta see inside.

683
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:19,567
- Wait. Where are we going?
- I rented a spot at Lake Geneva.

684
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,975
Bottom of the ninth,
two outs, nobody on...

685
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:25,140
and here comes Kovac
with a clutch home run.

686
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,410
- Is that baseball?
- Mm-hm.

687
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,587
How you gonna
back this thing out?

688
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,997
Mr. Joss's triple-A repair went
well. He's stable in the ICU.

689
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,969
And Dr. Edson's finishing up on
the perirectal abscess right now.

690
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:51,473
And do you know a good cheap red wine
that goes with spicy food? I have a date.

691
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,612
Two nights in a row.

692
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,304
It's with the teacher tonight.

693
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:59,610
Okay. Zinfandel.

694
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:06,113
I'm not completely comfortable
with waking up with one man...

695
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,954
and going out with
another the next night.

696
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:13,997
Well, if we were guys, we'd be
talking about carburetors right now.

697
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,431
So you don't think it's slutty?

698
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,136
No.

699
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,207
I just won't sleep with him.

700
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,639
That sounds like a good plan.

701
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,046
- Good night.
- Good night.

702
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,115
Women plan, God laughs.

703
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,719
Hey, when did I become
the guru of sluttiness?

704
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:37,219
- Did you start that banana bag on Vern?
- Three times.

705
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,017
He keeps going off to the
bathroom and coming back drunk.

706
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,956
I think I should delete emergency
medicine from my match list.

707
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,120
- One mistake. I pushed you too hard.
- No.

708
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,391
What they said about me
in your meeting was all true.

709
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:53,694
Look, you're a talented doctor.
And you did a lot of good things today.

710
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,540
Nothing I did on this shift can convince
me or anyone else that I belong here.

711
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,572
Yesterday you were a little too cautious.
Today you were a little too reckless.

712
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,413
Somewhere in the middle is the
way to practice emergency medicine.

713
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,338
I just want you to know...

714
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,070
I shouldn't have left you alone
with the patient until he was stable.

715
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,009
It's my fault.

716
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:43,082
What you did was the sweetest,
dumbest thing anyone has done for me.

717
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,955
Well, something like this
could have derailed your career.

718
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,562
Worst that'll happen to me is...

719
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:56,797
discipline, counseling.
I'll be all right.

720
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,661
You don't look all right.

721
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:08,610
Seems kind of silly now, but out
in the bay this morning, I was...

722
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,179
I was thinking
about asking you out.

723
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:20,323
I was thinking of saying yes.

724
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,496
I have that cefoxitin
for Mr. Martin.

725
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,295
I just need the
extension tubing.

726
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,839
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'll take care of it.

727
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,439
- Let me help you find it.
- I said I can do it!

728
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,949
Bottom drawer.

729
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,737
Well...

730
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,544
I suppose it's time
to call it a night.

731
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:20,046
- You're welcome to stay a little longer.
- No, no, no. I really should get going.

732
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,985
- I'll get my coat.
- I'll help you find it.

733
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,958
It was such a lovely evening.

734
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,293
And I am so glad that
the girls like each other.

735
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,694
Ella's a great kid.

736
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,564
Oh, and it was really good of
you to pick her up from school.

737
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,363
Thank you so much.

738
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:43,167
You want me to carry
her to the car for you?

739
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,573
No, no. No, I'm
fine. I can manage.

740
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,508
So...

741
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,778
good night.

742
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,722
You should have
come and talked to me.

743
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,397
You know why I
backed you up in there?

744
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,701
Because if Weaver
knew the truth...

745
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,574
you'd be done.

746
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,780
I know you went out
on a limb for me but...

747
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,546
I could just say I got confused.

748
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,382
You could have.

749
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,789
Until you falsified the chart.

750
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,924
- But...
- That's a felony.

751
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,234
Okay.

752
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,098
- Then I gotta go tear it up.
- Too late.

753
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:50,207
Why? Why? It's just one entry on
an otherwise blank order sheet, okay?

754
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,209
Nobody's gonna know it's missing.
We can talk to Weaver again.

755
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,108
It's too late!

756
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,814
It's already up in Legal.

757
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,827
You know, you
guys sit up there...

758
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:14,589
and you decide who's gonna
go and who's gonna stay.

759
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,928
I mean, why did you
have to push her?

760
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,797
Why'd you have to push her?!

761
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,203
The only reason she screwed up is you
made her think she wasn't good enough!

762
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,969
She wasn't cutting it!

763
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,846
We're talking about
you now, Michael.

764
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,794
I wasn't thinking.

765
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,602
I'm sorry.

766
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,410
Yeah.

767
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,948
Me too.
