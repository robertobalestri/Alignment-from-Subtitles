1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,135
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:09,276
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,439
Yes, I am.

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,275
Leaving that stripper in 4
with the broken toe for you.

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,974
- Try not to T.U.B.E. her.
- What are you talking about?

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,618
Totally Unnecessary Breast Exam.

7
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,809
It's Sandy.

8
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,684
Sandy Lopez died today.

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,326
What am I supposed to do now?

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,926
Give me back my son!

11
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,926
Mom, guess what. Dad's here.

12
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,863
I don't like working on old
people or children or drunks.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,969
Go to bloody Iraq and tell yourself
you've done something noble.

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,979
Hey. Hey, Mom.
Mom, look at this.

15
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,484
Hey, that's pretty good.

16
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,680
Dad's been teaching me, says
we might get my own guitar today.

17
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,552
Oh, really?

18
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,918
Alex, you want scrambled eggs?
- Sure.

19
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,120
Should have told me you needed
the groceries. I would have gone.

20
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,027
- You all right?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,894
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

22
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,726
Listen, take this, okay?

23
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,531
What's this?

24
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,276
It's, you know, grocery
money, rent money, guilt money.

25
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,869
It's not much guilt.

26
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,214
There's more where this came from.
I got a few jobs lined up, and the...

27
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,577
There's something you need,
so I'm gonna leave this here.

28
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,722
What, like a guitar?

29
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,391
Why not? It's good for a
kid to learn an instrument.

30
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,356
I mean, music, it
stimulates the brain.

31
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,462
Yeah, prove it.

32
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,129
Well, it helps score the
hot chicks. That's for sure.

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,737
- Hey, Dad, teach me something else.
- All right, buddy. Here, let me see.

34
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:47,898
This one's a little trickier,
but it's very cool. You'll like it.

35
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,705
I've had pretty good luck
with this one with the ladies.

36
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,052
- Let go of me, you dirty freak!
- Calm down.

37
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,421
- No!
- Want Haldol?

38
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,926
Yes. That and a hammer.

39
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,258
- Need help, Morris?
- No, this is going great!

40
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,775
- Stop touching me!
- Relax.

41
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,428
- Just try and relax, Mrs. Garrison.
- You know her?

42
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,332
- Yeah, she's off her meds.
- You think?

43
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,938
Five or 10 of Haldol?

44
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,301
- Ten.
- Five.

45
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,635
Whatever.

46
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,835
All right, this is gonna sting
a little, Mrs. Garrison, okay?

47
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,071
Want hard restraints?

48
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,646
- No.
- Soft restraints?

49
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,147
No. No restraints.
She'll be fine.

50
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,717
Ah!

51
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,480
Guess you should've
put her in restraints.

52
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,714
Ah!

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,305
Their argument is Sandy was his
mother and you never legally adopted him.

54
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,107
- We were in the process.
- And that will help, perhaps.

55
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,911
If the child's genetic father was
willing to assign you his rights.

56
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,077
He was an anonymous donor.

57
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,620
Well, we will establish
parental intent.

58
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,088
And I'm confident we can
secure some temporary...

59
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,420
Temporary? Henry is my son.

60
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:52,032
The good news is that the state has
adopted a sexual-orientation-neutral...

61
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,997
approach to child-custody
determination. But...

62
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,137
there are other
factors at play here.

63
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,274
- Like what?
- In addition to being gay, you're single.

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,434
And your work requires a great
deal of time away from Henry.

65
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,445
Now, the Lopezes present a
blood relationship with a loving...

66
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,708
intact family unit and
a stay-at-home mom.

67
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,876
I'll change my schedule.
Hell, I'll quit my job if I have to.

68
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,147
- What happened to you?
- Bitten by a patient.

69
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,052
- What are you doing here?
- Working.

70
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,351
- Have a nurse look at that.
- It's okay.

71
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,655
Sam, wash out Dr. Kovac's
bite, update his tetanus...

72
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,458
and check for hepatitis
and HIV on the source.

73
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,863
- Sure.
- I'll call you. Let you know how it goes.

74
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,562
There's another difference between
Sandy's family and me: money.

75
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,401
And I'll use everything I
have to get my son back.

76
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,310
- Make sure they know that.
- I'll make them aware of that.

77
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,349
What are you doing?

78
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,485
Icing my nads.

79
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:48,213
- Excuse me?
- One of the patients grabbed my junk.

80
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,259
So Alex must be excited.

81
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:54,837
What?

82
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,591
Today is first day of
spring break, right?

83
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,233
Oh, yeah. Right.

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,266
You guys want to do
something after work?

85
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:06,167
He's been talking about this
rock-'n'-roll bowling alley with...

86
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,535
glow-in-the-dark
balls and lasers and...

87
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,574
We can't. Not tonight.

88
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,415
Alex's father is in town.
He just showed up.

89
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,412
- Oh.
- Yeah, he does this every now and then.

90
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,249
Usually without warning.
Kind of like a tornado.

91
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,425
I wish he'd just
stay away for good.

92
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,223
Oh, well. He's the boy's father.

93
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:35,601
Barely. He sticks around long enough
to run up my phone bill and drink my beer.

94
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,404
He's staying with you?

95
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,966
Somebody call for
a psych consult?

96
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,578
- You on Psych now?
- Yep. But don't worry...

97
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,980
I'm keeping an ID in my pocket in
case someone mistakes me for a patient.

98
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,748
That was a joke.

99
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,151
She's in the Suture Room.

100
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,894
- Give me the chart.
- It's my patient.

101
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,563
- Done an H & P?
- I pulled the chart.

102
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,673
- What are you doing?
- He's stealing my patient.

103
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,503
- What? I'm trying to help you.
- What are we talking about?

104
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,577
Back pain in 2.

105
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,476
- I'll settle this.
- You should be ashamed of yourselves.

106
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,144
Well, here's a beauty for
you. Blue and puking in 1.

107
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,516
Blue?

108
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,162
Mrs. Garrison, we're gonna take
you upstairs and get you lunch.

109
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,663
I'm really not hungry. Although I
wouldn't mind a nice glass of merlot.

110
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,927
See what I can do.

111
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:46,701
- I'll try to get her admitted.
- She'll be fine once she's on her meds.

112
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,001
- How's the Psych rotation?
- It's kind of scary.

113
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,270
- What? The patients?
- No, me. I like it.

114
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,710
How about you? Everything good?

115
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,981
Sam's ex-boyfriend's
back in town.

116
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,386
Hey, Abby.

117
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,494
Can you take
Mr. Chen here upstairs?

118
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,631
- If you want him in Psych.
- Don't tempt me.

119
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,062
Fall into outstretched
hand. Nothing serious.

120
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:17,364
It's his right arm, and now he won't be
able to do anything. Not that he would.

121
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,938
I've already been through
four home-care workers.

122
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,964
I can help you out.

123
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,976
Can't get more shifts. I need
money or I have to drop out of school.

124
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,670
Abby, you don't
want any of this.

125
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:37,151
- Coffee?
- Yeah. Good idea.

126
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,584
- So?
- So.

127
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,218
How's Kem? She
must be getting big.

128
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,365
- Very.
- You should see Susan.

129
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,761
How's she doing?

130
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,927
Well, you know how some
mothers talk to their unborn children?

131
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:55,007
Susan threatened to pull hers out
with her bare hand if it didn't hurry up.

132
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,235
Doing anything differently?
Exercise? Sports?

133
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,436
- No.
- Any heavy lifting? Help a friend move?

134
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,205
- Anything like that?
- No.

135
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,545
- Slip or fall recently?
- Nothing.

136
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,618
- I'm just checking your lymph node.
- I'm ticklish.

137
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,848
I'll make a note of that.

138
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,721
- You ever have a mammogram?
- No.

139
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,623
You do self breast exams?

140
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,390
- Sometimes.
- Hey, Sam. Can you give me a hand?

141
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,034
- I need a breast exam on Miss Campbell.
- Sure.

142
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,103
- You do? PRATT:
It's just routine.

143
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,800
You should do this every month.

144
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,068
You have to get to know your
breasts. You can't rely on friends.

145
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,271
- Right after your period is the best time.
- Blood bank's on six for you.

146
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,281
Thanks. PRATT: All right.

147
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,386
- This is Taggart. PRATT:
Look in the mirror...

148
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,991
- for any changes in shape...
- Yeah, I drew blood on Mendoza.

149
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,252
Then you lift up your
arm and do it again.

150
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,918
- I signed all of them.
- Okay?

151
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:53,897
Then you gently squeeze the
nipple to check for discharge.

152
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:58,334
- Okay.
- Now, you start by circling the nipple...

153
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,134
- moving out in larger circles.
- Okay, it's been busy down here.

154
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,301
Feeling for any lumps along
the way until you reach the edge.

155
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,310
He needs two units
typed and crossed.

156
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,573
Okay, lie down.

157
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,576
Feel the breast tissue beneath the skin...
- He's vomiting blood.

158
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:19,488
With a soft touch. And down to
the ribcage with a firmer touch.

159
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,857
From the collarbone to
the top of the abdomen...

160
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,363
and from the
armpit to the midline.

161
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,195
- Want me to come down?
- I don't appreciate any masses.

162
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:33,101
- That's good, right?
- It's perfect. You can sit up.

163
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:37,333
- Forget it. Just send two units O-neg.
- You should also do this in the shower.

164
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,948
The skin's a lot more slippery
when it's wet, and sometimes it helps.

165
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,518
Oh, make it stop! Oh,
please! Give me something!

166
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,316
- Connor, James. Passenger in an MVA.
- Oh, my God! Help me!

167
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,049
Car T-boned into
them pretty good.

168
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,887
- Give me something!
- Vitals?

169
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,064
He's been thrashing too much
for us to get a BP. No LOC.

170
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,994
Walking and
swearing on the scene.

171
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,634
Three-centimeter temporal
lac with some glass.

172
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,480
- My arm is killing me! Come on!
- The driver's right behind us.

173
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,063
- She got the worst.
- Where's Pratt?

174
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,071
- Right here.
- Okay, this guy is yours.

175
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,709
- All right.
- Neela, come with me.

176
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:10,876
Oh, my God!

177
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,404
- Seat belt, harness.
Air bag didn't deploy.

178
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,048
- Where do you hurt, ma'am?
- All over.

179
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,549
- What happened, man?
- We were driving...

180
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,586
and some guy blindsided us.
Oh, God! Oh, God! Save my arm!

181
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,087
- Save my arm!
- You're not gonna lose your arm, sir.

182
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,250
- Is she your girlfriend? JAMES:
No, man. I just met her last night.

183
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:31,421
She was driving me home from
her place. I should have taken a cab.

184
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,601
Closed deformity on the
right elbow. He's dislocated.

185
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,607
- No radial pulse. 100 of Brevital.
- Brevital?

186
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,432
Yeah, and 100 of fent. All
right. Just hang in there, okay?

187
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,165
We're gonna fix
this up real quick.

188
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,868
- What do we want?
- Trauma panel, HemoCues and x-rays.

189
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,070
- Want me to guess?
- Chest, C-spine, pelvis.

190
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,727
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna be sick.

191
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,852
- On the monitor. Get suction.
- Periumbilical ecchymosis.

192
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,921
- Pretty tender in the upper right.
- Systolic's 90. First HemoCue's 11.

193
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,183
- My head feels funny.
- Okay, get another line.

194
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,384
Already done with
a liter onboard.

195
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,128
- Is Dr. Pratt working?
- Next door.

196
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,095
Two units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser.

197
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,289
Can you get him?

198
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,266
- Tachy at 118.
- She's gonna crash.

199
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,463
Get a seven and a half.
I need the ultrasound.

200
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,970
- I'll get it. KOVAC:
Somebody call Surgery again.

201
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,473
- Brevital's in.
- It's not helping! It's not...!

202
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,308
- Thank God.
- All right. We got about 20 seconds.

203
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,077
- Pull.
- Dr. Pratt, this patient's asking for you.

204
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,811
- For me?
- He's waking up.

205
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,649
Almost there.

206
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,163
- What happened?
- We fixed your elbow.

207
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,731
Holy crap, you're good.

208
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,103
You can pick up your Dr. Greg
Pratt Fan Club ring at the door.

209
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,970
Barely holding at a 100
systolic. Blood's running.

210
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,736
- Hypoechoic in Morrison's.
- How are we doing in here?

211
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,677
- Greg, is that you?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,577
Foley is on. Blood on the dip.

213
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,153
- What's the name on the chart?
- Rena Carlson.

214
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,257
We hooked up last year.
We met on the El, remember?

215
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,326
Oh, yeah. Right.

216
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,519
Make sure the blood
bank gets a clot.

217
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,493
Let's drop an NG
tube and pack her up.

218
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,362
Rena, you injured your spleen.
You're gonna require surgery to repair it.

219
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,970
- God. I'm all messed up.
- No, you're gonna be okay.

220
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,629
We're gonna take
very good care of you.

221
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,443
Abby.

222
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,710
- Hi.
- I see Mrs. Garrison is back.

223
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,876
Yeah. She bit one of
the Attendings in ER.

224
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,954
Oh, well, better
them than one of us.

225
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,557
- Mr. Rosenblum was asking for you.
- Oh, great.

226
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,021
Take it as a compliment.

227
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,958
Took me two years before
the duke would even talk to me.

228
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,462
Maybe it's your
nursing background.

229
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,124
It's probably a combination
of nursing and genetics.

230
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,964
My family's pretty
high-maintenance.

231
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,402
You can lead the group today.

232
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,407
- By myself?
- No better time than the present.

233
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,305
Okay.

234
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,718
Hi. Hi.

235
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,725
I'm Abby. I'm a medical student, I'm
going to be running the group today.

236
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,420
Ow!

237
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,428
Elbow's good. Sutures
will come out in a week.

238
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:22,035
But the Ortho clinic will wanna get
some more x-rays and start you on P.T.

239
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,726
So does that mean I can go?

240
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,701
You're not gonna
stick around for her?

241
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,899
- Like I said, I just met her.
- You spent the night together.

242
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,010
That don't make us married.

243
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,844
What's the status?

244
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,710
Stable after four units of
packed cells and some fluid.

245
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,579
Corday's waiting
for her upstairs.

246
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,549
I have to have an operation.

247
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,121
Don't worry. Dr. Corday's
an excellent surgeon.

248
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,760
- Will you come see me after?
- Sure.

249
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,225
- Friend?
- Not really.

250
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,954
Could you let me
know how she does?

251
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,224
- Okay.
- Thanks.

252
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,601
Labs and films on Campbell.

253
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,101
Sussman is starting to get
short-term memory back.

254
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,466
Thanks.

255
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,232
Neela.

256
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,312
- Neuro checks on Mr. Sussman Q hour.
- Can't. Working in the lab.

257
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,606
- Doing what?
- Stroke physiology research.

258
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,806
- Going to the mouse house?
- It's an elective.

259
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,952
I'm doing a lousy job. Everyone
thinks I'm better suited for the lab.

260
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,418
Yeah, well, God forbid
you disappoint them.

261
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,917
Hello. I'm sorry
this is taking so long.

262
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,324
- Yeah.
- So, what's going on with you, Denise?

263
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:27,627
I've just... I've been feeling cruddy,
like sick to my stomach and headaches.

264
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,496
At first I thought
it was the flu...

265
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,400
till I started losing feeling
in my hands and feet.

266
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,473
So you're not here
because of your skin?

267
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:40,377
No, that's from the amiodarone.
I have a ventricular arrhythmia.

268
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,515
Pretty sad, huh?

269
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,675
You know what the
guys at school call me?

270
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,581
Smurf.

271
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,292
Everything looks good. No
fractures, no arthritis, no bony lesions.

272
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,257
I'm thinking it's
just muscle strain.

273
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,391
But I told you I
didn't do anything.

274
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,861
Maybe you didn't realize it. It
may not have been sudden strain.

275
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,798
You could have slept
funny or been sitting too long.

276
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,031
- That's it?
- Yeah. It should get better with time.

277
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,109
Try a warm bath
and some ibuprofen.

278
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,109
Come back and see
me if it gets worse...

279
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,475
or you feel numbness
or weakness in your legs.

280
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,207
- Yo, doc.
- Excuse me.

281
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,386
Twenty-nine-year-old
with syncopal episode.

282
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,021
- Housekeeper found her in the kitchen.
- She on meds?

283
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,316
- Not that we could find.
- Neela.

284
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,686
Ma'am, can you hear me? Ma'am?

285
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,657
All right, let's get
her in Trauma 1.

286
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,457
Excuse me. Could I speak
with someone in charge?

287
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,655
What do you need?

288
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,893
Would it be possible to speak
with Dr. Pratt's supervisor?

289
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,162
Yeah. Okay.

290
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,574
What are you doing
here? Where's Alex?

291
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,044
- Thought I'd take you to lunch.
- Where's Alex?

292
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,547
He's showing one of
the doctors his guitar.

293
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,422
- Was this a bad idea?
- I can't leave for lunch.

294
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,921
- I asked Alex. He said it'd be all right.
- He's 10.

295
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,184
Hey, Mom, look. He did it.

296
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,260
Dad said he'd buy
me a guitar and he did.

297
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,326
- So I see.
- This is my dad.

298
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,966
Hi.

299
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,830
Isn't it cool?

300
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,061
- Do you know how to play, Luka?
- No.

301
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,500
Well, my dad's in a band.

302
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:16,370
- Your old lady stopped breathing again.
- It was nice meeting you.

303
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,067
You too.

304
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,579
Some gal stopped
breathing, can't be good.

305
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,079
People die in here all
the time. It's no big deal.

306
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,785
He already sounds
like a doctor. It's great.

307
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,614
You gonna play something for me?

308
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,757
Fainted and altered.
We're looking for?

309
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,052
- Normal sinus. Not having an MI.
- Think about the differential.

310
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,356
No ectopy, interval isn't
prolonged, QRS duration is 0.10.

311
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,623
Normal.

312
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,961
Pupils equal and reactive.

313
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,693
The common pathway in syncope?

314
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,596
Low blood pressure.
Don't hear a murmur.

315
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,607
No. Lack of vital-nutrient delivery to
the brainstem reticular activating system.

316
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,266
Caused by low blood pressure.

317
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,778
Or hypoxia or hypoglycemia.
Abdomen is soft and non-tender.

318
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,076
- So, what are we ordering, kids?
- CBC, lytes, head CT.

319
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:02,149
And a urine tox screen. And call a family
member to verify she's not on any meds.

320
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,290
What meds cause
orthostatic hypotension?

321
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:08,986
Antihypertensives. Beta-blockers,
Dig, diuretics, phenothiazines, nitrites...

322
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,892
antidysrhythmics, antidepressants,
alcohol and cocaine.

323
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,592
You know, we don't have to do this
if you've got something better to do.

324
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,663
I've got the papers here. I'm gonna be
stuck at the hospital for a couple hours.

325
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,299
Is there any way you can
have a notary come here?

326
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,843
That'd be great. Thank you.

327
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,243
Carter, I'm so sorry I stranded
you here. They're gonna admit him.

328
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,781
So I can drive you home.

329
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,787
I arranged for somebody to come
here with papers for me to sign.

330
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,452
I gotta be at work
soon. I'm just gonna stay.

331
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,524
I just ruined your
whole day, didn't I?

332
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,354
Don't worry. Know
what you can do?

333
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,359
You can help me
pick out nursery colors.

334
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,830
What do you think? Circus: colorful,
fun, developmentally stimulating.

335
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,802
Aquatic: soothing yet educational,
sort of for the young scientist. Or jungle:

336
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,204
Environmentally positive, a
celebration of his African heritage.

337
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,435
If you had a baby, which wou...?

338
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,512
I like the jungle.

339
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,618
I'm sorry. I wasn't
even thinking.

340
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,223
Carter, no. It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

341
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,223
You know, sometimes I
forget about him myself.

342
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,027
That's when I feel the worst...

343
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,029
when I realize that I haven't thought
about him in, like, a week or so.

344
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,625
You know, ever since my...

345
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:25,169
mom died and
my dad got sick, I...

346
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,534
I've been thinking
about him a lot.

347
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,508
You know, when my dad goes,
I'm not gonna have anyone else.

348
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,147
No aunts, cousin...

349
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,476
Nothing.

350
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,647
Have you ever gone to see him?

351
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,484
Maybe you should.

352
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,754
Maybe I should have kept him.

353
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:54,165
I mean, he is 3 years old now.

354
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,504
The nightmares have stopped,
but I feel like killing myself.

355
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,904
- So, what else is new?
- I smell something.

356
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,011
I can't smell anything. I developed
anosmia after my accident.

357
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,670
Nobody accidentally puts
their head in a paint mixer.

358
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,783
- Let's let Larry finish.
- Why?

359
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,509
It's the same thing every week.

360
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,349
"I wanna kill myself." Blah,
blah, blah. He needs new material.

361
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,718
- You need a soul.
- Please stop fighting.

362
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,594
- What's he saying?
- No one here speaks Klingon.

363
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,592
- It's rather odd, don't you think?
- Yeah. No. No.

364
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,646
- I think we should take a minute.
- Where did you go to school?

365
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,134
What?

366
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,048
I'm going to school.
I wanna be a lawyer.

367
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,850
Last week he wanted
to be a lion-tamer.

368
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,554
At least he has goals beyond
how many women he can screw.

369
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,221
- You jealous?
- Hey. Okay, okay.

370
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,765
You're a pig. - Oink.

371
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,305
Stanley, if you continue
to disrupt the group...

372
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,077
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

373
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,154
- That's good.
- "That's good. It's what you should do."

374
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,120
- Can we all get along?
- Is it just me or are we kooky?

375
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,987
- I smell gas.
- Sit down.

376
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,957
When I'm a lawyer,
I'm suing the hospital.

377
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,654
Can't sit on a jury with
multiple-personality disorder.

378
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,801
Does anyone else smell gas?
- It's coming from Larry.

379
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:02,991
Why don't you shut up.

380
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,068
You cut yourself,
start with your tongue.

381
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,832
Leave her alone. You have
nothing inside, dirty person.

382
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,247
Nothing inside you...
You make everybody sick.

383
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,211
Hey. Hey!

384
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,285
No.

385
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,423
You can't smoke in
here. It's against the law.

386
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,655
- So is suicide.
- You've got an addiction.

387
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,699
- Well, I'm trying to quit.
- I'm allergic to smoke.

388
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,632
Only takes 11 seconds for
nicotine to reach your brain.

389
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,466
There are 50 different kinds
of carcinogens in cigarettes.

390
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,632
You better put that out
before somebody catches you.

391
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,537
Stanley, what about you? Do
you have a problem with this?

392
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,849
My mother died of lung cancer.

393
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,283
It's a nasty habit.

394
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,189
Well, now that we've all
agreed on something...

395
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,055
let's talk about personal goals.

396
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,737
I don't wanna make a big deal.
He just made me feel uncomfortable.

397
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:15,341
- How so?
- He did a breast exam, and...

398
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:18,205
I don't know, he
seemed to enjoy it.

399
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,546
- Was there a nurse present?
- Yes.

400
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,376
It was her.

401
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,747
Did you voice your
concerns to Dr. Pratt?

402
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,980
No. I guess I was
caught off guard.

403
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,557
I can assure you he's a
very professional physician.

404
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,092
However, if you want to
file a formal complaint...

405
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,095
Oh, no, no. I don't want to
make a big deal out of this.

406
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,393
I just felt I should tell someone.
Maybe they could speak with him?

407
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:45,094
- I'll speak to him.
- Thank you.

408
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,871
Where's Pratt?

409
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,602
- With a patient. What do you need?
- I need Pratt. Where are you going?

410
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,939
I'm going to grab a bite
with Alex and his dad.

411
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,948
Did you assist Dr. Pratt in examining
Campbell, the woman in Curtain 2?

412
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,951
- Yeah.
- Anything unusual about the exam?

413
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,352
- I don't think so. Why?
- He gave her a breast exam for back pain.

414
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,957
I don't know what
her complaint was.

415
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,254
I was on the phone and
juggling other patients.

416
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,398
- Sounds like he T.U.B.E.D. her.
- She wasn't intubated, Morris.

417
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,364
No, no. You know,
T.U.B.E. T-U-B-E.

418
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,528
- Totally Unnecessary Breast Exam.
- You're such an ass.

419
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,033
- What was that?
- Sorry.

420
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,905
No, not you. Where
did you hear that term?

421
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,245
I don't know. I
didn't make it up.

422
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,543
Well, who did?

423
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,993
What happened?
Where's my daughter?

424
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:46,394
Your daughter's with your
neighbor. My name is Dr. Pratt.

425
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,592
You fainted at home. But
all your tests look good.

426
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,930
We checked your heart,
lungs and your brain.

427
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,302
You're not anemic or dehydrated.
And all your electrolytes are normal.

428
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,636
- I feel fine.
- Are you taking any medications?

429
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,676
- No.
- Could be anything over the counter.

430
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,348
- Diet pills, cold medicine.
- Nothing.

431
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,916
You ever have any heart problems?
Palpitations? Shortness of breath?

432
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,451
I'm healthy.

433
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,283
Anyone in your family
ever have seizures?

434
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,750
I did when I was a kid,
but I grew out of them.

435
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,394
How long ago was your last one?

436
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,925
I don't know. Years and years.

437
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,790
I was on phenobarb
until, like...

438
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:24,926
fifth grade. They said I had epilepsy.
But when I stopped the medicine...

439
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:28,199
they went away. I never had
another one. That was 20 years ago.

440
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,610
- Dr. Pratt, can I see you for a second?
- Just give me a minute.

441
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,474
- Can I go home now?
- I need you now.

442
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,173
- All right, I'll be right back.
- I have a baby at home.

443
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,342
I just need to run a
few more tests, okay?

444
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,711
Here. What's up?

445
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,687
- Did you treat this patient?
- Yeah. Why?

446
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,827
She accused you of
sexual harassment.

447
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,318
What?

448
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,663
- Did you T.U.B.E. her, Pratt?
- What?

449
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:57,292
That's what you call it, isn't it, when
you wanna feel up a good-looking patient?

450
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,232
If she hires a lawyer, you could
be charged with harassment.

451
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,388
If I found a lesion, I
would've saved her.

452
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:06,004
You didn't.

453
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,818
I'm being punished
because she's not sick?

454
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,814
It's not her condition,
it's your behavior.

455
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,507
Nothing's wrong
with my behavior.

456
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:15,314
She had tenderness over the fourth and
fifth lumbar vertebrae. Bony tenderness.

457
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:19,219
None over the paraspinus muscles. I felt
a 1-centimeter lymph node in the axilla.

458
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:22,054
- You saying you weren't attracted to her?
- Oh, come on.

459
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:26,221
Bone pain and lymphadenopathy in a
woman who's never had a mammogram?

460
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,730
You would've done the same.

461
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,664
It's not about what
you did, it's how.

462
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,237
- With a nurse present, per policy.
- The patient felt you enjoyed yourself.

463
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,930
Come on, please.
Give me a break?

464
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,099
You ever got turned on
giving a breast exam?

465
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,005
You don't have a
nurse in the room.

466
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,942
- I'm a woman.
- Who sleeps with women.

467
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:43,548
- I never T.U.B.E.D. a patient.
- Yeah? Neither have I.

468
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,515
- You coined the phrase.
- It's been around since I was a student.

469
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,415
You've been overheard using it.

470
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,021
It doesn't mean I've done it.

471
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,420
If she was uncomfortable,
why not say something?

472
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,083
I don't know. Maybe she
was intimidated by you.

473
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,752
Scared the big black doctor's
gonna bend over the bed...

474
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,694
Don't you turn this
into a race issue.

475
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,697
When you're black,
it's always an issue.

476
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,029
- I'm not gonna let you hide.
- I'm not hiding.

477
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,728
- A call for you.
- Take a message.

478
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,271
- It's your lawyer, line four.
- Don't go anywhere.

479
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,432
- Where's Sam?
- I think she's with her son.

480
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,602
Hey, Dr. Pratt, Neela's
patient collapsed.

481
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,305
She was coming
back from the restroom.

482
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,111
Hey, ma'am. Can you hear
me? Somebody find Neela!

483
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:23,745
Let's get her up on the gurney,
okay? Ready? One, two...

484
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,786
- Malik, monitors.
- Positive sternotomy sign.

485
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,291
- What happened?
- V-tach.

486
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,224
Ventricular arrhythmia.
On amiodarone.

487
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:33,628
- "Tetralogy of Fallot repaired in 1975."
- Why is she in today?

488
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,994
- Flu.
- What's her lab show?

489
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,687
- Haven't come back.
- Need hands?

490
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,498
Did you open your
big mouth to Weaver?

491
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,831
What? NEELA: Airway clear.

492
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,668
Start bagging. Did you tell
Weaver I T.U.B.E.D. a patient?

493
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,675
V-tach, no pulse.
Denise, stay with us.

494
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,388
Charge to 200.
MALIK: I'm charged.

495
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,643
- Clear.
- No change.

496
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,612
Going again, 300. Well, did you?

497
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:52,342
- No.
- Somebody did, though.

498
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:53,781
Clear.

499
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,880
Sinus. NEELA:
Good carotid pulse.

500
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,514
100 of lidocaine.
What'd you say?

501
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,683
Nothing. That hot patient
was complaining about you.

502
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,624
Good breath. I'll
call about her labs.

503
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,459
Perhaps you two referring
to a patient as "hot" is a clue.

504
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,166
I never called her that.
She's the one with problems.

505
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,031
Can you even imagine what it
was like for her to come here?

506
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,470
Feeling ill, worried, scared.
Waiting several hours to be seen...

507
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:19,339
- only to have a stranger fondle her.
- Secondary survey.

508
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,215
Good gag. She's waking up.

509
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,044
You're okay, Denise. - Labs?

510
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,382
CBC, electrolytes,
calcium, LFTs, creatinine.

511
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,786
Labs report her amiodarone
level less than zero.

512
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,501
She sometimes
forgets to take it.

513
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,858
Must have stopped taking
it weeks ago to have zero.

514
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,224
She give you any
indication why she'd do that?

515
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,524
Maybe. Because men are idiots.

516
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,200
- Can I play pinball?
- Sure.

517
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,066
Finish your lunch first.

518
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,537
I'm full.

519
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,871
- Barely touched your hamburger.
- I don't wanna get mad cow disease.

520
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,070
Then finish your fries.

521
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,711
God, he's grown a foot
since I've seen him last.

522
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,383
Been a year.

523
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,689
You've done a great job, Sam.

524
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,823
He's a cool kid.

525
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,093
Thanks.

526
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,398
I guess I can't take
much credit for that.

527
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,962
- Anyway, is he doing good in school?
- Yeah.

528
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,828
When he's not being expelled...

529
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,100
for performing medical
procedures on himself or...

530
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,904
- dissecting dead squirrels.
- Really?

531
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,377
It's not funny.

532
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,743
He seems to like
that Russian doctor.

533
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,616
Croatian.

534
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,414
You two...?

535
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,753
We've gone out. Nothing serious.

536
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,425
He have any friends his own age?

537
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,788
- He's got some buddies at school.
- That's good.

538
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,362
Considering how much you
move around, that's good.

539
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,262
Well, you gotta go
where the work is, right?

540
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,260
Tell me about it. That's the
good thing about Chicago.

541
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,270
- Always building...
- How long are you planning on staying?

542
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,138
You sick of me already?

543
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,143
It's not about me.
It's about Alex.

544
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,007
Well, he seems
happy that I'm back.

545
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,575
That's the problem.

546
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,277
The longer you stay, the harder
it's gonna be on him when you leave.

547
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,580
Well, maybe I
won't leave this time.

548
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,754
What's going on
with Hollings in 2?

549
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:15,622
Cardiology was
supposed to get him.

550
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,956
Call them again. What
about Dunn in Exam 3?

551
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,497
Some recurrent seizure
disorder. Waiting on an EEG.

552
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,261
They can do that upstairs.
We need to free up some beds.

553
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,597
- Medicine won't take her.
- Why not Neurology?

554
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,296
They don't think
she had a seizure.

555
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,668
Was there witnessed
tonic-clonic activity?

556
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,605
- Not really.
- Did she bite her tongue?

557
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,837
- No.
- Was there urinary incontinence?

558
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,742
- I don't think so.
- Not a seizure.

559
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,761
Discharge her, she
can have an EEG.

560
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:40,010
If she passes out,
she could hurt herself.

561
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,312
Send in a DMV card.

562
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,115
There's also a baby at
home who could get hurt.

563
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:49,023
Look, she had a syncopal episode.
And I'm gonna rule her out for MI.

564
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,653
While we wait for the six-hour troponin,
we might as well throw in an EEG.

565
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,665
Dr. Pratt, Denise's parents
are coming in to talk to her.

566
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,271
Her cardiologist's gonna switch her
to sotalol which should help the skin.

567
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,499
Hey, Neela, when does
your research rotation start?

568
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,007
- Fifteen minutes.
- Good luck.

569
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,142
Thank you, Dr. Kovac.

570
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,008
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah?

571
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,481
When you do a breast exam on an
attractive woman, it's awkward, right?

572
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,984
- For you and the patient.
- Right.

573
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,816
See, I'm just as nervous
and uncomfortable as they are.

574
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,459
I don't know. Maybe it comes
across as something else.

575
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,821
What do you mean?

576
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:25,487
How do you do it so that they don't
think that you're enjoying yourself?

577
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,031
It's a medical procedure.

578
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,295
It's no different than looking
for rebound or guarding.

579
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,302
I pretend it's my mom.

580
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:38,205
Yeah, it's a little trick I picked up
from my OB-GYN Attending. It works.

581
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,539
I mean, unless
your mom's hot too.

582
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,544
You're a freak.

583
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:49,044
Every workstation has its own
microfuge. We share the ultracentrifuge.

584
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:53,989
Cold room for tissue-culture
media, bacterial plates, DNA ligations.

585
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,061
Arun and Angelie are
looking at expression of...

586
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,722
heat-shock proteins in
glial cells. This is Neela.

587
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,733
Hi. Is that an
electron microscope?

588
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:04,995
Yeah.

589
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,107
EM's kind of old school for showing
apoptosis in neurons, but, you know...

590
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,073
looks sexy on the page,
so Lundgren still likes it.

591
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:15,112
- Lundgren?
- Dr. Lundgren, the guy whose huge...

592
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,374
R01 grant is funding your butt.

593
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,178
I'm not getting paid. Rotation.
Fourth-year med student.

594
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,720
- I'm an eighth-year, Ph.D. program.
- Eight years? God.

595
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,415
We don't get credit around
here for wiping snotty noses.

596
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,026
I've actually gotta discover
something new in neuroscience...

597
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,890
in order to get my degree.

598
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:34,397
- Takes a while.
- I'm helping with some stroke study?

599
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,865
Everyone here is
researching some aspect...

600
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,595
of brain hypoperfusion
and tissue injury.

601
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,433
You're gonna be
with Yuri and me.

602
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,046
Looking at the
effects of ketamine...

603
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,473
on cerebral ischemia
and tissue damage in mice.

604
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,943
- Yuri, Neela. Neela, Yuri.
- Hey.

605
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,113
No one said anything
about working with animals.

606
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,276
Is that a problem?

607
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,416
All tests look good. We'd like to
figure out why she had a seizure.

608
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,560
Yeah. I thought that was
something she outgrew as a kid.

609
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,788
It may be totally
unrelated. Here we go.

610
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,600
What's all of that?

611
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,601
We're doing an EEG to monitor
her electrical brain activity.

612
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,934
It takes several hours, some
of which is done while sleeping.

613
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,768
- Can I stay with her?
- Sure. Just try not to wake her up.

614
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,743
We're more likely to pick up
the seizures when she's asleep.

615
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:26,146
Thank you. You hear that?
We're gotta let your mama sleep.

616
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,488
Hey. You know...

617
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,318
when I ask you to assist
me on an exam of a female...

618
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,825
it's so I don't get accused
of things I didn't do.

619
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,155
Don't blame me for this.

620
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,766
You were there. I did everything
I could to put that patient at ease.

621
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,492
- Guess it didn't work.
- I was trying to be friendly.

622
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,160
One man's friendly is
another woman's creepy.

623
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,536
- You're a flirt. You can't help yourself.
- I was breaking the ice.

624
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:54,179
It's a breast exam, not a cocktail
party. You don't have to break the ice.

625
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,872
- Nice package, by the way.
- What?

626
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,450
Package. Amira and I were
noticing it earlier. Must be those pants.

627
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,815
I see what you're trying
to do. You're way off.

628
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,719
I didn't say anything remotely
inappropriate to that woman.

629
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,883
- It was going through your head.
- It wasn't.

630
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,858
You weren't thinking about her
great rack when examining her?

631
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,658
Hell, no. And even if I was,
which I wasn't, so what?

632
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,358
- She can't read my mind.
- Of course she can. We all can.

633
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,334
It's not that difficult,
believe me. You're a guy.

634
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,030
Men only think about three
things: food, sports and sex.

635
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,971
Dogs are more mysterious.

636
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,203
If they invent a refrigerator with
a wide-screen TV and a vagina...

637
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,245
- we're all doomed.
- Yeah, okay.

638
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,680
You think I'm kidding, but I'm
not. When you check us out...

639
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,753
you're asking us to show
our tits. That's what it feels like.

640
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,481
- It's not a nice feeling.
- I didn't check her out.

641
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,717
Dr. Pratt, your
patient's seizing again.

642
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,224
All right, find Kovac.

643
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,353
- Jordan?
- Push two of Ativan.

644
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,021
- I knew it.
- Pulse ox, 97.

645
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,363
- Up the nasal oxygen to five liters.
- What's happening to her?

646
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,095
Malik, another two of
Ativan. Mix up Dilantin.

647
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,740
She's gonna be okay. Give
the medicine a chance to work.

648
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,085
How long has she been seizing?
- Less than a minute.

649
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,372
I stepped out for a second.

650
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,740
It's okay. It's okay, Jordan.

651
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,212
It's okay. You're okay.

652
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,080
- Caught the seizure on the EEG.
- Is this just gonna keep happening?

653
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,747
She needs anticonvulsant medication.
After that, everything should be fine.

654
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,916
- See any spikes?
- Not yet.

655
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,085
- Can she hear me?
- Sure, you can talk to her.

656
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:22,326
- She's not gonna be awake for a while.
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.

657
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,198
I'm here with Caroline.
Everything's gonna be okay.

658
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,101
You're doing good.

659
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:32,267
- Dr. Pratt?
- I'll be right back. She's gonna be fine.

660
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,580
Looks like Neurology can't
refuse to admit her now.

661
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,445
- That wasn't a real seizure.
- What are you talking about?

662
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,314
The EEG doesn't lie.

663
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:45,287
No focal spikes, no sharp waves,
and no spike-wave complexes.

664
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,948
She's faking it.

665
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:51,119
She had a pseudo-seizure.
Call Psychiatry.

666
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,548
- I learned a little Klingon.
- That's good.

667
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,521
We had to get rid of
our Klingon translator...

668
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,549
in the most recent
round of budget cuts.

669
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,884
You're serious?

670
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,759
My buddy's hospital in Seattle had to
hire someone who speaks Elven full-time.

671
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,901
Thank you, Mr. Tolkien.

672
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,971
- That was an interesting approach today.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

673
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:38,475
Look, I know it's cruel throwing
students into a group like that.

674
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,272
But it is a good indicator
of who has what skills.

675
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,574
I was kind of freaked out.

676
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,809
I've never seen them respond to
a student the way they did to you.

677
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,284
Of course, they've
never seen anyone...

678
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,889
show as much disregard
for hospital policy.

679
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:55,789
I think you scared them.
You kind of scared me.

680
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:04,567
- I am being paged to the ER.
- Yeah. We could try hypnosis.

681
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:08,104
- On who?
- You. It might help you quit smoking.

682
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,435
I'll get back to you on that.

683
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,808
I told her to look for any changes
in the shape or size of the breast.

684
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,915
And I felt for any lumps.

685
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,779
I told her to watch out for
dimpling or puckering. This is stupid.

686
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,647
Continue.

687
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,090
I told her to check for discharge.
Then gently squeeze the ni...

688
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:26,884
Jerry.

689
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:30,490
I can't help it. My
nipples are sensitive.

690
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:34,429
- What?
- Your lawyer, Mr. Brooks, is here.

691
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,258
- Excuse me.
- So are we done here?

692
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,836
I want you to prep a lecture
for the med students...

693
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,941
on gender sensitivity in
the physical examination.

694
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,142
Abby's down from
Psych for your patient.

695
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,005
- Pardon me.
- Yeah.

696
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,546
Do you mind?

697
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:55,592
Bored yet?

698
00:35:55,616 --> 00:35:57,682
Actually, I find it
extremely interesting.

699
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,223
I prefer working with
empirical data over patients.

700
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:03,794
- Not a people person?
- Not when they're sick.

701
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,464
- Watch it! Ugh!
- Sorry.

702
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,465
- You contaminated my ELISA.
- Shouldn't have coffee in the lab.

703
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,569
I always have coffee in the lab.

704
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,405
- You just ruined my sample.
- Do you have to rerun it?

705
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,269
I can't. I don't
have any serum left.

706
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,172
You just set us back six weeks.

707
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:24,216
- Maybe she's faking it.
- Not if it's a conversion reaction.

708
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,475
Nothing on the EEG.

709
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,176
Doesn't mean her symptoms
are under voluntary control.

710
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,720
Whatever's happening is
on a subconscious level...

711
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,916
maybe due to some sublimated
emotional trauma or something.

712
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:37,426
Would you listen to Miss Freud
here? Okay. What are we talking about?

713
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,063
- Postpartum depression?
- Maybe.

714
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,358
In some, it can turn
into full-blown psychosis.

715
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,025
- Hey, where are you going, Mrs. Dunn?
- Home.

716
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,266
Miss Dunn, hi. I'm Abby
Lockhart from Psychiatry.

717
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,840
I already told him I
don't need a shrink.

718
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,909
I have to go. My
husband's waiting for me.

719
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,911
Jordan, if you don't
stay, we can't help you.

720
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,508
That was my easiest
consult all day.

721
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:03,348
- Get your prescription filled,
Mrs. Epstein. EPSTEIN: Thank you.

722
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,823
- Hey.
- I got these back today.

723
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,690
Oh, my God. Look at you guys.

724
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,765
You can keep those.
I got double prints.

725
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:18,267
- Thanks.
- Good night.

726
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,333
Luka.

727
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,373
I didn't know he was coming.

728
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,543
I'll see you tomorrow.

729
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,722
Hey. How did Rena
Carlson make out?

730
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,324
MVA, came up for an ex-lap.

731
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,257
She had a lot of clot in the
belly. We took out the spleen.

732
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,661
- What about the liver?
- Good. Mesenteric arteries are fine.

733
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,892
Kidneys too. She's a lucky girl.

734
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:53,368
She should be awake
by now. I think she's in 10.

735
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,734
Thanks.

736
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,143
You working banker's hours now?

737
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,644
Hardly. I only stepped out of surgery
once today and that was to pee.

738
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,579
I'm sorry to hear that,
for you and your bladder.

739
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,015
Are you up for some dinner?

740
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,746
- Tonight I can't.
- You can't eat?

741
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,921
- Not with you.
- Oh, really?

742
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,691
What's wrong?

743
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,465
Who's that? A patient?

744
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,098
- It's difficult to talk about.
- Sounds serious.

745
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,137
It could be. I still
have some tests to run.

746
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,441
- Anything I can do to help?
- No, nothing. I think I'd better go.

747
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,770
- Hey.
- Oh, what are you doing here?

748
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:36,904
- I thought I'd surprise you.
- Well, you certainly did.

749
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,674
Hey.

750
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,188
Dr. Jeremy Lawson,
Mr. David Spencer.

751
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,222
Mr. Spencer.

752
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,623
- How's it going?
- It's going very well, thank you.

753
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,787
Have a good evening, Dr. Corday.

754
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,489
It was nice meeting you.

755
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:01,173
- What's with the James Bond routine?
- He's English.

756
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,205
Oh, that's nice.

757
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,673
- A little taste of home?
- Hm.

758
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:14,180
Dr. Weaver, sorry to bother you.
If I don't get more nursing shifts...

759
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,083
I'm not gonna be able to
pay for my spring tuition.

760
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,655
You okay?

761
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:27,696
Why don't you take some time off?
You need to give yourself time to grieve.

762
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,994
I don't have that luxury.

763
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:34,105
I lost my wife. Now I'm
fighting to keep my son.

764
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,833
I'm sorry.

765
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:41,045
Been begging and arguing with lawyers
all day to get Henry for the weekend.

766
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,205
And they're granting
me two days with my son.

767
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,244
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

768
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,389
Thank you. And don't
worry about your tuition.

769
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:55,687
- It's been paid.
- What?

770
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,524
Yeah. The registrar said it's
been paid through graduation.

771
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,039
I'm sorry. You
need to sign this.

772
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,573
- What is it?
- It's a visitation agreement.

773
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:16,443
Basically, it says you'll return Henry
to the Lopezes by Monday at noon.

774
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,318
Hey, baby.

775
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,883
Hi. Hello, baby.

776
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,394
There you are. Oh, how are you?

777
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,259
He's been a little fussy.

778
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,730
Maybe he's teething.

779
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,665
Yeah, I don't think so.
It's too early. Isn't it?

780
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:43,274
You don't have any teeth, do
you? You just miss your mommy.

781
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,740
- That's my baby.
- Not all of us think like my parents do.

782
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,073
They're pretty old-fashioned.

783
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,648
I know Sandy would be pissed
if she knew what was happening.

784
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,583
She'd be cursing up a storm.

785
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,654
I know she'd want you
and Henry to be together.

786
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,121
I hope it works out for
the two of you, that's all.

787
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,328
Thank you.

788
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,956
Thank you. That's my boy.

789
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,001
That's my beautiful baby.

790
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,545
- What?
- What are you doing?

791
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,477
- Waiting for an ambulance.
- Carter.

792
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,117
- What?
- I'm not taking your money.

793
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,048
- What are you talking about?
- You know.

794
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,122
- I'm not one of your charities.
- I was hoping to count you as a friend.

795
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,316
Well, neither a
borrower nor a lender be.

796
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,360
Abby, I'm not loaning you
the money, I'm giving it to you.

797
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,054
Think of it as an investment
in the future of medicine.

798
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,029
You'd be better
off with tech stocks.

799
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,136
In the time that it's taken
us to have this conversation...

800
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:50,173
I've made your salary for
the rest of your life in interest.

801
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:56,137
When you put it that way, how about
a couple extra grand for a new car?

802
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,646
You can't park here. This is
where we bring ambulances.

803
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,014
He's with me.

804
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,182
And I will pay you back.

805
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,897
You know, you both
should be wearing helmets.

806
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,572
My throat hurts.

807
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,013
It's from being intubated.

808
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,277
I didn't think you'd come.

809
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:38,286
I said I would.

810
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,685
I think you said
you'd call me too.

811
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,053
Well, this place
keeps me pretty busy.

812
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,230
You don't remember
me, do you, Greg?

813
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,198
