1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,119
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:10,575
You get used to it. You'll be
sliding in the hall in socks in no time.

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:11,803
How long you gonna stay?

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,240
Kem's gonna go back and see
her family for a couple weeks.

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,935
Then come back here
and have the baby.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,249
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about Luka.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,254
- He's a good guy.
- I'm not looking for anything right now.

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,915
Okay. I just thought
you should know.

9
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,824
Thank you. But independence
works pretty good for me.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,929
Although I wouldn't
mind some regular sex.

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,461
They always pray
before they start eating.

12
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,665
You have to bow your
head. That's weird.

13
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,310
Just be respectful. Think
about something else.

14
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,811
- Like what?
- I don't know. Baseball or dinosaurs...

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,846
cannibalism.

16
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,815
Isn't his mom gonna set
something on fire tonight?

17
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,545
- Bananas.
- That doesn't happen every day.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,281
Well, Austin's mom can
cook pretty much anything.

19
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,894
See, you're gonna have a great
time. Sorry. Late start. Hi, Austin.

20
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,531
I couldn't get Max going either.
I'm never gonna make yoga now.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay.

22
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,194
One for my pager, two
for the hospital, okay?

23
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,139
What are you gonna do tonight?

24
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,502
I don't know. Check
your sugar before bed.

25
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:18,840
- You gonna see Luka?
- I don't know. I guess.

26
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,878
- Bye.
- Enjoy your night of freedom.

27
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:23,017
Thanks. I will.

28
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,919
Man, your sister's hot.

29
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,588
Fourteen-year-old
female, ankle inversion...

30
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:35,024
I'm dying right now! I'm dying
every minute, every second, dying.

31
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,528
Every day I'm closer to death.

32
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,378
Negative drawer,
good pedal pulses...

33
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,253
splint and RICE.
Seventy-four-year-old...

34
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,098
Hold on. Past medical history?

35
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,863
On the 14-year-old?
Unremarkable.

36
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,531
Was she drunk or high? Does the story
match the injury? She sexually active?

37
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,941
- When was her last menstrual period?
- She came in for a sprained ankle.

38
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,114
Monoarticular joint
pain in a young woman...

39
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,217
could be the result of
gonococcal arthritis, staph...

40
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:01,412
- or a systemic polyarticular disease.
- Or she fell off a curb.

41
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,350
You're a med student. I don't
want to hear "history unremarkable."

42
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,053
This ER visit may be the only
time a 14-year-old sees a doctor.

43
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,460
Get a sexual history,
do some STD counseling.

44
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,430
Dr. Weaver. Arnie
Nadler, Human Resources.

45
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,900
- Oh, right.
- Hi. Arnie Nadler. Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,539
Mr. Nadler is visiting us
for a couple of weeks...

47
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:23,199
advising us on how to have a
happy and cooperative workplace.

48
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,868
Shorter hours, higher pay.

49
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,707
- Pardon?
- Just a suggestion.

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,939
I'm open to suggestions.

51
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,555
I'll be interviewing the staff
before issuing recommendations.

52
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,821
I'd love to pursue this conversation
with you when you have a free minute.

53
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,752
- Great.
- An HR consultant?

54
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,255
Risk Management sent him.

55
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,452
He's a mandated part of the
Romano lawsuit settlement.

56
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,096
- Which one?
- Hengstet.

57
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,097
- Who?
- Nurse with the weird dog and that hat.

58
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,498
- Sexual harassment?
- Hostile work environment.

59
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,168
We identify and assess
high-risk employee behaviors...

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,673
and implement
early-intervention strategies...

61
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,404
before they escalate into
psychological abuse or violence.

62
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,105
Have you ever been
in an ER before?

63
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,252
You know, Dr. Romano's
gone, and we all get along great.

64
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,150
In my experience, all work
environments could use help.

65
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,782
Especially when navigating the
twin dangers of anger and conflict.

66
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:18,661
- Morris. Morris, I'm gonna kill you.
- I'm sorry. Here, have one.

67
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,466
Don't put those there.

68
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,813
Thank you.

69
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,148
Idiot.

70
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,031
John?

71
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,594
What are you doing? I was
gonna make you breakfast in bed.

72
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,756
Did you lock Emily
in the guesthouse?

73
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,868
No. I gave her the day off.

74
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,300
She's convinced we're
gonna burn the house down.

75
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,907
Oh, let's. Then we can run off to
the jungle, live off sticks and berries.

76
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,134
Is my cooking that bad?

77
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,370
- Ow!
- Oh, let me do it.

78
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,573
They hassle you about
going into work today?

79
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:54,278
No. I think Luka has forced
everybody to lower their expectations.

80
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:58,221
If we show up without resigning,
Weaver thinks it's a good day.

81
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,054
We've got a whole
day alone together.

82
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,595
- What are we gonna do?
- I have a list.

83
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,631
This is everything I wanted to show
you in Chicago, but we haven't done yet.

84
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,464
Aw.

85
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,968
- Ice-skating in Grant Park.
- Yeah, that's one.

86
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,010
And the Art Institute.

87
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,980
Among others. So
where should we start?

88
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,978
I have an idea.

89
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:31,420
Would you do a sexual history on a
14-year-old girl with a twisted ankle?

90
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,457
- Depends on the girl. Why?
- Weaver.

91
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,028
I'm used to the squawk,
but she's condescending.

92
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,427
Belly pain in 3 has
been waiting for an hour.

93
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,999
Okay. Hey, you're getting big.

94
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,658
- You mind?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:47,433
- You want to try a dislocated shoulder?
- Yeah. Can I do the Hennepin maneuver?

96
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,008
Are you marrying, or will
that kid grow up a bastard?

97
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,145
Shut up, Frank.

98
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,008
But what is going on
with you and Chuck?

99
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,343
He's pushing to get
married, buy a minivan...

100
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,349
fire up the barbecue.
I don't know.

101
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,547
Dr. Lewis. How often do you find
yourself the subject of unwanted...

102
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,851
physical contact at work?
- What?

103
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,622
Can you do a fly-by on a swollen
knee? This guy's demanding pain meds...

104
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,527
- wants to see a doctor right away.
- Sure.

105
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,031
Is tactile contact
between employees...

106
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,432
something that is
encouraged or frowned upon?

107
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,837
How many bimbos
you got in this hospital?

108
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,407
Just the right number.
Miguel, this is Dr. Lockhart.

109
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,737
- Student doctor, actually.
- What does that mean?

110
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,880
Means she's studying
the latest medicine.

111
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,209
That looks painful.
How'd you do it?

112
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,375
I fell off a ladder. I
gotta get back to work.

113
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,418
- What kind of work you do?
- Hang dry wall.

114
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:38,319
It'll go away. Just give me some
Vicodin, and I can get off your plate.

115
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,825
We'll take good care of your knee
and get you home. When did you fall?

116
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,123
- What do you have?
- I'm not ready to present.

117
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,029
Knee effusion from a fall? Drain it,
pain meds and send him on his way.

118
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,201
- Told you. ABBY: I'm
not finished doing a history.

119
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,305
We've got 30 on the
board and 50 waiting.

120
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,873
We're backed up 18 hours,
and this is an easy case.

121
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,534
- Come on, next patient. Let's go.
- I'll get a setup for you.

122
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,874
Med students always
spend an hour with patients.

123
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,040
- She was doing a great job.
- Dr. Pratt, if you have a minute...

124
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,381
I'd like to talk to you later about
that incident with Dr. Morris.

125
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,349
It wasn't an incident.
It was a French fry.

126
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:15,318
- How does that feel? Is that too tight?
- No, it's perfect.

127
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:19,496
Oh, I love it. Seeing
your whole face.

128
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,529
- Are you colder now?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,735
Well, that is what
scarves are for.

130
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,409
That and kissing.

131
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,746
This is where you used to
skate when you were a kid?

132
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,611
No. There was another one
on the other side of Grant Park.

133
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,185
My grandfather used
to rent it out for us.

134
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,686
All right, you ready?

135
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,882
I don't know.

136
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,224
Whoa!

137
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,085
Yeah?

138
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,426
- So who's "us"?
- My brother and I.

139
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:56,195
Your grandfather would rent you
the entire rink just for the two of you?

140
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,771
- Yeah, and our friends.
- A lot of friends, I hope.

141
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,205
Usually. You know, I wasn't quite
as pampered as I make it sound.

142
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,605
No, of course not.

143
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,584
I still don't see anything.

144
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,121
Once the blades are in,
pull pressure straight down...

145
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,782
and the cervix
should come into view.

146
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,558
- Can you set up for cultures?
- Sure.

147
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,263
- So when did the bleeding start?
- Last night.

148
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,336
It's weird because I'm
usually pretty regular.

149
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,403
Sorry.

150
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,839
Dr. Kovac. Vulva hematoma,
multiple bruises and vaginal tears...

151
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,739
one at least 3 centimeters.

152
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,278
You'll need suturing.
Lido and 3-0 Vicryl.

153
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,122
Layla, there's some
vaginal trauma.

154
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,352
Is that from too much sex?

155
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,792
Could be from the kind of sex.

156
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,498
Has anyone forced
themselves on you?

157
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,471
- What?
- Did anyone touch you in a way that...

158
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,507
hurt you or that you
didn't give permission?

159
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,841
- No.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

160
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,808
Fiancé.

161
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,517
Dean. He's in college.

162
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,616
Do you and Dean...?

163
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,655
Does it ever get rough?

164
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,853
Well, we get a little
carried away sometimes.

165
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,388
- How old is that girl?
- Sixteen.

166
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,534
- What are you doing tonight?
- What?

167
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,466
A patient invited me to his
restaurant. I thought we can go.

168
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,539
- Does Alex like Korean food?
- Oh, Alex has a sleepover.

169
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,972
Nine victims total.
We're getting three more.

170
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,904
Gus Loomer, 50s, altered LOC.
GALLANT: Wearing a heart monitor.

171
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,980
- Pulse is irregular but in the mid-90s.
- How did it happen?

172
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,311
Plowed his Hummer
into two oncoming cars.

173
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,147
- One, two... KOVAC:
What do you want, Gallant?

174
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,757
Full trauma panel, lateral C-spine,
chest, pelvis and a 12-lead EKG.

175
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,689
Okay. Add a set of troponins
and talk to the patient.

176
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,024
Mr. Loomer, you're at County
Hospital. You were in a car accident.

177
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,598
I was driving. I must
have blacked out.

178
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,032
- Been having heart palpitations?
- I had a heart attack two years ago.

179
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,265
Call Cards to
interrogate the monitor.

180
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,270
See if they need help
with other traumas.

181
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,903
Okay.

182
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,044
How bad is it?

183
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:22,273
- We're still assessing your injuries, sir.
- No, no, no, not me.

184
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,907
- My Hummer. It's brand-new.
- Okay. C-spine is clear.

185
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:32,090
- Can you find out about my car?
- Not right now, sir.

186
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,422
Got three more victims on
the MVA, two of them critical.

187
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,258
- Is he stable enough to be moved?
- Yes.

188
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,424
- What's MVA?
- Motor-vehicle accident.

189
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,435
Gonna be a lot of crashes
today. It's icy out there.

190
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,166
He's hypoxic. He
could be retaining.

191
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:53,171
Hang a gram of Ancef
and update his tetanus.

192
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,574
- Sending him to CT?
- No. Belly is benign.

193
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,378
- We'll follow the serial crits.
- Good day to be driving a Hummer.

194
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,549
Sam, we need you to
get the Pedes airway box.

195
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,124
- There's a kid involved?
- Mom and dad too.

196
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,590
Damn shame.

197
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,955
- He doesn't know?
- No. He was unconscious at the scene.

198
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,963
- This is the dad?
- Lungs down...

199
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,965
- hypoxic, altered.
- We need the room.

200
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,765
- Can you move him out? LEWIS:
Duvata, bring Loomer to Curtain 2.

201
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,739
Oh, my God.

202
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,344
- What have we got?
- Kathy Shepard, A and O times four.

203
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,310
- Breath sounds clear, good radial pulse.
- Is my family okay?

204
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,473
We're working on your
husband and your son.

205
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,913
- Loss of consciousness?
- No.

206
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,917
- What about my daughter?
- What daughter?

207
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,113
- Morris...
- They never brought in a girl.

208
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,054
Is she dead?! Is she dead,
and you're not telling me?!

209
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,364
Distal perfusion
sucks. I can't get a line.

210
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,388
Draw up etomidate.

211
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,026
- What's his weight?
- About 25 kilos, same as Alex.

212
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,806
Oh, God. He's been scalped.

213
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,171
Exposed skull and galea
with a big hematoma.

214
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,743
Neck's broken, C-5 and 6.

215
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,680
We'll need the Gardner-Wells tongs
to stabilize the neck. Page Neurosurg.

216
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,341
Where's my mommy?

217
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,478
It's all right, sweetie.

218
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,182
Mark the placement
point for the tongs.

219
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,164
They're all beautiful.

220
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,768
Most of these are
over 100 years old.

221
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,694
They were built for the
doctors, lawyers and managers...

222
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,636
who went west
with the railroads.

223
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,034
This is my favorite
street in Chicago.

224
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,381
What do you think of this one?

225
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,914
It's lovely.

226
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,712
- Yeah? You like it?
- Yeah.

227
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,714
- What?
- I was thinking maybe we could buy it.

228
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,089
- Really?
- Actually, I may have already bought it.

229
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,063
I had to put a deposit down. There
were four other interested buyers.

230
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,494
We need to have someplace
to stay when we're here.

231
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,106
- What about your grandmother's castle?
- We can sell it.

232
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,604
What will your father say?

233
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,244
He might get a little upset,
but Gamma left the house to me.

234
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,712
I don't want to live there.

235
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,216
Are you sure?

236
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,918
It is a little bit more
space than we need.

237
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:17,942
Mm-hm.

238
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,391
We can get our deposit
back if you don't like it.

239
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,592
- I love it.
- Yeah?

240
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,058
Yeah.

241
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,466
They sent two to Mercy
and two to Northwestern.

242
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,969
Why would they split us up?

243
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,200
In big accidents, one hospital
can't take care of everyone.

244
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,210
There were 10 victims total.
We could only handle four.

245
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,905
No, that's eight. What
happened to the other two?

246
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,880
There were two
fatalities at the scene.

247
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,075
- What?
- Kathy.

248
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,777
- Oh, my God.
- Kathy.

249
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,719
Kathy, we don't
know anything yet.

250
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,901
- Oh, God, Paul.
- Mrs. Shepard?

251
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,296
- What was the last HemoCue?
- Ten-point-two.

252
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,458
He has to get up to the O.R.
He's losing blood somewhere.

253
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,731
Ethan? Where's Ethan? Ethan.
What are you doing to him?

254
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,138
- Until it's anchored in the skull.
- No!

255
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,437
- Dr. Kovac?
- No! Take that off!

256
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:16,806
Stop it! Stop it! That's my son.

257
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,156
God, this isn't happening.

258
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,515
Oh, God.

259
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,958
Your husband has suffered
massive injuries to his chest.

260
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,998
Both lungs are collapsed,
and he's bleeding internally.

261
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,102
What about Ethan?

262
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,899
What about you? You
were in there with him?

263
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,536
Tell me!

264
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,336
Dr. Weaver will talk to you.

265
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,003
Please, what was that thing
they were screwing into his head?

266
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,981
Ethan has a broken neck.

267
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,816
- The tongs help prevent paralysis.
- Paralysis?

268
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,854
There's been severe
injury to Ethan's spine...

269
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,367
and his lungs, and
probably his brain.

270
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,868
- They're dying, aren't they?
- We don't know yet.

271
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,440
Where should I go now?

272
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,045
Sorry?

273
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,480
Who's gonna die first?

274
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:35,386
I've had this ice-cream cone for nearly
two hours now. It hasn't melted yet.

275
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:39,965
It's just one of the many wonderful
things about winters in Chicago.

276
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,363
My grandparents got
married here, and my parents.

277
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,337
- Is that a proposal?
- You want it to be?

278
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,210
No, I thought since breakfast in
bed didn't work out, we'd try for lunch.

279
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,284
- Are we gonna check in?
- We already have.

280
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,418
Beth Shepard. No. Kathy
Shepard's here at County.

281
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,217
I'm looking for
her daughter Beth.

282
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,453
- I should get a smaller set of sandbags.
- Stabilize the tongs while I add traction.

283
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,928
Can you tell me what
hospital she was sent to?

284
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,590
Abby, I need you to
hold the counterweight.

285
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,732
Layla's been waiting
three hours for a repeat crit.

286
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,307
Go on. He's stable.

287
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,921
I'll take three of your patients
if you take over for me in there.

288
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,914
No, thanks.

289
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,774
- How are you doing?
- Fine. When can I go?

290
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,818
As soon as we
get these results in.

291
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,456
Nurse, can I have
some orange juice?

292
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,593
Hearing that, did you feel
threatened or just uncomfortable?

293
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,824
I mean, would you
categorize his comments...

294
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,696
as hostile or
merely insensitive?

295
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,668
- Can I still have sex?
- Not for a couple weeks.

296
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,343
- What? Just tell your boyfriend.
- Fiancé.

297
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,911
Just tell him that he
needs to settle down.

298
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,174
If he really loves
you, he'll understand.

299
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,751
Dean loves me.

300
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,317
We're getting married.

301
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,457
You know, sometimes you can
love someone and not realize...

302
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,926
that they're hurting you.

303
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,260
He doesn't mean to hurt me.

304
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,337
But does he hurt you sometimes?

305
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,568
Did he hurt you last night?

306
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,204
I don't know.

307
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,075
What do you mean?

308
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:42,455
We went on a drive last
night with two of his friends.

309
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,515
We went to this
park near his house.

310
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:53,465
He tells me I'm sexy all the
time. He just likes to show me off.

311
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,658
Well, show you off how?

312
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,804
Sometimes he likes
to let them watch.

313
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,036
Do they ever...

314
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,371
do more than watch?

315
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,884
Layla?

316
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,555
Yeah.

317
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,222
Sam, we need you to
set up another IMED.

318
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,523
Get Duvata. ABBY: She's busy.

319
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,366
We're gonna figure this out, okay?
- Sam, now.

320
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,765
I'll be right back.

321
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,606
Dispatch RDC can't tell me where
Kathy's daughter went or if she's alive.

322
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,234
The father arrested twice. I don't
know how long he's gonna last.

323
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,005
Decreased on the right.

324
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,210
Pratt wanted that guy discharged.
- I'm busy.

325
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,649
Betadine. Let's do this again.

326
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,921
- It doesn't look good.
- Needle decompression and chest tube.

327
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,958
- Where are my pain pills?
- You can't be here. You have to wait.

328
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,789
- No. I got to see you now.
- Abby, get him out of here.

329
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,727
- Tachy at 124.
- We're still waiting on some tests.

330
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,925
- I don't need any tests!
- Abby!

331
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,196
BP's dropping again. This is
stupid. We're just torturing him.

332
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,896
Let's go.

333
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,717
Hi.

334
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,117
Hi.

335
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,724
Was this on your list?

336
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,052
Several times.

337
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,890
I hope he has your nose.

338
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,131
You have a lovely nose.

339
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,934
What do you want him
to be when he grows up?

340
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:44,237
I don't care. As long as
he's healthy and happy.

341
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,307
Okay, I'm deciding between
Cy Young Award winner...

342
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,247
and the guy who cures cancer.

343
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,347
I think he'll be
astoundingly cute.

344
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,184
Well, nature likes
genetic diversity.

345
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:02,089
We should make him marry
an Asian or Hispanic girl.

346
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,490
You know what frightens me most?

347
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,101
That I could get
used to all of this.

348
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,366
Well, I'm not gonna be
renting out any ice rinks for him.

349
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,442
- No?
- Uh-uh.

350
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,945
That's what I ran away from.

351
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,188
- Good femoral pulse.
- All that epi kicked his BP up.

352
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,352
Sam.

353
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,993
Layla's pregnant?

354
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,897
I can't get his sats above 80.

355
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,203
- Did you call Social Work?
- Yeah. But they're slow as hell.

356
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,840
Sub-Q air in the neck.

357
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,169
- Let me tell her.
- Okay.

358
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,470
Haleh, I'll be right back, okay?

359
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,412
We do a pregnancy test on all
female patients of childbearing age.

360
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,813
Yours came back positive.

361
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,786
- I'm pregnant?
- Yes.

362
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:04,048
Do you use birth control?

363
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:07,387
I was on the pill for a
while, but it made me fat.

364
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,828
Oh, my God! This is incredible.

365
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,196
- Layla, do your parents know...?
- Dean's gonna go through the roof.

366
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,836
You can't use that in here.

367
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,741
You need to seriously consider whether
or not you want to keep this pregnancy.

368
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,974
Oh, Dean loves kids.

369
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,943
What you want now may not be
what you're gonna want in five years...

370
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,781
or next year, or
even in six months.

371
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,948
We need a SonoSite in here.

372
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,556
I'll be back.

373
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,586
You running some kind of scam?

374
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,095
I've been here nine hours
waiting on some tests.

375
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,791
I hear you. How come
Mr. Rivas hasn't been discharged?

376
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,233
Abby's still waiting
on some labs.

377
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,303
Mr. Loomer...

378
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,498
- Hey, can you take this to Trauma 1?
- Sure.

379
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,007
Miss Taggart, I would
love to sit down with you...

380
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,737
and discuss workplace
conduct when you have time.

381
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,113
- I don't, okay?
- Maybe later?

382
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,309
I won't then either.
Mr. Loomer, back to bed.

383
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:08,011
- What's happening in there? SAM:
Come on. You've a heart condition.

384
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,280
Is he dead?

385
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,416
Yeah.

386
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,986
- Damn shame.
- Come on. Get back to bed.

387
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:20,159
- I bought that car on a whim.
- You shouldn't be here.

388
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:24,463
Impulse buy, midlife-crisis thing.
But hell, it probably saved my life.

389
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:28,664
I could've ended up like
that poor schmuck in there.

390
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,673
You drove your
car into that family.

391
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,810
You were unconscious
on the scene.

392
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,008
Your Hummer slammed into
their car and went right over it.

393
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,225
I don't remember.

394
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,692
Is that Mr. Loomer?

395
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,699
Oh, God! I need some help here!

396
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,234
Shirt.

397
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,928
- What happened?
- Syncope.

398
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,876
Okay, quick look.

399
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,214
- V-tach.
- Okay, charge to 200.

400
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,711
Clear.

401
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,481
Sinus. Got a pulse.

402
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,519
Okay. Can you at least
tell me how serious...?

403
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,562
She's alive.

404
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,532
Okay. When can I call back
to...? Okay, fine. Thank you.

405
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,103
She's at Mercy Hospital.
Doctors are working on her.

406
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,365
- What's wrong?
- I couldn't get more specifics.

407
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,441
But I'm pushing for
a transfer here soon.

408
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,168
I just want to
know if she's okay.

409
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,045
Do you want to be
with your son, Kathy?

410
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,945
- Will you come with me?
- Sure.

411
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:52,381
Labs back on your knee effusion,
Miguel Rivas. AFB's positive.

412
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,259
Okay. I'm sorry. Can
you take Mrs. Shepard in?

413
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,897
- Of course.
- I'll be back in a minute.

414
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,695
- Pratt.
- What?

415
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,768
- Miguel's knee effusion is from TB.
- What?

416
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,963
I saw his old charts. He had
multi-drug-resistant TB 15 months ago.

417
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,108
- He stopped going to therapy.
- No coughing.

418
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,266
I did an AFB stain,
which is positive.

419
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,878
He's coughing. He's probably
infectious. Where is he?

420
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,639
I just discharged him.

421
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,579
We have to find him before
he starts coughing up TB all...

422
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,711
I gave him a prescription. Call the
pharmacy. I'll see if he's still there.

423
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,556
Miguel! Move this damn thing.

424
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,750
- Watch it! Watch it! ABBY:
Hey! Hold the elevator!

425
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,293
- Damn it.
- Damn it.

426
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,561
Hey! Miguel, hey!

427
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:41,799
- Wait for the next one.
- Come on, man. Sorry. All right.

428
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:50,272
Hey, Alex. If you don't wanna go to
that sleepover tonight, you don't have to.

429
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:54,443
We could do something fun together. If
you still wanna go, then that's fine too.

430
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,647
I just realized that I'm the only
one who will get this message...

431
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:01,282
because I never showed you
how to use the voicemail. Damn it.

432
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,794
I am so disgusted with
you. You are such an idiot.

433
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,296
- I'm sorry, okay?
- How could you do this to me?

434
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:08,695
- Get rid of it.
- It's ours.

435
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,631
- Leave.
- How do I even know it's mine?

436
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,705
- I love you.
- Get out! You need to leave...

437
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,465
- right now!
- What's going on?

438
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,667
One of your buddies
from the gangbang squad?

439
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,106
- She knows?
- Get out!

440
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,043
- I told you she'd talk.
- We didn't make her do anything...

441
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,274
- she didn't want to.
- Tell it to the cops.

442
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,884
She lies, okay? You heard her.

443
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:30,352
If it was true, why would she still
be saying she loves me? Hold on!

444
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:34,520
- Let go of me.
- Look, she's just a stupid little slut.

445
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,651
Hey, how long's it
gonna take in here?

446
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,687
I've been here 12
hours, going on 13 now.

447
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:08,225
- Keep your mask on.
- Yo, nurse! I'm talking to you.

448
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,501
- Hey, Frank.
- Hey.

449
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,105
- Has my kid called?
- No.

450
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,265
- He was supposed to call.
- Maybe he's busy.

451
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,776
- Can you hold for a tap...?
- Weaver says not to see any patients...

452
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,504
- until you talk to her.
- Yeah.

453
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,080
- Wait here for her.
- I got it.

454
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,275
- I'm just the messenger.
- I don't trust him.

455
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:36,081
He didn't understand. He stopped taking
the pills when he stopped feeling sick.

456
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,020
I want Miguel in isolation.
If he can't take his meds...

457
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:42,252
- I want him handcuffed and force-fed.
- He just started coughing.

458
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,090
- You're gonna call the police?
- The guy's a time bomb.

459
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,699
Are we gonna throw all
of our TB patients in jail?

460
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,529
- Just this one.
- If this is how we treat people with TB...

461
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,728
they will stop coming
to this hospital.

462
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,898
- They don't all go out together.
- They hang out at the TB clinic.

463
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,770
Miguel will need
six months' therapy.

464
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:01,038
- You think you can do that?
- I want to try to make him cooperate...

465
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,943
with the health-care system.

466
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,107
- Hey. FRANK: You're
supposed to stay put.

467
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,276
- If you still want to talk...
- Maybe later.

468
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,732
Waiting for Weaver? SAM: Yeah.

469
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,052
Hey, don't hit her.
She's crippled.

470
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,256
- It never stops being funny, does it?
- Sam.

471
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,118
How's Ethan?

472
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,288
Pressure's holding.
Last gas looks better.

473
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,567
Mr. Nadler's recommending
your immediate dismissal.

474
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,294
He called other
hospitals you worked for.

475
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,304
- You had prior incidents.
- I never got fired from those jobs.

476
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,668
You left before they could.

477
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,776
I'm a good nurse.
You want me here, fine.

478
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:34,140
If not, I'll find another
job somewhere else.

479
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:38,148
Something tells me you've used that
speech before. It's clear to everyone...

480
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,786
that you have an
impulse-control problem.

481
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,320
The guy helped his friends
gang-rape his girlfriend.

482
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,323
- We'll probably get sued.
- Kid's in PEA.

483
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,325
All right. The director of
nursing will talk to you tomorrow.

484
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,622
For what it's worth, I
wish I'd hit him harder.

485
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,726
You know, it's a lot warmer
here in the summertime.

486
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,496
I like Chicago.

487
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,202
In the summertime, the
lake is full of sailboats. It's...

488
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,740
I can't live here, John.

489
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,335
My work, it's...

490
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,306
important.

491
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,678
I know.

492
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:14,353
- What terminal? CARTER:
United. Terminal One.

493
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,512
We could just disappear,
and no one would ever know.

494
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,386
Yeah, I'd like that.

495
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,460
Me too.

496
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,293
- The pills made me sick.
- If you stop taking the pills too soon...

497
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:32,200
you'll only kill some of the TB.
Bacteria that's left will get stronger...

498
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,135
and then none of
the medicine will work.

499
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,399
Abby?

500
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,370
Did you call the cops yet?

501
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,844
No, not yet.

502
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,644
You're wasting your time
with this guy. Call the cops.

503
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,218
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting out of here.

504
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,083
It's not that simple.
You can't leave.

505
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,918
- I'll take the damn pills.
- You need to go to the TB clinic...

506
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,027
- every day for observed therapy.
- I don't need that.

507
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,221
- Abby. Mercy for you on line one.
- Just a minute. Miguel, stop.

508
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,594
It's about that woman's
daughter, Beth Shepard.

509
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,568
Okay. Don't be an idiot.
Okay. Security, stop this guy.

510
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,037
Hold it. Come here, please.

511
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,905
Hey, come on. Come
on. Easy. Come on.

512
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,070
Get off!

513
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,874
Don't hurt him.

514
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,251
I don't want you to leave.

515
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,413
I don't want to leave.

516
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,285
Well, then stay.

517
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,586
I can't.

518
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,427
We'll be all right.

519
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,877
<i>We love you.</i>

520
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:01,218
Your Holter monitor records every
heartbeat and stores it for 24 hours.

521
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,793
Thanks.

522
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:06,595
It appears you had a
run of V-tach at 8:20 a.m.

523
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:10,293
Eight-twenty. Is that
about when I crashed?

524
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,961
Your arrhythmia
caused you to black out.

525
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:17,599
But upon impact, it seemed you
reverted to sinus almost instantly.

526
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,638
You mean the car
crash saved my life?

527
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,479
Yeah.

528
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,748
How long?

529
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,086
Forty-one minutes.

530
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,492
Hold compressions. Pace at 80.

531
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,862
No capture.

532
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,126
Another atropine and resume CPR.

533
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,798
PEA.

534
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:53,007
Mrs. Shepard, your
son has no pulse.

535
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:56,478
His brain has been deprived
of oxygen for almost an hour.

536
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,776
I think we should stop.

537
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,854
But it's still beeping.

538
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:10,120
It can take some time for the
electrical activity of the heart to stop.

539
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,528
- What about my daughter?
- I'll find out.

540
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:38,886
I thought my life was over
after my first heart attack.

541
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,024
I couldn't work.

542
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,826
I couldn't walk upstairs.

543
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,024
I couldn't have sex.

544
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,202
I felt like I was dead.

545
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:56,001
I never thought I'd get
married, have two kids.

546
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,904
I wasn't the type.

547
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,376
I always thought that stuff
would mean life was over.

548
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,411
But then...

549
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,180
I got pregnant.

550
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,554
Paul was so excited.

551
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,621
He was always more
excited about everything.

552
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,857
<i>I thought my wife
was gonna leave me.</i>

553
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,797
I mean, I thought she should.

554
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,897
But she didn't. She...

555
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,367
She made me get out
of bed in the morning.

556
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,477
I'll take any seat. I
must get to the gate.

557
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,375
- Amsterdam's sold out.
- Another flight. Anything.

558
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,877
I have a first-class
to Tokyo. It's $9000.

559
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,453
That car cost $110,000.

560
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:48,959
But she didn't care. She said, "Gus,
you spoil yourself. You deserve it."

561
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,226
So...

562
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,734
that's what I did. I went out and
bought myself my dream car...

563
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,134
took it for a drive.

564
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:02,832
I've been having these
dreams, fantasies.

565
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:09,740
Stretching out alone at night,
you know, reading a book.

566
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,982
Now I can.

567
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,484
Did I make this happen?

568
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:26,755
Why? Why should I be the lucky
one? Why should I be spared?

569
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,827
No one knows why
these things happen.

570
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,597
You have to believe there
is a reason you're still here.

571
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:37,868
<i>Late start this morning.
Ethan wanted ice cream.</i>

572
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,678
<i>He always wants these
crazy things. Today I said okay.</i>

573
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:46,284
<i>Can you imagine?
Ice cream in winter.</i>

574
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,970
She's in here.

575
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,308
Oh, sweetie.

576
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,347
John?

577
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,259
Hi. Can I get four
coffees, three chili dogs...

578
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:11,563
and in a separate bag, two plain
hamburgers and three plain yogurts.

579
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,602
Hamburgers and yogurt?

580
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,937
Susan can only eat two
things without throwing up.

581
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,236
Being pregnant sucks.

582
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,279
- You want to sit?
- Sure.

583
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,949
How are you handling a
nursing and student shift?

584
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,248
- Do you ever get any sleep?
- Not that much, no.

585
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,717
That's what you get
for switching careers.

586
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,623
Well, medical
school was the plan...

587
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:40,288
for a while, actually. I
just sort of got sidetracked.

588
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:45,226
The last thing I remember wanting
to be was an international spy.

589
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,299
I was 15.

590
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,600
Then I got pregnant.

591
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,209
Fifteen? Wow.

592
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:58,408
Oh, I was, like, one of those girls
who gives birth at her prom. Total denial.

593
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,948
By the time I figured out
where the clinic was, I...

594
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,182
I didn't have any money. Alex's
dad never kicked in his half.

595
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,816
I couldn't get a waitressing
job because I was too young.

596
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,129
I took double shifts at
Baskin-Robbins to save up the dough.

597
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,300
Did he go with you?

598
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,234
He was at a gig.

599
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,665
Right.

600
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,808
First time I went...

601
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,839
I sat in the waiting room.

602
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,178
They called my
name. I never got up.

603
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,449
Second time, I was too late.

604
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,029
I look at Alex and I...

605
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,981
The place I went to had this
calendar on the wall with a picture of...

606
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,677
Strawberry Shortcake.

607
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,547
I just stared at
it the whole time.

608
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,196
- You have a nursing shift?
- Yeah. You're finished?

609
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,562
Yeah. Oh, here.

610
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,260
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

611
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,064
See you tomorrow.

612
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,774
- Hey.
- Hey.

613
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,537
- How's your arm?
- Oh, it's okay.

614
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,581
Alex having fun
at his sleepover?

615
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,842
Too much fun to come
to the phone when I call.

616
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,679
Yeah. Sleepovers are tough.

617
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:43,014
I mean on parents, not kids.

618
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,457
I had a boy and
a girl in Croatia.

619
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,719
Miss Taggart...

620
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,923
do you have a minute?

621
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,333
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

622
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,305
This is a document drawn
up by our legal department.

623
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,772
It says you agree to be
admitted for treatment.

624
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:08,072
And after that, visit the TB clinic
every morning for six months.

625
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,272
I'm not signing anything.

626
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,415
You don't have a
Social Security number.

627
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:17,488
Hey, I've been living and
working in this country for 10 years.

628
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,620
Good. So you know if you
get arrested for a felony...

629
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,886
<i>la migra's</i> gonna
kick your ass out.

630
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:26,088
Oh, where's Dr. Carter?
Sandy's gonna kill me.

631
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:29,234
Dr. Weaver, we need you
to sign off on a TB admission.

632
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,768
TB on a knee effusion? See, that's
what I meant by doing a thorough exam.

633
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,803
- Good catch, Pratt.
- Dr. Weaver...

634
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:37,807
- That was Abby's catch.
- It doesn't matter.

635
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,002
- Dr. Weaver.
- What do you want?

636
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,443
A month in Door County
with my French horn...

637
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:46,483
but I'd settle for five minutes
of your undivided attention.

638
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,750
This place is a disaster. I've
never seen anything like it.

639
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,653
I've seen your workers
engaging in bullying, hostility...

640
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:57,159
- violence, inappropriate touching...
- Come on. We have a good staff.

641
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,025
- They do their best.
- You have lunatics on your hands.

642
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,531
Doctors yelling, nurses
beating up patients.

643
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,795
- You need to fire people immediately.
- Fine. You're fired.

644
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,438
- What?
- Don't come back tomorrow.

645
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,540
You'll break the
terms of the settlement.

646
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:13,405
So sue me. Again.
What else is new?

647
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,843
You're late.

648
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:21,680
- Night shift started 20 minutes ago.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

649
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,516
- Where were you?
- I was at the airport dropping off Kem.

650
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:28,854
- Oh, yeah? Where'd she go?
- Kisangani.

651
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,296
- She have to get back to her program?
- Mm-hm.

652
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,370
She has 200 HIV
patients' lives to save.

653
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,139
Good for her.

654
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,868
That's Sandy. She can't
believe I left her alone...

655
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:50,675
with a screaming
baby for 12 hours.

656
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:55,010
- How long will she be gone?
- I hope just a couple weeks.

657
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,388
Hey...

658
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,360
- did I show you the new pictures?
- No.

659
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,897
- He's pointing his finger, huh?
- Yeah. He does that all the time.

660
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,405
He came out of the womb doing that.
It's like, "I've got a point to make."

661
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:24,072
- He's got his own personality already.
- Yeah. They all do. You'll see.

662
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,493
- Hi.
- Hey.

663
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:48,356
I was gonna see if
you'd had dinner yet.

664
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,626
Maybe we could get something.

665
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:53,328
Come on in. Let me get my coat.

666
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,337
- Wow, nice place.
- Yeah, it's okay.

667
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,448
So...

668
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,451
- where do you want to go?
- I don't know.
