1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,338
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,238
My car's up the
street. You want a ride?

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,436
- Dr. Romano, you're back.
- Hide your wild enthusiasm of my return.

4
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,707
I find overt displays of
emotion embarrassing.

5
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,362
Did you think about me? - Yes.

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,476
Okay. What did you think?

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,651
- Where am I going?
- Home.

8
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,587
Give this to Abby
when you see her.

9
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,763
On any given day, this Emergency
Department will treat 300 patients.

10
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,368
Another 40 will leave
without ever being seen.

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:40,304
In order to not get buried, you have
to maintain adequate patient flow.

12
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,409
This all starts with the nurses.

13
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,307
Treat them with respect,
they'll get you through your shift.

14
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,938
Treat them as your personal scut
slaves, you'll be lucky to get out alive.

15
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,575
Triage is our first line of defense.
Patients are signed in and vitaled...

16
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,245
by whoever's working the cage.
- The cage?

17
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,950
Like a shark cage. You can see them
circling around, but they can't get you.

18
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,755
- When is Kovac getting here?
- Flight should land at 7:30.

19
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,125
What about Carter?
Can you rack this?

20
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,632
Triage nurse starts the chart,
which is then racked at Admit.

21
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,431
- Put your name in for the lottery.
- Once the patients are brought back...

22
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:16,566
their name is put on the board, along
with time, location and chief complaint.

23
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:20,778
Dr. Pratt is also a second-year Resident.
Pratt, this is three of our new R-2s.

24
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,645
- Sofun, Morris, Cooper.
- Welcome to the zoo.

25
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,809
What do I give a
10-year-old with road rash?

26
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:30,082
Acetaminophen's easy on the stomach,
but ibuprofen's better for inflammation.

27
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,988
Med students work up patients
and present them to Residents.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,154
You can mentor, but ultimately every
case has to be looked at by an Attending.

29
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,823
I know my rights! This
is assault and battery!

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,333
- I'm coming back for you, bitch.
- Yeah, yeah...

31
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,132
- bring me a latte when you do.
- Dr. Lewis is one of our Attendings.

32
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,606
We usually we have two working.
They have to sign off on every case.

33
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,177
Don't remind me.
Second-year Residents?

34
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,475
- Cooper, Sofun, Morris.
- Grab a chart.

35
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,016
Abby, could you set up
the airway box in Exam 3...

36
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,177
so they can practice
assembling laryngoscopes?

37
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,515
Mm-hm.

38
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,487
Nursing orders go there.
Clerk orders go here.

39
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,992
These are two of our clerks, Jerry
and Frank. Please don't feed them.

40
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,654
When you're done, the discharge
rack is over here. Any questions?

41
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,199
Yeah, why is the
board see-through?

42
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,998
- So we can see through it.
- Remind me not to get sick anytime soon.

43
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,505
- The ambulance pick Luka up yet?
- An hour ago. They should be here soon.

44
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,668
- He need a bed down here?
- No, no, they got one for him upstairs.

45
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,365
Have you seen the schedule?
- No.

46
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,345
I'm only working four
shifts in two weeks.

47
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,313
- I only got three.
- How many do I have?

48
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,918
- Two?
- We're starting a petition.

49
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,988
We got more beds, but fewer nurses.
Romano's cutting senior nurse hours...

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,217
- so he can bring in cheaper travelers.
- You need to talk to him.

51
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:42,329
You lost the Triage lottery,
Abby. You got the cage from 9 to 1.

52
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,261
Come on, no way. I lose every time.
- Abby.

53
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,661
That's, like, statistically impossible.
- Abby!

54
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,995
What?

55
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,505
How you doing, Luka? - Okay.

56
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,733
Welcome back, man.
Africa agrees with you.

57
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,936
- I need you to help me with a GI bleeder.
- Two minutes. Let me say hi to Luka.

58
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,505
Sir, you have to stay in bed.

59
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,285
Here, lie down. Lie down. I
need sedation orders over here.

60
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,218
I think Mrs. Dunn's in labor.
- She's only 36 weeks.

61
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,304
Explain Braxton Hicks
contractions to her.

62
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:13,121
Her water broke.

63
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,727
Please, I need a nurse!

64
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,922
- Did you nitrazine it?
- No, I was helping her to the bathroom.

65
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:22,092
- Page OB and call an Attending.
- Please, somebody, help me!

66
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,863
- Hi.
- Aah!

67
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,938
Okay, breathe. Don't push.

68
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,868
- It's too early.
- No, 36 weeks...

69
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,102
is what we start
calling "normal term."

70
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,804
All right, try and relax.
I'm gonna do a quick exam.

71
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,254
I need a fetal monitor and an IV.
- Okay. I got it.

72
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,491
Oh! Lewis needs
that in Curtain 1.

73
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,024
- Thank you. MALIK:
You're welcome.

74
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,226
- Show me how to set the slit-lamp?
- Yup, just one second.

75
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,732
Luka.

76
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,437
Hey, I think this old
lady stopped breathing.

77
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,858
Dr. Romano, hi.
How are you today?

78
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,795
- I'm busy.
- How's the stump feeling?

79
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:06,430
It's suffering from delusions of
grandeur. It still thinks it's an arm.

80
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,102
- What's that? DOCTOR:
Your new prosthesis.

81
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,115
Okay. I'm sorry. I just
assumed as a prosthetist...

82
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,083
that you would have some
rudimentary knowledge of medicine.

83
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,285
- I have a degree in bioengineering.
- Well, then you have a vague...

84
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,926
civilian concept of what
doctors do. I'm a surgeon.

85
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,426
That's why I was specific
about needing a Utah Arm.

86
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,794
Your hospital insurance won't
cover a myoelectric device.

87
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,094
I lost my arm on the roof
of this damn hospital...

88
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,435
- trying to save a patient's life.
- They require proof you can't get by...

89
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,509
- with a traditional device.
- What do I do?

90
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,944
Am I supposed to just duct-tape
a coat hanger to my stump?

91
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,077
I can prepare another
letter to insurance.

92
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,416
I've got two letters for you and
the insurance company, F and U.

93
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,982
- It's hurting my arm.
- A little bit longer.

94
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,458
Why can't I just have my prescription
filled without being tortured?

95
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,689
- How much longer? My back's killing me.
- I'll let you know.

96
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,266
- I don't wanna miss my turn.
- Then you should sit down.

97
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay, put this in your mouth.

98
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,533
Be a good girl, Ilanna.
Open your mouth.

99
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,417
I think it was a black widow.

100
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,548
Darren, don't touch that.

101
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,781
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Darren, stop it.

102
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,822
- Give me that.
- Is it almost my time?

103
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,221
No.

104
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,521
Tell her.

105
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,293
Tell the nurse what you ate,
Lisa. Well, go on. Tell her.

106
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,300
Maybe you should,
Mrs. Brandenburg.

107
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,965
I brought my own urine
sample to save time.

108
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:19,604
- Could I at least get a sandwich?
- How did you get back here? Security!

109
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,833
Hey, wake up!

110
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,670
She's getting worse.

111
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,675
- Do you have asthma, Elle?
- No.

112
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,677
- Anybody sick at home? Any fevers?
- No.

113
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,543
Okay, deep breaths.

114
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,717
- How long have you had that cough?
- Since we went camping.

115
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,353
Uh, a few weeks, maybe.

116
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,764
She lets herself get rundown,
and she doesn't eat enough.

117
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,596
What's that?

118
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,232
The oxygen level in your
blood is a little bit low...

119
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,233
which can happen with
infection. Frank, what's open?

120
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,564
- Curtain 1.
- Okay, I'm taking this one back.

121
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,606
Come on, Elle. Gonna put you
in a bed, get you some oxygen...

122
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,936
and that should
make you feel better.

123
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,537
Oh, Dr. Lewis. This is Mrs.
Ryser and her daughter, Elle.

124
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,206
Shortness of breath,
sats are 86, bibasilar rales.

125
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,715
Yeah. Can you grab a Resident?

126
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,376
I think an Attending
should take a look at her.

127
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,581
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.
Come on this way.

128
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,089
The rest of her vitals okay?

129
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,387
Tachy at 116. BP's 98/52.

130
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,088
- A & O times three.
- What are rales?

131
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,597
It's the sound fluid makes
when it's in your lungs.

132
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,759
That doesn't sound good.

133
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,268
It's probably just pneumonia.

134
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,169
Great. She never dresses warm enough
and she's always going out with wet hair.

135
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,341
- Mom, please. LEWIS:
All right, let's get a chest.

136
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,240
- I'll be back to do a full exam, okay?
- Thanks.

137
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,747
- Are you coming back?
- Yeah. And don't worry.

138
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,545
The only thing you can catch
from wet hair is split ends.

139
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,353
Yeah, send her up for a
chest and draw a CBC.

140
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,083
- How's Luka?
- I haven't had a chance to get upstairs.

141
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,820
If you do go upstairs, let me
know and maybe I can come.

142
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,436
- Okay.
- Have you talked to him?

143
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,033
- Luka?
- No, Romano. We gave him the petition.

144
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,329
You better do something or you're
gonna have a mutiny on your hands.

145
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,837
As soon as I can,
I will. I promise.

146
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,999
Frank, where'd they send Kovac?

147
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,942
- Five West. He looks good.
- You saw him?

148
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,604
Just popped my head
in to welcome him back.

149
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,616
Wouldn't hurt you
to do the same thing.

150
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,721
Hi, could I get an update
on a patient, please? Kovac.

151
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,982
K-O-V-A-C.

152
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,059
- Right, malaria.
- He's still spiking on quinine...

153
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:25,221
but lucid between fevers. And
he's asking for a meatball sub.

154
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,302
- Either he's delirious or hungry.
- Never mind.

155
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,732
- Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,133
- I'm Gillian.
- Abby.

157
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,002
Oh, you're Abby? John
talked a lot about you.

158
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,911
John...
- Carter?
- Yeah.

159
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,172
I'm sorry. Who did
you say you were?

160
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,146
I'm sorry. You don't
know. I'm Gillian.

161
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,151
I was working with Luka
and John in the Congo.

162
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,691
Oh, I have something for you.

163
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,324
Um, John asked
Luka to give you this.

164
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,129
- He wrote me a letter?
- Now, there's a lost art.

165
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,536
Well, it's hard to find a phone
and when you do, they seldom work.

166
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,503
- Where do I find Dr. Magoo's?
- You don't. It burned down.

167
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,008
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

168
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,509
Nance, I'm taking my break.

169
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,079
Am I interrupting? Your
assistant wasn't at his desk.

170
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,774
We're in the
middle of a meeting.

171
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,545
That's why you haven't returned
my pages. I'm Dr. Romano.

172
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,381
Jeez. I'm sorry.
Let me get that.

173
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,853
- Okay. Stop. ROMANO:
You know what?

174
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,391
I'm not good at using this thing.
Maybe if the hospital's workers' comp...

175
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,722
had covered a myoelectric
arm, it would be better.

176
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,256
- Robert...
- What do I have to do?

177
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,926
Pay for it myself? That'd
make a good news story, huh?

178
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,867
Amputee surgeon has to pay for his arm
to work in the hospital where he lost it.

179
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,802
It's not the place or time to discuss this.
- You're right.

180
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,132
I've got a lot of patients
in the ER. That's

181
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,139
where using this
hook really gets dicey.

182
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,373
Wish me luck. Hopefully I won't
take someone's eye out with this thing.

183
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,729
We're staging a walkout.

184
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,800
Meeting at Dunkin' Donuts to plan.
- What?

185
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,404
If we don't take a stand, they're
gonna replace us with part-time nurses...

186
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:15,440
- so they don't have to pay benefits.
- Yeah, they're welcome to replace me.

187
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,339
- Is anybody working here today?
- Talk to Dr. Romano.

188
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,276
- I will.
- A joker just fainted in the waiting area.

189
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,417
Took a header into an end
table. There's blood everywhere.

190
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,776
Abby?

191
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,085
Why... Why are
you telling me this?

192
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,920
Well, according to my
watch, your break is over.

193
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,439
That's right. Leave
me to pick up after you.

194
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,544
Hey, wait. Hold up,
hold up. Hold up.

195
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,485
Sorry. I just ran down from CT.

196
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,983
- You're Pratt?
- Yeah.

197
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,384
Nick Cooper, second-year
Resident. Friends call me Coop.

198
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,990
Plastics or Head and Neck for
an unstable mandible fracture?

199
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,956
Call them both.
Take whoever is first.

200
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,992
- What do I tell the other?
- Patient left.

201
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,893
They'll be happy. It's one
less consult for their team.

202
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,297
- Cool.
- You new guys got to start picking it up.

203
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,699
It's only 10:30, we're
already 20 patients behind.

204
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,566
- I got six.
- The other two are slow.

205
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,799
Morris has an LOL with abdominal
pain and altered mental status.

206
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,344
It's a big workup, possible LP.
Sofun's still getting the lay of the land.

207
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,512
- They're killing me.
- Don't worry about it.

208
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,515
Look, we'll blast through
these. Let me see what you got.

209
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,175
Epistaxis and vertigo.

210
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,152
Nasal pack for the nosebleed,
Meclizine for the vertigo.

211
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,484
They're out the door in 20.

212
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,001
How's it going?

213
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,071
Oh, uh, rather deep. I
used a 4-0 Vicryl subq.

214
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,175
Nice. What was that
that you were just saying?

215
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,176
- Nothing.
- I heard you talking to him.

216
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,305
It was a prayer.

217
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,012
He's not dying.

218
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,678
- It wasn't for him. It's a private prayer.
- Oh, something like:

219
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,290
"Please, Lord, don't let
me kill somebody today"?

220
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,722
Somewhere along those lines?

221
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:18,422
Neela, I need you to run down to Medical
Records and get Mr. Perkins' old chart.

222
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:19,861
If you can't find that...

223
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,526
Cardiology should have his
last EKG on file on the fifth floor.

224
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:28,368
He's got anemia and renal insufficiency,
so print out his BUN, creatinine...

225
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,602
and CBC trends for the last two years.
- Okay.

226
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,911
Hey there.

227
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,948
Don't forget.
Dinner tonight, 8:00.

228
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,950
Oh, they have a dress
code, so wear something nice.

229
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,951
How nice?

230
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,056
I'm wearing my
little black dress.

231
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,654
- I think I'm in.
- You think?

232
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,226
No, no. I'm in.

233
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,092
Hey. How come I wasn't
invited to this party?

234
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,997
- Hook up the Thora-Seal.
- I got it.

235
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,728
Okay, what's next?

236
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:02,307
Um...
- You want 0 silk?
- Yes, 0 silk.

237
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,309
Girl's in 2's x-rays.
You better check it out.

238
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,174
Not good. COOPER: Who is it?

239
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,179
- Tachypneic girl in 2.
- Huge heart.

240
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,444
Call Cards. She's in failure.

241
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,118
I don't think this is normal.
Maybe it's a brain tumor.

242
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,593
I've tried everything.
I can't stop drooling.

243
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,130
I'm out. A nurse will be
with you in one minute.

244
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,603
Hey, what about that sandwich?

245
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,172
What about it? Where's Amanda?
She's supposed to relieve me at 1.

246
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,038
The nurses are over at Dunkin'
Donuts plotting some kind of a coup.

247
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,442
- Hey, did you sign this?
- No.

248
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,842
- Smart girl.
- Should have.

249
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,950
I want everyone on this petition
in the lounge in five minutes.

250
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,118
- They staged a walkout.
- They're on a break.

251
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,879
- For over an hour?
- Well, page them.

252
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,183
Anyone who's not back
in five minutes is fired.

253
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,952
- You can't fire nurses. ROMANO:
I can if they walk off the job.

254
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,187
I'll go get them.

255
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:00,322
- Hey, you got a hook. Suits you.
- Shut up.

256
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,029
- Nobody's called my name yet.
- They will.

257
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,663
Would it help if I gave
a stool sample too?

258
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,310
No, just...

259
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,046
- Are you a nurse?
- Check-in's at Triage...

260
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,151
- What happened to you?
- Somebody shot me.

261
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,685
All right. Okay,
sit down, sit down.

262
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,255
I need a gurney. What's your
name? What's your name?

263
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,187
- Bobby.
- Okay, Bobby. Okay.

264
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:30,353
- Don't let me die.
- I won't. I won't. I won't. Okay.

265
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,792
- Who shot you?
- I don't know.

266
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,302
- Dumped by a homeboy ambulance.
- You're gonna have to hold still.

267
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,374
- We need to tube him.
- Well, get that line in, and I will.

268
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:49,005
Uh-oh, Bobby? Bobby?
Bobby, open your eyes.

269
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,651
No radial pulse.

270
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,185
Got a carotid, but it's weak.
Get him on the monitor.

271
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,379
Get that blood up
and page Surgery.

272
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,855
Twenty of etomidate,
120 of sux. Suction.

273
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,985
- BP, 64 systolic. Pulse is 60.
- Saline and a mg of atropine.

274
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,529
Penetrating trauma with
impending arrest. Crack him.

275
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,191
- No, not yet. Tube. Come on.
- I'm prepping the chest.

276
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,835
All right, I'm in the
hole. Bag him up, Abby.

277
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,202
Where's Lewis?

278
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,346
Abby, crash cart, now!

279
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,519
Sorry, I had a hot MI.
What are you doing?

280
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,832
Talk to Abby. I'm
putting in a chest tube.

281
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,680
He was talking,
now he's arresting.

282
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,985
Good breath sounds,
airway secure, hypotensive.

283
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,889
Okay, run the code, Pratt.

284
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,053
What are you gonna
do, crack him by yourself?

285
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,893
Get Corday and order
some more O-neg.

286
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,572
Okay, Lisa, can you
follow my finger, please?

287
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,074
Lisa, can you follow my finger?

288
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,513
Don't stare.

289
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,612
Excuse me.

290
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,457
Morris? Work the
kid up in Curtain 2.

291
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,294
- Pressure's only 60 systolic.
- Vasculature is collapsed.

292
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,768
- Cutdown tray.
- Femoral cutdown.

293
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,463
- Who are they?
- Med students.

294
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,405
That makes three of epi.

295
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,273
- Good breath sounds with bagging.
- Hook up a Cell Saver.

296
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,970
- How much O-neg?
- Four units.

297
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,376
He's only got a faint carotid.

298
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,280
- Come on, man. Stay with me.
- Another two units of blood.

299
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,885
Let's follow his
chest tube output.

300
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,621
- There he goes again.
- Hey, I have an idea.

301
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,053
How about a thoracotomy?

302
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,286
"Wow, that is just so
crazy, Abby, it might work."

303
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,754
There's only 300
cc's out the chest.

304
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,126
V-fib.

305
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,791
Charge to 200. ABBY: Look out!

306
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,164
- Prep for a thoracotomy.
- He's already prepped.

307
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,498
Ten blade, now.

308
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,507
First incision is in the fourth intercostal
space from the lateral sternum...

309
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,948
- to the posterior axillary line.
- Clear.

310
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,593
What's Carter mean
by "unfettered"?

311
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,640
- He means... FRANK: It
means she's been dumped.

312
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,255
- Did you get rid of those nurses?
- They went to Nursing Administration...

313
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,425
saying something
about hiring a hit man.

314
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,504
- Hell hath no fury like an RN scorned.
- Whose patient is this?

315
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,663
- She's mine. ROMANO:
Well, get her back in bed...

316
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,468
and use restraints
if you have to.

317
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,612
It's okay. She's harmless. Can
you sign off on a wound infection?

318
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,180
- No. Go away and take her with you.
- No, seriously. She's cool.

319
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,784
I'm Nick Cooper. Coop.
I'm a new Resident.

320
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,819
I didn't realize who you were.
Do me a favor would you, Coop?

321
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:45,481
Air Rescue's bringing in a bad MVA.
Go up on the roof. Wave in the chopper.

322
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,787
Stand in the middle of the
landing pad so they see you.

323
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,223
You're Rocket Romano. You were
a surgeon. Used to be chief of staff.

324
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,626
I still am a surgeon.

325
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,792
Yeah, you got scalpel
attachments for that bad boy?

326
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,836
- I'm right-handed.
- Lucky.

327
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,739
- This guy's 10 days...
- Let's get a few things straight.

328
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,215
One, we don't offer
remedial medicine here.

329
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,651
Two, you don't talk
to me. I talk to you.

330
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,653
- Three...
- Should I be writing this down?

331
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,257
Stay out of my face!

332
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,036
Thirty again.

333
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,873
Clear.

334
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,507
Fine V-fib.

335
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,009
- More like coarse asystole.
- Resuming compressions.

336
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,490
Units five and six are up.
- How long's it been?

337
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,575
- Thirty-five minutes.
- Should be able to shock him into sinus.

338
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,986
- Hold CPR.
- There's nothing to shock.

339
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,783
- High-dose epi might coarsen his rhythm.
- He's been down too long.

340
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,552
- He's young and healthy.
- With fatal wounds.

341
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,560
His hilum and aorta
are cross-clamped.

342
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,090
We've replaced his volume and
maxed out on atropine and epi.

343
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,295
- He walked in here. He was talking to me.
- That's it.

344
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,604
Time of death: 1336.

345
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,276
Abby, can you try
and locate the family?

346
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:48,338
I was coming down the ladder and
I stepped on the cord to my sander.

347
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,517
I only fell about 3 feet, but I
twisted my ankle pretty good.

348
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,118
And my collarbone's killing me.

349
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,981
- Well, let's take a look.
- Okay.

350
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:58,647
Heard about your run-in with Dr. Romano.
Someone should have warned you.

351
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,623
- He's quite a character.
- That's one word for him.

352
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,027
- What were you sanding?
- The hull of a boat.

353
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,860
- Fiberglass?
- Yeah.

354
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,303
Are you all right?

355
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,331
Hey, Coop, you ready
to present some cases?

356
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,817
His asthma is acting up.

357
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,775
- All right, give him
an albuterol treatment.

358
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,471
Then come find me. We
have to clear this board.

359
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,477
So, what's the story?

360
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,551
Call Respiratory to
set up nitric oxide.

361
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,154
Give her more Lasix and
start an isoproterenol drip.

362
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,847
- Wait. What?
- She has primary pulmonary hypertension.

363
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,654
You're kidding. Can you even
diagnose PPHN from an echo?

364
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,160
If you know what to look for.

365
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,355
We'll cath her in the
lab to be 100 percent.

366
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,592
Tough break.
Seemed like a nice kid.

367
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,227
Yeah.

368
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,471
Hennesy in Exam 3
needs a Foley and an IV.

369
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,579
CBC and chem panel
on Gininni in Curtain 4.

370
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,580
And that scalp-lac kid in the
Suture Room needs a setup.

371
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:00,982
- Am I the only nurse working today?
- Close. Romano fired six.

372
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,588
Oh, so that leaves four
of us for 35 patients.

373
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,224
Looks like you dodged a bullet.

374
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,860
Hey, I'm sorry about the
thoracotomy on that kid.

375
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,997
- Didn't seem to make a difference.
- Maybe if we'd done it sooner.

376
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,995
- You reached the parents?
- No.

377
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,830
Oh. Hey, you know, for what
it's worth, I think it's Carter's loss.

378
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:19,830
What?

379
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,237
Do you know where my parents
are? They went to talk to the doctor.

380
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,402
They said they'd only be a few
minutes, but that was a while ago.

381
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,048
Uh, why don't you hop back
into bed and I'll find them.

382
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,444
- Okay.
- Okay.

383
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,449
- I think he's getting even tighter.
- Try not to talk. Slow, deep breaths.

384
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,180
- Epi. Epi.
- Subq epinephrine?

385
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:44,860
- Uh, point three.
- His nebulizer's dry.

386
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,933
Okay, we'll try five
of albuterol this time.

387
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,296
Push it.

388
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,039
Little stick here, Coop.

389
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,277
Too much.

390
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,453
- Too much.
- We gave you 0.3.

391
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:11,647
You said push it all.

392
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,487
You gave 1 milligram?

393
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,657
- That's over three times the dose.
- I'll get an Attending.

394
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,129
No, no, no. He can handle it.

395
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,894
- V-tach.
- Crash cart.

396
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,909
- What the hell happened?
- Too much epi.

397
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,837
Has he got a pulse?
Can you hear me?

398
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,901
- Charge to 300.
- No, no, no. It's stable V-tach.

399
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,239
He only needs 50. Do
you want some Valium first?

400
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,348
- This could be uncomfortable.
- Just do it.

401
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,711
- Charged to 50 for synch cardioversion.
- Clear.

402
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,349
Aah! Jeez!

403
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,988
- V-tach.
- Let's try 100.

404
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,395
Valium. NEELA: Charged.

405
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,321
- Valium.
- Clear.

406
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,526
Aah!

407
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,361
Okay.

408
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,023
Congratulations.

409
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,103
You just saved
your first Resident.

410
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,013
You can't just sit here.

411
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,480
The union steward said
to stay the entire shift.

412
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,814
But we're getting slammed. I
mean, we'll work it all out tomorrow.

413
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,512
I'm sorry, Abby.

414
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:20,182
Think how you're gonna feel 10
years from now when they replace you...

415
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,021
with minimum-wage grads
right out of nursing school.

416
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,891
Abby, Lewis is yelling for you.

417
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,099
Are you nurses? ALL: No.

418
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,635
How come you're still working?

419
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,864
I'm an LVN. They don't
get no cheaper than me.

420
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,167
Pratt needs a chaperone
for a pelvic in 3.

421
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,208
If you could cath
the little boy in 4.

422
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,039
- Done deal.
- You still with us?

423
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,378
Okay, I also have a guy
in 2 that needs something...

424
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,849
- I can't read.
- What's that say, "nipple lips"?

425
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,818
I got a Resident who needs a
holding help for a spinal tap...

426
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,220
- on the dirty old man in Exam 3.
- He died.

427
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,619
- For real?
- Real dead.

428
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,626
Do you think you could cover
for me for, like, five minutes...

429
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,560
so I could go up? I gotta
deal with the nursing situation.

430
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:02,463
- I haven't seen Luka yet.
- I haven't stopped for six hours.

431
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,695
I had to use a patient's urinal.
And that Carter letter, I'm sorry.

432
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:10,070
- I know that was pretty harsh.
- How did you hear about this letter?

433
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,370
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

434
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,343
Excuse me, Dr. Romano, if we
don't get some help down here...

435
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,642
- patients will die.
- We called the registry.

436
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,842
Someone from the service
should be here soon.

437
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,181
Edna's down from Geriatrics.

438
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,586
Edna?

439
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,658
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.

440
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,926
There is a drunk in Exam 4
that needs two more of Ativan.

441
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,263
I'm sorry, dear. He's a putz.

442
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,333
Who, the drunk?

443
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:44,443
That Carter boy. It's too
bad you didn't dump him first.

444
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,412
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- The big man, he let me read the letter.

445
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,111
The guy in 3 needs another
bolus and an emesis basin.

446
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,948
And call the lab and ask
why it's taking over two hours...

447
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,784
- to get a set of electrolytes.
- Malik can do this. Hey!

448
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,791
- Okay. Did you hear about my letter?
- What letter?

449
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,692
Oh, yeah, I need a phenytoin
level on my seizure guy.

450
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,732
And your girl in Exam
2 needs 20 of Lasix, IV.

451
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,463
Oh, Elle. I told her I was gonna
find her parents. How's she doing?

452
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:16,302
She has primary pulmonary hypertension.
Won't live to see her 21st birthday.

453
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,443
Other than that, she's fine.

454
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,442
- Are you sure?
- Ninety-eight percent.

455
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,979
They won't be certain until
after the cath on Monday.

456
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,777
Her parents don't want her
to know until after the tests.

457
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,216
- Not gonna tell her for three days?
- It's awkward.

458
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,753
It's not awkward. It's stupid.

459
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:33,120
She already senses something's
wrong. She deserves to know the truth.

460
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,490
After the cath, she'll know and
then it'll all be downhill from there.

461
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,824
Just stay out of it. It's
the parents' decision.

462
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,297
Excuse me. Hi, I'm sorry.
We got turned around.

463
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:45,165
We were going to the children's
ward to visit a classmate.

464
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:50,332
Okay, go back to the elevator.
Go up to the third floor, take a left...

465
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,979
- You know what? I'll show you.
- Thanks.

466
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,342
- Are you a nurse?
- Yes, I am a nurse.

467
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,450
Who here wants to be a nurse?

468
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,188
- Hey, you know boys can be nurses too.
- I want to be a doctor.

469
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,849
Me too! Me too!

470
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,954
- Robert.
- To what do we owe this royal visit?

471
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,464
Do you know who that was
in my office this morning?

472
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,432
- Let me see. Do I care? No.
- That was totally inappropriate.

473
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,834
Yeah? I'll tell you what's
inappropriate, Kerry.

474
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,339
The hospital boning me with a
prosthesis with a limited functional field.

475
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,842
I'll have peripheral
neuropathy, overuse syndrome...

476
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,274
Did you fire six nurses today?

477
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,210
It was the only
good part of my day.

478
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,785
- How'd you like me to fire you?
- Well, I've got a handicap, remember?

479
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,013
- Somehow I don't think that's an issue.
- You guys have an audience.

480
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,091
Fire anyone else, even a
candy striper, and you're gone.

481
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,524
Consider this an
official reprimand.

482
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,328
You are one Grade A bitch!

483
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,834
You know that, Kerry?

484
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,664
No, Robert, I'm your boss. And
as long as I am, you're my bitch.

485
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,206
Now get your ass back to work.

486
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,649
Fecal impaction in 4 needs some
good old-fashioned finger digging.

487
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,379
Enjoy.

488
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:15,157
Jerry! Show them how to
get to the Pedes playroom?

489
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,920
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

490
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:20,657
- What is that?
- This is human blood.

491
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,740
Hi, Elle. Feeling any better?

492
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:38,077
- Yeah. I can finally take a deep breath.
- That's good.

493
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:42,083
They had a heart
doctor come see me.

494
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,552
Mm-hm.

495
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,181
Why?

496
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:50,090
I thought it was my
lungs, not my heart.

497
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,400
Well, your heart...

498
00:28:55,767 --> 00:29:00,933
Your heart and your lungs are
connected, so it only makes sense...

499
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:04,804
that Cardiology would
come and take a look at you.

500
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,277
I'm sure Dr. Lewis
was just being thorough.

501
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:15,714
So was it okay? My heart? My
parents were acting a little weird.

502
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:21,254
Well, all parents are
a little weird, right?

503
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,423
I'm sure they just want you to get
better. I'm gonna go find Dr. Lewis...

504
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,127
and see if she's
heard anything, okay?

505
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,349
Hey. PRATT: Hey.

506
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,523
These are my parents.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.

507
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,522
How you doing?

508
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,752
- Nice to meet you.
- They were downtown, shopping.

509
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,952
Really?

510
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,497
And now they wanna
join us for dinner.

511
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,294
- I hope you don't mind.
- Come on.

512
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,097
It's... It's okay.
How you doing?

513
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,704
- Nice to see you.
- Sit down, Greg.

514
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,467
Thank you.

515
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,546
Much better. The
medicine's working.

516
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,880
Dr. Lewis, I heard there
was a PPHN in here.

517
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,957
Cardiology said I should listen
for a tricuspid regurge murmur.

518
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,492
A what? Is that what I have? There's
something wrong with my heart?

519
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,130
This is not a good teaching
case, Neela. Come with me.

520
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,461
No, I want her to stay. I wanna
know what's wrong with me.

521
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,069
Okay, I'll be right
back, all right?

522
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:43,202
- I've never seen a PPHN before. I...
- She's not a PPHN.

523
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:47,574
She's a girl who's about to find out
she's going to die a slow, horrible death.

524
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,372
She hasn't been told yet?

525
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:53,508
There are extenuating circumstances
which you don't know about. Excuse me.

526
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,153
What are you doing?

527
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,916
He... He wasn't eating it.

528
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,357
That doesn't mean you
get to. What's his story?

529
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,790
Um...

530
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,992
Forest Herman. Just snoozing
off pain meds for lower-back pain.

531
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:12,928
Mr. Herman, I'm
Dr... Mr. Herman?

532
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,499
- Tell me he's sleeping.
- Not unless he's taking a dirt nap.

533
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,940
Wait, I feel a pulse. It's
weak. Get a crash cart.

534
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:24,916
- Bag him. What'd you give him?
- Just Demerol for back pain.

535
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,952
Somebody page Corday.

536
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,185
Okay, what did I
do? What did I miss?

537
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:37,524
While you were stealing his tuna
fish, he was bleeding out from a triple A.

538
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,796
He's drifting down.
You want more blood?

539
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:43,128
Yep, hang it. This man
needs vascular right now.

540
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:46,032
Get his pressure up, they can
do an endovascular procedure.

541
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,968
He probably won't
survive an open wound.

542
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,735
I paged them. They
were unimpressed.

543
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:56,381
Right. Let's page Dr. Dorset again.
Tell him Dr. Corday needs him. Badly.

544
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,817
I tried to get you a room
with a fireplace by the pool...

545
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:10,326
but the guys from Coldplay rented
out the whole top floor for a party.

546
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,827
I can walk.

547
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:17,095
I know, but hospital policy
says I have to do the driving.

548
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,631
Where are your parents?

549
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,967
They disappear every half-hour.

550
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,406
My mom pretends they're
making phone calls for work.

551
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,376
But when they come back,
I can tell she's been crying.

552
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,082
So either the stock
market crashed...

553
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,813
or there's something wrong with me
and no one is willing to talk about it.

554
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,253
So, what, am I dying?

555
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,491
Do I have cancer or something?

556
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,428
Okay, Elle...

557
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:54,266
the doctors still have
some more tests to do.

558
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,104
- But so far...
- Abby, I need to talk to you.

559
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,944
We're on our way upstairs.

560
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,639
Oh, okay. Hey, Malik, can
you wheel Elle to Three South?

561
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,410
- Yeah.
- I need help with the code.

562
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,222
This is wrong. You know it.
We're teaching her not to trust us...

563
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,228
exactly at the time she
should be trusting us the most.

564
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:21,991
Abby, what is wrong
with you today?

565
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,329
You practically start a
thoracotomy on your own.

566
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,414
Now you're talking to my
patients when I asked you not to.

567
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,872
Somebody should.

568
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,804
It's not your call. You're not
her doctor. You're her nurse.

569
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:33,207
When I ask you not to
do something, don't do it.

570
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,382
Mind if I watch?

571
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,494
- You should be at home in bed.
- Unit six type-specific is up.

572
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,630
Pressure's down to 80/40.
Shouldn't we start pressors?

573
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:57,168
- You wanna kill this guy. He's not stable.
- He was. Your service didn't come down.

574
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,930
Those bastards hate
to leave the hot tub. You.

575
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,631
Grab some Betadine, scrub
this guy like a sweet potato.

576
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,673
Ectopy.

577
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,075
- Kick that tray over here.
- You don't wanna do this upstairs?

578
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,647
Love to. Didn't leave
enough gas in him to get there.

579
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,807
- Scrubbed.
- Nicely done.

580
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,850
Maybe you can detail
my Jag after work.

581
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,251
Ten blade. Drape this
area here and here.

582
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:21,325
Suction to Lewis. You wanna try a little
more teaching, a little less standup?

583
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,826
Are you serious? My
name's on this chart.

584
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,193
It's like we say upstairs, "What
happens in the ER, stays in the ER."

585
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,958
- Thanks. ABBY:
His BP's still 50.

586
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:32,798
Cover your eyes, kids. This
is gonna be some badass juju.

587
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,496
Midline
transperitoneal incision.

588
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,638
There.

589
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,335
Pull down a bit, Dr. Corday.

590
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,978
You know, it really is like
music when we work together.

591
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,792
You boys remember
the Law of Laplace?

592
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:01,197
Stress on the arterial wall is pressure
times radius, divided by wall thickness.

593
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,631
You two have just
been nurse-slapped.

594
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,669
- You know what it means?
- It means this man's about to die.

595
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:11,206
Anyone can rip a man's heart
out. But fixing it without looking?

596
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:15,177
That's why I get the big
money and all the hot chicks.

597
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,080
Right-angled retractor.

598
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,175
Is this where I get to make a joke
about this man bleeding to death?

599
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,582
Only if you're qualified.

600
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,690
I got the supraceliac aorta in my
hand, meaning we have proximal control.

601
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,852
- Don't try this at home.
- Or anywhere near this hospital.

602
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,258
You need a clamp?

603
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,367
I think it's best if I just pull a Dutch
boy, keep my finger in it. Let's roll.

604
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:48,374
- How wicked was that?
- Guy's got balls the size of my head.

605
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,210
- I want the blue one.
- Hey, you know what?

606
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:56,787
A medical student was crushed to
death working on this computer last year.

607
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,254
- I can believe it.
- You save any lives today?

608
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,757
- Nope.
- She saved one.

609
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,418
Hey, I'm Nick Cooper.
My friends call me Coop.

610
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,224
- Michael Gallant.
- Good to meet you.

611
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,562
- So did I miss anything good?
- Yeah. Dr. Kovac is back.

612
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:14,297
- He's upstairs. He's doing better.
- Abby got a Dear John letter from Carter.

613
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,735
And she gave it to you?

614
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,432
- Not exactly.
- What's it say?

615
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,077
I imagine it's private.

616
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,804
Yeah, you're probably
right. What's it say?

617
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,744
"Dear Abby..."

618
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,809
Has anybody not
read this letter?

619
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,715
I haven't.

620
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,219
What, you pulled
this out of the trash?

621
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,223
- I...
- You guys are pathetic.

622
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,655
You're not the only one
who got a letter today.

623
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,298
We all got 90-day suspensions.

624
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,935
- I hate my job.
- Don't worry, dear. It'll get better.

625
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,273
I hope you don't mind, Greg...

626
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,606
but we went ahead and ordered
something that's not on the menu.

627
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,644
Oh, no, this is
okay. It looks good.

628
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,978
Okay. Okay. Sorry.

629
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,319
So, Greg, what do
your parents do?

630
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,822
Well, my mom passed
away when I was 12...

631
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,829
and my father and I
never kept in touch.

632
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,694
Well, that's unfortunate.

633
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,530
Family is such a
valuable part of one's life.

634
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,069
It's important to have roots.

635
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:25,542
Jing-Mei is going to China with us.
She's going to rediscover her ancestry.

636
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,511
No, I'm not. Mom,
we talked about this.

637
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:33,516
It's difficult to know where you're going
if you don't know where you came from.

638
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,213
What's that? Confucius?

639
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,079
Common sense.

640
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,725
- Lizzie, burning the midnight oil?
- Not if I can help it.

641
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,733
- How are you doing?
- Very well, thanks.

642
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,928
So is this where all
the cool kids hang out?

643
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,563
Not if we can help
it. How is our triple A?

644
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,438
- Not dead yet.
- Well, that's encouraging.

645
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,171
Thank you for coming
down so quickly.

646
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,982
And?

647
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,046
And what?

648
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,982
This is where you
say, "I owe you one."

649
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,254
- What do you want?
- Foot rub.

650
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:20,260
I'll settle for coffee.

651
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,961
I have to be home in an
hour, and nothing fancy.

652
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,538
No coconut-frosted double
javaccino or anything like that.

653
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,999
All right.

654
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,278
- Good night, Robert.
- Elizabeth.

655
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,866
Whoo.

656
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:35,669
- Okay, okay, how bad was that?
- What, the jellyfish or the ambush?

657
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,864
I'm so sorry.

658
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,010
- You know, they caught me off guard.
- Uh-huh.

659
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:42,306
You know, if it's any
consolation, they didn't hate you.

660
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,313
Is that what they were saying?

661
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,474
They're just old-fashioned.
- Taxi!

662
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,017
Meaning?

663
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:52,487
Meaning they want me to be
with someone more traditional.

664
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,183
You know all that talk
about going to China?

665
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,356
They just wanna
find me a husband.

666
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:01,898
Well, just tell them to relax, all right?
It's not like we're getting married. Taxi!

667
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,495
Oh, come on.

668
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,161
What?

669
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,703
What are we doing?

670
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,406
You're kidding, right?

671
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,009
We're dating. You
know, we're having fun.

672
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,413
Neither one of us is
ready to settle down, right?

673
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,912
Right.

674
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,015
What, did I say something?

675
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,682
Nope.

676
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,253
- Then why are you mad?
- I'm not mad.

677
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,524
I'm sure you'll find
yourself a new bang buddy.

678
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,327
Good night.

679
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:57,450
Thank God I got you a decaf.

680
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,225
He left.

681
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,267
- What are you doing?
- I needed to stretch my legs.

682
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,737
It's good to see you.

683
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,675
You look great.

684
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,081
You look like hell.

685
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,410
Too much partying on the plane.

686
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,422
So...

687
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:38,760
- So...?
- So I met Gillian.

688
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,829
- She seems...
- Yeah, she is.

689
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,261
Must be nice having
a private nurse.

690
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,468
She give you your letter?

691
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:52,938
Did you read it?

692
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:57,472
- No.
- Well, you're the only one.

693
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,449
I think he wanted to try
and explain why he stayed.

694
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,117
He saved my life.

695
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,957
It's different over there.

696
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,995
Changes you.

697
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,797
I think Carter found himself.

698
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,799
I didn't know he was missing.

699
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:26,976
- He's gonna be okay.
- I don't wanna talk about Carter anymore.

700
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,873
I think it was
doomed from the start.

701
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:34,110
I'm glad one of us had the
courage to put it out of its misery.

702
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,657
It feels strange to be here.

703
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,524
I think maybe I've changed too.

704
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,994
Well, change is good, right?

705
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:51,461
I think I'm way overdue myself.

706
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,906
I hope he hasn't talked
you into helping him escape.

707
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,876
Nope.

708
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,672
You need to take these
and get back in bed.

709
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,549
You're still warm.

710
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,519
I'll stop by tomorrow.

711
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:11,379
- Okay.
- Okay.

712
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,422
- It was really nice to finally meet you.
- You too.

713
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,690
I'm glad you're back.

714
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,363
What are you doing up?

715
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,162
Come on.
