00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:10,534
Got a medical transport plane in
Kinshasa waiting to take you back.

3
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,192
- Getting bad out there?
- Yes.

4
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,732
- Merry Christmas Eve, huh?
- If you say so.

5
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,566
- You're late.
- Yeah. I had to walk from La Salle.

6
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,536
My bus crashed into
a UPS truck. Whoa.

7
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:17,235
Weak and dizzy in 6.
LOL with bloody stool in 2.

8
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,279
There's a kid who swallowed
a Christmas tree ornament in 5.

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,847
- Work him up, send him to Kovac.
- My shoes are wet.

10
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,349
- Happy holidays, everybody.
- Where's she going?

11
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,853
Home to wait for the ghost
of Christmas past to show up.

12
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,753
- Thanks, Michael.
- I was afraid you'd already have it.

13
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,621
No, it's great.

14
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,387
- A kid swallowed an ornament?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,532
Mom's worried about the
wire hanging-hook thing.

16
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:43,228
Take a couple of minutes. The old lady
with the bloody stool can wait for you.

17
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,736
- Thanks.
- Did you get your trinket from Carter?

18
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,602
- What?
- His Third World care package.

19
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,402
Gone-native junk for everybody.

20
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:54,412
- Kovac got some kind of voodoo mask.
- I think it's Bangala.

21
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:59,076
Yeah, they use it to slaughter farm
animals in some kind of satanic ritual.

22
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,914
Oh, here.

23
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,717
Go ahead. It won't bite.

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,257
You ever send that box
of stuff to Africa, Frank?

25
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,224
Toys for Third World tots?

26
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,387
Went out last week.

27
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,161
What'd you get?

28
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:15,831
A box.

29
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,837
A tribal shaman's box. Medicine
men use it to store their potions.

30
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,780
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Welcome to Calcutta.

31
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,417
Come on, that's it.

32
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,645
- Hey, what is that?
- A little bit of Sikh rap.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,254
A little Sikh rap.

34
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,653
- Are you ready to go?
- No, keep dancing.

35
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,690
She's good.

36
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,136
Okay, I'll be back
for the H & P's.

37
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,791
This one? KEM: Yes.

38
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,721
Don't you shake it.

39
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,135
Oh, God. Are you a paper saver?

40
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,305
Mebendazole. How romantic.

41
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,973
Open it.

42
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,816
You like it?

43
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,622
That is beautiful.

44
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,995
It was my father's.

45
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,859
I want you to have it.

46
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,073
Come on, try it on.

47
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,080
Wow.

48
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,182
It suits you.

49
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,685
Thank you.

50
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,593
So, what'd you get me?
It had better be good.

51
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,894
- I hope you won't be disappointed.
- Come on.

52
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:40,436
- It's, um, kind of sentimental.
- Mm-hm.

53
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,819
They were mine
when I was little.

54
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,894
- Thank you.
- There's more.

55
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,009
I want you to come back
to the States with me.

56
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,417
I want our baby to
be born in America.

57
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,318
Well, back to work.

58
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,322
You really don't like
the Dixie Chicks?

59
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,363
Everybody likes
the Dixie Chicks.

60
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,900
- Everybody?
- Everybody with any taste.

61
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,514
He's weak on the right.

62
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,352
Toxoplasmosis?

63
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,685
- We got a CT?
- No.

64
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,848
So treat with sulfadiazine,
pyrimethamine, colonic acid.

65
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,220
- Spinal tap?
- No.

66
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,420
We have to save the taps for
the patients who really need them.

67
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,859
And he doesn't?

68
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,057
If he doesn't
improve in a week...

69
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,429
we'll tap him then.

70
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,700
Hey, you looking for me?

71
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:22,138
- How's our Belgian dermatologist?
- Oh, suffering from first-day shock.

72
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,571
He'll be all right.

73
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,872
- So are you coming tonight?
- Yeah. Nine?

74
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,778
- Coming alone?
- No.

75
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,385
- What?
- I think it's great.

76
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,214
It's nothing serious.

77
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,117
Nine, then.

78
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,943
Oh, come on. It
is not that simple.

79
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,584
Imperialism is imperialism.

80
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:08,688
No matter whether the conqueror claims
that the conquered will be better off.

81
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,584
- Again?
- Mm.

82
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:16,094
"The conqueror brings with him
the seeds of his own destruction."

83
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,924
Heiner Muller.

84
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,932
Müller, right.

85
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,912
Americans are like
sheep. I don't understand...

86
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:27,306
why they aren't rioting in the
streets of Palm Springs or "Atlana"...

87
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,375
Atlanta! Two T's.

88
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,206
And nobody riots in Palm Springs.
They're too busy playing golf.

89
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,508
Democracy has been a positive
force for change throughout the world.

90
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,676
Hiroshima, Chile, <i>le</i> Vietnam?

91
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,618
Hungary, Poland, Romania.

92
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,917
Coca-Cola, Marlboro.

93
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,217
McDonald's.

94
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,989
- What I would give for a Quarter Pounder.
- That's what I'm talking about.

95
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:56,159
American commercialism is ruining music,
film, indigenous culture around the world.

96
00:08:56,336 --> 00:09:00,171
Listen, from what I've
heard of French rock 'n' roll...

97
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,799
you are well on your way to
ruining French music all on your own.

98
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,543
I thought this was
supposed to be a celebration.

99
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,147
Okay.

100
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,011
I don't so much mind
American intervention in Iraq.

101
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,210
The Baathists were
rapists and murderers.

102
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,722
Hear, hear.

103
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,726
But I do mind America callously dismissing
legitimate international concerns...

104
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,332
just trampling 50 years of
carefully crafted diplomacy...

105
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,491
in pursuit of its own political
and economic interests.

106
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,901
Makemba Likasu, Dr. John Carter.
Kem works with the Ministry of Health.

107
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,666
And her friend, Peter.

108
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,100
I have no idea what he
does. What do you do?

109
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,745
Ministry of Finance.

110
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,406
Kem's setting up an ARV
demonstration project for AIDS patients.

111
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,017
That's great. Has
everybody ordered already?

112
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,520
Oh! I love this song.
Come on, Walter!

113
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,249
Let's dance.

114
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,360
Come on, Walter.

115
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,361
So, what project you working on?

116
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:07,439
I'm starting a small HIV-AIDS program
with money from the Global Fund.

117
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,599
- Anti-retroviral therapy.
- Really?

118
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,374
- Triple cocktail here.
- Your skepticism is well-founded.

119
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,105
We have our doubters.

120
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,251
Well, can you afford to treat
millions of patients, right?

121
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:22,719
Meds cost $15,000 a year per person.
We can't even get IV antibiotics here.

122
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,152
My point exactly.

123
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,122
We're not using American drugs.

124
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,989
Another example of American
commercial self-interest.

125
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,893
I mean, blocking
the use of generics.

126
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,661
After the WTO ruled that poor
countries could ignore drug patents...

127
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,235
India developed a generic.

128
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,736
It only costs $200
a year per patient.

129
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,636
Money we also don't have.

130
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,640
What is your alternative, Peter?

131
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,905
Just to watch 30 million
Africans die in the next 10 years?

132
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,743
If we can demonstrate
that these programs work...

133
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,819
then we can appeal to the U.N., to
rich countries, to our own governments.

134
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,582
I think I just heard
someone playing our song.

135
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,952
Imperialist Yankee
dollars to the rescue again.

136
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,754
It's nice to know we're
still needed for something.

137
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,792
Oh, Peter, stop pouting.

138
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,995
Let's dance.

139
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,783
It's Bastille Day, you
know? <i>Vive la révolution.</i>

140
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,555
I won't be forced to say
nice things about the French?

141
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,992
No.

142
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,530
He's not improving.

143
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,467
- When did we start him on sulfadiazine?
- Ten days ago.

144
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,835
Now do we do a spinal tap?

145
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,805
Yeah. Is this his wife?

146
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,844
- Yes.
- Tell her we need some additional tests.

147
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,977
I speak English.

148
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,885
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,923
Your husband is not getting better.
So we need to do some additional tests.

150
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,821
- He's very sick?
- Yes.

151
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,528
He will die soon?

152
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,661
Not immediately. But, yes.

153
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,007
- How pregnant are you?
- Six months.

154
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,174
Do you know why
your husband is dying?

155
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,446
AIDS.

156
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,073
And have you been tested?

157
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,775
No.

158
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,414
- The children?
- Mm-mm.

159
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,014
It only takes a few minutes.

160
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:43,027
Why? Is there anything you
can do to help us if we are sick?

161
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,796
If you are HIV-positive
we can give you...

162
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:50,801
medicine to try and keep you
from passing it along to your baby.

163
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,201
- Yes?
- Yes.

164
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:01,037
He's probably got a couple of weeks.
Mom's pregnant. She's got two kids.

165
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,912
One's 18 months, the other's 5.
All the tests came back positive.

166
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,452
- You get a CD4 count?
- She's stage 3.

167
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,917
They've been in
the refugee camp.

168
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,322
She had to flee the fighting
in Bukavu last March.

169
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,053
Has she been to a VCT center?

170
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,261
VCT?

171
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,557
- Counseling, community support.
- She doesn't need counseling.

172
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,761
She needs antiretroviral drugs.

173
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,434
- You wanna get her into my pilot program.
- She's a teacher.

174
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:35,807
She'll be the sole support for her family.
I'd think that would make her a candidate.

175
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,349
I can only enroll
10 patients a month.

176
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,487
We're only funded
for 200 participants.

177
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,521
- Total?
- Uh-huh.

178
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,157
How long is your waiting list?

179
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,819
The selection committee is
very particular about who gets in.

180
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,258
How long?

181
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,162
We take patients with TLC's under 1200.
They have to live close to the clinic.

182
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,326
They have to
participate for five years...

183
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,001
and show consistency in
taking previous drug regimens.

184
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,607
If they fulfill all these...

185
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,040
they're included in a list that I
present to the committee monthly.

186
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,773
They, then, select 10
to get the ARV drugs.

187
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,478
We have six fully occupied AIDS
wards in this hospital, Dr. Carter.

188
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:17,681
Every patient in every ward
wants to be in my program.

189
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,295
Who would you like me to exclude so
I can take your mother from Bukavu?

190
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,435
Your AIDS drugs finally came.

191
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,096
The pharmacy needs you
to sign your credit card slip.

192
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,673
Great. Thanks.

193
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,434
Twelve hundred bucks.

194
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,602
Yep. Carter's paying me back.

195
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,613
Carter needs antiretroviral?
He get a stick or something?

196
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,684
- No. Patient.
- Well, say hello to him for me, will you?

197
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,650
- Why don't you write a note, stick it in.
- Okay.

198
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,316
Leave a little for
somebody else.

199
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,757
You're Kovac, right? Med
student needs you down the hall.

200
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,963
Call a pickup for
me, will you, Frank?

201
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:11,710
You get used to the heat. It's
the food. That's another matter.

202
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,971
It can't be any
hotter than Sudan.

203
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,412
Thank you, Charles.

204
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,012
- So you've volunteered before?
- Yeah. Every year for the last eight.

205
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,316
- What is that?
- Lasagna.

206
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,822
Made with potatoes?

207
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,658
Excellent. Halloween candy?

208
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,130
- Ah.
- Anything chocolate?

209
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:41,672
- Who's Elizabeth?
- She is a friend from work.

210
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,200
Friend?

211
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,641
Is she blond?

212
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,372
She's a redhead actually.

213
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,847
Are you in private
practice back in the States?

214
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,851
Yeah. I spent 15 years at
Women and Children's, OB ward.

215
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,818
Oh, yeah? I have a patient eight
months pregnant, HIV-positive.

216
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,654
Husband's end-stage. She's
got kids that are HIV-positive.

217
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,387
- Take a look?
- Sure. Anytime.

218
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,225
How about now?

219
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,037
How's her CD4 count? - 175.

220
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,106
But that should come
up with the ARV's.

221
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,372
Good heartbeat, Mommy. Strong.

222
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,605
And the ARV's cut the transmission
rate down to three or four percent.

223
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,343
So if she uses formula, that
cuts it down to one percent.

224
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,682
- Are you living in the refugee camp?
- Yes.

225
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,051
- And are you still breastfeeding?
- Yes.

226
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:34,388
Celine, you can't
breastfeed your new baby.

227
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,454
You could pass the
virus along in your milk.

228
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,724
We'll get you formula,
which is great stuff.

229
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,891
And that will help
keep your baby strong.

230
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,765
- My milk can make my baby sick?
- Absolutely.

231
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,065
Uh, doctor, can I speak
with you a moment?

232
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,209
You're doing great, Mommy.

233
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,901
Listen, she's gonna
have to breastfeed.

234
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,912
No. We get the formula
in the UNICEF packs.

235
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,073
It's powdered. You
mix it with water.

236
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,785
She's gonna have to get that
water from a lake or a river.

237
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,651
There's a 50 percent chance her baby's
gonna die from dysentery or cholera.

238
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:09,262
The three percent chance of contracting
HIV from breast milk, it's a bargain.

239
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,919
We'll get her bottled water.

240
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,792
Eight times a day for six
months? A year? Two years?

241
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,426
It's possible. GINNY:
Maybe. But it's not practical.

242
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,405
What do you expect?! Of course
they're going to start blowing things up.

243
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:26,774
Nationalism, tribalism. You
didn't figure it out with Vietnam?

244
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,505
No. We're slow learners.

245
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:33,745
Now you come begging Europe for help.
Soldiers, money. But not as partners, no.

246
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,446
You just want us to
legitimize your misadventures.

247
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,320
What can I say? I
voted for the other guy.

248
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,121
Is it always like this?

249
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,129
The conversation is turning
into something of a perennial.

250
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,465
If America is going
to insist on bombing...

251
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:47,927
Enough.

252
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,796
- If they're going...
- They get it!

253
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,302
We all get it!

254
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,808
Come on, let's dance.

255
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,945
Come on.

256
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,184
- Dance?
- Sure.

257
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,870
Where's your friend?

258
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,008
From the Red Cross?

259
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,209
ICRC, food convoy to Goma.

260
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,145
- And yours?
- Peter?

261
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,086
He's at a conference in Nairobi.

262
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:50,025
Something about currency
fluctuations in the capital market.

263
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,902
- How's your AIDS study coming?
- Fully enrolled. All 200.

264
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,873
Really? Great.

265
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,341
- What about your adherence rate?
- One hundred percent.

266
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,346
Wow.

267
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,421
We have this combination pill. So
patients only have to take two a day.

268
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,553
Really? In America, the
patients have to take seven.

269
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,427
Where are you from? I've
been trying to place your accent.

270
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,061
My father was Congolese.
My mother's French.

271
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,434
They met when he
was in school in Paris.

272
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,432
- Where were you raised?
- London, mostly.

273
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,542
But my mother remarried.

274
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,310
Moba in the summers with my dad.

275
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,681
What about you?

276
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,943
I was born and raised
in Chicago, Illinois.

277
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,452
The Windy City.

278
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,290
Have you ever been to America?

279
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,918
No.

280
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,563
But I've seen it in the movies.

281
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,569
You wanna dance?

282
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,429
I am terrible.

283
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,835
Good.

284
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,105
So am I.

285
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,284
All right.

286
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,482
- What's your most embarrassing moment?
- No, no. Not a chance.

287
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,149
Come on. I just told you mine.

288
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,454
It wasn't embarrassing
so much as stupid.

289
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,358
Come on. Give it up.

290
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,432
Uh... It involved
a lack of clothing.

291
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,206
- Thank God.
- Looks like we closed the place.

292
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,676
What? You're not gonna tell
me about how you got naked?

293
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,149
What happened...? What
happened to your patient?

294
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,650
The mother, HIV and the kids?

295
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,983
Celine? Oh, she's doing great.

296
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:02,185
- You got her to a VCT center?
- No. I got her on ARV's.

297
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,327
- Anti-retroviral drugs?
- Yeah.

298
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,899
Her CD4 is over 400.

299
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,695
Where'd you get the drugs?

300
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,532
I had a friend of mine...

301
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:17,006
write a prescription back
home and ship them over.

302
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,540
- You smuggled them in?
- No, no.

303
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,579
I used FedEx.

304
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,175
What?

305
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,014
What? She's doing great.

306
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:31,851
Drugs have to be registered and
approved by the Ministry of Health.

307
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,755
You didn't have the
resources to include her.

308
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,328
- AZT? 3TC?
- Yeah. And Nelfinavir.

309
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,522
And that costs you
$1000 a month?

310
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,430
Twelve hundred.

311
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,900
Where'd she get the money?

312
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,508
- Um, I paid for it.
- Yourself?

313
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,442
I could treat four
patients for a year...

314
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,208
with what you're spending
on your patient every month.

315
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:02,083
It took me two years to get all the
approvals necessary to import the drugs...

316
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,086
arrange the funding and staff.

317
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,852
And you're jeopardizing it by pulling
out your checkbook and sending them.

318
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:11,691
- How am I jeopardizing your work?
- It's not sustainable.

319
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,424
What happens to that poor
woman when you leave?

320
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,537
You gonna keep shipping her thousands of
dollars of drugs for the rest of her life?

321
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,064
I was planning on it, yeah.

322
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,275
And who's gonna monitor her progress,
make sure she remains compliant?

323
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,538
What if one of her kids
gets sick and she decides...

324
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,480
to split her meds with
the child? It happens!

325
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,415
Or if she moves back to Kivu?

326
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,783
Is your Mr. FedEx gonna
chase all over the Congo...

327
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,447
tracking down your one patient?

328
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,093
What happens to your patients
when your funding ends?

329
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,058
You cannot start a
patient on drugs...

330
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,596
without guaranteeing
you can maintain a supply.

331
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,233
- What? And you can guarantee a supply?
- Yes.

332
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,270
I'm trying to show my government
that ARV therapy works here.

333
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:57,240
And when they see our success, they'll
realize we can save millions of lives.

334
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,969
I'm just trying to save one.

335
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,444
One's not enough!

336
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,116
You want me to walk you home?

337
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,657
This is mild jaundice.

338
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,200
Three Fansidar tablets and tell her if
she's not feeling better, just come back.

339
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,866
Dr. John, Ms. Likasu is here
from the Ministry of Health.

340
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,705
- She was looking for your HIV patient.
- Celine?

341
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,347
She was quite insistent.

342
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:39,508
- Did you tell her where she was?
- She went to Angelique on the ward.

343
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,825
- What's going on?
- You shipped in drugs.

344
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,469
- Okay, sure.
- Okay.

345
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,200
Okay, what? What?

346
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,210
I'm enrolling Celine
in my pilot program.

347
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,213
- I thought you were full.
- Yeah, I was.

348
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,680
Thanks, Angelique.

349
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,014
So, what happened?

350
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:18,521
I met this rich American who can
afford to commit $15,000 a year...

351
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,354
to my study for
the next five years.

352
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,929
- You can afford that, can't you?
- Yeah, sure.

353
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,895
So that means I have funding...

354
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,434
for 40 additional participants and
your patient seemed like the start.

355
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,571
What about her two kids?

356
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,368
Don't push your luck, doctor.

357
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,671
Thank you.

358
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,129
I looked in the records
room and it's not there.

359
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,898
Yeah. Well, happy
Thanksgiving to you too, jack-off.

360
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,405
- Hey, did Detroit win?
- I have no freaking idea.

361
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,238
- What about Dallas?
- Don't make me come and smack you.

362
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,074
- Are those from Christmas?
- Last year?

363
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,217
- The year before. Dr. Greene.
- Which one's Dr. Greene?

364
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:21,912
I'll need a massive amount of
caffeine if I'm gonna make it to sunrise.

365
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,715
Here you go, Abby.

366
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,715
Ugh.

367
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,223
Shred it.

368
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,419
Look at this one.
That's definitely 2001.

369
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,155
- The Secret Santa party.
- Anybody hear from Carter?

370
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,095
He sent us a
postcard a month ago.

371
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,929
- Put that in the lounge.
- How's he doing?

372
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,731
I don't know.

373
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,301
Why did you come back?

374
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,607
Well, you were raised
in Paris, London?

375
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,618
After you got your degree, why
did you come back to the Congo?

376
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,352
My father was killed.

377
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,460
So I came back
to settle his affairs.

378
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,359
How was he killed?

379
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,797
He was on his way from...

380
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,166
Manono to Kabitena.

381
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,334
And his car was ambushed...

382
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,709
by rebels and CLF soldiers.

383
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,288
I'm so sorry.

384
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,361
He was an engineer.

385
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,992
And he worked 30 years...

386
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:47,005
trying to upgrade the water
supply in Kivu and Katanga.

387
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:53,645
But he was a Banyamulenge
driving in a Mai Mai area.

388
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,978
So they pulled him from his
car and shot him in the head.

389
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:08,319
He believed in the
goodness of people.

390
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,198
I came back for him.

391
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,888
- Here he is.
- Hey.

392
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,880
Need a helmet?

393
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,384
Probably.

394
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,789
What's the matter?

395
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:21,058
Celine didn't show up at the
clinic this morning for her testing.

396
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,238
So when was the
last time she came in?

397
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,467
Two weeks ago, just
after her husband died.

398
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,142
- And her lymphocyte count was still good?
- Yep. It was excellent.

399
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,306
Something must have happened.

400
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,418
She knows she's
supposed to be monitored.

401
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,111
So how are we gonna find her?

402
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:46,486
- She'll be with people from her village.
- How are we gonna find them?

403
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,989
We ask.

404
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,619
When did you first
notice he was sick?

405
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,955
- A week ago.
- Has he been coughing?

406
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,224
Yes. But nothing is coming out.

407
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,492
Any shortness of breath?

408
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,667
He cannot run.
He gets very tired.

409
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:35,171
I know I was supposed
to come to the clinic.

410
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,775
But I wanted to wait till
he was feeling much better.

411
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,044
I have been taking
my medicine every day.

412
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,149
- Hee.
- Hee.

413
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,478
- Hee.
- Hee.

414
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,312
Start him on high
dose trimethoprim sulfa.

415
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,687
Twenty milligrams per kilo
per day, divided Q six hours.

416
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,886
Prednisone. Ten milligrams twice
a day. How are we set for oxygen?

417
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,031
- Not good.
- Hold off on the O2 for now.

418
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,395
- Is it the AIDS?
- He has pneumocystis pneumonia.

419
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:06,902
It's an infection that can take hold
if the immune system is weakened.

420
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:08,404
Will he get better?

421
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,010
I hope so. We're gonna give
him medicine, see how he does.

422
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,543
He looks so small...

423
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,407
and sick.

424
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,085
I only slept with my husband.

425
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,087
No one else, ever.

426
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,831
How bad?

427
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:50,074
Well, if he gets through the
pneumonia, he's gonna need ARVs.

428
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,542
- Do you have the pediatric suspensions?
- No.

429
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,746
We could grind
up the adult tablets.

430
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,619
- Figure out the dosage for a 5-year-old.
- No.

431
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,563
- The little boy's gonna die.
- Yeah.

432
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,492
You can just stand
there, not do anything?

433
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,432
- You can let that happen...?
- What?!

434
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,402
I am doing something. I'm
proving drug therapy works...

435
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,099
so we can save 1000
little boys, 50,000.

436
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,245
- Then help me save this one!
- Don't you yell at me.

437
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,476
You go home. You
yell at your president.

438
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,812
You yell at your government. You
tell them that we need real money.

439
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,647
Not just these empty promises.

440
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,847
You tell them 6000 people
are dying out here every...

441
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,117
- Damn it!
- They have to do something about it.

442
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,841
Hey.

443
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,485
- How are you?
- Great.

444
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,820
Still mad?

445
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,124
I wasn't mad.

446
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,395
Well, Charles tells me
that you're gonna take...

447
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:18,333
a C-140 flight into Kinshasa to
get a couple more tons of rice.

448
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,166
No, it's MONUC's plane.
I'm just along for the ride.

449
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:29,141
It occurred to me that I might be able
to talk you into picking up a few things.

450
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:35,378
- Like what?
- Oh, Christmas decorations.

451
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,768
You know, tree, lights,
ornaments, tinsel.

452
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:40,522
Tinsel?

453
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:44,220
Santa suit, snow
globes, that sort of thing.

454
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,899
Oh, and a couple of
cylinders of oxygen.

455
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,502
- Oxygen?
- You know, if you can find any.

456
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,662
I made a list.

457
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,045
- Hey.
- Hey.

458
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,621
What are you doing?

459
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,553
Just wrapping a few
Christmas presents...

460
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,057
for some friends back home.

461
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,718
- Bangala.
- Hm.

462
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:20,093
- Hope you didn't pay too much for it.
- No, it was cheap. Fifty bucks.

463
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,063
What?

464
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,896
I'm just kidding. It was three.

465
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,597
- How was your day?
- Oh. Endless.

466
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,043
Who's Abby?

467
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,540
She's, you know, a friend.

468
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,277
Really?

469
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,384
I hope she still is.

470
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,249
Why? You jealous?

471
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,094
A bit.

472
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,331
I think I might be pregnant.

473
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:13,982
What?

474
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:20,183
How? Uh... When did...?

475
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,422
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hm.

476
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,567
You angry?

477
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,333
No.

478
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,609
You're upset?

479
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,976
No.

480
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,452
You?

481
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,451
I thought I would be, but...

482
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,226
It's strange. I think
I might be happy.

483
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:10,640
- Do you want to have our baby?
- I don't know. Do you?

484
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,641
You first.

485
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,815
I've got my program.

486
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,145
And we barely know each
other. It's been, what, six hours?

487
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,755
Six weeks.

488
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,760
Oh, God. I'm really in trouble.

489
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,854
- Getting bad out there?
- Yes.

490
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:02,483
- Merry Christmas Eve, huh?
- If you say so.

491
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,262
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey, Valerie.

492
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,762
- How are you doing?
- Good.

493
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,368
- Just waiting for the holidays.
- Yeah, me too. Except I got to work.

494
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,935
Too bad.

495
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,765
- You waiting for Mike?
- Yeah.

496
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,601
He's supposed to be
off in a couple minutes.

497
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:21,337
- All right then, merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

498
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,259
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Hey, what the hell is that?

499
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,945
Come on, that's it.

500
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,952
- Hey, what is that?
- A little bit of Sikh rap.

501
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,714
A little Sikh rap.

502
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,121
- Are you ready to go?
- No, keep dancing.

503
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,783
She's good.

504
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,630
I found six tanks.

505
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,794
The pilot couldn't handle the extra weight.
He only let me bring on these three.

506
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,168
Bilateral interstitial
infiltrates and a high LDH?

507
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,536
Yeah. We've got him on
IV Bactrim and steroids.

508
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,976
Pulse ox on O2 is only 78.

509
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,377
Is he not getting any better?

510
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,485
He should be resting more
comfortably now with the oxygen.

511
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,488
How about the other stuff?

512
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,320
Dumped them in the hallway.

513
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,928
Yeah? Decorations?
Ornaments? That kind of thing?

514
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,827
Someone offered to sell me
a fruitcake. You like fruitcake?

515
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:17,162
You didn't get any, like,
decorations, or tinsel or garland?

516
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,429
Hey, I did the best I could do.

517
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,370
Whoa!

518
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,941
- All right.
- What's that?

519
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,670
- Oh, it's fantastic.
- Where did you get all this stuff?

520
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,839
American embassy. A bunch
of their old junk in the basement.

521
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,608
Oh!

522
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:38,683
- Friends back home sent all this?
- Yeah. The ER staff where I worked.

523
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:42,885
I asked everybody to get
one gift, nothing over $20.

524
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,724
And looks like
everybody chipped in.

525
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,096
How are we gonna
know what to give whom?

526
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,132
They were supposed...

527
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:54,033
Yeah, they wrote on the back,
see? Appropriate age, boy, girl.

528
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,198
- A few in here for the adults too.
- Package in here for you, John.

529
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,142
This one's heavy.

530
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,416
John...

531
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,549
is that some kind of doll?

532
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,051
What'd you get?

533
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:13,991
It is a card from work
that everybody signed.

534
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,119
What's "Martin,
Hall and Jacobs?"

535
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:21,391
That is a law firm back home.

536
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,995
It's marked "Urgent."

537
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,468
Oh, my God.

538
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,368
What?

539
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,099
- Dr. Romano died.
- Was he a friend?

540
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:35,574
Um... No. No, not really.

541
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,153
It's beautiful, isn't it?

542
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,113
Yeah.

543
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,519
It really is.

544
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:00,005
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

545
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,147
Merry Christmas.

546
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,366
- Okay. 3-year-old boy.
- 3-year-old...

547
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,232
- Do you want another?
- 3-year-old boy.

548
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,031
You know what?

549
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,806
Keep going. I'll be right back.

550
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,599
He hasn't woken up this morning.

551
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,769
His oxygen level is too low.

552
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,078
Will he ever wake up?

553
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,346
No, I don't think so.

554
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,533
I brought some presents
for your kids from the party.

555
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:40,364
This is for your little girl.

556
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:49,008
This is for the baby.
And this is for Lamia.

557
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,113
Shall I open it for him?

558
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,080
It's a truck.

559
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,636
Thank you.

560
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,084
Merry Christmas.

561
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,422
Merry Christmas.

562
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:11,596
They were mine
when I was little.

563
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,599
- Thank you.
- There's more.

564
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,744
I want you to come back
to the States with me.

565
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,549
I want our baby to
be born in America.

566
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,165
I have to go back.

567
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:55,269
That package, the envelope from
the law firm you asked me about?

568
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,376
I used to get them every few
months. Then every few weeks.

569
00:42:58,543 --> 00:42:59,772
Now it's every few days.

570
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:04,241
It's just something that
I have to take care of.

571
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,441
Are you in some kind of trouble?

572
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:10,519
No.

573
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,590
No, it's nothing
like that. Um...

574
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:19,392
My grandmother died nine months
ago, and I have to settle her estate.

575
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,134
It's just some financial
things that I have to deal with.

576
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,532
I kind of ran away
after she died.

577
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:27,800
Ran away from what?

578
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,910
Myself.

579
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,572
Responsibility. Um...

580
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,815
It's hard to explain.

581
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,911
I wasn't happy.

582
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,289
Something was
missing in my life.

583
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,961
I can't leave.

584
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,326
My work is here.

585
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,292
It's my life, you know?

586
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:57,996
I know.

587
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:02,503
I don't expect you to leave forever.
Come for a couple weeks, a month, two.

588
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,474
Meet my friends.

589
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:09,004
See my life there.

590
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,415
You'd get the
best prenatal care.

591
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:17,284
Your program's up and
running. You got a great staff.

592
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:19,822
They'll be okay
without you for a while.

593
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,085
How long do you have to stay?

594
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,525
I don't know.

595
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,025
But we'll figure
it out together.

596
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,971
What was missing in my life...

597
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,939
isn't missing anymore.
