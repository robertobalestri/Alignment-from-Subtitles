1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,905
- What are you doing?
- Cut it out!

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,719
- What are you doing?
- He just grabbed my ass.

4
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,454
What are the odds we're
gonna find someone better?

5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,918
We should spend either all
our time together or none at all...

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,425
and I'm kind of leaning
towards none at all.

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,418
- Sign it.
- This goes up to Human Resources?

8
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:21,988
Stays with me, until I have a fat
enough file to pull the trigger. Bang.

9
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,425
Sinus tach, 130.

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,927
BP's up, 220/140.

11
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,090
- Come on. He's gonna blow an O-ring.
- Let's try Nipride.

12
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,362
- Oh, how did the paramedics miss this?
- Cocaine?

13
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,971
- Could be. ABBY:
Hold the Nipride.

14
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,937
He needs a beta-blocker.
Five of metropolol, IV push.

15
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,542
Heart rate's up to 140.

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,701
- Metropolol's in.
- He's seizing.

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,107
Okay, two of Ativan.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,442
What are the physiological
effects of cocaine?

19
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,709
- A sympathetic stimulant.
- Alpha or beta?

20
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,876
Both. SAM: V-tach.

21
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,488
- Starting compressions.
- Uh, charge to 200.

22
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,284
Check for pulse
with compressions.

23
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,423
Clear.

24
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,724
V-fib.

25
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,296
Charge to 300.

26
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,797
- Amp of epi.
- Beta-blocker made him worse.

27
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,629
Clear.

28
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,161
No change.

29
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,904
- 360. Maybe he's allergic.
- I doubt it.

30
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,905
By blocking beta, you
left alpha unopposed.

31
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,010
BP's high and his
brain's bleeding.

32
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,306
Clear.

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,312
Asystole.

34
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,280
- Amp of atropine.
- What should she give?

35
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,080
- Phentolamine, esmolol.
- Gold dot for your forehead.

36
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,156
- I've seen beta-blockers work.
- You have nursing experience...

37
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,520
meaning you can handle
90 percent of patients.

38
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,356
- Also means you might kill the others.
- He's not dead yet.

39
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,657
- Another amp of epi.
- Forget it. That's it. Stop compressions.

40
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,007
Just another dead junkie.

41
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,610
Congratulations, Abby. You
managed to kill the practice dummy.

42
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,846
Okay, reset for
the next student.

43
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,039
Shame we have
to work the holiday.

44
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,370
- You got family in town?
- No.

45
00:02:57,144 --> 00:03:00,273
Your overdose was harder than
my dialysis patient with hyperkalemia.

46
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,849
- I need the room to hold an ICU admit.
- Sorry, bad MVA coming in.

47
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,748
- Where do I put him?
- Anywhere, long as it's in the hallway.

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,389
- Come on.
- Can't you just get me some pills?

49
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,890
That wouldn't be safe. Mr. Garland
has pneumonia with hypoxia.

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,619
You need IV antibiotics.

51
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,855
I need to be with my
family for Thanksgiving.

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,261
They can come
and visit you here.

53
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,561
- How was the mock code?
- Fine.

54
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,068
- So Romano humiliated you?
- I looked like an idiot.

55
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,603
He does that to everyone.

56
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,434
Or maybe I just don't get it.

57
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,599
You'll catch on. It
just takes a little time.

58
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,245
Stay up there, turkey. Come on.

59
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,109
- Son of a bitch.
- Better call the coroner on that one.

60
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,444
The damn night shift
was supposed to do this.

61
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,611
- I'm just in charge of the potluck.
- Well, my yams are in the lounge.

62
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,314
- How many admits are we holding?
- You don't wanna know.

63
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,255
No, there's a
sandwich in the fridge.

64
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,395
And don't answer the
door until I get home.

65
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,292
All right. See you soon.

66
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,488
Everything okay?

67
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,462
I had to leave Alex
home for the day.

68
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,465
- He'll be all right.
- It's just until 3.

69
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,161
I finally get to make my kid
a real Thanksgiving dinner.

70
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,806
Most years I work.

71
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,340
That's Lily's.

72
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,944
- Thought it was the potluck.
- There's a coffee club.

73
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,479
Yeah, you have
to pay every month.

74
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,607
- Sorry. How much?
- It's a nurse's coffee club.

75
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,846
Okay, time to stamp out disease.

76
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,819
- Hand lac for Coop.
- Hit me again.

77
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,322
Oh, one per customer.

78
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,085
Asthma for Neela.

79
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,820
- Vag bleeding for Abby.
- Lovely.

80
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,522
And "bugs are crawling
under my skin" for Lester.

81
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,997
- Cool.
- Pratt, will you take incoming trauma?

82
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,636
Yeah. Hey, Frank.

83
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,136
What's up with the stupid
parade? Put the game on.

84
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,500
Kickoff isn't till 12:30.

85
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,871
My brother-in-law is marching with
the Brundy County Sheriff's Posse.

86
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,944
Oh, yeah, what's
that? Some sort of clan?

87
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,014
- Morris, what do you think you're doing?
- Picking up a patient.

88
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,674
You just skipped over
bloody diarrhea for eye pain.

89
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,342
- Smile!
- Frank.

90
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,979
Sorry, I didn't think this old thing
would work. It was in last year's box.

91
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,956
Couple of shots left. What
do you figure is on there?

92
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,322
Romano and Weaver in
a compromising position.

93
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,023
I'll get double prints
then, just in case.

94
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,532
October 14th.

95
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,296
Six weeks and three days.

96
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,839
- So I'm still pregnant?
- We'll check an ultrasound.

97
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,533
How heavy is the spotting?

98
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,702
Couple of pads so far.

99
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,212
Are you taking any medications?

100
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,717
Prenatal vitamins,
AZT, 3TC, indinavir.

101
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,913
- You're HIV-positive?
- Yeah, for 10 years.

102
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,717
Never shared a needle,
no blood transfusions.

103
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,719
Just a loser boyfriend with
too many chicks on the side.

104
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,727
- Anyone here with you today?
- My fiancÃ©.

105
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,832
He's driving up from Iowa City.

106
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,524
This guy's the real deal.

107
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,000
- Abby?
- Excuse me.

108
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,533
- Three sick calls for night shift.
- Right, sick. On Thanksgiving.

109
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,507
Call the registry.

110
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,045
We really need someone
who knows the floor.

111
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,743
No.

112
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,181
No way. I'm on all
day as a med student.

113
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,049
I only work nursing
shifts on weekends.

114
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,919
I can let you off your rotation
at 5 so you can take a nap.

115
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,054
- Can you take one for the team?
- No.

116
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,256
Fine. Only if you
can't find anybody else.

117
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,402
- Okay.
- Thanks.

118
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,965
So you're not
using the eye drops?

119
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,572
My nephew gave me
an herbal medicine.

120
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,102
What, some sort of
homeopathic crap?

121
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:21,112
- Morris, come on, man. Trauma's here.
- I think it's called Kona Gold.

122
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:27,076
- Morris, grab some me some 4-by-4's.
- Uh, yeah.

123
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,382
Okay, this is pretty deep.

124
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,287
I wanted to use the carving knife.
She made me use the other thing.

125
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,158
- It's from Germany.
- Morris!

126
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,264
Morgan Westbrook,
collision with intrusion.

127
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,797
BP 80 palp, pelvic fracture.

128
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,265
O2 sats, 98. No
significant head trauma.

129
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,427
Didn't get altered until
he dropped pressure.

130
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,472
On the phone to his doctor when
we pulled up. Drives a Bentley.

131
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,305
Nice. Okay, prime the rapid
infuser. Come on. Let's go.

132
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,969
Here we go. On my count.

133
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,848
How do we tell pelvic
bleeding from intra-abdominal?

134
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,816
- CT scan.
- If the patient's unstable?

135
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,184
- Uh, ultrasound?
- No, suprapubic mini-lap and DPL.

136
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,859
Which you can assist on.
Pupils equal and reactive.

137
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,996
- We got some sewing for you too.
- Can you two handle this?

138
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,425
Oh, I should hope so.

139
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,326
I need to get back to
my glaucoma patient.

140
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,162
- This is a primo case.
- I'm worried about angle closure.

141
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,668
- No hemotympanum.
- I need to check eye pressures.

142
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,670
Equal breath sounds.

143
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,174
- Is he squeamish?
- No, just stupid.

144
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,338
- Frank, where are the nurses?
- With patients.

145
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,711
I need a chaperone.
Sam, help me with a pelvic?

146
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,443
- After I hang blood.
- Can we bring a few patients back?

147
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,111
Eventually.

148
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,814
I've done solo pelvics. I
could help, if you'd like.

149
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,619
- That's okay. Thanks.
- No, we are boarding five ICU players...

150
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,559
and it's total gridlock.

151
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,699
I'll give you an hour.

152
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,796
Mr. Garland, looks like you
might be with us for a while.

153
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,133
Not a problem.

154
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,510
- What's that?
- Turducken.

155
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,872
What?

156
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,537
It's a chicken stuffed in
a duck stuffed in a turkey.

157
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,150
- Want a taste?
- Maybe later.

158
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,183
Sorry.

159
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,559
No, no, it wasn't
you. Just a cramp.

160
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:19,221
There's a little bit more
bleeding than I expected.

161
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,894
And the cervix is open.

162
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,864
Meaning?

163
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,100
With the cervix open, you can't
maintain a pregnancy. I'm sorry.

164
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,902
I had a feeling.

165
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,748
I woke up, and something...

166
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,082
Something was strange.

167
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,620
We've been trying
to get pregnant...

168
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,919
For how long?

169
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,054
Loren?

170
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,755
Loren?

171
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,927
Damn it.

172
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,275
<i>- Can I help you?</i>
- This is Abby. Who's at Admit?

173
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,473
<i>- Just me and the food.</i>
- Well, my patient's bleeding out.

174
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,277
<i>I'll see who I can rustle up.</i>

175
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,826
Could use a little help here!

176
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,730
- Systolic's 110 after two units.
- Spontaneous eye movements.

177
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,297
- Mr. Westbrook?
- Where am I?

178
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,097
You're at County General.
You got clipped by a tow truck.

179
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,297
Try not to move your leg.

180
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,268
- What do you think you're doing?
- Calling my lawyer.

181
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,313
- I'd rather not be treated here.
- May have internal bleeding.

182
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,244
I'll take my chances.

183
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,180
Your phone interferes
with our equipment.

184
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,685
- Hello. It's Morgan Westbrook...
- Hey, I said no cell phones!

185
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:53,423
Hello, Mr. Westbrook. I'm Robert
Romano, chief of Emergency Services.

186
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,028
I just got off the phone with
our CEO, Peter Fenwick.

187
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,633
Oh, Peter was in my class at Wharton.
- Yeah, so I heard.

188
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,497
I think your employees need
a lesson in customer service.

189
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,367
This one stole my phone.

190
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,371
Well, he's not long
for this hospital.

191
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,172
We're taking him up to CT.

192
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,313
Great. After a few
tests, we'll transfer.

193
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,175
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

194
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,544
You are in excellent
hands with Dr. Corday.

195
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,449
Believe me, I envy
you. Hey. Come here.

196
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,350
That guy is the biggest real
estate developer in Chicago.

197
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,358
- More like the biggest prick.
- When you get a VIP, sometimes...

198
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,859
You treat everybody the same.

199
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,998
- He's not stable.
- If he has no organ injuries, I say he is.

200
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,691
You're making a mistake.
Could have ongoing hemorrhage.

201
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,463
My only mistake was to
allow you to practice medicine.

202
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,368
You'll compromise patient
care to suck up to some rich guy?

203
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,907
We will determine if he's
able to be transferred...

204
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,102
I'm not signing
any transfer papers.

205
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,077
You don't have to. You're
no longer on the case.

206
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,344
Great. My name won't be on
your malpractice suit when he dies.

207
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,545
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't work here.

208
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,213
- Right.
- No, I'm serious, Pratt.

209
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,425
You just pissed me
off for the last time.

210
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,693
Second liter's in.
Pressure's 100/60.

211
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,434
Hey, Loren.

212
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,769
Gave us a little scare.

213
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,935
You passed out from blood loss.

214
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,444
That doesn't sound good.

215
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,844
There can be retained
tissue that keeps bleeding.

216
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,282
- Hemoglobin's 9.4.
- Okay, type and cross for two.

217
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,620
- How do you stop that?
- With a D and C.

218
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,782
We clean things out, and
then you're back to normal.

219
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,963
Abby.

220
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:45,070
Let's get you a fresh gown.
- I'll be right back.

221
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,675
There is no retained tissue.
She has multiple uterine fibroids.

222
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:53,336
It won't be as simple as a D and C.
You should be careful what you say.

223
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,014
- Most of the time, it's retained...
- Not in her case.

224
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:03,919
Transfuse two units and call GYN.
We have to get this bleeding to stop.

225
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:12,026
Next time, wear oven mitts when
you take out the turkey, okay?

226
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,996
Oh, there.

227
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,726
Hey, Frank, what's the score?

228
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,894
First quarter, 0-0.

229
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,664
Oh, you're back from the scan?

230
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,832
Bilateral pubic rami fractures
and a shattered acetabulum.

231
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,875
- Ouch.
- We got Todd Corbett on standby...

232
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,273
at the Mayo Clinic.

233
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,610
Hey, you think I'll be able to
run the marathon next October?

234
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,216
I'd say there's a good chance.

235
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,353
That guy could put Humpty
Dumpty back together again.

236
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,854
Be right there. What part of "you're
off the case" don't you understand?

237
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,220
Looking out for the
patient's best interests.

238
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,021
Did you send off another CBC?

239
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,392
- Keep it up, Pratt.
- What, another letter in my file?

240
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,626
We're meeting with
Weaver and Anspaugh.

241
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,566
- On Thanksgiving?
- That's right.

242
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,698
Well, I guess it saves
you from spending it alone.

243
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,535
- Did you call Psych about your bug guy?
- No, he really has scabies.

244
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,147
My asthma girl's worse.

245
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,647
Call RT for heliox.

246
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,548
Lewis, get coverage for Pratt's shifts
starting tomorrow. Complex laceration?

247
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,916
I repaired the extensor
tendon with a figure of eight.

248
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,113
Looks nice.

249
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,755
Very tidy.

250
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,952
Abby, where's the abductor
pollicis brevis insert?

251
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,724
- You know its innervation?
- Smile!

252
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,568
My patient needs blood.

253
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,295
Put your dirty clothes in the
hamper. Check your sugar?

254
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,906
Timoptic, one drop
two times a day.

255
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,667
What about the other stuff?

256
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,903
You don't need it.
It's illegal. Just say no.

257
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,241
- Just say no to what?
- Altar boys.

258
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,077
Look at this rack.

259
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,311
- Do I have to?
- We gotta treat patients in Triage again.

260
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,751
Meet them and street them.
- Not so fast, Luka.

261
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,754
Couple of problems in the hall.

262
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,757
Jeffries spiked to 104.

263
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,954
Tylenol, blood cultures and a gram
of cefotetan. When can he go up?

264
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,964
- Fifth in line for Med-Surg.
- Mrs. Paulson's now altered.

265
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,932
- Two tele admits in front of her.
- How are you doing, ma'am?

266
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,198
Thirty cc's of lactulose
and draw an ammonia level.

267
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,933
And Mr. Garland's BP
is down to 90 systolic.

268
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,203
Start dopamine at five mics.

269
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:09,748
- Sorry for the delay, sir.
- That's okay. I like to people-watch.

270
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,376
- Can you help us at Triage?
- No.

271
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,953
- Why not?
- You gave me an hour's worth of orders.

272
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,953
This is ridiculous.
No beds, no staff...

273
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,456
and we're doing the
work of the entire hospital.

274
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,958
Yep, welcome to my world.

275
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,290
I need hard restraints
for Mr. Garland.

276
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,196
- Garland? He's a pussycat.
- The kind that lock.

277
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,799
Have you ever had any
problems with general anesthesia?

278
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,201
Hepatitis?

279
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,900
No, they check my liver
enzymes on the triple cocktail.

280
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,874
I need you to sign
a consent form...

281
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,482
for exploratory surgery
and a possible hysterectomy.

282
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,311
- Hysterectomy?
- Only as a last resort.

283
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,920
Nobody said anything
about a hysterectomy.

284
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,821
It may be our only option if
we can't control the bleeding.

285
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,594
No. I wanna have kids.

286
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:00,096
- I appreciate that.
- Dr. Coburn, do you have a minute?

287
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,365
Hang two more units and
check another hemoglobin.

288
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,238
Um, why do a
hysterectomy for fibroids?

289
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,937
- It might save her life.
- There are other options.

290
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,048
I don't justify my
approach to a nurse.

291
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,515
- I'm a fourth-year med student.
- We consent for all contingencies.

292
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,086
Are you even going to
attempt embolization?

293
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,814
That would take hours.

294
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,819
Okay, I'm not sure
I'm getting your point.

295
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,689
She's bleeding out.

296
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,353
She's on her fourth unit,
not stable for embolization.

297
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,023
And maybe she would be
if she wasn't HIV-positive?

298
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,034
- What are you accusing me of?
- Let me settle this catfight.

299
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,139
- Abby, you're wrong.
- I'm discussing uterus-sparing procedures.

300
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,070
- On an HIV-positive woman?
- Thank you, I can handle this.

301
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,043
- She wants to have a baby.
- Maybe this is God saying, "Bad idea."

302
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,047
With a low viral load,
transmission's less than 3 percent.

303
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,048
And the kid'll be
motherless by age 10.

304
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:59,425
I'll attempt a myomectomy,
but I can't make any promises.

305
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,565
Rotator-cuff tear.

306
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,568
I thought it was a
game of touch football.

307
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,730
My sister-in-law
doesn't like to lose.

308
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,106
- Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Lewis.
- Excuse me.

309
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,769
Uh, thank you.

310
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,576
Don't thank me. Thank
some dead guy from Mercy.

311
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,116
- Very romantic.
- So you in the mood...

312
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,083
for some late-night pumpkin pie?

313
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,017
- Um, you know what? I'm beat.
- I'll bring the whipped cream.

314
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,029
- Maybe another time.
- You okay?

315
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,392
- Yeah, I'm just tired.
- Of me?

316
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,967
GSW to the face en route.

317
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,297
Morris, you're with me.

318
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,965
Talk to you later.

319
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,105
Two liters NC, TKO the saline.

320
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,509
Five-minute ETA on the
private chopper. I'm Chuck.

321
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,149
Dr. Hewitt from Northwestern.
I'll be flying with you.

322
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,944
Hands inside the car, man.

323
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,485
I appreciate everything
you've done, Dr. Romano.

324
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,714
- My pleasure.
- You coming up to the copter?

325
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,950
I'd like to, but as you can see,
we are completely swamped.

326
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,153
- I don't know how you do it, Robert.
- I guess it's just my calling.

327
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,822
Thanks a lot. Take
care. Have a good flight.

328
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,195
Thank you.

329
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,132
Hold that elevator.

330
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,204
So you still think
there's a chance?

331
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,965
Yeah, I do. A good one. - Abby.

332
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,541
Mrs. Marshall is praying
to the porcelain god again.

333
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,644
Uh, okay.

334
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,804
- Reglan and Tagamet.
- My fiancÃ©'s coming to the ER.

335
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:33,242
Okay, I'll bring him up, and I'm
gonna scrub in, make sure you're okay.

336
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,054
This is for painkillers.

337
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,254
Keep them. After 10 years of
marriage, I'm immune to pain.

338
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,023
- Helium gets deeper into the lungs.
- I won't float away?

339
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,532
No, but you may talk funny.

340
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,501
- Frank, Pedes ICU have a bed yet?
- In your dreams.

341
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,164
- Hey, chow line's open.
- I think you forgot something.

342
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,741
- What?
- Emesis basins.

343
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,775
- Shouldn't you be on the roof?
- No.

344
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,345
Mr. Moneybags left his
Rolex in the Trauma Room.

345
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,779
- Have one of the nurses take it up.
- They're busy.

346
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,186
Hey, Indira, take
that up to the helipad.

347
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,380
- How do I get there?
- I don't blame you for being scared.

348
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,118
The last thing you need is
to lose another limb up there.

349
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,585
Come on, I'll take you up.

350
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,357
- Someone stole my medicine.
- Talk to the hand.

351
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,058
- What kind of medicine?
- For my glaucoma.

352
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,693
- Who was your doctor?
- Young guy, red hair and goatee.

353
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,306
GSW to the mid-face.
Where the hell is Morris?

354
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,785
So about tonight. It's okay
that I'm coming for dinner?

355
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,051
- What?
- Alex invited me.

356
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,726
- What is this?
- Septic pneumonia patient.

357
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,891
- We don't have any beds.
- Neither do we.

358
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,663
- You said they accepted him.
- You have to call report.

359
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:02,798
Here is your report: 72-year-old
pneumonia patient on cefotaxime...

360
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,412
five mics of dopamine
and six liters of O2.

361
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,605
- He might leave AMA.
- What are you doing?

362
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,044
Take it easy.

363
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,350
He's a troublemaker.

364
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,747
- This is really stupid.
- You have more nurses.

365
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,445
We can't take extra patients.

366
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,182
Why not? We do it all the time.

367
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,625
Now you can't send him back.

368
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,113
Are you coming?

369
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,015
Dr. Romano?

370
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,127
Here, take it.

371
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,130
- Patient forgot his watch.
- Thank you.

372
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,631
- Keep your head down.
- I know the drill.

373
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,663
This isn't your flight.

374
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,466
Dispatch sent me.

375
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,834
- Only room for two attendants.
- Me and the doc.

376
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,171
No, I have to go. Insurance
requirement. She's off the flight.

377
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,278
Hey!

378
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,720
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.

379
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,018
- Give me that. MORRIS:
It's not what you think.

380
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:05,187
Get your ass inside, sit down at Admit
and do not move until I come get you.

381
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,417
The strap is caught.

382
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,220
- Fine. Just call the nursing supervisor.
- You're not helping to solve the problem.

383
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,591
No!

384
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,180
Open up four ORs and get
every surgeon down here.

385
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,445
<i>- Three criticals out here.</i>
- Copy that. Mike?

386
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,317
- Yo.
- O2 and IVs outside. Let's go.

387
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,219
Lester, we need backboards, man.

388
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,553
- Dr. Pratt? NEELA:
From the roof.

389
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,286
Morris, get busy. - I can't.

390
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,365
- Decreased breath sounds.
- Weak carotid pulse. What's open?

391
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,300
- Trauma 2.
- Chest tube, ET and two large-bore IVs.

392
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,336
- Send X-ray for a portable.
- Set up a Thora-Seal?

393
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,476
No, no. I need you to
triage. Go. We got this. Go.

394
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:00,477
- Neela, grab a box.
- What is it?

395
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,514
Mass-casualty bins
and lots of morphine.

396
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,980
How much longer?

397
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,642
- Soon as I get this. What happened?
- Helicopter crash.

398
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,720
- Up on the roof?
- In the bay.

399
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,380
- Any survivors?
- I don't know.

400
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,991
Find out. Go!

401
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,525
I closed us to internal disasters.
- What should I do?

402
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,995
Grab this gurney.

403
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,831
Okay. Put one of
these on every patient.

404
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:27,235
Fill in vitals, injury and
tear off the triage category.

405
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,170
- Morris!
- Romano told me to wait here.

406
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,778
Green for minor, yellow, delayed,
red, immediate, black, dead.

407
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,278
Green and yellow stay
in Chairs. Bring back red.

408
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,245
- What about black?
- Cover with a sheet.

409
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,884
- Where should I start?
- Anywhere.

410
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,020
We need two more gurneys.

411
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,052
How bad is it?

412
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,264
- You okay?
- Just a little dizzy.

413
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,239
Backboard!

414
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,650
- Did they pull anyone out?
- No. Meet Reina Flores.

415
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,883
Came in for heart failure,
and now she needs ortho.

416
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,956
It hurts quite a bit.

417
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,886
Abby, morphine.

418
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,397
- What about him?
- I'm fine. Take care of her.

419
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,798
- Chest pains, broken ribs. MAN:
Abdominal pain and weak pulse.

420
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,001
Abby, I need four of morphine.

421
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,109
Susan, you should go
inside. We got this covered.

422
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:44,182
No, her lungs are wet.
She needs a nitro spray...

423
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:47,649
40 of Lasix and dopamine
to keep her systolic above 90.

424
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,452
Are you all right, dear?

425
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,818
Yeah, it's just the smoke.

426
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,288
Hey, get me out of here!

427
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,597
- Get me out of this!
- You're okay, Mr. Garland.

428
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,938
- We have to move patients to the ER.
- No, they'll be swamped.

429
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,873
- We can treat them here.
- I'll call down for help.

430
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,475
No. The phones are dead.

431
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,272
- Get him to the other side.
- I can't find the key.

432
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,381
You're gonna be okay, ma'am.

433
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,983
Not if I don't make it to my
granddaughter's wedding.

434
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,619
- When's that?
- Two weeks.

435
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,516
Hypotensive with a rigid belly.

436
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,157
- Call Corday.
- Blunt chest, good vitals.

437
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,656
- Okay.
- How is my wife?

438
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,021
- Who's in charge?
- Uh, Dr. Lewis.

439
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,653
Right here.

440
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,228
The fire's just about
out. I got nothing for you.

441
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,732
But I got four for the coroner.

442
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,804
You know, Luka's on. I
can get him to cover for you.

443
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,338
No.

444
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,477
Abby, respiratory
arrest in Curtain 1.

445
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:53,141
- Hey, nurse, I'm chained to the wall here.
- Double up the patients, two per slot.

446
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,982
- I need some help over here.
- Get an E cylinder before you move them.

447
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,921
The fire melted her ET
tube. I have to reintubate.

448
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,754
Burned her central line too.

449
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,520
Come on, get me
loose. Get me loose.

450
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,393
- Here you go, 8-0.
- Not ready for the tube yet.

451
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,660
You wanted to intubate.

452
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:12,066
I think she aspirated
the end into her lungs.

453
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,706
- I need something to fish it out.
- You want a McGill?

454
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,899
Keep pressure on
it. I'll find something.

455
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,243
Somebody help!

456
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,548
Ready with backboard and splint.
- One more time.

457
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,379
How are you doing, Reina?

458
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:31,615
Better than the poor
souls in that helicopter.

459
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,927
- Pulse ox down to 88.
- Put her up to 10 liters.

460
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,564
- Susan.
- Kerry.

461
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,221
Susan, are you okay?

462
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,391
- Were you hurt?
- No, no. I'm fine.

463
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,594
Okay, who are the
other Attendings?

464
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,103
Uh, Luka and Romano. I
don't know where they are.

465
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,441
Can't get tied up with a patient.
Gotta keep your eye on the big picture.

466
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,873
Chuck's on the chopper.

467
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,976
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- She's more hypoxic.

468
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,380
- How's your breathing, Reina?
- We're having 212 wedding guests.

469
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,076
Can you imagine?

470
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,253
- She's altered. Needs an airway.
- Both traumas going to the OR.

471
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,914
- Stay with Lewis.
- Flail chest.

472
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,753
Okay, Trauma 2 with me.
- Got it.

473
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:12,387
Abby, you and Pratt take
the yellows to Exam 3.

474
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,056
Pulse ox dropped
to 88 on five liters.

475
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,729
- Is there blood in the belly?
- That's my wife.

476
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,895
We're taking her up
to the OR for an ex-lap.

477
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,166
- Berta. WEAVER:
She's in good hands.

478
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,071
- Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Weaver.
- You too.

479
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,905
Didn't get past the relish tray.

480
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,309
Tough one. Had to
tube this lady on her side.

481
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,443
Hey, Pratt, you're with us.

482
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,518
- Know how to dÃ©bride?
- I've done it once.

483
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,983
- Let's go.
- What happened?

484
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,622
- I don't know.
- Bad concussion.

485
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,087
- Neuro checks Q 15.
- I fell to my hand.

486
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,978
- You lifted patients like that?
- Yes.

487
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,290
- You are one tough <i>muchacha.</i>
- Need a doctor here!

488
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,954
- All right.
- Through-and-through penetrating neck.

489
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,997
I tubed him for an
expanding hematoma.

490
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,261
On the roof? Weren't
you the flight nurse?

491
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,132
- Supposed to be.
- Lily, Trauma 1.

492
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,171
Five hundred cc's in.

493
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,969
You started a line? CHUCK:
Yeah, in case he needed blood.

494
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,874
- Is that Mel?
- Yeah, type and cross for six...

495
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,174
lateral C-spine, and let's
get Surgery down here.

496
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,481
- Nice and easy.
- CO2 detector is yellow.

497
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,118
- We need to tube you too?
- I thought he was dead.

498
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,396
How long until we check an ABG?

499
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:26,231
Baby, I had to tube this guy, and
there was no suction... Whoa, hey.

500
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,842
- It's not that big a deal.
- I thought you were on the chopper.

501
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,671
Brought their own flight
nurse. Bitch wouldn't let me fly.

502
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,972
That bitch saved your life.
- Dr. Lewis!

503
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,343
- Multifocal PVCs.
- I know, I know.

504
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,250
I thought you were dead.

505
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,254
Hey, hey. I scraped
my back a little, see?

506
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,491
Okay.

507
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,000
- McGill won't fit through.
- All we have.

508
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,829
- Need something thinner.
- Like what?

509
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,766
Anything.

510
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,668
- Dr. Kovac, I need you over here.
- Where are your doctors?

511
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,570
Coming from home.
It's Thanksgiving.

512
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,940
- I'm so late. Gotta call a neighbor.
- Can we focus on this?

513
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,046
Curved vascular clamp.

514
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,452
- Get ready with the ET tube.
- Tube her fast. Sats are dropping.

515
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,601
- Bag her.
- This guy needs the OR.

516
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,169
If we still have one.

517
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,941
Keep pressure on the liver.

518
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,580
- Where are you going?
- To the OR. We need Vicryl mesh.

519
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,272
Okay, and bring a surgeon.

520
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,077
- A little cold on your chest.
- Har... Hard to breathe.

521
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,652
- Because you collapsed a lung.
- How is Berta?

522
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,584
She's in the OR.
We'll get an update.

523
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:53,248
- You have a Cordis introducer?
- What's going on, Pratt?

524
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,826
Penetrating neck developed
a dense left-sided paralysis.

525
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,754
Vascular needs
to repair his carotid.

526
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:58,920
No, that won't work.

527
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,895
- Ten blade.
- Call Surgery.

528
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,558
- The injury is too high.
- Yeah? Let them decide that.

529
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,795
- 32 French.
- Get me a C-arm and a radiologist.

530
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,100
- No, your patient needs to go to the OR.
- He'll be dead by then.

531
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,140
- V-tach. GALLANT:
Charge to 200.

532
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,006
Don't do it, Pratt. Clear.

533
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,613
- Run of six.
- That's another 50 of lidocaine.

534
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,687
She's about to arrest.
Where's the heliox?

535
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,584
- Mix it up.
- You think it's rhabdo?

536
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,284
Yeah, the crushed muscle cells
are getting into her central circulation.

537
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,455
She needs an amputation.

538
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,689
Operation would kill
her. Heart's too weak.

539
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,766
- I don't know about that wedding.
- I need ice, lots of it.

540
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,630
Subtract seven from 100.

541
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,034
- Uh, ninety-three.
- Seven from 93.

542
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,798
- What are you doing?
- Mental-status exam. Serial sevens.

543
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,170
Neuro checks are pupils,
orientation, grip strength.

544
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,676
Ten other patients need you.

545
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,336
Excuse me. - Eighty-six.

546
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,537
Good enough.

547
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,376
We have a foot lac to suture
before it's six hours old and...

548
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,142
- Chuck?
- What is it?

549
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,981
Chuck?

550
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,316
Move the arm guy into a chair.

551
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,894
Neela, go get a doctor and a SonoSite.
Lester, help me lift him. One, two... Wait.

552
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,552
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

553
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,322
Okay, roll him.

554
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,065
- Suction.
- Open the internal paddles.

555
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,671
We need a doctor in Exam 3.

556
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,672
Try next door. Start
internal compressions.

557
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,711
- The guy is stroking out.
- I'd start with an angiogram.

558
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,077
Injury's at the base of the skull.
Surgeons can't get distal control.

559
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,218
- Dr. Pratt, can you come to Exam 3?
- Does it look like it?

560
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,685
You don't put a stent in
this guy, he's gonna die.

561
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,289
I'm taking the SonoSite.

562
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,163
Clear.

563
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,827
- Ultrasound, but no one's available.
- Hard to bag. Try a jaw thrust.

564
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,869
- He stopped breathing?
- Yeah. He needs intubation.

565
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,448
Prep an 8-0 ET tube.

566
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,678
Abby?

567
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,589
- The damn cords are too anterior.
- You want me to try?

568
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,352
Roll him. Roll him.
Roll him. Yankauer.

569
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,621
His sats are dropping.

570
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,202
Why isn't this...? Can you turn
it on? Turn on the wall suction.

571
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:21,363
- Heart rate's down to 40.
- Okay, stand by with atropine.

572
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,842
Maybe you need a straight blade.

573
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,623
- Give me your hand.
- I'll open the crash cart.

574
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,357
Backwards and to the right.

575
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,623
Right...

576
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:48,396
there. Hold it right there.

577
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,771
Got it. Bag him. Neela, tape.

578
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,510
He's got a laceration on his back.
It could be an entrance wound.

579
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,578
Sats are coming up.

580
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,613
Looks like he has a metal
fragment in his spleen.

581
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:10,346
Lester, get me the rapid
infuser and two units of O-neg.

582
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,115
What are you doing?

583
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,089
- He needs a central line.
- Shouldn't an Attending be here?

584
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,751
Yep. See anyone around?

585
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,597
The liver is wrapped,
still bleeding.

586
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,791
Purse string it with 2-0.

587
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,370
- How do you know this?
- I used to be a surgical tech.

588
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,269
- Oh, my, what have we here?
- Liver lac.

589
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,138
- Hemostasis with Vicryl mesh.
- Excellent.

590
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,337
Well, I've got an open
OR. Let's get him upstairs.

591
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,881
- Looks like I'll eat cold turkey.
- What time is it?

592
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,848
- Almost 5.
- Oh, man.

593
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,722
- Hey, you got a bolt cutter? MAN:
Not up here, but I'll get you one.

594
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,125
You're lucky, Mr. Garland.

595
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,132
- Your burns are only minor.
- I liked it better downstairs.

596
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,326
Only had pneumonia downstairs.

597
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,334
Charged to 30 and clear.

598
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,203
- Asystole.
- Resuming compressions.

599
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,311
- How long's it been?
- Thirty-five minutes.

600
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:08,003
Okay, that's it.

601
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,741
Time of death: 17:09.

602
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,550
Close the thoracotomy,
find the family.

603
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,687
His wife's in surgery.

604
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:21,725
- Hey, what did Vascular say?
- They never came down.

605
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:26,221
There you go. Leave 3 centimeters
to cover the defect, one intracranial.

606
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,560
- Stent is in place.
- What did I tell you?

607
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,293
- To do the right thing.
- No. I want...

608
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,700
Hey, look at this.

609
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,771
Motor function in
the upper extremity.

610
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,408
Blood flow is
restored to the brain.

611
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,078
Everything's good, Mel.

612
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,041
Where's Dr. Lewis?

613
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,583
Clear.

614
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,555
- Sinus tach.
- Got a pulse.

615
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:51,951
Try for a pressure.

616
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,490
- Reina? Open your eyes.
- You think she'll wake up?

617
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,885
- I hope so.
- We still need an Attending.

618
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,894
- Which patient?
- The flight nurse guy.

619
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:00,896
- Chuck?
- What?

620
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,732
Abby?

621
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:06,235
Occult splenic injury. Slow leak,
took him an hour to drop his pressure.

622
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,635
He's intubated with a
central line. Who did this?

623
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,607
Sign here, we can say you did.

624
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,881
- It was either that or let him die.
- This the spleen for the OR?

625
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,538
- Yup.
- It's Chuck.

626
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,249
- What, your ex-husband?
- Yeah.

627
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,582
- Do you want to observe?
- Um, I can't, but I can bring him up.

628
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,649
Last crit was 26. He's type
and crossed for another four.

629
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:29,886
- BP's 110/70 after two units.
- Abby, thank you.

630
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,141
Is it over?

631
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,244
Did he drop his pressure again?

632
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,079
Any additional transfusions?

633
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,777
- Okay, good. Thanks.
- Chuck?

634
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,547
He's doing well.
They're closing.

635
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,748
- And we're opening to Trauma.
- What?

636
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,120
Sent nine to the OR,
five to Telemetry...

637
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,421
four to Med-Surg, and
I have monitored beds.

638
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,258
Too bad it takes a disaster
to whip this place into shape.

639
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:11,096
Ruptured globe's going up to surgery.
- Okay, good.

640
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,468
Abby. The fibroids
involved the uterine artery.

641
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,075
I attempted a myomectomy,
but there was no way.

642
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,212
- You did a hysterectomy?
- Yeah.

643
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,078
She's stable now.

644
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,110
Heard you had your
hands full down here.

645
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,546
Good night.

646
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,949
- Hey, can I sign out?
- What?

647
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,589
- You're a night-shift nurse.
- Not until 7.

648
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,422
- Well, it's a quarter till.
- I don't believe this.

649
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,754
I wrote these orders six hours ago.
- Hey, Mom.

650
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,920
- Where's Helene?
- She couldn't pull in.

651
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,588
Are those body bags out there?

652
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,665
Did you see the crash?

653
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,003
Well, looks like home
cooking's out of the question.

654
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,436
You wanna go to Ike's?

655
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,735
- Ike's?
- It's across the street.

656
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,408
We're going out.
You're still coming, right?

657
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,605
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

658
00:36:56,781 --> 00:37:00,775
- Alex, we'll be fine on our own.
- Mom, you said I could bring a friend.

659
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,818
Besides, it's
boring if it's just us.

660
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:05,920
You're welcome to join us.

661
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:10,326
- No, I don't have to.
- No. Come on.

662
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,698
Are you ready?

663
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,305
- Yeah, last stitch.
- Where is Romano?

664
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:26,206
- Haven't seen him. I need to get this...
- Let the nurses handle it. Come on.

665
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,381
Why in God's name would
he insist on meeting tonight?

666
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,176
- I really couldn't say. ANSPAUGH:
Time for our little sit-down.

667
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,512
- I'm a little tied up in here.
- Where is Robert?

668
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,485
- I thought he was up in the OR.
- I thought he was down here.

669
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,989
- Just fill me in later.
- Come along, Dr. Pratt.

670
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,627
Best if we deal
with this right now.

671
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,700
Romano sent me a file
of your disciplinary letters.

672
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,666
Sometimes we
don't see eye to eye.

673
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:55,671
Well, there's enough documentation
here to merit a suspension...

674
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,138
I guarantee you that.

675
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:59,709
Offending patients,
contradicting consultants...

676
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,677
refusing to comply with
Attending's treatment plans.

677
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,338
Do you care to respond?

678
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,585
- Look, I may have been out of line...
- Oh, baloney.

679
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:11,354
- Excuse me?
- I give no credence to these allegations.

680
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:14,687
If any of this were true, I'd get
complaints from other Attendings.

681
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,693
And obviously, Robert doesn't
care enough to even show up.

682
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,421
I saw you in action today.

683
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,997
You're an excellent physician.

684
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,399
Thank you.

685
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,702
Give this to Romano
when you see him.

686
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,705
Can I have French toast? - No.

687
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,540
Why not? It says
all-day breakfast.

688
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,875
Because it's Thanksgiving.
You're having turkey.

689
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,848
Would you rather have
French toast or turkey?

690
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:44,387
Um, I don't like French toast.

691
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,252
Why not? You like pancakes.

692
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,757
- Yeah.
- So... So does my mom.

693
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,558
You guys can have pancakes,
I'll have French toast...

694
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,893
and then we can share
some turkey sausage.

695
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:00,728
Alex.

696
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,906
- Why would you do that?
- Payback.

697
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:08,211
I'm sorry I didn't get home in time
to cook you Thanksgiving dinner.

698
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,579
Excuse me. I'll wash up.

699
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,792
Why did you invite him?

700
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:25,927
Because he's my friend.

701
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,089
You shouldn't have
friends who are over 30.

702
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,757
- Why not?
- Because you're a kid.

703
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,926
So? I like him. He's cool.

704
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,799
- I know what you're trying.
- I'm not.

705
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,804
And...

706
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,443
I'd rather not go out with
someone right now, okay?

707
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:42,744
You're probably not his type.
Besides, he's my friend, not yours.

708
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,476
Hello, Mrs. Marshall. I'm back.

709
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:52,021
- The nurse never came with my medicine.
- That's okay. I'm your nurse now.

710
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,624
I thought you were my doctor.

711
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,989
That was this morning.
Now I'm your nurse.

712
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,995
- This is a very strange hospital.
- Tell me about it.

713
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,866
Abby, I'm about to
suture an arm lac.

714
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,592
- 5-0 nylon.
- I thought so.

715
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,967
How much angulation is acceptable
on a fifth-metacarpal fracture?

716
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,005
More than 60 degrees
needs reduction.

717
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,309
Do you know who gets the
Blue Beacon admissions?

718
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:19,178
Sessa, beeper number 2956.

719
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,646
Never received? No way.
I brought that down myself.

720
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,347
Look, I looked in the records
room, and it's not there.

721
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,153
Yeah, well, happy
Thanksgiving to you too, jagoff.

722
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,626
- Hey, did Detroit win?
- I have no freaking idea.

723
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,820
What about Dallas?

724
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,659
Don't make me come
over and smack you.

725
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,323
One for Dr. Pratt.

726
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,799
Hey, Morris. What have
you been doing all day?

727
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,500
Romano told me to wait here.

728
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,044
So you just sat on your ass
through a mass casualty?

729
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,909
- Yeah.
- Your shift's over, man. Go home.

730
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,515
I can't.

731
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,152
Are those from Christmas?

732
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,346
- Last year?
- The year before. Dr. Greene.

733
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,491
- Which one's Dr. Greene?
- I'm gonna need...

734
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,354
a massive amount of
caffeine to make it to sunrise.

735
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,928
- Here you go, Abby.
- Ugh.

736
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,495
Shred it.

737
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,033
Look at this one. That's definitely
2001. The Secret Santa party.

738
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,727
Anybody hear from Carter?

739
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,624
He sent a postcard
about a month ago.

740
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:17,265
- You should put that up in the lounge.
- How's he doing?

741
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,040
I don't know.

742
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,213
What are you thinking about?

743
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,455
Nothing.

744
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,220
Come back to bed.

745
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,391
Hey.

746
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,186
Hey.

747
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,097
I should fake my
death more often.

748
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,625
I knew it.

749
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,065
What?

750
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,340
That we'd end up
together tonight.

751
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,404
This your idea of a hot date?

752
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,102
Yeah, yeah.

753
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,113
It's dark. All the
nurses are busy.

754
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,082
You just had your
spleen removed.

755
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:37,279
Yeah. You know what they say:

756
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:40,448
When you lose an organ,
the other ones get stronger.

757
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:09,110
Hey. What are
you still doing here?

758
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,223
Waiting on a few labs. I hate to
pass on patients when it's busy.

759
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,359
That will change.

760
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:17,017
Today was pretty amazing.

761
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,357
I've never seen
anything like it.

762
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,658
I didn't think we could
handle it, but we did.

763
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,667
We did really well.
We saved lives.

764
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,228
It was like a roller coaster.

765
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:30,637
I've always hated
roller coasters, but...

766
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:35,337
- I sort of can't wait for the next ride.
- As long as it's not in the next 12 hours.

767
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:36,845
You drink coffee?

768
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,312
I'm not in the club.

769
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:40,008
I got an extra.

770
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,675
Thanks.
