1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,801
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,671
- You did it.
- We have a baby.

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,937
Will you be home
late again tonight?

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,256
I've got the med list.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,958
- Why didn't you have it before?
- Phenelzine?

6
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,110
She'll be a star in internal
medicine or research.

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,650
You have to be more decisive.

8
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,151
Shall we try the high-dose epi?

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,653
I assessed it, I
ordered it, I pushed it.

10
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,452
- I gave her the order. CARTER:
Until you falsified the chart.

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:26,958
That's a felony.

12
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:31,258
Nothing I did on this shift can convince
me or anyone else that I belong here.

13
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,660
She's not an ER doc.

14
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,841
We need more wipes.
Where's your mom? She's late.

15
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:51,816
- Hey, 9 ounces.
- Nice.

16
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,114
Can't say I don't produce.

17
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,955
Better put on your shirt. She
already thinks we're pervs.

18
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,357
Come on, baby. You gonna
be good for your grandma?

19
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,031
Yeah, you're always a
good boy, aren't you?

20
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,827
That's my baby. That's my baby.

21
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,902
I'm sorry. My battery was dead.

22
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,231
- I had to get a jump.
- That's all right.

23
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,171
- Hi, baby.
- Hands. Wait, hands, hands.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,669
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi, <i>hija.</i>

25
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,076
Carlos is going to
buy me a new battery.

26
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,376
Really? What you
need is a new car, Mom.

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,178
- Yeah?
- Preferably with an air bag.

28
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,082
Yes, well, you going
to buy it for me?

29
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,349
Yeah, right. My brother's a saint
because he's getting a battery...

30
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,517
but I gotta pick up the
tab for a whole new car.

31
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,356
He didn't sleep
well last night...

32
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,328
so you might wanna put him
down early for his morning nap.

33
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,694
Oh, okay. Poor <i>lindo.</i>

34
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,634
Just like your mother, only
don't be so stubborn, okay?

35
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,406
- You ready to go, babe?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,043
- Say goodbye to Mama.
- Goodbye, baby.

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,236
- And Mommy too.
- Say goodbye.

38
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,718
- Come on, baby.
- Okay.

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,252
It's all right, papa. Don't
worry. We'll be back.

40
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,891
- Your son has a set of pipes on him, huh?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,301
He gets that from
your side of the family.

42
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:07,892
Oh, yeah?

43
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,930
What are you trying to
say? I got a big mouth?

44
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,101
You want a turkey or
peanut butter sandwich?

45
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,068
- Both.
- You want turkey with peanut butter?

46
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,232
- You used to make it for me, remember?
- No, I didn't.

47
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,709
Well, somebody did. Hey,
what are sodomy laws?

48
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,409
I'll get it.

49
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,646
- What are you doing here?
- Just got off work.

50
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,416
- Thought I'd stop by, say hello.
- Hey.

51
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,117
Guess he misses us or something.

52
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,964
I have to be at work in, like, 40 minutes,
and he has to be at school, like, now.

53
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,794
You know, if he
wants, I could stay.

54
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,267
Nice try. Gina got a ticket for
double-parking last time. Go.

55
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,497
When are you gonna
stop working night shifts?

56
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,804
Soon.

57
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,271
- And what are sodomy laws?
- Out!

58
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,616
You know...

59
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,785
I have a couple of minutes
before I have to leave.

60
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,418
Really?

61
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,451
A lot can happen
in a few minutes.

62
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,658
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,457
It doesn't have to
be anything fancy.

64
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,660
I'm really tired.

65
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,740
How tired?

66
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,504
Not that tired.

67
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,343
How did you score?

68
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:43,150
- On your boards?
- Don't know. I can't bring myself to look.

69
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,157
- Any luck, I failed.
- Now, that's a positive attitude.

70
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,785
Part of me is afraid I'll be given a
license to practice medicine one day.

71
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,194
- Isn't that the point?
- If I was good at it, yeah.

72
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,361
Between annoying Attendings,
butting heads with nurses...

73
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,336
and being responsible for a patient's
death because I tried to be aggressive...

74
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,737
writing's on the wall for
me, wouldn't you say?

75
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,900
You're not good until
you've killed someone.

76
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,239
Spoken like someone who hasn't.

77
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,348
So how you doing?

78
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,744
Fine.

79
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,044
And I don't have much
of a poker face, do I?

80
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:16,315
Abby, pilonidal cyst in Four.
Gallant, shingles in Two.

81
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,755
Neela, vaginal bleeding
in One. Get to work.

82
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,360
Sorry, I'm late. Had a
meeting with Risk Management.

83
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,258
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

84
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,524
My feet are swollen,
my back is killing me...

85
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,032
and apparently, my
waddle's too slow for people.

86
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,363
Got a long day. The
sooner we start, the better.

87
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,507
All right. We're doing interviews
on the phenelzine death.

88
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,199
- I'll need some time off the floor.
- Are we being sued?

89
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,936
Not yet. Need to clarify
the hospital's defense.

90
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,240
All right, Gallant,
you're up last at 11:30.

91
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,873
The Attending's up last since he's
the one who will be named in the suit.

92
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,885
God knows Carter's got assets.
That why he left the country?

93
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:52,048
All right, we'll start at the bottom
and work our way up. Neela, that's you.

94
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:57,227
The guy's records fell through the cracks.
It's not like anyone did anything wrong.

95
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,042
What's the matter with
you? This chick is hot.

96
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,812
- A little overweight, but in a good way.
- Not interested.

97
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,080
- Mike, she's your type.
- I'm busy.

98
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,019
- Lieutenant James on line one.
- Tell him I'll call him back.

99
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,490
Busy doing what? Playing
soldier? You need a life.

100
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,220
Dr. Gallant, you treat the
immersion burn in Exam Four?

101
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,523
- Problem?
- I tell you...

102
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,361
- You did excellent with the dÃ©bridement.
- Magna cum laude.

103
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,561
- Ever thought of switching to surgery?
- I'm pretty well committed.

104
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,206
- If you change your mind...
- She has legs up to here:

105
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,613
- Pratt.
- You're playing games.

106
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,902
Susan's with Risk
Management, so present to me.

107
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,740
- Yeah, okay. You all right?
- Yeah. Why?

108
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,576
- How's your dad doing?
- Oh, he's much better, thanks.

109
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,944
Okay.

110
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:28,213
We have a homeless John
Doe, approximately 70 years old...

111
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,620
found in a makeshift tent in
Lincoln Park, cold and altered.

112
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,956
His sugar's at 435, so I gave
him 8 units of insulin sub-Q.

113
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:41,124
- How long has he been outside?
- Rectal temp's 92.3. Overnight?

114
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,133
Diabetic ulcerations
on the feet.

115
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,866
Also has high blood pressure: 180/95.
And evidence of a prior MI on the EKG.

116
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,443
- Pretty bad cataracts too.
- You sure he's homeless?

117
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,044
- Well, he fits the bill, right?
- Nails are groomed.

118
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,616
Check Missing Persons.
Maybe he's a wanderer.

119
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,720
Sir. Sir. Oh, great.

120
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,158
- Here.
- Seems like he's incontinent too.

121
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,794
Kerry. My department's in utter chaos.
Since Robert, there's been no leadership.

122
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:14,094
Scheduling's a nightmare. And nobody's
representing us at the bargaining table.

123
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,395
- Our salaries have been cut back.
- I know.

124
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,164
- Well, what will you do?
- Have the new department head...

125
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,841
assess the situation and
get back to me about it.

126
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,409
- You selected a chairman?
- Dr. Weaver, Sandy on two.

127
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,569
Chairwoman. Can you
find out if it's urgent?

128
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,942
Unless you prefer to
be gender non-specific...

129
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,141
and simply referred to as chair.

130
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,581
Only dinner. Call her back.

131
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,244
I'm late for a medical
executive committee meeting.

132
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,690
I don't understand.
When was this decided?

133
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:42,295
Two months ago. Still need final
approval, but that shouldn't be an issue.

134
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,030
Fine, but it would have
been nice to have been asked.

135
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,362
Three months. I don't know.
Something like that. You don't want it?

136
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:52,700
Maybe. I don't know. It would have been
nice to be given a choice in the matter.

137
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,137
How long has your back
been hurting, Mr. Halpern?

138
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,708
A couple of days now.

139
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,175
Did you fall or strain yourself?

140
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,679
I slipped on the stairs
about a week ago.

141
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,307
Might have triggered something. I
had a slipped disk a few years back.

142
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,547
- You have surgery for it?
- No, no. I couldn't afford it.

143
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:13,285
It just flares up once in a
while. I usually just take Vicodin.

144
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,722
Let me guess. You're allergic
to Tylenol and ibuprofen...

145
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,899
and Vicodin is the
only thing that works.

146
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,866
Yeah, I don't really like the stuff,
but what am I gonna do, you know?

147
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,896
- Abby?
- T and L spine and get some urine?

148
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,734
Yep. We'll be right back.

149
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,245
Then run a tox screen. Check his
records. Make sure he's not drug-seeking.

150
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,314
You read my mind. So you
think you'll match at County?

151
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,816
Huh. I don't know.

152
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:43,184
So you basically let a desk clerk get in
the way of your getting a medical history?

153
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,585
I suppose I did.

154
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,024
Did you inform Dr. Gallant that you
didn't have Mr. Sanchez's med list?

155
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,595
- Yes.
- And yet he gave the order for Demerol?

156
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,460
Yes.

157
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,499
- Do you have anything else?
- No, I'm good.

158
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,332
Okay. Thanks, Neela.

159
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,411
I have a friend who's doing a study
on neuroprotective agents in stroke.

160
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,740
They're looking for
students to work in the lab.

161
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:08,973
Research?

162
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,117
Just check it out.

163
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,351
This is crazy.

164
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,720
If Susan knew she was in
some inquisition all day...

165
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,794
she should've scheduled
another Attending.

166
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,521
Abby: chest pain, scalp
lac, itchy groin rash.

167
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,257
- Already got eight.
- I've got 12. What's your point?

168
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,767
Dr. Chen, old frozen
guy is waking up.

169
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,132
- He asked for some water.
- Oh, hey, Kovac called.

170
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,604
He said next time he's
gonna have a triple latte first.

171
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,606
- That make sense?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,642
- Aren't you two living together now?
- No.

173
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,974
For what it's worth, I
think Luka's a good guy.

174
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,639
- Oh, wait. You didn't...?
- Sleep with him? No.

175
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:47,254
I went in a completely
different direction.

176
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,316
Hi, I'm Dr. Chen. Can
you tell me your name, sir?

177
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,383
Jones.

178
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,790
First name is Bob.

179
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,289
Is there any family
we can contact, Bob?

180
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,663
No. I'm homeless.

181
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,397
Mr. Jones, your
hemoglobin A1C suggests...

182
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,805
that your diabetes was
under control until recently.

183
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,842
What happened?

184
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,545
No missing-persons
report that fits.

185
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,779
Well, we'll just have
to call Social Services...

186
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,251
get him placed somewhere.

187
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,247
Yes.

188
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,483
I need somewhere to live.

189
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,346
All right, re-check
d-stick, urine ketone...

190
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,260
You know what,
why am I doing this?

191
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,064
He's Pratt's patient.

192
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,605
So the Klonopin's working?
Okay. No, that's good.

193
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,502
Just give me a call if he
gets agitated again. All right.

194
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,869
What are you doing?

195
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,274
Talking to your father's nurse.
She tried to call, but you were busy.

196
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,041
He tried to fry a steak while
she was stripping his bed.

197
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,275
- What?
- Yeah. Set off all the smoke alarms...

198
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,546
- scared himself, but he's okay now.
- Oh, my God.

199
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,885
I gave her verbal orders for p.r.n.
Klonopin. It has a long half-life.

200
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,957
You might wanna
consider restraints.

201
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:04,496
Dr. Chen, Rescue 3-8 has two critical and
six serious from a structure-fire collapse.

202
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,395
Give me it. I'll call Resp. Make
sure they have vents ready.

203
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,069
Page Trauma and Burn
Fellows, set up rapid infusers...

204
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,967
and get Lewis out
of that damn meeting!

205
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,042
She discovered he'd had a bad reaction
to morphine and sought out an alternative.

206
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,678
It was smart on her part.

207
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,905
She didn't tell you what
that alternative was?

208
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,514
No. Not specifically.

209
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,016
Did you hear Dr. Gallant give
the order to push Demerol?

210
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,251
No. But to be fair, I had
stepped out of the room briefly.

211
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,882
- What are you guys looking for exactly?
- The truth.

212
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,920
Meaning you think there's
some sort of cover-up?

213
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,128
Excuse me. Dr. Lewis, FD's
are rolling up with criticals.

214
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,599
- What do we got?
- Tommy Mason, 33.

215
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,267
Full-thickness burns to
the face, neck and chest.

216
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,347
Unconscious at the scene. BP's
90 palp, tubed for agonal resps.

217
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,355
- Residential fire? EMT
1: Abandoned warehouse.

218
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:01,284
- Should've let it burn. Nobody to save.
- Sam, Gallant, you take the next one.

219
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,548
Pratt, you come with me.

220
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,522
- What happened?
- Industrial fire, 17 got hit pretty bad.

221
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,060
- How did your meeting go?
- Fine.

222
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,131
Andy Fash, 22. Smoke inhalation.
Passed out and took a fall.

223
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,031
Dislocated knee. - BP's 132/80.

224
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,899
- Belly pain. SAM:
Good pulse on the foot.

225
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,992
- Pelvis is stable.
- I'm cool. How's Mason?

226
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,214
- We don't know yet.
- I'll get the next one.

227
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,912
- This the second critical?
- Next rig.

228
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,445
Took a while to fish her out.

229
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,446
- Abby, you take this one.
- By myself?

230
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,142
Chen and Pratt, next room.
Gallant, Neela, with me.

231
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:36,449
29-year-old female, chest, pelvis crush.
Injury on scene with prolonged extrication.

232
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,956
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.

233
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,594
- It's Sandy.
- Hey, doc.

234
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,126
Got a flash. Wire. Sandy,
you need to stay still, okay?

235
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,323
BP's 80 palp.

236
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,969
Tell Gemmill to stop trying
to get a look at my boobs.

237
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,570
- Chest is up.
- Rib fractures.

238
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,799
- Pneumothorax. She needs a chest tube.
- I was about to say that.

239
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,934
Pulse ox to 78. How about
doing it instead of talking?

240
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,579
Ten blade.

241
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,181
Tegaderm for the line.
Sandy, how are you doing?

242
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,112
I've been better.

243
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,609
- I remember you.
- How's the baby?

244
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,017
You have carbonaceous
material in both nares.

245
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,521
We need to think about
securing your airway.

246
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,751
You wanna shut me up by
sticking a tube down my throat?

247
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,452
We wanna help
you breathe better.

248
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,495
I want... I wanna
talk to Kerry first.

249
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,637
Okay. Cut in the
fifth intercostal space.

250
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,170
- Mid-axillary line.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

251
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,308
Free fluid in both
pericolic gutters.

252
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,970
Sandy, you need the O.R.
We're gonna have to intubate.

253
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,273
- What's taking her so long?
- I paged her.

254
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,848
Okay, I'm in.

255
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,548
Please.

256
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,115
Okay, okay.

257
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,549
Put her on 100-percent non-rebreather.
The minute she's here, I'll intubate you.

258
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,283
- Need another doc.
- Go, Gallant.

259
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,362
- Just a chest tube.
- Not a student. They want a doc.

260
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,692
Neela, have you ever
done a horizontal mattress?

261
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,959
- Yes.
- Dazzle me.

262
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,299
- What do you need?
- Glove up.

263
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,871
Sixty percent surface
area burns with hypoxia.

264
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,373
- This guy needs an escharotomy.
- Wide prep, 10 blades for both of us.

265
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,342
We'll open a square over the
entire chest down to the sub-Q.

266
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,810
BP's down to 70 palp.

267
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,643
Gallant, check the ET for a
leak. May have to re-intubate.

268
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,649
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ready?

269
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,843
Every time.

270
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,490
Anterior axillary line all
the way down to the 10th rib.

271
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,653
Join the top and bottom transversely.
Mike, you should be able to bag him now.

272
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,865
Nope. Sats are dropping.

273
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,160
- Hold up. Eighteen angiocath.
- What?

274
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,998
Tracheal shift. Puncture wound. Tension
pneumo on the left. Gotta needle him.

275
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,004
Hemostat and 4-0 vicryl.

276
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,869
- Pulse is stronger. Sats coming up.
- Nice catch, Gallant.

277
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,207
Hey, Abby needs some
help with a knee reduction.

278
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,010
- Pratt.
- I'm in the middle of tying off a bleeder.

279
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,175
Gallant can take over.

280
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,888
Sterile gloves. - What's up?

281
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,424
Lateral dislocation with
equivocal pedal pulses...

282
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,255
wheezing, maybe
smoke inhalation.

283
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,398
- Is he hanging in there?
- Chest was so bad, he couldn't breathe.

284
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,362
He's intubated and doing better.

285
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,053
Systolic's 120 with 50 on board.

286
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,533
- Lopez?
- We don't know yet.

287
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,433
He's had 250 mics of fentanyl.

288
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,733
I told the old-timers
I'd race them to the top.

289
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,573
All right, this is gonna hurt.

290
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,541
Have to pull on your lower leg
to move it back onto the knee.

291
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,943
Seventeen years between
them. I got eight months.

292
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,913
Come on, stabilize the distal
femur. Let's get ready to pull.

293
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,282
- Tommy got up there first. Then Sandy.
- Enough counter-traction?

294
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,115
Remember thinking
the old guy won.

295
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,552
Yeah. Ready?

296
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,785
- Then I saw them both drop.
- Okay, one, two, three.

297
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,598
- Where's Sandy?
- Trauma One.

298
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,736
- How bad is it?
- She's conscious.

299
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,872
- Excuse me. Sandy?
- Crit's 24 after two units.

300
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,143
Sandy?

301
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,670
- Oh, God.
- Hey, baby.

302
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,406
- What did you go and do?
- Roof collapse.

303
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,575
Bilateral rib fractures,
pneumothorax.

304
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,914
Intra-abdominal bleed,
pubic rami fractures.

305
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,487
We need to get her to the O.R.

306
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,456
- It's a good thing I pumped, huh?
- Chest tube output going down.

307
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,117
Pulse ox, 87.

308
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,786
- She's on 100 percent?
- Yeah.

309
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,297
- Why isn't she intubated?
- She refused until you got here.

310
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,931
I wanted to say, "Hey."

311
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,266
- Type-specific's here.
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

312
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:18,972
Sandy? Sandy? Sandy, you
need to stay awake, sweetie.

313
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,443
Need to stay awake. Sandy!

314
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,445
- Stay awake.
- 20 etomidate, 120 of sux.

315
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,277
- Pressure's drifting.
- Stay awake.

316
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,818
- Number two mac.
- Sandy, I need to do this.

317
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,353
Sats in the 70s. We should bag.

318
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,787
- Kerry...? WEAVER:
Push the drugs.

319
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,191
I need an end-tidal
CO2 detector.

320
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,658
- Etomidate first?
- Kerry...

321
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,339
- No.
- You need to let us do it.

322
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,457
Please. She's my wife.

323
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,327
How long am I gonna be in this?

324
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,804
When you dislocate, you tear
up a bunch of knee ligaments.

325
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,306
Those heal, right?

326
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,343
Even with surgery, there
still could be some instability.

327
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,546
I've wanted to do this
since I was a kid, you know?

328
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,810
There are some new
artificial ligaments.

329
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,648
But if it's really bad, you
may need knee replacement.

330
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,188
Mason says it's a calling.

331
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,553
So, what happens
when you can't answer it?

332
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,995
Good pulses. Check his airway.
I'll see if they need me next door.

333
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,395
- What happened?
- Cardiac injury.

334
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,662
- I lost the pulse. CHEN:
Start compressions.

335
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,829
Thoracotomy tray to Dr. Gallant.

336
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,435
- You're serious?
- Why not? He's earned it.

337
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,543
Ten blade, then Mayo scissors.

338
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,475
Put up a screen. They
don't need to see this.

339
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,482
Okay. Rib spreader.

340
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,185
Open the pericardium
with the Metz.

341
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,519
Stay anterior or you'll
cut the phrenic nerve.

342
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,193
You do remember the
anatomy of the phrenic nerve.

343
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,205
Edema and secretions.
Tube's not advancing.

344
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,703
You asked for an 8-0.

345
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,069
- BP 108/68.
- Come on. Come on, honey.

346
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,003
- Switch to a seven-and-a half?
- Come on. You can do this.

347
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,570
Sats, 83, 82...

348
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,443
- I'm switching to fiber-optic scope.
- Suction and crichoid.

349
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,949
- Eighty-one, 80...
- Kerry?

350
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,439
- I see cords.
- Get a tube.

351
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,251
- Seventy-nine, 78...
- I'm in.

352
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,891
Bag her.

353
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,991
Good yellow on CO2 monitor.

354
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,894
- Pressure's 120 palp.
- Four of Ativan and six of Pavulon.

355
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,295
Are you okay, Dr. Weaver?

356
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,601
- Portable vent?
- Just keep bagging her.

357
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,165
Okay, Mr. Fash, we're gonna
move you to... Are you all right?

358
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,004
- I can't breathe.
- I hear stridor.

359
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:35,638
Okay, try continuous
albuterol at 20 per hour. Pratt?

360
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,818
- Pratt, I need you in here.
- This guy needs me a little bit more.

361
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,750
I'll start an atrial line.
He needs four units, now!

362
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,287
Okay, we can try a Foley.

363
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:49,491
- This guy's in respiratory distress.
- Upper-airway burn. Crank up the O2.

364
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,597
Ventricle's starting
to fill. Crank it up.

365
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,760
Abby, does he need intubation?

366
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,973
Just bag him. I'll be
there in a few minutes.

367
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,662
All right. Ambu mask at 100 percent.
- What's happening?

368
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:02,275
Okay. You need to try to
relax, all right? Just relax.

369
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,103
No reading on the pulse ox.

370
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,203
- He's out.
- All right. Try a jaw thrust.

371
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,850
There's no chest
excursion. I can't bag him.

372
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,282
Twenty cc's for the
balloon. Extend his neck.

373
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,717
- We did!
- Okay, good hemostasis with the Foley.

374
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,948
Another 2 units and
we might save this guy.

375
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,491
- Okay, fine. Etomidate and sux.
- You got it.

376
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,789
Push the drugs, Abby.
One of us will be right there.

377
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,290
- Run of six.
- Heart's still empty.

378
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,962
Where's he losing it?

379
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,869
- Abby, try a 6-0. Take a look.
- Okay, sponge stick and suction.

380
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,030
Clamp the hilar vessels.
What do you see?

381
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,643
Nothing! Larynx is swollen shut.

382
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,541
- His sats are down to 72.
- This is ridiculous.

383
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,807
- I can't ventilate him.
- Just keep bagging.

384
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,507
I'll be right there in a second.

385
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:49,384
All right. Eleven
blade and a five shiley.

386
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,989
- What?
- You heard me.

387
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,649
- All right.
- Okay, hilum's clamped.

388
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,193
- So is the aorta.
- V-tach.

389
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,127
Internal paddles. Charge to 30.

390
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,666
Clear.

391
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,399
Abby, how're you doing
in there? You okay?

392
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,232
Yep.

393
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,737
Tube and curved Kelly.

394
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,034
Ectopy on the monitor.

395
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,450
- You do this before?
- Nope.

396
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,917
Charged.

397
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,422
- Clear.
- No change.

398
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,184
- Amp of epi.
- Sixty.

399
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,850
- Charged.
- Never mind.

400
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,190
- Why?
- I criked him.

401
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,389
- By yourself?
- Sats are up. He's fine.

402
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,934
- Well, now, that's a med student.
- Okay, going again, 100 of lidocaine.

403
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,765
- Charged.
- Clear.

404
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,236
Still V-fib.

405
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,242
- Asystole.
- Okay, come on. Five of epi.

406
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,469
High dose should give
us a shockable rhythm.

407
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:46,873
Stop compressions.

408
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,114
Don't bother, man.

409
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,944
Twelve twenty-seven.

410
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,744
- Should we let those guys in?
- After we close the chest.

411
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,749
Oh-silk on a needle driver.

412
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,119
BP's 82/60. Want more blood?

413
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,163
Another two units and
squeeze in the FFP.

414
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,801
Fractured liver, pelvis, ribs...

415
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,665
humerus. God, what's not broken?

416
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,397
- Kerry, do you have the C-spine film?
- It's Sandy.

417
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,905
What?

418
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,907
Oh, God.

419
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,170
Who's operating?

420
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:25,614
Anspaugh, hopefully, and Dean.

421
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,755
Ignacio's anesthesia.
Shirley's circulating.

422
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,083
- Good. That's good.
- Platelets are here.

423
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,590
Do you want to stay with her?

424
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,160
- What?
- Would you like to observe?

425
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,297
Yes. Yes, I would.

426
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,933
All right. Chest
tube on mortar seal.

427
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,127
You got it.

428
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,741
- The O.R.'s ready.
- All right, let's go then.

429
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,835
I'll say a prayer for
you, Dr. Weaver.

430
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,437
Kerry, she'll pull
through. She's a fighter.

431
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,441
I'm right here. I'm
not going anywhere.

432
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,349
Have the blood bank send four units.
- Already had six.

433
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,853
- How is she?
- Lung collapsed.

434
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,279
We're able to re-inflate
it. She's lacerated

435
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:08,324
her liver, which we
need to repair now.

436
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,955
<i>- Mija</i>. Oh, my God!
- What happened? Where you taking her?

437
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,569
Try not to be scared.
She needs an operation.

438
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,500
Sandy. <i>Mija.</i>

439
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,402
<i>- Mija?</i>
- She's not conscious, ma'am.

440
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,842
- Where's Henry?
- With my wife.

441
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,981
- Is Sandy gonna be all right?
- Yes.

442
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:32,710
I will be with her in the O.R.,
but there's a waiting room upstairs.

443
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,878
And I'll call you the minute
that she gets out of surgery.

444
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,524
- Take care of her.
- We will.

445
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,025
- I'll take them up.
- Thanks.

446
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,526
No. No.

447
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,373
I can tell you exactly
what happened.

448
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,009
I mean, we had a very
recent discharge summary...

449
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,771
documenting an adverse
reaction to morphine.

450
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,609
The patient was in pain. I gave
the order to administer Demerol.

451
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,115
I shouldn't have. End of story.

452
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,877
Not exactly.

453
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,454
Luis Sanchez's
chart is incomplete.

454
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,252
No Attending note.
Any idea why that is?

455
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:17,620
Maybe Carter didn't have a chance to
do it before it was sequestered by Legal.

456
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,958
He was leaving for
Africa that night so...

457
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,294
So he was distracted,
is what you're saying.

458
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,300
No. I'm not saying that at all.

459
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,462
Think he needed time
to get facts straight?

460
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,803
What? No. It was a busy night.

461
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,637
We had a lot of patients.

462
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,640
Is Dr. Carter typically
available to you?

463
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,243
Of course he is.

464
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,648
What are you doing? I
thought you were helping.

465
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,490
I am. By preparing you for the difficult
questioning you may face in a deposition.

466
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:49,356
Do you feel supported by
Dr. Carter as an Attending?

467
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,124
Yes. He's a great teacher.

468
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,759
One of the finest physicians I've worked
with. I respect his opinion tremendously.

469
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,128
So why didn't you
present to him?

470
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,136
LEWIS It doesn't make sense...

471
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,607
because he was probably
30 feet away the whole time.

472
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,905
Was Dr. Carter informed
of the decisions...

473
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,877
you were making in
your treatment plan?

474
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,147
No.

475
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,151
I wanted to handle it myself.

476
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:23,624
I thought I was better at
this job than I guess I am.

477
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,288
I'm completely
responsible. Nobody else is.

478
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,529
Will you state if deposed?

479
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,627
Yes.

480
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,473
When is that
supposed to take place?

481
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,907
The deposition? We're not sure.
We haven't heard from the family yet.

482
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,850
- I might not be able to do it for a while.
- Why is that?

483
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,512
The Army called me up.

484
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,021
I'm gonna be deployed to Iraq.

485
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,361
Excuse me.

486
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:04,062
- I got Halpern's records.
- It'd be nice to see you.

487
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,829
- Gallant?
- It's always nice.

488
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,133
- Halpern, right. Refresh my memory.
- Call back.

489
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:11,243
- Desperately seeking Vicodin.
- Yeah.

490
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,071
You hear anything
about Sandy Lopez?

491
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,873
- No, you?
- No.

492
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,243
Puts it in perspective, huh?

493
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,250
So Mr. Halpern managed to hit up
every local hospital for Vicodin this year.

494
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,048
- Know what his tox screen showed?
- Narcotics and benzos?

495
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:27,716
Nope. Nothing. He's
clean. Aspirin and caffeine.

496
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,088
Excuse me.

497
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,389
Could you find out
about my sister?

498
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,429
They told me she's in
surgery and you'd know.

499
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,058
- You're Sandy's brother?
- I'm one of them. Is she okay?

500
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,398
- Uh, let me make a call.
- Thanks.

501
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,231
Falciform ligament's clamped.

502
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,970
- Systolic's in the 90s.
- Two more units going in.

503
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,745
How long have you
two been together?

504
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,710
Three years.

505
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,381
One of which
included a pregnancy.

506
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,783
That gets you bonus
time in the equation.

507
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,458
- Okay, there's lots of blood.
Suction. DEAN: Looks venous.

508
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,890
HemoCue's 8.3.

509
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,533
We met here.

510
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,901
At the hospital?

511
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:16,071
It was the last place I
expected to find anyone.

512
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,711
Right. Uh, the
spleen looks good.

513
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,574
But...

514
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,615
- there's a grade-four hepatic lac.
- Bovie.

515
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,579
I miss Mark too.

516
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,284
Let's pack off the liver.

517
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,458
Shirley? Shirley, can
you wipe my brow?

518
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,991
Lap pads. I need lots of them.

519
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,497
What's the therapeutic
range of procainamide?

520
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,432
Four to 10 mics per mil.
Measure its active metabolite.

521
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,334
Procain plus NAPA
should be under 40.

522
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,140
- Did you open that envelope yet?
- Yes.

523
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,507
- And let me guess. You passed.
- Yes.

524
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,477
You're not a bit
excited about that?

525
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,846
I'm a little excited about it, I suppose.
Don't have to tell my parents I flunked.

526
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,489
I don't know. I'm not
sure it means anything.

527
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,815
I suppose we should at least
go celebrate passing tonight.

528
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,757
Well, I'm not much
in the mood myself.

529
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,587
Yeah.

530
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,025
Susan, what are you doing?

531
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,636
Please let these
be Braxton Hicks.

532
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:22,036
- What's wrong?
- You need to isolate the segmental veins.

533
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,006
Trying. ANSPAUGH: Kerry?

534
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,110
- How is she doing?
- Systolic's down to 78.

535
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,340
She must have a
retrohepatic caval injury.

536
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,384
Oh, God. CORDAY: Okay,
clamp the suprarenal IVC.

537
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,611
All right, I'll take over.

538
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,856
- Large-angled Satinsky.
- Come on, baby.

539
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,891
Please don't scare me like this.

540
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,893
IVC clamped. Mark time.

541
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,497
CVP dropped to zero.

542
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,196
Start an epi infusion.
Keep her temp up.

543
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,100
All right, supra-hepatic
cava clamped.

544
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:57,206
You sure you should be in here?
- She's fine.

545
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,373
Bradycardia.

546
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,480
She's lost her filling pressure.

547
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:02,876
Can you unclamp?

548
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,711
If we do, she'll bleed out.
- And if we don't...

549
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,251
- her heart stays empty and she arrests.
- Oh, God.

550
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,719
- Systolic's only 60.
- Mig of atropine.

551
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,755
Let's prep the
chest for a Schrock.

552
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,156
- Ten blade.
- Heart rate's down to 58.

553
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,920
Sternal saw.

554
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,257
We have to put in
an atrial-caval shunt.

555
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,263
To do that, we have
to open up the chest.

556
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,597
It'll improve her preload and
get blood back to the heart.

557
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,170
- Kerry!
- Do it.

558
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,714
Nicotine, coffee and aspirin.
You're setting yourself up for an ulcer.

559
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,053
I don't drink coffee.

560
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,915
Okay, soda then.

561
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,648
A lot of caffeine
in your system.

562
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:49,754
Over-the-counter migraine
tablets. They don't do squat, though.

563
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,420
Nothing works but Imitrex.

564
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,294
That's a pretty
expensive medication.

565
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,371
Especially for someone who doesn't
work much, not insured anywhere.

566
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,407
Yeah, well, thanks
a lot, Uncle Sam.

567
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,938
How long have you
had the headaches?

568
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,747
Ever since I pulled
sand duty in the Gulf.

569
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,948
What branch?

570
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,819
- Army.
- Yeah, me too.

571
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,321
Don't count on the benefits.

572
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,328
Spent a year in the desert.
Came home with migraines.

573
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:28,490
V.A. says it's not service-related.
Won't give me a dime.

574
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,269
That why you sell the Vicodin?

575
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,465
Pay for the Imitrex?

576
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,406
What unit?

577
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,245
Forty-third Battalion.
Medical Corps.

578
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,351
You gonna turn me in?

579
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,913
No.

580
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,851
But I'm not gonna give
you the Vicodin either.

581
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,025
That's fair enough.

582
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,365
You stay low. Watch your back.

583
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,933
You didn't say how
your meeting went.

584
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:12,672
It's gonna be fine.

585
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,043
Look, I'm sorry I've been...

586
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,041
I don't know.

587
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,880
Bitchy about this whole thing.

588
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,690
It's just not
comfortable for me.

589
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,227
Lying and having someone
else cover my mistakes.

590
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,559
And it just sort of keeps on
compounding, one on top of the other.

591
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,835
I'm being deployed to Iraq.

592
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:48,409
I'm headed for Texas
tomorrow morning.

593
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,714
You haven't finished
your residency.

594
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,419
I know. I'm gonna finish up
the last few electives down there.

595
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,050
They called you
up, just like that?

596
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,787
Yeah.

597
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,429
You're a coward.

598
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:10,027
- What? What?
- A coward and a liar.

599
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,737
I never asked you to do
this for me, but you did.

600
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,740
Now you're leaving. And I'm supposed to
live with the fact that I killed a man...

601
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,538
and that you helped to
lie for me to cover it up?

602
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,944
- Listen, Neela...
- Michael, go to bloody Iraq.

603
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,210
And tell yourself you've
done something noble.

604
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,719
- I had to protect you and Dr. Carter.
- No.

605
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,955
You didn't.

606
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,235
Well, at least the
contractions stopped.

607
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,633
So the sub-Q terb worked?

608
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:52,334
She's still 1 centimeter dilated and
50 percent effaced. You can sit up now.

609
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:57,282
So I should just take it
easy, cut back on a few shifts?

610
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,645
You're having
regular contractions.

611
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,112
Your cervix has softened,
shortened and dilated.

612
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,822
- Bed rest, huh? Plain and simple.
- For how long?

613
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:10,451
Three-to five-weekers do
well, full-terms do better?

614
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:14,959
Oh, no way. I can't stay
in bed for five weeks!

615
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,658
You can and you will.

616
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,400
Schedule an appointment for
an NST with my office in a week.

617
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,678
This blows.

618
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,505
The whole day blows.

619
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,945
Yeah.

620
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,312
- What else happened?
- Nothing.

621
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,783
- Oh, I failed my boards.
- What?

622
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,294
Need a 182 to pass. I got a 167.

623
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,320
Oh, Abby.

624
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,366
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

625
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,867
Well, how were you supposed to
study? You're pulling double shifts.

626
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,767
It's fine.

627
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:58,535
It's not like a burning building collapsed
on me or anything. I'll take them again.

628
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,506
Atrium's oozing.

629
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,679
Another 2-0, I'll
oversew the purse string.

630
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:03,975
V-fib.

631
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,615
Charge to 30.

632
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,148
I love you so much.

633
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,619
Come on!

634
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,455
Clear.

635
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,898
Clear.

636
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:24,196
- No change.
- Okay. Teflon pledgets.

637
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,834
Oh, there's blood
pouring out of her ET tube.

638
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,565
DIC. More platelets and FFP!

639
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,141
Clear!

640
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:36,207
Asystole. CORDAY:
Resume cardiac massage.

641
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,476
- Mig of atropine!
- You can stop.

642
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,244
She's gone.

643
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,840
Kerry.

644
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,910
Can you take it out?

645
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,350
- By law, we're not supposed to...
- Please.

646
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,315
Of course.

647
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,781
I'm so sorry.

648
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,657
We wanted more.

649
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,665
I had to twist her
arm to have a baby...

650
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:08,434
but once Henry was here,
she said, "I can do this.

651
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,441
Eight more and we got a team."

652
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,471
Sandy had a big family.

653
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:22,751
I only had her... and Henry.

654
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,283
What am I supposed to do now?

655
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,100
Would you like me
to talk to the family?

656
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,168
No.

657
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,599
No, I'll go do it.

658
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,027
Hey, you hiding out
or taking inventory?

659
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,187
Oh, just looking for Reglan.

660
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,559
You leaving?

661
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,463
I've been ordered to sit
on my sofa for five weeks.

662
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,729
Sounds good to me.

663
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,701
Yeah, I bet.

664
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,673
Do people know?

665
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,505
No, not really.

666
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,807
You prefer it that way?

667
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,574
You know...

668
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:27,885
Look, what you did was stupid...

669
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:31,581
but there were a lot of circumstances
that conspired to kill Luis Sanchez.

670
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,351
The nursing home should
have put a medic alert on him.

671
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,724
You should have gotten a
full med list, but you didn't.

672
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,025
If it goes to court, the Army
will send me back to testify.

673
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,759
No, I doubt it'll happen.

674
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,103
People don't sue
doctors they like.

675
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:49,605
And for whatever reason,
Mrs. Sanchez liked you.

676
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,072
Take care of yourself
over there, okay?

677
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,773
Yeah.

678
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:02,215
You have a healthy,
happy baby, Dr. Lewis.

679
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,315
Hey.

680
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,985
- You get called in early?
- No.

681
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,814
My shift doesn't
start for an hour.

682
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:40,754
I wanted to see you. Maybe we
can get a coffee or something?

683
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,556
Sandy Lopez died today.

684
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:52,671
- Who?
- Weaver's Sandy.

685
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,332
Take care of yourself,
Dr. Kovac. Sam.

686
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,033
Ace.

687
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:03,148
- So how long have you got?
- Here?

688
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,341
- About an hour.
- On your tour of duty?

689
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,323
A year at least. Maybe longer.

690
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,618
So you're just gonna sneak
out in the cover of darkness?

691
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,026
No "Hi," "Bye," "Kiss
my ass." Nothing.

692
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:22,793
- You know, I'm not much for sendoffs.
- I don't care what you call it.

693
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,265
There's a war going on.

694
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,068
Gonna miss having
you around, man.

695
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:38,980
- Yeah, right.
- No, I'm serious. You're an honorable guy.

696
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,318
I'm not sure I've ever met one.

697
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,384
Don't go getting
yourself killed.

698
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,850
Alex?

699
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,881
Alex?

700
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,053
Alex, get out here.

701
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,922
Mom, guess what.

702
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,829
Alex, turn it down, okay? I've had a
crappy day, and I got a major headache.

703
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,228
You look good, though.

704
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,034
Dad's here.

705
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,899
Is there anything I can do?

706
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,036
Need me to watch Henry,
or do you need a ride home?

707
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:12,041
He's with Sandy's family.

708
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,114
Dr. Weaver.

709
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,381
It's okay.

710
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,420
Dr. Weaver, it's okay.

711
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,064
It's okay.

712
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,572
It's okay.

713
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,756
- Got anything else?
- No, that's about it.

714
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,283
You'll need this.

715
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,626
Rabbit's foot.

716
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,465
It's American for
good luck, isn't it?

717
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,295
Thanks.

718
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,271
You're welcome.

719
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,452
You'd better come back.
You know that, don't you?

720
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,622
Yeah, I will.

721
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:41,798
You just better be a damn
good doctor when I do.

722
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,304
You ready?

723
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,780
Bye, Michael.

724
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,793
- Hi, Eduardo.
- Hey.

725
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,562
I'm here to get
Henry. Is he awake?

726
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,970
Hey, listen. He's not here. I think
he's with my aunt or something.

727
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,373
No, no. You told
me that Theresa...

728
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:03,709
It's nothing personal, okay? I
mean, I always really liked you.

729
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:07,811
Wait a minute. You said that
Theresa was taking care of him.

730
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,351
We're his blood relatives.

731
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,414
What are you talking about? What's
going on here? Where's Henry?

732
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,889
I don't know.

733
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,219
Where is my son?

734
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,863
Sandy's son.

735
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:23,499
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

736
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:26,502
I don't understand what you're
talking about. Where is he?

737
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:30,741
- I hear him.
- No, that's mine.

738
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,570
- No! Let me in. Let me inside.
- No.

739
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:33,938
- I know my own son...
- No.

740
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,605
- No, no, Kerry. He's not...
- No! Let me in! I know my son's voice!

741
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,080
Why won't you let me inside?

742
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,651
- I'm really sorry, okay?
- Please! Please!

743
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,118
- No!
- Why are you doing this?

744
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,591
Why are you doing
this? Let me in!

745
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,624
That is my baby! Give me my son!

746
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,097
Give me back my son!
