1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:05,885
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,507
I work nights at a burger joint.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,905
Caught myself by putting
my hands on the grill.

4
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,909
Too young to have
high blood pressure.

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,672
- This is my dad.
- Hi.

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,083
Longer you stay, harder it's
gonna be on him when you leave.

7
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,948
Well, maybe I
won't leave this time.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,988
She left the money to me.
She left the house to me.

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,955
She trusted me to make the
right decisions for the future.

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,960
I doubt she'd agree that's
what you're doing now.

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,126
Pleasure meeting you.

12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,496
I look forward to getting
the wedding announcement.

13
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,971
- What else did we get?
- Another book...

14
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,976
from...

15
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,478
Elizabeth Corday.
Elizabeth. Who's that?

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,279
Surgeon. British.

17
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,389
<i>The American Way of Birth.</i>

18
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:58,757
Don't let Dr. Ford
catch you reading that.

19
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,189
Oh, yeah? Why not?

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,353
Because it argues that the shift
from home births and midwives...

21
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:08,559
to hospital births and C-sections is
the result of American OBs' greed.

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,802
- All right, what do you think?
- I'll read it today.

23
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,967
- No, about the paint.
- Oh...

24
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,472
Maybe something with more blue.

25
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,639
Maybe?

26
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,651
You know, Americans are way
too neurotic and technology-reliant.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,688
I mean, with all your
money and equipment...

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,485
your infant mortality
rate is still terrible.

29
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,959
Oh, you'd rather be back in Kivu,
giving birth on a concrete floor?

30
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,622
You're, like, 34th or
something, behind Guam.

31
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,893
I like the second one.

32
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,039
Mm. Too much gray.

33
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,906
Well, why don't we ask George?

34
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,544
- Oh. George?
- You don't like George?

35
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,011
- Oh, please.
- I like George.

36
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:58,016
It's the name of first president of
the United States, the quiet Beatle.

37
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,915
The current occupant
of the White House.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,146
Well, no name is
perfect. Hey, George.

39
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,257
It's Dad.

40
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,154
Say, listen, would
you rather be born...

41
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,591
on the filthy dirt floor
of a primitive mud hut...

42
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,162
in Central Africa, or...?

43
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,265
I do not live in a mud hut.

44
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,266
Or in a modern hospital...

45
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:19,634
surrounded by the finest doctors
and equipment in the world?

46
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,373
Kick once for America,
twice for the mud hut.

47
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,708
- I resent your characterization...
- Shh. He's deciding.

48
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,873
- He's not deciding.
- He's deciding.

49
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,713
- You know what, he's sleeping.
- No.

50
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,453
- I'm back.
- Hey, you get there in time?

51
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,291
Yeah. It's a
nice-looking school.

52
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,127
It's kind of heavy-duty
security, though.

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,293
They have a drug shootout
there recently or something?

54
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,272
What the hell is this?

55
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,775
Honey, you knew what that
was when I met you at 15.

56
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,242
Where did he get it?

57
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,315
He saw it with my stuff, and
he wanted to know what it was.

58
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,474
So you gave it to him?

59
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,154
- He knows not to take it to school.
- A condom?

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,380
Hey, look. Come
on, I'm sorry, all right?

61
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,720
It's no big deal. I shouldn't have
had the thing in my damn pocket.

62
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,926
Picked up a few, just in case.

63
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,594
- You're not on the pill right now, right?
- Me?

64
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,466
A boy can dream, can't he?

65
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,197
You look good, baby.

66
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,263
I missed you.

67
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,303
- What are you doing?
- What you like.

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,472
It's still what
you like, isn't it?

69
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,149
No. I gotta go finish laundry.

70
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,418
Hey, can you hang with Alex
tonight? I got something I gotta do.

71
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,254
A date?

72
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,754
Yeah, sure.

73
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,533
I can't believe we
graduate tomorrow.

74
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,331
Neither can future patients.
Today, ill-prepared students.

75
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,475
Tomorrow, doctors with the fate
of countless helpless victims...

76
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,870
in capable hands.

77
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,171
They ought to make
them wear caution signs.

78
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,507
"Danger: New Doc" in
big letters on your coats.

79
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,944
Thanks for the pep talk.

80
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,142
Happy to lend
encouragement to the newbies.

81
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,547
- Jerk.
- Bastard.

82
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,777
Putz.

83
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,074
How long will it take me to
get to O'Hare at midnight?

84
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,149
- Midnight?
- My family's arriving from London.

85
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,536
- I had to get the cheapest flight.
- How many are coming?

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,858
- Nineteen.
- How many?

87
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,465
Really. Eighteen if my uncle's hip
is still dodgy. Your families coming?

88
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,964
Father and mother, Dad's
new wife, Mom's new boy...

89
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:32,197
- Abby, any family jetting in?
- No. We're not that close.

90
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,865
We're more like survivors of a particularly
brutal carjacking than a family.

91
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,035
Hello, ladies. Let's get a
move on. It's your last chance...

92
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,979
to learn something before you start
screwing up your malpractice premiums.

93
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,382
- Wanker.
- Turd.

94
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,043
Dick.

95
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,032
- Is Alex coming with us?
- No.

96
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,800
It'd be fine with me if he did.

97
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,604
- Just you and me.
- Where do you wanna go?

98
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,771
Just hang out. I miss you.

99
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,609
Eighty-five-year-old male,
combative and uncooperative...

100
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,813
wandering around
naked at board and care.

101
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,549
Give me my watch
back, you bastards!

102
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,786
- Thinks we took his watch.
- I want it back, you son of a bitch!

103
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,157
It's on his wrist.

104
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,455
- You want restraints?
- Not yet.

105
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,898
- CBC, chem panel, UA and chest x-ray.
- Somebody call the cops.

106
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,301
And let's see if we can find
a reason for his deterioration.

107
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,236
Hey, back so soon?

108
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,138
- Lucky me, huh?
- Abby, you free?

109
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,246
What, everybody just decide to
not file anything for two months?

110
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,180
Frank, my man. Ha-ha!
Thank God you're back.

111
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,819
You start blubbering, I
swear I'm gonna smack you.

112
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,513
- Back to work already?
- Wife threw me out of the house.

113
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,126
I think I was getting on her nerves.
She was definitely getting on mine.

114
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,680
- John?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:05,849
- God, how long have I been asleep?
- About an hour.

116
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,419
- Here, drink this.
- No, thanks.

117
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,164
- No, really, I don't want it.
- Come on, come on, come on.

118
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:20,466
- You been doing your kick counts?
- What? No.

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,474
The baby squirms
like mad all the time.

120
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,208
You've been reading
too many books.

121
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,178
I'll count, okay?

122
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,251
Just go do something useful.
Unpack a box, paint, do something.

123
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,546
- Go, go.
- Okay, okay.

124
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,323
Dr. Pratt, remember that kid with
high blood pressure last week?

125
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,224
- Nope.
- Burnt his hands on a grill?

126
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,560
His belly CT came back. No pheo,
no coarc, no renal artery stenosis.

127
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,895
Nothing indicates cause
for high blood pressure.

128
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,560
- So?
- He has primary hypertension.

129
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,729
What? That big kid
who flips burgers?

130
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:56,104
- What'd you tell him on discharge?
- To lose weight, get some exercise.

131
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,245
Gave him a scrip for
hydrochlorothiazide.

132
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,539
And referred him to
Family Medicine Clinic.

133
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:04,583
- Voilà. You're a miracle worker.
- Look at his cardiac echo.

134
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,380
- Left ventricular hypertrophy.
- You call the clinic?

135
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,853
- He hasn't made an appointment.
- Call and remind him.

136
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,788
He has end-organ damage. He
could have CHF or arrhythmia.

137
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,622
Neela, he's a kid, okay?
That would take decades.

138
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:20,130
Call him, tell him to get his butt to
the clinic sometime before he's 30.

139
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,034
No fever, no pneumonia, no UTI.

140
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,367
- Something metabolic?
- Pulse ox is 98.

141
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,704
Sodium's okay. Sugar's
normal. No anion gap.

142
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,972
- Mr. Ferguson, you have to stay in bed.
- I have to go feed the cat.

143
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,379
We'll make sure the cat's taken
care of, but you have to stay in bed.

144
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,384
- What else? ABBY: Uh,
could be toxic ingestion...

145
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,285
but there's no toxidrome. I think
it's just a worsening of his dementia.

146
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,985
Five hundred cc saline bolus
and D5 half at 100 an hour?

147
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,960
Yep. You graduate tomorrow?

148
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,932
- Eight short years later, yeah.
- You got your boards results yet?

149
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,400
- No. MORRIS: Dr. Kovac,
you got a minute?

150
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,833
They gonna let you graduate?

151
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,838
I can walk, but I don't get
my diploma until I pass.

152
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:06,980
- You haven't passed your boards yet?
- I took them last week.

153
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,083
Wow, I had to take mine, like,
six months before my graduation.

154
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,980
Morris, what do you need?

155
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,417
Hey, Malik. Can you hang 500
saline for the old guy in Exam 3?

156
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,752
- You got it.
- Dr. Corday is a surgeon.

157
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,326
She'd be on the sixth floor.

158
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,656
I went there first. They
told me to come here.

159
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,493
- Yeah? Well, they were wrong.
- Rachel?

160
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,667
- Jerry, how've you been?
- Oh, my God. Look at you.

161
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:33,773
- You're all grown up.
- Frank, you remember Rachel, right?

162
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,670
Rachel Greene.

163
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,368
Dr. Greene's daughter. - Oh!

164
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,514
No bleeding, right, and no
contractions? Nothing hurts?

165
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,946
Hey, slow down, honey.
You're scaring me.

166
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,848
Did your membranes rupture?
Could've happened in the shower.

167
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,980
I saw Dr. Ford yesterday,
and the membranes are fine.

168
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,683
Hey, you can't park here.

169
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,456
- It's okay. I'm a doctor.
- Good for you. You gotta move it.

170
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,963
It's a tow-away zone!

171
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,199
All right, thank you.

172
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,532
When he does come in, would
you get him to call me back, please?

173
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,368
Thanks. Bloody hell.

174
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,874
"Bloody hell" already?
It's not even lunchtime.

175
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,378
I'm trying to find a hypertensive
17-year-old with end-organ damage.

176
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,039
No answer at home. Hasn't
turned up for work, either.

177
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,415
Organ damage in a hypertensive
teenager? Is that even possible?

178
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:26,058
- Anybody know whose patient that is?
- Mine.

179
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:30,163
Malik. Larry Godiva's taking
another afternoon stroll. Thank you.

180
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,196
One of you Samantha Taggart?

181
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,531
- You a process server?
- No.

182
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,693
Then that's me.

183
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,832
Better eat them quick. They
gonna start melting soon.

184
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,271
- Ice cream?
- Anybody want a sundae?

185
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,910
Somebody sent you ice cream?

186
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,048
Yeah, she's here right now.

187
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,413
Uh, with a boy, yeah.

188
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,077
BJ. Right, okay.

189
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,414
All right, thanks, bye.

190
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,757
- I called your mother.
- How is she?

191
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,264
She's surprised you're here.

192
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,165
BJ, could you give us
a few minutes, please?

193
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:16,635
Cafeteria's on the first floor. Could
you get me some fries, Diet Coke?

194
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,175
Cool.

195
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,945
- You good?
- Yeah, fine, thanks.

196
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,943
So your mother tells me that
you're not living at home anymore.

197
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,954
- Moved in with a friend from school.
- Living with her family?

198
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,786
No, got our own place. How's
Ella? Can't wait to see her...

199
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,451
Excuse me, Elizabeth. Can
I borrow you for a moment?

200
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,460
Yeah. I'll be right back.

201
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,623
I've got a bad mesenteric
occlusion. May need the O.R.

202
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,393
Fine, sure.

203
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,670
I got those Itzhak
Perlman tickets for Sunday.

204
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,637
- Shaw's first?
- Right, yeah, yeah.

205
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,642
- Where'd you say the patient was?
- Angiography suite.

206
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,303
I'll be right there.

207
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,310
Um, I'm sorry, Rachel. I
have to get back to work.

208
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,582
Who was that?

209
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,190
- Colleague, Dr. Lawson.
- Handsome.

210
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,349
- So we can stay with you, right?
- How long for?

211
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,524
Couple of days. I wanted to check
out U of I, maybe Northwestern.

212
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,665
You know you're always welcome.

213
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:20,837
- Separate bedrooms, of course.
- Of course.

214
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,676
I was 15 when we met.

215
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,314
I was scooping ice
cream at the mall...

216
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,974
little apron, white
hat, whole bit.

217
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,484
- Anything left?
- Help yourself.

218
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:38,614
Hey, you just had bypass
surgery, like, seven weeks ago.

219
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,192
A treat now and then is
not gonna kill anybody.

220
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,695
In your case, that little truism
might not be completely accurate.

221
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,890
Steve and his buddies
would come after work.

222
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,035
He was working
construction then.

223
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:53,537
He was all tan, sweaty,
little cowboy boots.

224
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,302
- How old was he?
- Twenty-three.

225
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:02,211
- And you were 15?
- Yep. Disgraceful, huh?

226
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,912
He'd come to my school...

227
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,886
and pick me up in this old Mustang
GTO he was always fixing up.

228
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,891
We'd go out driving or go
play "X-Men" in the arcade.

229
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,696
Lots of times, we'd just park
somewhere and steam up the windows.

230
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,232
And your parents had
nothing to say about this?

231
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,836
Pfft.

232
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,199
They had plenty to
say, but I didn't listen.

233
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:31,436
- So, what happened?
- Alex happened.

234
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,348
When was the last time you
were sure you felt the baby move?

235
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,450
In the bath, this morning.

236
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,082
- No bleeding, no cramping?
- No.

237
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,887
A little buzz here.

238
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,437
And again, a little buzz.

239
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,247
You sure you had that
positioned over the head?

240
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,077
Yes.

241
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,916
The amniotic-fluid
index? If she's got poly...

242
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,392
John, sit down.

243
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,291
Take Kem's hand.

244
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,800
I've been looking
for over five minutes.

245
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,471
There's no heartbeat.

246
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,307
There's no gross body movement.

247
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,074
There's no response to
acoustic stimulation. I'm sorry.

248
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,479
John. Kem.

249
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,642
I'm so sorry.

250
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,253
The baby died.

251
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,325
It could have been an
infection, a cord accident...

252
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,159
erythroblastosis, preeclampsia.

253
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,823
We may never know.

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,198
I'm gonna admit you so we
can get started on induction.

255
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,362
An induction?

256
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,907
We should get this baby
out as fast as possible.

257
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,806
I have to go through labor?

258
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,074
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,977
I'll go order the epidural and
get started on your paperwork.

260
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,062
Vicki?

261
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,038
- Blood pressure was fine.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,904
- Rh-positive, she's afebrile.
- We're gonna do an autopsy...

263
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,443
after the delivery and
see what we can find.

264
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:50,615
I'll ripen the cervix with misoprostol.
We'll start Pitocin about four hours after.

265
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,187
- How long will that take?
- Twelve to 24 hours.

266
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:58,017
Sometimes it's longer
for first-time moms.

267
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,729
- LV wall thickness is 18.
- Is this Burger Boy again?

268
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,963
Called in sick at work. No
one's answering at home.

269
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,973
Seventeen-year-olds do not have
trouble with high blood pressure.

270
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,078
Left ventricular hypertrophy in
teens can lead to heart failure.

271
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,271
And sudden death
from cardiac arrhythmia.

272
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,710
You're a cardiologist now?

273
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,909
- I looked it up on the internet.
- Everything on the internet is true.

274
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,385
I wanna go by his house and see if
he's there. He lives 10 minutes away.

275
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:33,219
I can take a BP cuff, some
IV supplies and oxygen.

276
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,487
Don't forget a thoracotomy tray in
case he needs a heart transplant.

277
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,394
Where does he live?
Morgan Taylor Homes?

278
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,263
Ha! Bring an armored personnel
carrier and a squad of Rangers.

279
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,598
- You can't go in there.
- I'm taking my lunch.

280
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,240
- I'll be back in 30 minutes.
- Hey, Mother Teresa.

281
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,309
I get off at 6. I'll take you.
But you owe me vindaloo after.

282
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,503
Who's got the geriatric flasher?

283
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,171
- Ferguson has dementia.
- Had him in self-restraints.

284
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,283
- Keeps getting loose.
- Use the Posey vest.

285
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,853
I don't wanna see his "wee Willy
Wonka" wagging around here anymore.

286
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,253
- I'll go make sure he's okay.
- Nail him to the bed if you have to.

287
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,417
Hey, Kovac, Security's on the
line. They say your car alarm's...

288
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,257
going off in the garage.
It's driving them crazy.

289
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,959
So you like Indian food?

290
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,798
I love Indian food: chicken
tikka, masala, naan. I love it.

291
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,203
When you open your match letter,
maybe I can take you out to celebrate.

292
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,867
- Might not be anything to celebrate.
- You're gonna do great. You're smart...

293
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,810
cute. You work your ass off.
Got nothing to worry about.

294
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,279
Not like Lockhart.

295
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,475
Some residency program's
gonna get a shock...

296
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,621
when they find she
hasn't passed boards.

297
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,949
- I need to go and see a patient.
- So are we on?

298
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,149
Sure, maybe.

299
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,665
Your TV control is here,
on-button, volume, channels.

300
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,302
It's gonna feel a little tight.

301
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,201
This is the call button, straight to
nurses' station. If you need anything...

302
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,000
- All set.
- You thirsty?

303
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,877
I'll get you some ice chips.

304
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,196
Hey.

305
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,858
You know, your
alarm's a little sensitive.

306
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,765
You might wanna raise the
motion-detection threshold a bit.

307
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,539
It's a nice ride.

308
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,103
- What'd it set you back?
- What do you want?

309
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,108
The sports package.

310
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,679
Should hold up
pretty good on resale.

311
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,723
I really screwed this
thing up with my family.

312
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,358
But I'm gonna make
it right this time.

313
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,690
And I need time
to make it right.

314
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,000
Let Sam see how
much I've changed.

315
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,627
Time to be a father to my son.

316
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,609
We belong together,
Sam, Alex and I.

317
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,571
And Sam knows that.

318
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,114
You paid that kid $10
to stay with your car?

319
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,724
I want there to be wheels
on there when we get back.

320
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,121
Thanks for doing this.

321
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,421
He's here, we yell at
him to get to the clinic.

322
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,758
If not, just leave a
note, and that's it, okay?

323
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,925
- Lifts are over there, I think.
- Trust me, the elevators don't work.

324
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,274
- Thirty-nine, right?
- Yeah.

325
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,842
So much wire mesh.

326
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,688
So they don't throw
things on folks below.

327
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,340
- Like trash?
- Like bricks.

328
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,179
Nobody's home. Got the note?

329
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,289
Come on, would
you? I'm starving.

330
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,425
- Elgin?
- Great.

331
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,154
It's Neela from the hospital.

332
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,664
I just get a little winded
climbing the stairs. It's no big deal.

333
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,167
- You remember Dr. Pratt, right?
- What's up, man?

334
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,431
You been taking your
hydrochlorothiazide? Why not?

335
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,804
Because you told me if I
exercised a little, I'll feel better.

336
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,141
I said you could stop taking it in six
months if you exercised and lost weight.

337
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,648
- Is that dinner? Cheeseburgers.
- Yeah.

338
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:22,585
My mother's working tonight. I have to
pick up the kids from Ms. Johnson at 7.

339
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,585
158/94.

340
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,887
Can someone look after the kids so you
can come to the hospital for more tests?

341
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,894
- I'm feeling okay.
- Take your pills.

342
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,533
Come in next week for a
blood pressure check, okay?

343
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,000
- All right. Thanks, doc.
- You got it.

344
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,030
He needs an EKG
and a chest x-ray.

345
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,802
He needs to pick up his family
and get them fed. You found him.

346
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,205
You told him what he needs.

347
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,541
Unless you plan on adopting
the kid, let's get something to eat.

348
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,683
What time is your
graduation ceremony?

349
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,341
Noon.

350
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,249
- You're not gonna go?
- I'm off.

351
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,981
Thanks, but no. It's boring.

352
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,752
It's boring, and I'm not even
sure I'm gonna go myself.

353
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,360
To your own graduation?

354
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,759
Yes. It seems pointless
considering the fact...

355
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,868
that I might not actually get to practice
medicine, so I would rather no one come.

356
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,028
- Abby, got a minute?
- Yeah.

357
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,175
But thanks.

358
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:23,275
- Anything new on Henry?
- No, no, uh, thank you.

359
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,112
Abby, did you get confirmation
of your match list yet?

360
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,277
Couple of weeks ago, yeah.

361
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,651
Well, with your clinical skills,
I'm sure you'll do very well.

362
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:40,690
Off the record, I can tell you
that we ranked you in our top 20.

363
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,859
If County's top of your list,
you're guaranteed to match here.

364
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,801
I thought we weren't
supposed to talk about that.

365
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,674
No. No, of course not.

366
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,409
You found out I
failed my boards.

367
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,284
Well, I took them
again last week.

368
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:06,255
The hypothetical concern would
be that if you don't pass again...

369
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,452
and you match with a program,
whatever that program might be...

370
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,063
you would be ineligible
to begin your internship.

371
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:15,065
And the program
would be short an intern.

372
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:20,297
Programs can still delete applicants
from their match lists until Friday.

373
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,965
That way, the applicant would
match with his or her second choice.

374
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:29,775
And if he or she didn't pass their boards,
the second-choice program would be...

375
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,615
the hospital short a body.

376
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:41,421
Well, I guess if
that happened, um...

377
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,629
If that happened, the applicant that
was deleted would lodge a complaint...

378
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,099
with the National Board indicating
he or she'd been approached...

379
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,603
by the chief of staff in
violation of clearly stated rules...

380
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,638
governing how
matches are conducted.

381
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,149
- Hey. Where to? I'm starving.
- Hey.

382
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,720
Um, I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

383
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,825
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah, fine. I'm just...

384
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,188
just tired.

385
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,523
This have something
to do with Steve?

386
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,030
Because I keep telling him he's
gotta find another place to crash.

387
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,130
I just think it's maybe
confusing for Alex.

388
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,172
Alex isn't confused.

389
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,871
It's not that simple.

390
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,014
Can I give you a lift?

391
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,914
No, that's okay.

392
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:15,381
Hey, it's morning in Kinshasa.
You want me to call your family?

393
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,115
Kem, do you want
me to call your family?

394
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,728
You sure?

395
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,567
- What's that?
- Have you told anybody?

396
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:41,039
No. No. Been here with you.

397
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,849
I don't want anyone to know.

398
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,419
Okay...

399
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,218
- You didn't restock.
- No, I didn't.

400
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:57,056
- Just restock when you use something.
- I will, when I actually use it.

401
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,630
You need anything? Do you?

402
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:10,866
I don't want anyone
to know, okay?

403
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:17,808
- Ella's asleep?
- Mm-hm.

404
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,815
Guy named Dave called.

405
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,319
Wanted to know if you were
still up for a movie Saturday night.

406
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:27,927
He has a daughter,
the same school as Ella.

407
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:32,087
Guy at the hospital,
tall British guy.

408
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,257
- You dating him too?
- How are you liking school?

409
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,827
- Don't worry. I'm going to college.
- Do I look worried?

410
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,671
My mom's worried.

411
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,504
Rachel, why are you here?

412
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,276
I just wanna look at
a couple of colleges.

413
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,644
I need a prescription
for Plan B.

414
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,486
The, uh, morning-after pill?

415
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,123
Why didn't you
go to your mother?

416
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,564
Five centimeters, 100 percent
effaced. You're moving along.

417
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,733
- How much longer?
- Hard to say. Hours still.

418
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,502
My legs are completely numb.

419
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,014
We can turn the epidural down. I'll
come back and check on your progress.

420
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,057
I'm gonna go get a cup
of coffee or something.

421
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,167
You'll be okay for a
couple of minutes?

422
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,711
One more big push.

423
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,044
That's it. Push.

424
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:06,954
Push. That's it. Good.

425
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,118
Long night, huh?

426
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,061
- Yeah.
- Your first?

427
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,565
- Yeah.
- I got three already.

428
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,726
All girls.

429
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:20,805
This one gonna be a girl too.

430
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,440
Even our cat's a girl.

431
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,537
You know what time it is?

432
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,775
- Yeah. It's almost midnight.
- Midnight.

433
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,410
I am dying for a cigarette. But
you gotta go all the way down...

434
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,615
halfway across the building to
get to one of them smoking areas.

435
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,263
So I'll probably see you
around the hallway later on, huh?

436
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,092
- Good luck.
- You too.

437
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:54,571
Didn't mention anything
about the ice cream.

438
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,732
It was a big hit.

439
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:02,278
- God, you're beautiful, Sam.
- Yeah, this is me at my finest.

440
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,109
No, really.

441
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,481
- You're all grown up.
- You're drunk.

442
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,486
A little bit.

443
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:16,459
Hey, did you go to the hospital
and say something to Luka?

444
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,463
Sam, I want another chance.

445
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,767
Well, I don't want you
going to the hospital, okay?

446
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,964
I gotta get up early.

447
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,803
Come on. Steve.

448
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,479
Do you remember those cottonwood
trees down by the river we used to go to?

449
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,052
Used to lay under those trees
for hours, just drinking Schnapps...

450
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,713
and rum-and-Cokes with no ice.

451
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:50,352
Making love, Dave Matthews...

452
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,189
coming from my car stereo.

453
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,896
Listen, Steve. Please.

454
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:06,545
Sammy, I love you,
sweetie. I love you, Sammy.

455
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,509
Please, Steve.

456
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,359
Please, Steve, what?

457
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,326
Let me... Let me by, please.

458
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,626
- I can't feel anything.
- Head's almost out.

459
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,729
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

460
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,300
- Bear down. Hard as you can.
- Shoulder's out.

461
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,028
- I got it. I got it.
- It's almost over.

462
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,901
He's out. He's out. It's over.

463
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,168
True knot. Clamp.

464
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,240
Your baby twisted and squirmed
in such a way that he tied a knot...

465
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,782
in his umbilical cord.

466
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,251
Send 5 cc's of cord blood
to the lab for Rh factor.

467
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,891
There's nothing you could
have done to prevent this.

468
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,231
Not genetic. It's
not an infection.

469
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,232
It was just bad luck.

470
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,638
- Would you like to see him?
- No. No.

471
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,237
Are you sure?

472
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,621
John?

473
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,502
It's okay, son.

474
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,108
It's okay.

475
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,481
- Stillborn?
- Yeah, true knot in the cord.

476
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,643
- Oh, how terrible.
- Oh, I can't even imagine.

477
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,313
- I'll try and get up there after rounds.
- Those poor people.

478
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,050
- Seven months old?
- Almost eight.

479
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,387
Yeah, tough break.

480
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,997
What? I was being sincere.

481
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,067
This is the admit area
where we keep track...

482
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,328
of all of the patients
we have in the ER.

483
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,633
That's Jerry. He makes this
whole place work, and he's very big.

484
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,868
That's Frank, works with Jerry.
Had a massive heart attack and...

485
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,842
shouldn't be eating that
doughnut. And this is the ER staff.

486
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,506
- Staff, this is my family.
- Nice to meet you.

487
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,551
Okay, well, lovely
to see you all.

488
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,916
Down this way are the
trauma and exam rooms...

489
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,355
where we save the lives of
unfortunate souls who end up here.

490
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:11,861
On a busy shift, we'll see over 120
patients, sometimes as many as 200.

491
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,491
Back there is the Suture Room,
where we attend to minor skin wounds.

492
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,228
That's a naked patient.
Let's step through this way.

493
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,737
- Is that too tight?
- No, it's fine.

494
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,889
Would you like a lock?

495
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,228
To keep?

496
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,746
Good morning. You look radiant.

497
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,415
Liar. I was up half the night.

498
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:15,925
Doing what, one might wonder?

499
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:20,255
I was hoping you could
do me a very large favor.

500
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,764
Will there be a
very large reward?

501
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,301
I need you to write me
up a scrip for Reglan...

502
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,269
Yasmin and two
packets of Plan B.

503
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,776
John?

504
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:46,620
I'm off in a few minutes. I asked
them to get a room for you downstairs.

505
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,623
I wanna watch Kem
for the rest of the day.

506
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,785
Just make sure
there's no bleeding.

507
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,462
Has she held the baby yet?

508
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,798
I've been doing this
for over 20 years.

509
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,839
There's nothing more difficult
than what you've been through.

510
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,842
But if Kem doesn't say
goodbye to her child...

511
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,845
she will regret it for
the rest of her life.

512
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,013
And a three-month supply
of oral contraceptives.

513
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,954
- Birth control pills?
- You'll still need to use condoms.

514
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,789
- Who's Dr. Lawson?
- He's a friend.

515
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,453
Why didn't you do it?

516
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,189
When your mother
discovers these...

517
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,893
in your dresser drawer, I'd rather
she didn't know they came from me.

518
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,164
Lawson. Was he that
British guy from yesterday?

519
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,536
Your gynecologist back
home can write you a refill...

520
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,405
for the Yasmin when it runs out.

521
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,241
Do you like him more than
the guy from Ella's school?

522
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,080
Rachel.

523
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,353
They're both nice, you know, but it's
just an occasional meal. It's a movie.

524
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:54,549
You know, I have Ella.
I'm very busy with my work.

525
00:34:56,027 --> 00:35:00,362
It's okay. Dad would've
wanted you to be happy.

526
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,364
Do you miss him?

527
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,033
Yeah.

528
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,340
Yeah, I do.

529
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,910
Me too.

530
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:28,555
I appreciate you both coming.
But you should go home.

531
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:33,292
I don't want you to miss your
graduation. That is today, right?

532
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,991
I was gonna miss it anyway.

533
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,464
They didn't have any bagels,
but the coffee was fresh.

534
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,006
I was just saying, Dad, how much I
appreciate you guys all being here...

535
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,578
but I think that we're okay.

536
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,815
And, um... I think
you guys can go.

537
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,623
Okay.

538
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,160
You know, if you...

539
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:05,822
<i>I know.</i>

540
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,567
You too, Dad. You can go.

541
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,440
Oh, thanks. I think I'll stay.

542
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,256
Lester, have you seen Abby?
Abby. Have you seen her?

543
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,914
No.

544
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,575
Kem?

545
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,811
They want us to move
to another room soon.

546
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,648
And they're gonna take
the baby when we go.

547
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:15,159
Would you like to hold him?

548
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,333
Campbell, Edward
Barrington the third.

549
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:30,505
Ann Marie Barstow.

550
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,118
Corazon, Linda Benitez.

551
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,022
Bennings, Jonathan Bett.

552
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,022
Hey.

553
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,223
- What did I miss?
- Molly Ivins gave a kick-ass speech.

554
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,389
- Who?
- They haven't gotten to Abby yet.

555
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,226
I thought you were on bed rest.

556
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,067
Please, I'm already a week late.
I am desperate to get this kid out.

557
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,274
Lily Yay Lin Chang.

558
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,281
Lee Son Chow.

559
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,118
Robert David Betterman.

560
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,419
- I can't breathe.
- Wet crackles to the apex.

561
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,459
He's in pulmonary
edema. Hey, I know you.

562
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,790
Pratt's patient? Pratt,
think this one's yours.

563
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,024
- Pulse ox is 78.
- He needs Lasix.

564
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,429
What's going on?

565
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,571
- 17-year-old with pulmonary edema.
- Elgin?

566
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,798
- We need a nitro spray.
- Had two in the field.

567
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,635
- Want an intubation tray?
- What? No.

568
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,439
- Just got a little hypertension.
- He has a little congestive heart failure.

569
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:38,049
Start a nitro drip at 40 mics
and 25 sublingual captopril.

570
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,242
- Sats dropping to low 80s.
- Page Cardiology.

571
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,751
We need a stat
echo down here now.

572
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,288
Never seen a kid this
young in heart failure before.

573
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:50,594
- I don't see Abby, do you?
- No, said she probably wouldn't come.

574
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,594
To her own graduation?

575
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:55,825
Lester Rodney Kertzenstein.

576
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,137
Andrashi Lapoor.

577
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,271
Abigail Marjorie Lockhart.

578
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,639
Congratulations.

579
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,809
Robin Jay Nancy.

580
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,514
Neela Rasgotra.

581
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:25,459
- Neela!
- Neela!

582
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,648
When your brother died...

583
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,984
the thing I hated the most
were other people's platitudes.

584
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,655
There are no words.

585
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:05,030
You don't know where you'll find
the strength, but somehow you do.

586
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,470
You can have another child.

587
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,175
It was an accident. A tragic...

588
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,504
unforeseeable accident.

589
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,581
The whole thing was an accident.

590
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,776
No, it wasn't.

591
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,482
You love each other.
Everybody can see that.

592
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,927
I don't know that she'll want
to have another baby with me.

593
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,299
Sure she will.

594
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,832
Just give it some time.

595
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,802
Abby?

596
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,035
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

597
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,205
Hey, this is so
great. Good for you.

598
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,176
We're gonna get something
to eat. Wanna join us?

599
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:56,412
- Um, no, I'm tired. But thanks.
- Okay.

600
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,886
And thank you guys for coming.

601
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:00,389
- See you at work.
- Okay.

602
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,624
I'll be back.

603
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,577
Hey, Mom, it's Abby.

604
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:27,242
No, no, everything's fine. We
just haven't talked in a while, so...

605
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,847
Yeah, it's good to hear
your voice too. Hey, Mom?

606
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,355
Guess what. I graduated today.

607
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,790
Really.

608
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,990
Can you believe it?

609
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,296
Kem.

610
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:53,100
They're gonna come down and
take us to our new room soon.

611
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,905
And when they come,
they're gonna take the baby...

612
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,574
and we're never
gonna see him again.

613
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,318
I don't know what the
right thing is to say.

614
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,028
I don't know what
the right thing to do is.

615
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,191
It was an accident.

616
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,399
It was nothing that you did wrong.
It was nothing that we did wrong.

617
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:25,440
It just happened.

618
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:34,642
I love you, and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

619
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:41,620
But we have to say
goodbye to our son now.

620
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,999
I have to help you to do that,
and I don't know how to do that.

621
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,195
Please, help me.

622
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,033
Please.

623
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,676
Yeah?

624
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,877
- He's beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

625
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,684
I love you so much.

626
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,685
I love you so much.
