00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,934
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,507
- What do you want?
- Foot rub.

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,713
I'll settle for coffee.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,750
I'm Gillian. I was working with
Luka and John in the Congo.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,947
- John asked Luka to give you this.
- He wrote me a letter?

6
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,389
- He wanted to explain why he stayed.
- I don't wanna talk about Carter.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,290
- Then why are you mad?
- I'm not mad.

8
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,796
I'm sure you'll find yourself a
new bang buddy. Good night.

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,525
You're not her doctor. When I
ask you not to do something, don't.

10
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,933
I hate my job.

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,640
Pardon me. Excuse me.

12
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,476
- Whoa, whoa, I need a paper.
- We're closed.

13
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,637
Come on, man, show me some love.

14
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,110
Come on.

15
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,752
Old news by now.

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,855
- Thanks. MAN: Excuse
me, coming through.

17
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,497
So she's had her bath?

18
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,162
Good. Good.

19
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:44,065
Yeah, could you put her on for
me so I could say good night?

20
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,279
Oh, um...

21
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,143
Okay, then. Well, give her a
kiss good night for me, then...

22
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,012
and I shall see
you in the morning.

23
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,786
No, I won't work too hard.

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,518
Yeah. Okay, bye.

25
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,192
Everything okay?

26
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,024
Yeah.

27
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,130
She's watching <i>Clifford.</i>

28
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:19,037
You know, everyone's
allowed a little downtime.

29
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,999
Even Ella's mother.

30
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,644
You disagree?

31
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,141
I don't know.

32
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,019
It's just, sneaking out
of the house like this...

33
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:40,451
it all feels a little unseemly.

34
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,526
You say unseemly, I say sexy.

35
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,966
- That too.
- Not to mention fun.

36
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:53,505
- Our shift starts in...
- My car's fast.

37
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,473
- You've just had a shower.
- Water's cheap.

38
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,578
You're half dressed.

39
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,373
You're not.

40
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,311
Mr. Drake in 2 is waiting
on a second troponin.

41
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,479
Psych needs to
evaluate the woman in 4...

42
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,251
who says she's been pregnant
for the past seven years.

43
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,588
- Eloise is back?
- With the mother of all yeast infections.

44
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,890
I gave her a
Fluconazole-Haldol cocktail.

45
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,260
Frequent flier?

46
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,697
Logs in more hours than
me, which is saying something.

47
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,564
- Have we met?
- No.

48
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,851
Damn, is everybody
new around here or what?

49
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,341
- Fresh out of nursing school.
- Or fresh off the boat.

50
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,501
I haven't seen anything like
this since shore leave in Manila.

51
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,045
- Think fast, truant.
- You still here, Weezy?

52
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,683
Hell, yeah. Home sweet
home, and right on time, buddy.

53
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,218
No, see, this is <i>mi
casa,</i> not <i>su casa.</i>

54
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,016
You're just visiting from
white-bread Iowa or wherever.

55
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,625
- It's white-bread Florida, actually.
- Hey, Pratt.

56
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,761
Is there a warfarin-phenobarb
interaction?

57
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,591
Up the warfarin, you've got
increased hepatic metabolism.

58
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,598
Secondly, I'll more than make
up for being a few minutes late.

59
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,531
And third, I'm not your buddy.

60
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,366
Hey, Coop. Cubbies, Friday night,
behind home plate, you and me?

61
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,939
Hell, yeah. Suds and dogs...

62
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,100
- I'm there, daddy.
- Cool.

63
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,801
You two gonna kiss next?

64
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,604
Ortho on line one for you.

65
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,579
Well, unless there's a phone
in the can, take a message.

66
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,484
Uh, Pratt? We have a rectal-mass
guy in 2 personally asking for you.

67
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,782
I have a man with
urticaria I need to present.

68
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,324
- Give me a minute.
- Can you supervise my pelvic exam?

69
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,392
- In a sec.
- What's the dose of IV Reglan?

70
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,622
- How many of you newbies are there?
- Med students? Lots of us.

71
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,131
- Am I the only second-year here?
- I'm sorry.

72
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,997
I didn't see Dr. Cooper. I
would've asked Dr. Morris, but...

73
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,139
He's stuck with a patient in 2.

74
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,473
The sprained ankle?

75
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,678
Damn it, Morris, I have 30
patients on the rack and 40 in Triage.

76
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,474
A little multitasking on
your part would be helpful.

77
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,585
You're not doing that clown
any favors by picking up his slack.

78
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,280
Okay, not a single chart's been
picked up in the past 45 minutes.

79
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,654
- It's called a work ethic, people.
- Since when is Weaver on graveyard?

80
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,489
God forbid you take a patient
the last hour of your shift.

81
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,155
- You might stay an extra 20 minutes.
- Once a month. Keeps up her skills.

82
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,460
I worked all day too,
you think I'm not tired?

83
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,434
Never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of miss Little Stumpy.

84
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,506
Pratt, you forgot to sign
your Q.A. forms last night.

85
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,174
Get me out of here!

86
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,606
You wanna grab this first?

87
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,872
- I'm off the clock.
- Come on, you heard Weaver.

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,608
- Open tibia fracture after a motorcycle...
- I never gave permission for this!

89
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,946
- You have his films?
- Right here. Name's Mathers...

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,452
and he's not a happy camper.

91
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,954
- How you doing?
- I don't wanna be in this hellhole!

92
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,525
- That's how I'm doing!
- Saint T's shipped him because...

93
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,821
They dumped me because
I don't have insurance.

94
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,861
You're here, sir,
because you require...

95
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,626
a higher level of care than
they're capable of giving.

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,201
I work for a living. I'm not
some County welfare case.

97
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,702
Hey, this look like TV to
you? What are you doing?

98
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,070
- Get a gram of Ancef and 6 of MS.
- God, I deserve better than this.

99
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,575
No, the best thing for
you was coming to County.

100
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,179
You're about to receive
Chicago's finest health care.

101
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,715
- Won't anyone help deliver my baby?
- Eloise, you've been pregnant...

102
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,149
for seven years, you
can wait 10 more minutes.

103
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,754
All right, listen up, listen up.

104
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,254
We're the A team, people.
You know what that means?

105
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,258
That means we have exactly
12 hours to clear this place out...

106
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,329
and show those quacks at
the day shift how it's done!

107
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,495
Most people are pleased...

108
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,075
with its lifelike appearance
and attention paid to detail...

109
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,244
They should've
clipped my nails, then.

110
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,980
With a minimum of motion...

111
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,955
your own muscle signals
will trigger the arm so that...

112
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,755
Yeah, I read the
brochure. Let's go.

113
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,329
To bend the arm, simply
contract your biceps.

114
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,992
That's it. Biceps
up, triceps down.

115
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,300
- Biceps up, triceps down.
- They pay you to state the obvious?

116
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:24,611
Okay. Pausing, as you just
did, causes the arm to lock.

117
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,007
How do you unlock it?

118
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,750
Well, it requires a quick co-contraction,
but that's too advanced for now.

119
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,851
We're not ready to
move on to the hand yet.

120
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,850
We don't have to.
How do you put it on?

121
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,784
Donning and doffing
are complex tasks.

122
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,256
- Harness first, or stump in the socket?
- Dr. Romano, it's late...

123
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:43,420
I want my damn arm, all right?
I've waited long enough! Let's go.

124
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,966
Screwy thing is, if I was on welfare,
Medicaid would've covered me, right?

125
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,830
- Right.
- Now, remember...

126
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,201
open fractures can lead to
gram-negative osteomyelitis...

127
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,272
which is why we add gentamicin.

128
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,276
- Veins are sclerosed.
- Excuse me.

129
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,346
Ever use IV drugs, Mr. Mathers?

130
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,142
Years ago. Doesn't mean I
should be butchered at County.

131
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,718
You're right. That's why we're gonna
have our best work your central line.

132
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,479
- Neela?
- Right.

133
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,558
- Wait. What is she, 10?
- No, almost 16.

134
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,558
Lester, I need
you to call Ortho.

135
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,493
Tell them that Dr. Pratt's
patient needs to be in the O.R...

136
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,895
no later than three
hours from now.

137
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:24,197
- It was a pleasure working with you, sir.
- Doesn't she need to be supervised?

138
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,804
Hey, Mike. Can you
spot this one for me, man?

139
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,173
- Hey.
- What?

140
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,311
I've had to take a
whiz since I got here.

141
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,309
Freddie, if you don't get up,
you're gonna lose your gurney...

142
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:41,478
- and spend the night on the floor.
- But I like a firm mattress.

143
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,556
- What's his blood alcohol?
- 0.429, but it smells a lot higher.

144
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,717
He's not going anywhere on his
own. Come on, up you go, Freddie.

145
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,693
- Anybody ever tell you you're beautiful?
- All the time. Come on.

146
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,026
Mag and thiamine,
keep him till he's sober...

147
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,532
and tell Housekeeping
there's vomit in the hall.

148
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,331
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- She new?

149
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,407
She's wearing white pants, isn't
she? Why, you wanna date her?

150
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,169
Hey, hold on, now. I thought
things were good between us.

151
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,041
Cards on the table, no hard
feelings. We talked about this.

152
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,681
Oh, no feelings whatsoever.

153
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,578
Pratt, ready for you to present.

154
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,185
- Okay. Let me take a leak first.
- No.

155
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,851
Rick Mathers, open
tib, on Ancef and gent.

156
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,014
Awaiting Ortho for
a washout and ORIF.

157
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,353
He has a history of
IVDA, needs a central line.

158
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,756
Better have more than that.

159
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:26,059
Exam 4, ureteral colic, waiting on a
CT urogram, pain-free with Toradol.

160
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,135
- How's his renal function?
- BUN, 15. Creatinine, 1.1.

161
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,365
Curtain 2, febrile PID, got foxy-doxy.
She's being admitted to GYN.

162
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:38,034
And in here we've got Betsy Wimbel,
28, exacerbation of Crohn's disease...

163
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,908
with abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Percocet's not touching her.

164
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,310
It's cramping again.

165
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,313
Another 100 of Demerol
for Betsy, please.

166
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,452
- Steroids?
- Gram of Solu-Medrol.

167
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,248
And I called GI to get her
admitted for intractable pain.

168
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,488
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,494
- Should be going upstairs any time now.
- Thank you, Dr. Pratt.

170
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,293
- I appreciate your going to bat for me.
- It's nothing. Anything for you, Betsy.

171
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,335
- I like your style, man.
- Oh, yeah? Well, get your own.

172
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,472
- Numb it! Numb it! ABBY:
Hold still, Mr. Mathers.

173
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,005
We're almost done.

174
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,633
- You aiming for the sternal notch?
- Still no flash.

175
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,280
All right, you're too
inferior. Aim more cephalad.

176
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,007
She has to avoid the subclavian artery.
- I know, I know.

177
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,584
- Ow! God!
- Here, let me try it.

178
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,584
- No.
- Are you following the landmarks?

179
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,916
- Yes.
- Oh, God!

180
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,254
- What's going on in here?
- They're stabbing me to death here!

181
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,987
- Four attempts at a central line.
- Here, I'll take that.

182
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,031
What, a Chink now? What
is this, the damn U.N.?

183
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,193
You aim above and posterior to
the index finger in the sternal notch.

184
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,804
Hello.

185
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,965
- Oh! God. NEELA:
I thought I was.

186
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,268
Advancing...

187
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,509
got a flash.

188
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,942
Guide wire.

189
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,174
I'm more comfortable
with the IJ approach.

190
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,785
Well, you need
to learn them both.

191
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,648
All right, I'm in.

192
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,120
Thank God somebody here
knows what they're doing.

193
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,849
Gallant, can you
sew it in for me?

194
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,085
- I was off an hour ago.
- Me too.

195
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,491
- She hates me, doesn't she?
- Who, Dr. Chen?

196
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,170
She thinks I'm interested
in her boyfriend, but I'm not.

197
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,232
- Should I talk to her?
- I would leave it alone.

198
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,841
- They broke up.
- She and Dr. Pratt? When?

199
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,739
Last week.

200
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,973
Let go of my sleeve, Freddie.

201
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,139
- But I love you.
- Dr. Chen?

202
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,376
Let's see if you feel
that way in the morning.

203
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,249
- Another 2 of lorazepam.
- Do you have a moment?

204
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,890
Uh, actually, I'm on my way out.

205
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:36,018
Put Freddie in Curtain 2 and give him
to Dr. Morris, wherever he is. Thank you.

206
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,031
We got off on the wrong foot, and
I'd very much like to remedy that.

207
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,725
What?

208
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:46,037
Dr. Pratt's a bit of a flirt, of
which I'm sure you're well aware...

209
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,540
but I want you to know, I
did nothing to bring it on.

210
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,338
In fact, I think he
rather can't help himself.

211
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,279
But if I did anything to worsen
the situation, I apologize.

212
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,942
And I hope you wouldn't penalize me
over something which I had no control.

213
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,850
- Penalize you?
- Be hard on me.

214
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,150
Show me up in
front of the others.

215
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,184
Um, look...

216
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,396
Neela.

217
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,123
I'm hard on all my med
students, especially the women...

218
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,291
because I have to
be, for their own good.

219
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:20,666
If I were you, I'd worry more about
my skills and less about Dr. Pratt.

220
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,242
All right, Mr. Costan's
discharged.

221
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,749
Mrs. Provost, admitted to
Cards. Lemony Jones is AMA.

222
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,548
And don't bother me unless you've
got some money for me, please.

223
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,558
- Who's got bigmouth Freddie?
- Chen assigned him to Morris.

224
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,388
Yeah, well, he's mine now.

225
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,230
- Keep pushing Ativan till he shuts up.
- Yeah, right.

226
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,464
- Jeez!
- One more patient.

227
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:51,900
No, not now. Later.

228
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,064
You won't even have to go very
far. He's right over here. His name is...

229
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,506
Hey, stop. Okay? Just stop.

230
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,970
Betsy, nobody's
been in to see you yet?

231
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,242
- No. Is it gonna be much longer?
- Let me get on the horn to GI...

232
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,649
and tell them my girl's tired of
waiting on her consult, okay?

233
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,779
- Can I talk now?
- Yeah, go ahead.

234
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,449
Ed Gamble, 28, developed an expressive
aphasia while fighting with his wife.

235
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,152
Stopped talking mid-sentence.
It was all very dramatic.

236
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,329
- I can talk now.
- Have you had a full neuro exam?

237
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,967
No, but my husband passed
the idiot test with flying colors.

238
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,769
Excuse me. What's up?

239
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,428
Weaver knows, but just in
case, dislocated shoulder...

240
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:27,938
check post-reduction film.

241
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,872
Pancreatitis, 30 grams of
morphine. Make sure he's breathing.

242
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,774
I'm gone unless
you need me to stay.

243
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,972
- Why would I need that?
- It's crazy busy and only one Attending...

244
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,879
- on the floor?
- No, I got it this.

245
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,520
- I was hoping you'd say that.
- For you. Morris is MIA.

246
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,156
He's got an LOL waiting
on a pelvic for over 14 hours.

247
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,882
- You leaving?
- Yeah, finally.

248
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,118
73-year-old female, chronic
emphysema, on home O2.

249
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,128
Told her granddaughter she
couldn't breathe, kid called 911.

250
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,459
- Ma'am, what's your name?
- Winnie Crawford.

251
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,569
- She's not moving air.
- Let's get Miss Crawford into Trauma 1.

252
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,170
- Abby?
- My shift's over.

253
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,638
You. You wanna
be a doctor? Move it!

254
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,635
By the way, your loan's
not going to go through.

255
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,304
Not with a FICO of 428.

256
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,910
They gave you my credit rating?

257
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:15,146
I saw the application on the fax. Couldn't
lease a moped with a score that low.

258
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,526
Get her on 100
percent non-rebreather.

259
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,161
- Is Grandma okay?
- We're trying to help her.

260
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,524
Hang a liter of saline.
We have an IV yet?

261
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,222
She doesn't like hospitals.

262
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,368
Working on it. Pressure's 86/52.

263
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,698
- Don't do that!
- I need a 7-0 tube and a Mack 3.

264
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,340
- Stop it!
- Somebody get her into the family room.

265
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,373
She wouldn't like it. She's DNR!

266
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,337
- What did you say?
- Sweetie...

267
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,376
do you know what DNR means?

268
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,182
She doesn't wanna be naked.

269
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,924
Hypoxic on 15 liters, respiratory
failure. We have to tube her.

270
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,790
Not if she's DNR. The child wouldn't
know the term unless it'd been discussed.

271
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,455
Doesn't matter. Without
documentation, we resuscitate.

272
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,467
Put her on a vent, she'll never come
off. Morphine and oxygen till we know.

273
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,628
Erika, do you know
where your parents are?

274
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,137
My mom's out with her boyfriend.

275
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,539
Okay, take her to the family
room. Get a number for the mom.

276
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,577
Come with me, all right?

277
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,139
Okay, shut your eyes
and don't let me open them.

278
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,612
You think it's bad?

279
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,650
- I asked for a divorce...
- You didn't ask.

280
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,880
And he starts with the mute act, a childish
variation on his cold-shoulder act.

281
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,055
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Excuse me.

282
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,562
Intubated benzo overdose,
waiting for an ICU bed.

283
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,960
Radiator-fluid burn needs
Thermazene dressing.

284
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,930
Incised thrombosed hemorrhoid
needs to go home for sitz bath.

285
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,299
- Why you telling me? Those are Morris'.
- I cannot find him.

286
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,440
- Plus, I'm late for dinner.
- Give it to me.

287
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,097
Thank you. Have a good night.

288
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,073
- Yeah.
- He's doing it again.

289
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,144
- He's doing what?
- Not talking.

290
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,804
Look, obviously this is Ed's
way of keeping me hooked.

291
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,576
That, or he's really lost it.
Either way, he needs help.

292
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,083
- Okay.
- Thank you.

293
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,777
Hey, I need you
to do me a favor.

294
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,355
I need you to call Psych
for a consult on Mr. Gamble.

295
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,752
- Yes, doctor.
- Dr. Pratt...

296
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,360
- I have a patient who was bit by a rat.
- Come on.

297
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,995
Should I send off for a CBC?

298
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,653
For what, rabies?

299
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,528
- Nurse. Come on.
- That woman blew her nose on my smock.

300
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,191
Maybe she's not a Tweety fan.

301
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,100
I need you to update his tetanus,
and I need you to test his flexor tendons.

302
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,173
No, don't test me,
man, just test the rat.

303
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,478
This is not what I went to
nursing school for. I quit.

304
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,546
Irrigate, put him on Keflex
and chuck that rat in the bio bin.

305
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,775
- I've still gotta take a piss.
- I've got a lady with dysmenorrhea.

306
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,180
Here, take that.

307
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:30,016
If it's obstruction, what
would the diameter be?

308
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:34,186
So then over 10 millimeters,
then I should call Surgery?

309
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,420
Son of a bitch.

310
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,523
- Hang up!
- What?

311
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,066
You're a second-year
Resident, not a med student.

312
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,728
You can't be calling your mother,
father, your cousin who's a podiatrist...

313
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,966
to help get you through a shift. Now,
get on the floor and do your damn job!

314
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,441
And for God's sake, light
a match or something.

315
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,917
- Hi.
- Hey.

316
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,184
Figured I owed you a visit.

317
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,425
And Gillian invited
me for dinner.

318
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,257
It's 10:00.

319
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,194
I didn't think you'd
take me up on it.

320
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,891
Oh.

321
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,899
Sorry, I can't stay...

322
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,198
but there's still some Thai
left in the fridge if you want.

323
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,642
See you in a couple months.

324
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,380
- Thanks.
- Okay.

325
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,646
- Need any help with that?
- No, no, I'm good.

326
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,151
Bye, Abby.

327
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,900
- Where's she going?
- Uh, back to Montreal.

328
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,608
Her boyfriend's been
bugging her to go back home.

329
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,771
- I thought you two were...
- It's complicated.

330
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,347
This guy Mathers is
approaching the six-hour mark.

331
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,485
He needs a washout in the O.R.,
or he'll get some serious osteo...

332
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,847
Well, we're a little busy
down here too. Dumb...

333
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,012
Your acute abdomen
is acutely constipated.

334
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,954
- Give him an enema and some Colace.
- How did I know you'd say that?

335
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,855
You know you shouldn't
have called me down.

336
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,187
Hey, I got a board to clear.
- Yeah, yeah.

337
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,821
Look, put a fresh
saline dressing...

338
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,593
- on my open-fracture guy, would you?
- Yes, doctor.

339
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,635
- You do speak English, right?
- Yes, doctor.

340
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,270
Looks like we're making
progress. Only 30 on the board.

341
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,104
And 50 in Triage.

342
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,213
Guess we better fuel up. Feel
like making a burger run? My treat.

343
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,177
- Cafeteria's closed.
- McDonald's isn't.

344
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,147
You got feet.

345
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,718
- Excuse me, doctor.
- I see you're talking again.

346
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,890
It sort of comes and goes. Were
you able to determine anything?

347
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,821
No, not yet, but we got a
special doctor coming to see you.

348
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,121
So you better get into
bed before you miss him.

349
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,025
- You think it's stress?
- I don't know.

350
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,291
You pull me out of a
movie for Betsy Wimbel?

351
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,129
- Is there a problem?
- She's in here three times a month...

352
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,864
and still manages to squeeze
Demerol out of Residents like you...

353
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,975
- who don't pull her old charts.
- That's all fine and dandy...

354
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,203
but she's got real disease,
guaiac-positive stool and intractable pain.

355
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,178
She's a manipulative drug-seeker.
We don't support her habit.

356
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,750
So examine her, put a note in her
chart stating that you won't admit.

357
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:18,323
Bump her steroids, give her a few
Vicodin and do not call me again.

358
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,722
I'm just asking you to
take care of your patient.

359
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,260
Actually, she's
your patient now.

360
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,462
Hey, Lester.

361
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,896
Medicate and discharge
my Crohn's patient.

362
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,769
Tell her you're sorry,
but she won't be admitted.

363
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,768
You seem to be getting
your strength back.

364
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,607
I couldn't run a four-minute
mile, but I'm doing okay.

365
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,478
Still a little anemic.

366
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,850
Are you glad to be home?

367
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,612
Yes and no.

368
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,620
I miss it.

369
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,623
You're not in your
own head all the time.

370
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:57,063
You're a part of something that's
in constant motion over there.

371
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,959
Any break from it
you get is a luxury...

372
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,296
not just something to
be taken for granted.

373
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,800
And that's different
from County how?

374
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,468
It's its own addiction, I guess.

375
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,407
- Yeah, it certainly hooked Carter.
- Yeah.

376
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,137
How are you doing with that?

377
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,307
Without him, you mean?

378
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,516
I'm fine.

379
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,946
I'm better than fine.

380
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,919
So you're happy?

381
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,023
Getting there.

382
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,424
- I made a few decisions.
- Like what?

383
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,534
I don't wanna jinx myself.

384
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,777
- Work wants me back.
- Tonight?

385
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,945
Pretend you didn't get a page.

386
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,474
I need the money.

387
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,812
See you soon, then?

388
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,789
Yeah.

389
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,690
Good night.

390
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,774
Corina Wybel is waiting on amylase
and Mathers is still in Sutures.

391
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,636
He didn't go up to surgery yet?

392
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,835
- Hey, I thought you left.
- What can I say...

393
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,173
the attrition rate for
nurses here sucks.

394
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,873
Tweety girl? Yeah, writing
was on the wall for that one.

395
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:28,020
- It's a drag you got called back in.
- Not really. Double overtime.

396
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,849
How's it going?

397
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,020
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah.

398
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,088
Fine.

399
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,567
Glad to hear it. You're one
of the best nurses on the floor.

400
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,728
With all the changes that
Robert's been making...

401
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:49,000
- I'd, uh, hate to lose you.
- Thanks.

402
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,973
Abby, do you know
where I can find...

403
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,544
- paper and crayons for a little girl?
- Is she a patient?

404
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,806
- No, but...
- Your evaluation as a med student...

405
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,348
revolves around how many
patients you can carry...

406
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,713
not how many children
you can babysit.

407
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,412
Take a cue from some of
your colleagues and get busy.

408
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:07,081
The wrist film's negative. ACE
wrap and he's out of here with R.I.C.E.

409
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,194
- Got it.
- Scombroid patient had 2 liters...

410
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,024
tolerating p.o.'s, discharge
with a clear liquid diet.

411
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,996
Threatened A.B. is Rh-positive.

412
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,500
Send her home with pelvic rest. No
intercourse, no tampons, no douching.

413
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,138
Thanks.

414
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,833
Morris, why do I have a board full of
nasty and you're studying radiology?

415
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,602
Uh, Damian here
came in with wheezing.

416
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,748
He's got a quarter in his upper
esophagus. So, what's your point?

417
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,941
- I'm thinking it'll just pass.
- In my poop?

418
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,777
So that's it, we just
wait till it comes out?

419
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,389
No, being that he's symptomatic,
we call in a specialist...

420
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,252
who can take it out
with an endoscope.

421
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,791
Is that an operation?

422
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,452
- No cutting involved.
- Who's the GI consult on call?

423
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,757
Hampton, a very special
friend of mine. You page her.

424
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,958
Pratt! EMT 1: Pulse
ox 98 on 2 liters.

425
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:52,104
Street-racing MVA, first of three.
Sicker ones coming in behind.

426
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,298
- Witness said the car rolled three times.
- It was at least four.

427
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,908
Excuse me.

428
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,477
Janie Timmons, 16,
restrained but loose after rolls.

429
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,147
- Unknown LOC. GCS, 234.
- Janie, can you hear me?

430
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,783
- CSF out the ears.
- And blood in the airway.

431
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,977
Page Neurosurg and Trauma. Bet
you she's got a bleed in her brain.

432
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,156
Wait a minute. Where
we going? What's open?

433
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,723
Nothing. End-stage
emphysema in 1, a possible DNR.

434
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,758
- Possible? Let's go.
- Yeah.

435
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,486
Look out!

436
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,324
- Triple MVA, we need this room.
- She needs a monitored bed.

437
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,831
- Not if she's DNR.
- We're waiting for confirmation.

438
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,096
She's got end-stage
emphysema. Consider it confirmed.

439
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,206
Come on, let's go.

440
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:32,240
- Excuse me.
- Let's go. Come on, come on. Out, out.

441
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,347
His '64 Mustang
lost out to a Z28.

442
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:47,084
Good vitals, unknown LOC, chest
abrasion, closed fracture of the humerus.

443
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,457
- It's a classic. People always challenge.
- We'll get a C-spine in CT.

444
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,326
- But he needs a chest and AP pelvis.
- That'll take a while.

445
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,968
Okay, if CT opens first,
we'll have to send him there.

446
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:59,037
- You wanna go when he does?
- I can't. I'm the only Attending...

447
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,639
and Pratt's the senior
on the floor. Abby, you go.

448
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,504
It's my fault. They're young.
They're allowed to be stupid.

449
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,942
No one's allowed to be
that stupid, Mr. Vangoss.

450
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,446
I got bone sticking
out of my legs!

451
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,017
Six Flags, only better.

452
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,676
Cranial nerves grossly intact.

453
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,448
I have been here six hours!

454
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,615
Somebody needs to shut him up.

455
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,559
- Clinically clear.
- It was like a total G-force, you know?

456
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,788
- Good breath sounds.
- Hey, where's Janie?

457
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,026
- Yeah, you're just now asking?
- The belly's tender.

458
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,500
- Take the rectal.
- What?

459
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,636
Needs someone to find out
about his girlfriend, doesn't he?

460
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,303
You're going up my butt?

461
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,910
Just one finger.

462
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,710
Multiple lacs,
scalp and occiput.

463
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,213
Pratt, your guy in Sutures
is having a meltdown.

464
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,908
Later.

465
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,146
- Skull fracture with a step-off.
- Sats are down to 90.

466
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,813
Threatening to sue everybody
and their brother. Mostly you.

467
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,586
Whoa! She's blowing some teeth.

468
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,561
Hey, where the hell are you going?
- Bathroom.

469
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:04,261
Sats, 88. Eighty-six.
Eighty-five. Eighty-three...

470
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,769
All right, after I
secure the airway...

471
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,272
chest tube and
subclavian on the right.

472
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,673
Psych won't see your aphasia
patient unless you clear a head CT first.

473
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,407
The guy's freaking out because his
wife's leaving. He doesn't need a head CT.

474
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,380
Okay, give me the tube.

475
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,242
Okay.

476
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,879
Pulse is down to
65. You better kick it.

477
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:27,186
Pratt, Hampton called from GI. She's not
gonna see the quarter kid till morning...

478
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,761
- but she plans on seeing Romano first.
- I'm in. Is that all she said?

479
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,388
No, actually, she said
you're an asshole too.

480
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,864
Night.

481
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:42,034
Wow, it's 1 in the morning.
I guess it's lunchtime.

482
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,369
- You gotta try this.
- Sure. What is it?

483
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,411
- Dinuguan.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

484
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,241
Cooked pork blood.

485
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,142
Did I ever mention
I was half Jewish?

486
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,454
Hey, Randi. I'm still waiting on
Ortho for my open-fracture guy.

487
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,955
- As soon as they call, tell them...
- They said you should irrigate him.

488
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,922
- They're kind of busy right now.
- Nice.

489
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,157
Neela, find Morris and
have him supervise you...

490
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,493
on doing a poor man's
washout on Mr. Mathers.

491
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,102
- Any idea where he is?
- No, but that's an MSP:

492
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,068
Med student problem.

493
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,934
I love being an R2.

494
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,837
So, what do you think?

495
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,639
- I think it's a little loud.
- If I stay up, everybody does.

496
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,442
No, he hasn't gone to
Radiology yet. That's the problem.

497
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,346
High-speed MVA, blunt trauma.
He really needs a belly CT.

498
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,248
Can't you just sneak us in?

499
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,820
Thank you.

500
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,355
Okay, Mr. Vangoss, we're
going up to the CT room.

501
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,619
I was 17 when that
song first came out.

502
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:39,993
- You probably weren't even born yet.
- Oh, I was around.

503
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,136
- Hi.
- Hi.

504
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,033
Elizabeth. Hold the door.

505
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,270
- We're full, I'm afraid.
- Oh.

506
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,972
Well, I'll catch the next one.

507
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,146
He's cute.

508
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:02,447
- Did you guys ever get together?
- Who?

509
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:06,486
Dorset. Didn't he ask
you out or something?

510
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,523
I suppose you could
say we're dating.

511
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,961
Really.

512
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,535
What?

513
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,966
- What?
- What? You think it's too soon?

514
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,666
I didn't say that.

515
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,884
I think it's too soon.

516
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,681
- I just said he was cute.
- Yeah.

517
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,687
Too soon.

518
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,820
You're not too good
at this, are you?

519
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,397
It should start to
feel numb soon.

520
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:54,233
- What the hell is that stuff?
- Sterile saline, washes the germs out.

521
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,205
And you're just now
getting around to this?

522
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:01,040
We thought you'd be in the O.R. by
now. This will buy us an extra hour or two.

523
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:04,706
- Before what?
- Neela, what do you think you're doing?

524
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,746
- Temporary washout.
- Which is not a procedure...

525
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,515
a med student performs
without Resident supervision.

526
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,216
Great, she's not even a doctor?

527
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:17,420
Stop what you're doing and tell
me who the Resident is on this case.

528
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,522
Dr. Pratt, but he asked Dr. Morris
to supervise on his behalf.

529
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,601
And where's Dr. Morris?

530
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,431
I'm surrounded by incompetence.

531
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:34,569
Hey, how do you think I feel? This
one's been trying to kill me all night.

532
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,245
No mass, no hemorrhage,
normal ventricles, no shift.

533
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,250
- So he's clear?
- Crystal.

534
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,219
Hey, Mr. Gamble, your
head CT looks good.

535
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,255
- Everything's fine.
- So, what do I do now?

536
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:49,793
I've arranged for you to speak with
one of our mental-health specialists.

537
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,557
- I'm not crazy.
- No, you're not. You're just stressed...

538
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,792
Then give me something for
that, but don't send me to a shrink.

539
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:59,268
God, the last thing I need is
for Gloria to have proof I'm nuts.

540
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,930
Pratt, dislocated patella.

541
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,598
COPD exacerbation.

542
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:08,839
I&D on a pilonidal cyst. And don't
pass these off on that idiot Morris.

543
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,343
- I know you think I'm a wuss...
- Mr. Gamble, I don't have time...

544
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,850
Just give me something
to get me through the night.

545
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:20,657
Hey, I want you to give Ed
here 2 milligrams of obecalp IV...

546
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,920
- and discharge him.
- Obecalp?

547
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,757
You know what obecalp is?

548
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,665
Yes, doctor.

549
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,529
Thank you.

550
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,194
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah. Whatever works, right?

551
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,506
Erika.

552
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,653
What does DNR mean?

553
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,954
It stands for "do
not resuscitate."

554
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,660
Which means...

555
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:59,655
someone doesn't want to be kept alive
by machines if they should get very sick.

556
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,127
Let's get you back to the
other room where you can rest.

557
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,602
Can I stay here?

558
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,764
She says she
sleeps better with me.

559
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,078
Sure.

560
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,921
- Good night.
- Night.

561
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,768
I'm glad you have time for a Kodak
moment. I know I sure as hell don't.

562
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,500
We still got 20 on the
board and 35 in Triage.

563
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,177
Sorry. She's by herself here.

564
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,810
It's hard, isn't it? Learning
where your time is best spent...

565
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,217
whether it's with the
patient or their family.

566
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,153
You know, that's really rough.

567
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:03,489
Now, if you're done playing house,
do an I&D on Mr. Brier's pilonidal cyst.

568
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,328
Hey, hey.

569
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,058
He's tough, but he's
got the goods, you know?

570
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,792
Yeah.

571
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,163
Hey, have you ever heard of obecalp?
Because I can't find it in the PDR.

572
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,536
It's "placebo"
spelled backwards.

573
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,644
Who's prescribing it?

574
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,679
Dr. Pratt.

575
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,050
Obecalp?

576
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,349
Look, the guy's playing
games with his wife.

577
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,518
He gets panicky
whenever I mention Psych...

578
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:40,598
and he begs me to give him something
to calm his nerves. So I give him saline.

579
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,428
And it looks like he feels a
lot better. No harm, no foul.

580
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,935
Ever hear of truth-telling?
Deceptive practices?

581
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,040
Not only have you breached
every principle of medical ethics...

582
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,234
you've also opened us up to a
lawsuit if this patient finds out.

583
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,778
Dr. Weaver, your MVA
guy is crashing in CT.

584
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,006
Damn it.

585
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:02,054
Severa, I guess we better pull
the plug on Mr. Gamble's obecalp.

586
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,950
I never gave it to him.

587
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:09,092
Doctor, how long before
my son is taken care of?

588
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,288
- Your son...?
- Damian, the quarter?

589
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,901
Right, right. Well, it
looks like the GI doctor...

590
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,401
who performs the procedure won't
be able to see him till the morning.

591
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:23,107
- When in the morning?
- I'm not sure.

592
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,938
But he's stable, and
I don't see a problem.

593
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,945
We've been here for 14 hours.
No one's done a damn thing.

594
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,607
Damian's scared to death. She
needs to get to bed. We all do.

595
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,984
- I know it's hard... FATHER:
This is an emergency room.

596
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,952
There's a quarter
in my son's throat.

597
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,591
He can't breathe. That's
an emergency, isn't it?

598
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,127
What happened?

599
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,459
He got altered and
his sats drifted down.

600
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,933
- Did you finish the scan?
- No.

601
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,265
- How long has he been down?
- Under five minutes.

602
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,465
- Let's tube him. ABBY:
Pulmonary edema?

603
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,611
More than likely. Okay,
stop compressions.

604
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,746
- Still no pulse.
- Never, never send...

605
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,113
an even slightly unstable
patient to CT without a doctor.

606
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,284
- You told me to bring him...
- I'm talking to me.

607
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,923
I'm in.

608
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,352
You coming? Pratt's
trying the old Foley trick.

609
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,020
- What?
- Yeah, that's what's so cool.

610
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:26,701
- Okay, Foley and a 2 Mack blade.
- All right, sats is 96, BP steady.

611
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,966
All right, come on.

612
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,642
Okay, so now what we
wanna do is put this tube...

613
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,477
just past the quarter.

614
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,778
And once we do that...

615
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,650
we're gonna blow up the
little balloon with saline...

616
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:49,986
and hopefully pull the
quarter back into his mouth.

617
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,797
Couldn't he aspirate
the quarter into his lungs?

618
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,489
Not if I grab it first.

619
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,659
Now, here's the tricky part.

620
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,836
Okay.

621
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,474
And...

622
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,577
Presto.

623
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,446
Dr. Pratt.

624
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,016
Here. One for the piggy bank.

625
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:23,051
Oh, Abby, you're back. Can
you cover for Melinda in Triage?

626
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:28,364
Sure. Love to. Triage
is my personal favorite.

627
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,728
Thanks for asking.

628
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,837
Where's Weaver? The bars are
closing. We're gonna get slammed.

629
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,406
She's still in CT, which means the
R2s are in charge, and that scares me.

630
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,669
You and me, man.

631
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,539
All right, let's get
the party started.

632
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:47,180
You, come on. Come show
me some love. Come here.

633
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,918
Please tell me it's not just 3.

634
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,553
Shut the hell up! How's anybody
supposed to sleep around here?!

635
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:02,895
Yo, Abby, any time now.

636
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,401
- Okay, where we at?
- Now serving number 47.

637
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,267
- This is Jay Jay. He has a toothache.
- Thank you.

638
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,137
- Hey, Jay Jay, how you feeling?
- Tooth hurts.

639
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,608
When did you first notice it?

640
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,644
About a year ago.

641
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,745
- Excuse me.
- Have a seat. I'll be right with you.

642
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,944
No, we've already been seen.
My son was feeling a little queasy.

643
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,454
It might just be the anesthesia, but
could you get Dr. Pratt to maybe...?

644
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,957
- Oh, my God.
- Pratt. Pratt!

645
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,062
- Damian?
- Here, help me lie him down.

646
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,795
- What did he come in for?
- He swallowed a quarter.

647
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,492
Blood looks arterial.

648
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,503
- Page Surgery and Vascular.
- Aorto-esophageal fistula?

649
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,666
- Pratt, I need you at Curtain 1.
- Not now. Get a gurney.

650
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,408
- Watch your back.
- What's going on?

651
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:55,111
Probable aorto-esophageal
fistula after a foreign-body removal.

652
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,914
- You did endoscopy?
- I used a Foley.

653
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,989
- Are you out of your mind?
- It worked fine.

654
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,457
The quarter was in there too long.
After he was discharged, this happened.

655
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,153
- We'll take it from here. CORDAY:
Trans-esophageal erosion...

656
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,926
needs immediate aortic repair. Not
all ER Residents can walk on water.

657
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,592
You're lucky this happened
while they were still here...

658
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,466
otherwise this
boy would be dead.

659
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,206
Add five of PEEP
once he's on a vent.

660
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,030
Andy, what did the NG
aspirate show on Maloney?

661
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,865
- Hey, Pratt.
- Let me find out.

662
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,472
- Pratt!
- Lungs clear.

663
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,804
- Let's get some O2 and check a D-stick.
- Watch it. Syncopal episode?

664
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,569
Only groans with a sternal rub.

665
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,146
We were ready to go,
then he slumped to the floor.

666
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,182
Let's get him on the
bed. One, two, three, up.

667
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,219
All right, put him on a
monitor and get me some vitals.

668
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,416
- I'm on it.
- I thought he was kidding.

669
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:11,995
Pupils asymmetric, mild ptosis. He
was fine other than being a nut case.

670
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,997
Young, healthy guy with
transient loss of speech. SonoSite.

671
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,193
And a negative CT.
Turn that damn music off!

672
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,928
Listen, man, I
got this. It's okay.

673
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:23,438
- Any risk factors for stroke?
- No. Decreased tone on the right.

674
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:27,373
- Oh, my God, he had a stroke?
- Call CT. Have them clear a room.

675
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,946
- I think I have something here.
- This is my patient.

676
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:33,175
- It might be a carotid dissection.
- Let me see that.

677
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,216
- Tapering occlusion of the left carotid.
- What is that?

678
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,555
Your husband has a tear in one
of his main arteries, it caused a clot.

679
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,197
Your open-fracture patient
demands to be euthanized.

680
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,765
- Mr. Mathers is still here?
- I got your back on this.

681
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,301
Get consent for
TPA, 0.9 migs per kig.

682
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,365
Okay, that's enough of Triage.

683
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,305
Let it be someone
else's turn for a change.

684
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,812
- And I know you're talking about me.
- Hey, Abby, is Exam 2 open?

685
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,177
I'm on a break.

686
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:23,258
Hi, I'd like to find out if I
qualify for a cash advance.

687
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,564
Uh... Uh, sorry, I have to go.

688
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,756
- Neela.
- Yeah?

689
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,295
Grandma's dead.

690
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,800
Little girl's sleeping.
We need the bed.

691
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,290
Hey, how you doing?

692
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,060
Sleepy.

693
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,491
Morphine's kicked in.

694
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:29,031
That and it's 4:30
in the morning.

695
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,169
Am I gonna lose
this thing or what?

696
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,804
My leg.

697
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,505
No.

698
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:46,148
Because I'm not the kind of
guy who can get along without it.

699
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,650
I work for a living, you know.

700
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,688
Look, I know I've
said it before...

701
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,724
but we're gonna get
you in the O.R. real soon.

702
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,664
That's what I hear.

703
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,703
- Get Coop to cover for me.
- Where are you going?

704
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,175
To do something that
should've been done hours ago.

705
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,837
Starts screaming right in
the middle of the course.

706
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,575
Wonder what he would've
done if he were four over par.

707
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,349
Hey. How you guys doing? Dr. Pratt
from the ER. Size 8 1/2 gloves, please.

708
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,833
- What are you doing?
- Holding your retractors.

709
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,883
Reamer to me. Drill
for the cup screws.

710
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,858
Been calling you guys for
hours on that open tibia fracture.

711
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:35,023
Well, now that I'm here to help, you
can free somebody up for the consult.

712
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,895
Just show me where to pull.

713
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,736
Shh. It's all right.

714
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,179
Hello?

715
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,517
Hi.

716
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,123
Is Richard here?

717
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,988
Honey, your ex-wife is here.

718
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,598
- How old now?
- Fourteen months.

719
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,473
What do you want?

720
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,475
I need a favor.

721
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,547
- Abby, it's 8:00 in the morning.
- Yeah, I know. I don't have a lot of time.

722
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,550
I need you to cosign a loan.

723
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:11,458
- Why don't you just declare bankruptcy?
- Look, I'm not in trouble, okay?

724
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,655
- I just need you...
- Want me to support you?

725
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:17,859
No. I never asked for alimony. I
didn't contest anything in court.

726
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,870
- I didn't even take the damn furniture.
- You could have.

727
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,065
You must know how
much I hate doing this.

728
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:26,837
I wouldn't do it unless it was absolutely
necessary. I don't want your money.

729
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,446
I just want your signature.

730
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,849
- Oh, good morning.
- Yeah, hi.

731
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,724
I just got in, and already I've heard from
the Ortho, Psych and GI departments...

732
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,526
not to mention Dr. Weaver
about your medical high jinks.

733
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,726
The carotid clot was a total
zebra, Ortho was taking their time...

734
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,031
and Hampton refused
to get down here for a...

735
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,880
You are a screwup,
Pratt. And just to be

736
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:59,872
clear, I didn't like
you before I knew that.

737
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:03,743
Mmm. Kenyan roast. Can't
beat it for flavor or punch.

738
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,077
Triple espresso, yes, I can.

739
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,220
Hey, your septic pancreatitis
is still waiting on an ICU bed.

740
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:12,221
- Thanks. How'd it go?
- Good.

741
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,619
- Hey.
- Hey.

742
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,386
- How's the quarter kid?
- Corday said he's gonna be fine.

743
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:19,292
Hey, Coop. I heard you
caught a carotid dissection. Nice.

744
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:20,726
Thanks, man.

745
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:26,698
Did rotation with the stroke team
in June. Anybody could've missed it.

746
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:30,273
Yeah, well, started
Mr. Gamble on anticoagulants...

747
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,707
- tear should heal on its own.
- And he keeps talking.

748
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,809
- You headed home?
- Yeah, why, you're not?

749
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,242
I'm gonna hit the gym first.

750
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,919
Hey, Coop.

751
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,055
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure. Anything for a buddy.
