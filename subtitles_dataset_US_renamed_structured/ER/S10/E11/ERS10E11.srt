1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,434
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,475
- You guys met my sister, Val?
- I was diagnosed with MS at 22.

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,442
- Before that, I was a normal girl.
- How advanced is it?

4
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:13,945
I'm still fully functional.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,478
Look, I know I said
I didn't need any

6
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,915
help, but tonight I did.
Thanks for the help.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,552
Hey, Abby. Did you get
your trinket from Carter?

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,695
Gone-native junk for everybody.

9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,125
It was my father's. I
want you to have it.

10
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,130
I want you to
come to the States.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,929
I want our baby to
be born in America.

12
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,527
Remind me to put the
clock on your side of the bed.

13
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,875
Hey, Kem? You down here?

14
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,527
- Been in the kitchen since dawn.
- She's still adjusting to the time change.

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,025
- Insisted on making me eggs again.
- Well, that's nice.

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,533
That's not nice?

17
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,775
- Good morning.
- Hey.

18
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,638
Good morning.

19
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:57,808
You know, you have got 20
types of tea, like, six sets of china...

20
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,580
and glasses for
every possible drink.

21
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,724
- Did you have trouble sleeping again?
- Uh...

22
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,587
I had trouble finding
the kitchen again.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,662
- I need a map.
- You get used to it.

24
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,800
You'll be sliding in the
hall in socks in no time.

25
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,834
- Oh, and that wouldn't offend anybody?
- Nope.

26
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:19,804
Although, you should probably
stop making breakfast for Emily.

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,638
She doesn't like my cooking?

28
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,243
Doesn't like feeling insecure
about her employment.

29
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,209
Oh.

30
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,216
I'm gonna miss you today.

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,017
You want George to show you
the sights after your appointment?

32
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:41,594
- Do some shopping, go to a movie?
- I might take a walk.

33
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,357
Would you rather I not
work while we're here?

34
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,591
Because I don't have to.

35
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,267
What I'd rather you do...

36
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,732
is give me your socks.

37
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,702
What are you doing?

38
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,446
What are you doing?

39
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,681
So where is the bedroom, again?

40
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,018
Whoa!

41
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,288
You coming or what?

42
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,132
Abby, sorry. It took forever
to get Alex out of the house.

43
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,064
- Don't worry.
- You already sign out?

44
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,797
Yes. Too bad I can't leave. Lelma
Ramirez in 1, vomiting times three.

45
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,669
- Tolerating sips after 10 of Reglan.
- Stomach-flu season?

46
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,141
Dr. Lewis would have us
believe. She called in sick.

47
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,974
- Really? How'd she sound?
- Better than she should have.

48
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,707
Repeat EKG and troponin
on Mr. St. John at 8 a.m.

49
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,318
Lewis probably has that
flight nurse in her bathrobe.

50
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,717
- Is he pain-free?
- Mrs. Clark's had three nebs.

51
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,722
- She may need continuous.
- Should I call in another Attending?

52
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,326
No. Carter's on. We're good.

53
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,360
So, what's his story?

54
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,761
Richer and better-looking than
you or I will ever be. The end.

55
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,402
I just wanna know
if the guy's a jerk.

56
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,765
- Is he?
- She's not the best one to ask.

57
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,702
There a problem
with the narcotics?

58
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,171
Missing 10 migs of Valium.

59
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,458
If you sign off, the
night nurses can go.

60
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:05,574
Yeah. Or they could
just learn to count.

61
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,774
My onset-seizure guy went to Medicine.
Rack is empty. And I am off the board.

62
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,714
Good. Go home.

63
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,129
Saying I can leave early?

64
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,219
I'm saying it's slow
and you're an intern.

65
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,358
- We'll be fine.
- Alrighty, then.

66
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,253
- Get some rest, Mike.
- Yeah. Hope it stays slow for you.

67
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,006
- What have you got?
- "Gome" from the home.

68
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,795
- An elderly patient from a nursing home?
- Breakfast special.

69
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:30,369
Staff went to check Granny's
vitals first thing. She didn't have any.

70
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,198
Hey, sis.

71
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,909
Hey, you wanna turn that down?

72
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,957
Valerie, it's 7:00
in the morning.

73
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,161
Mike.

74
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,729
- You're home early. PRATT:
Baby, you have another razor?

75
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,763
This one's dull.

76
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,171
Good morning, Mike.

77
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,995
- How many times?
- What?

78
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,155
- How many times has he been here?
- None of your damn business.

79
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,664
It's only my bedroom.

80
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,459
Just a few.

81
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,800
Now I know why you're
interested in my schedule.

82
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,203
- Is there any coffee?
- No.

83
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,673
Yes.

84
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,710
I'm on the clock
anyway. I'll see you later?

85
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,582
Peace, Mike.

86
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,419
- What time you gotta be at the airport?
- My flight leaves at 2.

87
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,321
Wake me up at noon.

88
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,522
- Thought you were off.
- Not until she balances her narc count.

89
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,099
- You wanna see me?
- January 18.

90
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:46,331
Forget it. I've already got two Attendings
requesting Super Bowl Sunday off.

91
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,101
- My last day here.
- Africa?

92
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:52,007
I have to admit I'm surprised
you're still going back.

93
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,669
Dr. Weaver!

94
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,248
- She pulled out her Foley.
- Kovac will be there.

95
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,079
Mrs. Webster's a boarder
being managed by Cardiology.

96
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,414
Congestive failure
and some dementia.

97
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,047
Check her potassium and hit her
again with Lasix before she goes up.

98
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,456
- So you'll notify Administration?
- About what?

99
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,027
- My resignation.
- No.

100
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,926
You will. Put it in writing
and leave it on my desk.

101
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,034
I'll bring it to the Medical
Executive Committee in the morning.

102
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,536
For the record, we need you
here as much as they do there.

103
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,808
- Dr. Kovac.
- You're late.

104
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,479
- Power outage at the Armitage station.
- Valerie again?

105
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,206
I was gonna put a Swan-Ganz
in my cardiomyopathy guy.

106
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,146
After load, reduce
with enalapril.

107
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,719
- How are you doing, Mrs. Webster?
- I wanna go home.

108
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,118
- A mig of Bumex and 40 of K.
- I'm on it.

109
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,782
Pressure's borderline. I can't
manage him without a Swann.

110
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,986
- How are you doing?
- Give the ACE inhibitor.

111
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,562
And support for dopamine.

112
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,528
I love you.

113
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,933
Thanks.

114
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,627
If I know his wedge
pressure, I can do what I need.

115
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,670
Dr. Kovac.

116
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,536
My kids finished the
chelation therapy today.

117
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,474
- They are coming home.
- That's good.

118
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,648
You are going to be our only
doctor from now on, okay?

119
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,184
Anyway, the Swann tells
me his output and PVR.

120
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,692
Do walk rounds with the med students,
and I'll talk to you about it later, okay?

121
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,370
- Patients really respond to him.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,938
Give the differential
diagnosis of peripheral edema.

123
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,439
- Cirrhosis.
- CHF.

124
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,940
Thrombophlebitis.

125
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,373
Lockhart.

126
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:35,481
You belong to me at 4. You better
be sharper than that. Come on.

127
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,045
What was that all about?

128
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,880
Could this day suck more?

129
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,215
Sign-in sheet's over there.

130
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,455
Um...

131
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,357
- I'm not a patient.
- Hey, Dr. Carter.

132
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,225
Nice to put a face to the name.

133
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,663
- She with you?
- Yeah.

134
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,903
Call me John. This is Kem.

135
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,574
Hi. Sam.

136
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,073
Pleasure to meet you.

137
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,678
- So this is it?
- This is it.

138
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,404
Double MVA, two minutes out.

139
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:11,312
- Hey, stranger!
- How are you?

140
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,180
Hi, everybody.

141
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,686
- Hey, Malik.
- Welcome back, doc.

142
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,983
Good to see you.

143
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,252
I heard you were
coming in today. Hi.

144
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,922
- And who is this lovely lady?
- Everybody, this is Kem Likasu.

145
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,622
She's visiting from the Congo.

146
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,701
Welcome. AMIRA: Nice.

147
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,666
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

148
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,932
Kem has an appointment
with Dr. Subramanian upstairs.

149
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,768
Dr. Subramanian from OB?

150
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,572
Prenatal checkup.
Second trimester.

151
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,777
- Congratulations.
- That's so great.

152
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,418
- Hey.
- Hey, Pratt. How are you?

153
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,453
Life is good. But I
see it's better for you.

154
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,622
How are you doing? KEM: Hey.

155
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,783
- So are you back on shift yet?
- About five minutes ago.

156
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,192
- Can somebody show Kem upstairs?
- Okay, this way.

157
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,357
- You're coming, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Start the paperwork.

158
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,468
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

159
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,117
- Behind you.
- What do you have?

160
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:10,075
Larry Brodie, 44-year-old passenger.
Single car versus telephone pole.

161
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,871
May have had a syncopal episode.

162
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,776
Bad bruising to the chest and belly.
- Who's worse off?

163
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,188
- Dad by a long shot.
- Four units of O-neg...

164
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,980
and a portable chest, and an EKG?
- Sure.

165
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,678
- Cool.
- I'm a second-year Resident too.

166
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,481
- Barely.
- Pratt, take the driver.

167
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,453
- Tell me his story.
- 19-year-old restrained driver.

168
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,724
Trying to wake his old
man up when he crashed.

169
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,390
BP, 128/74.

170
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,468
Cracked a couple
ribs. Got 6 of morphine.

171
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,003
- What's with the collar?
- Custom-made by Dad.

172
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,800
- What for?
- Ankylosing spondylitis.

173
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,144
- Equal breath sounds.
- HemoCue's only 8.5.

174
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,077
Well, he's profoundly anemic.
He's bleeding somewhere.

175
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,582
- Pressure down to 76.
- You're back.

176
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,152
- Where's my son?
- Let's squeeze in both units.

177
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,484
- I've been holed up at the house.
- And not alone, either.

178
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,626
Central-line kit and size
8 gloves. Kem, right?

179
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,195
- Cordis introducer gives more volume.
- Excellent, Morris.

180
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,526
She was setting up the
ARV therapy in Kinshasa.

181
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,463
Where's my son?

182
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,695
- He needs help. KOVAC:
Don't worry, Mr. Brodie.

183
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,430
Your son's in good hands.
Someone you want us to call?

184
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,938
- Your wife?
- No.

185
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,339
- She died. CARTER:
One percent lido.

186
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,878
- Did you ever meet her?
- Nope. Must've gotten past me.

187
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,614
Set up for ultrasound.

188
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,547
Oh...

189
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,381
- Good to be home.
- Need another doc in here.

190
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,322
Here.

191
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,659
Is my dad next door?
I can't turn my head.

192
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,623
- He's hanging in there.
- How's he doing?

193
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,287
Probable rib fracture. The neck film
shows fusion and a bamboo spine.

194
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,525
- Ankylosing spondylitis.
- Unusual bone disease at his age.

195
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,398
Similar to juvenile arthritis.
Weakens the spine, though.

196
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,836
Sucks living life
in bubble wrap.

197
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,872
Also has a big
pulmonary contusion...

198
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,806
and a small pneumo on the right.

199
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,809
- What?
- There's a bruise on your lung.

200
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,539
- You're having trouble breathing.
- May need to tube him.

201
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,809
Give my dad another
reason to keep me inside.

202
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:02,183
Call Anesthesia. They can do an LMA
or awake naso-tracheal while he's stable.

203
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,848
You wanna call in the whole team.
Your African buddy wants to ban all tests.

204
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,785
- What should I do?
- Isn't he the Attending?

205
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,694
Hey, Taggart. Principal at your kid's
school wants you over there lickety-split.

206
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,561
- What for?
- Don't know. Can't be good.

207
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,999
Hey, you find another
nurse to cover for you.

208
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,163
- Let's try nasal BiPAP.
Thank you. NEELA: I'll get it.

209
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,654
- Where are the BiPAP masks?
- Bottom right drawer.

210
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,335
Got the EKG. Pressure's
up to 100 systolic.

211
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,571
- Neela, read it for me.
- I can do that.

212
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,342
Left bundle branch block.
Can't see the ST segments.

213
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,612
Probably not an acute
MI, but send a troponin.

214
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:38,019
Can't visualize Morrison's
pouch with all this fat and air.

215
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:41,127
- Where does it hurt, Mr. Brodie?
- Everywhere.

216
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:46,322
Stay ahead four units of type-specific.
Hope his pressure stays up for a CT.

217
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,604
He's fragile.

218
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,907
Is he mad? NEELA: Who?

219
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,704
My dad. I talked him
into letting me drive today.

220
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,471
Oh, I'm sure he's not mad.

221
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,048
Rales are worse.
Sats are down to 88.

222
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,047
Might need to think
about an airway.

223
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,479
There's plenty of room
to move on BiPAP.

224
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,647
Up his inspiratory
pressure to 10.

225
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,986
Dr. Carter, Kem called.
Dr. Subramanian's seeing her now.

226
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,394
- She took her in early.
- Go. We're all over this.

227
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,001
Okay, I'm only covering for
Sam until Severa gets here.

228
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,768
What?

229
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,103
- Kem.
- Look.

230
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,373
Normal extremities.
Good fetal movement.

231
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,748
- Any neural-tube defects?
- No. Looks great.

232
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,682
It's our son.

233
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,921
I couldn't help it.
I wanted to know.

234
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,387
He's beautiful, isn't he?

235
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,532
A son?

236
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,810
- Well?
- Count's the same.

237
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,008
- Abby, that's totally wack.
- Don't make me call the union rep.

238
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,952
Okay, I'm gonna call Weaver at
home, see if she'll cut us a break.

239
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,855
It's ringing.

240
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,622
Ow.

241
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,366
Hi.

242
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,899
Dr. Weaver? WEAVER: <i>Yeah?</i>

243
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,559
It's Abby.

244
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:34,003
Yeah, we found the missing Valium.
- It was Weaver?

245
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,437
Yeah. Someone actually
left it in their lab-coat pocket.

246
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,248
I'll pass that along. Says
whoever did it is an idiot.

247
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,441
- I'm out of here.
- Make that a double.

248
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,764
- Hi.
- Hey.

249
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,544
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good.

250
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,771
- I'm Abby.
- Kem. Good to meet you.

251
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,540
You too. Welcome.
And welcome back.

252
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,015
- How have you been?
- Good.

253
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,054
- I'm back in med school.
- Really?

254
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,986
What's this?

255
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,059
That's an ultrasound.

256
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,396
Wow.

257
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,728
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

258
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,737
Must be Kem.

259
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,568
- Are you Luka?
- Yeah.

260
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,210
Oh.

261
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,204
- Wasn't for you, we wouldn't have met.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,984
So boy or a girl?

263
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,983
- It's...
- It's a boy.

264
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,452
- Handsome.
- Like his daddy.

265
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,393
Uh, well, I should probably...

266
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,428
get back to work. Come
on. I'll walk you out.

267
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,327
- Sure. Good to meet you both.
- Bye.

268
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,764
They got together after I left.

269
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,837
- You okay?
- Yeah.

270
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,603
Okay.

271
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,842
What? Did he knock her
up the minute he got there?

272
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,314
- Going home?
- No.

273
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,753
On-call room. Same thing.

274
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,694
- Aah!
- Got a messy one here!

275
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,265
- Let me go!
- What happened?

276
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:44,461
Two stab wounds to the upper left thigh.
Tachy at 120. BP 90 palp. Lost 2 liters...

277
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,315
- Back off, man!
- Easy. Even with direct pressure.

278
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,002
- Over the femoral artery?
- Okay, let's have a look.

279
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,478
- Can we fit a BP cuff above it?
- The injury's too high.

280
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,171
- Undo my belt.
- What?

281
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,782
He needs a tourniquet now.

282
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,310
- Mine's thinner and cheaper.
- Leave me alone.

283
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,285
- Leave me alone! KOVAC:
Okay, wrap it as high as you can.

284
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,790
Leave me alone!

285
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,625
I can't get it tight enough.

286
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,857
Got it.

287
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,500
- Let's get him in Trauma
1. FAH: Get off me, man.

288
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,034
- Where did you learn that?
- Sitting on a patient?

289
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,638
- Congolese nurse named Mwadi.
- You getting down?

290
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,866
- Get off me, man.
- Not until he's restrained or sedated.

291
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,635
Stab wound. Out
of the way, please.

292
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,871
- You taking Mr. Brodie to CT?
- No. Chuny is. Why, you need help?

293
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,814
Your patient's pressure is borderline.
Two units and a med student with you.

294
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,018
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

295
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,814
Mrs. Webster,
this is a busy road.

296
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,389
- How do I get out?
- By getting treated and released.

297
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,518
Now, let's get you back into bed before
another gurney comes around the corner.

298
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,096
Oh, you're a good boy.

299
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,324
That's what all the ladies say.

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,993
Thirty-year-old mom
with a history of migraines.

301
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,607
- Neuro exam is normal.
- No neck stiffness or fever. Good vitals.

302
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,504
- Morris, you all right?
- Yeah.

303
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,169
Mrs. Hulsey, are you still
going to the headache clinic?

304
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:04,841
No money for a sitter or
anything. I had to bring my kids.

305
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,009
Any chance they can
get something to eat?

306
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,247
- Sure.
- Maybe hamburgers or hot dogs?

307
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,790
- For breakfast?
- Just something hearty, you know?

308
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:17,090
Like mashed potatoes,
gravy and giblets?

309
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,593
Sorry.

310
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,299
Think you should be working?

311
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,200
Yeah. Maybe I should
call somebody else in?

312
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,307
Sympathy hurl.

313
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,715
Even a sandwich would be okay.

314
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,114
We're not picky.

315
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,190
Mrs. Hulsey, when's the last
time you had anything to eat?

316
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,824
I know he's not happy, but
he can't be an ordinary boy.

317
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,726
Man.

318
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,459
Martin's 19. You need
to let the guy live a little.

319
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,935
Does he need oral
contrast? PRATT: No. Just IV.

320
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,098
We'll be right on the other
side of the glass, Mr. Brodie.

321
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,739
All right, fire it up.

322
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,072
His son's the one with
all the osteophytes?

323
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,741
It's not like he wants to play football.
Just wants to get out once in a while.

324
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,083
Make sure you stay still, okay?

325
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,656
- Mr. Brodie?
- His pressure's down.

326
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,190
- Pull him from the tube.
- Define his pathology.

327
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,124
- How fast can you do this? Come on.
- Well, fast, but...

328
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,321
- Wait, what are we doing?
- Getting the scan.

329
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,797
- Hey, you need to wear lead.
- He's not wearing lead.

330
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,007
- He's only getting one scan.
- I do this every day?

331
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,298
Ladies first. Leave that alone.

332
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,270
Spike another unit and
squeeze it in. Hurry up.

333
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,433
And page Corday.

334
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,949
- They your patients?
- Mom was.

335
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,647
Thought her migraines were kicking
up. Then I noticed the hair and nails.

336
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:55,488
Dermatitis, loss of fat from the cheeks.
She and the kids are starving to death.

337
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,130
They'll get sick if we
increase calories too rapidly.

338
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,199
Yeah, I'm admitting to
Pedes for slow re-feeding.

339
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,336
She's beautiful, by the way.

340
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,994
- So when are you going back?
- Two weeks.

341
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,834
On my way up to
Weaver's office...

342
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,977
to drop off my resignation
letter. How long you gonna stay?

343
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,477
Kem's gonna go back and see
her family for a couple weeks.

344
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,377
Then come back here
and have the baby.

345
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,644
- She miss home?
- Yeah, we both do.

346
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,984
Hey, give yourself a week of hot
showers and an unlimited glove supply...

347
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,852
you'll miss it less.

348
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,719
Dr. Carter. Martin's
respiratory distress is worse.

349
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,160
I thought Anesthesia
was coming down.

350
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:35,324
I paged. Apparently,
he's at a pain clinic.

351
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,096
- What's his pulse ox?
- Eighty-six and dropping.

352
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,003
- How are you doing, Martin?
- Not so good.

353
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,666
Let's up his inspiratory pressure
at 15 and give him 5 of albuterol.

354
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:48,406
I'll be back with an anesthesiologist
if I have to pull one out myself.

355
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,413
Heart rate's down to 58.

356
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,052
Come on, you got a kid who
needs you. Push the drugs.

357
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,018
- Start the scan.
- Need to get your hands out of there.

358
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,884
Atropine's in.

359
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,753
Go.

360
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,690
- How long is this gonna take?
- Twenty seconds, tops.

361
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,922
I thought this was a
third-generation scanner.

362
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,622
Another 10 seconds.

363
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,630
What in God's
name are you doing?

364
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,430
Keeping this guy alive so we can
get the CT and show you where to cut.

365
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,700
- Systolic's down to 90.
- Come on. Have we got soup yet?

366
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,871
There. Eight-centimeter
Triple-A.

367
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,777
He would've bled out while I
focused on the liver and the spleen.

368
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,941
It's all in the wrist.

369
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,612
Dr. Carter? My patient's
in respiratory failure.

370
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,586
No.

371
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,557
Dr. Carter is not in here.

372
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,492
- Sats are 82.
- I can't find Dr. Kovac either.

373
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,996
- Martin, stay with us.
- What the hell's going on?

374
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,182
Progressive hypoxia
despite inspiratory...

375
00:21:42,206 --> 00:21:43,967
Meaning he's not
breathing. Bag him.

376
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,298
- Bradying down to 52.
- Carter call Anesthesia?

377
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,668
- An hour ago.
- Forget them coming to the rescue.

378
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,275
Mig of atropine. Twenty
of etomidate. 120 of sux.

379
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,742
- We're supposed to wait.
- Lost the pulse.

380
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,245
No, can't wait anymore.

381
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,407
- Amp of epi.
- What are you doing?

382
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,745
He needs oxygen.

383
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,581
Sats are dropping. Seventy-four.

384
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,518
Is the stiffness
part of his disease?

385
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,248
Pull his arms down, 100 of lido.

386
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,689
I can't visualize squat.

387
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,523
Dr. Pratt, are you sure?

388
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,598
- Lido onboard.
- Stop compressions.

389
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,101
- Pratt.
- I think I got it.

390
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,167
Oh, God.

391
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,012
- Hook up the ambu-bag.
- Pulse is strong and regular.

392
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,722
Did he break his neck?

393
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,299
Sats are good,
98 with 5 of PEEP.

394
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,966
There's still no
motor tone in the legs.

395
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,339
It's probably the
intubation meds.

396
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,516
Sux only paralyzes
for 10 minutes.

397
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,045
Could be a slow metabolizer.

398
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,063
I just broke off a
bone bridge, that's all.

399
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,385
No withdrawal to pain.

400
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,550
Well, even if his neck is broken,
doesn't mean he's paralyzed.

401
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:20,098
Hang the steroids. And we'll take
him up to MRI. We'll know for sure.

402
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,613
It's okay, baby.

403
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,777
Mrs. Webster, you have to get
back in bed before you get hurt.

404
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,853
I know you're busy.

405
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:47,118
Severa, can we get her some
soft restraints for her protection?

406
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:51,128
- Yes, doctor.
- But Mama still loves you.

407
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,575
- Hey, you're back.
- Not quite.

408
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,573
- Go wait in the lounge.
- Hi, Chuny.

409
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,542
- Hey, Alex.
- Mommy dearest, Nursing director called.

410
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,978
You're one emergency
break away from probation.

411
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,983
- Perfect.
- Everything okay with Alex?

412
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,211
Uh-huh.

413
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,787
- No school today?
- Nope. Excuse me.

414
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,481
Dr. Carter?

415
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:22,253
- Start with 25 of meclizine. Yep?
- I know we just met, but...

416
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,557
- I wondered if you could do me a favor.
- Yeah.

417
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,495
35-year-old female with AIDS-related
lymphoma, shortness of breath...

418
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,503
- and hypotension.
- HIV status was diagnosed but untreated.

419
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,265
- Hospice care?
- Lives alone at home.

420
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:38,070
- How long have you had AIDS, ma'am?
- Too long.

421
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,438
<i>One, two, three.</i>

422
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,474
Any advanced directive?

423
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,481
- Hypotensive, 78/52. PRATT:
Hey, what are you doing here?

424
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,518
I guess someone bought into
the idea Morris was really sick.

425
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,451
A hundred percent 02
and mix up dobutamine.

426
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,614
- Who's your doctor, Ruthie?
- Don't have one.

427
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,489
EKG, ABG and a portable chest.
Sorry about this morning, man.

428
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,994
You didn't look too sorry.

429
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,598
Lungs are wet and there's
a harsh systolic murmur.

430
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:04,100
- Could never get an appointment.
- Aortic stenosis?

431
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,034
More like mitral regurge.
We need an echo ASAP.

432
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,834
Got it.

433
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,103
- How's Val getting to the airport?
- Cab.

434
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,212
We'll take care of
you, Ruthie, okay?

435
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,944
I can't believe he
sutured himself.

436
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:20,985
Edges are everted. Nice
wound approximation.

437
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,218
- Hurt much when you did it?
- I numbed it with an ice cube.

438
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,983
- That was good thinking.
- Don't encourage him.

439
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,324
I'm gonna put in another
stitch just to be on the safe side.

440
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:35,398
And I think you'll find that lidocaine
works much better than ice cubes.

441
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,633
- I didn't have any.
- Sutures stay in for about seven days.

442
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:41,137
And then I'm sure Mom
can take them out for you.

443
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,606
- I can do it.
- I don't think so.

444
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,511
- I appreciate your doing this.
- No problem.

445
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,481
You ever seen a kid do
something this crazy before?

446
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,552
To be honest...

447
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,221
Pressure's up to
100. Try a nitro spray.

448
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,327
- She's a grown woman.
- We work together.

449
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,692
Some respect would've been
nice. No acute ST changes.

450
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,663
Some respect for the fact that
we're consenting adults would be nice.

451
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,326
Hey, enough. Take it outside.

452
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,201
Just when it was getting good.

453
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:22,712
- It's not like I don't want her to date.
- You just don't want her to date me.

454
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,909
- Look, man, this is not personal.
- You thinking I'm not good enough isn't?

455
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,214
I got news for you,
Mike. It's not your call.

456
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,289
I give up.

457
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,722
- You barely know her.
- Yeah, no thanks to you.

458
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,657
MRI called. They finished
with the neck-fracture guy.

459
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:43,291
Ruthie, it appears as though
you have a tumor in your heart.

460
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,870
It's gonna require a surgery.

461
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,438
Why?

462
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:52,538
Because the tumor will eventually
make it impossible for your heart...

463
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,113
That'll keep me in the
hospital, what, a month?

464
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:01,914
- Maybe longer.
- Now you wanna spend money on me.

465
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:07,087
- Ruthie...
- Just save it for the next patient.

466
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,285
Too late for this one.

467
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:17,260
Okay, how about a little cramping
and dizziness to ease back in?

468
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:20,895
- I thought you weren't on until 4.
- I'm not. But since I couldn't sleep...

469
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,133
I figured I'd make
myself useful.

470
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,606
Hey...

471
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,938
do you know much about
our insurance policy?

472
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,409
Does it cover... therapy?

473
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,676
Physical or psychological?

474
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:37,118
Like couples or family counseling.
You know, nothing serious.

475
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,316
I think it's 80 percent,
but there's a max per year.

476
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,960
Excuse me.

477
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,926
Hey.

478
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,129
- Can you tell me where I can find...?
- Hey, Valerie.

479
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,792
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for you.

480
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,961
Yeah, right. Have you
seen Pratt anywhere?

481
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,970
He's up in MRI. You
want me to call him?

482
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,801
- I thought your plane left at 2.
- It does.

483
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,446
You come all the way down
to see him before you leave?

484
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,310
- It's gonna take an hour just...
- I came to see you, Mike.

485
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:07,510
I didn't wanna
leave things this way.

486
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,780
For real?

487
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:13,392
You're my brother.
That's gotta come first.

488
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:18,195
- I'll be more considerate next time, okay?
- Yeah.

489
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,833
- Need me to get you a cab?
- No, I got one waiting.

490
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,530
- I'll call you when I get in?
- Okay.

491
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:35,474
- Don't be so serious all the time.
- Have a safe flight.

492
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:40,580
- Cord edema and contusion at C-5.
- That can resolve with decompression.

493
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:44,382
Not with this degree of hemorrhage.
Kid thought he had it bad before.

494
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,151
Broke it in an MVA, right?

495
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,230
Pratt, Mr. Brodie's in recovery. I've
repaired his abdominal aneurysm.

496
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,335
And he's gonna be just
fine. How's his son doing?

497
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:01,997
- You don't wanna know.
- I do. His father's asking about it.

498
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:05,110
Complete cervical-cord
injury with quadriplegia.

499
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,205
His neck snapped
during an intubation.

500
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:10,747
Performed by whom?

501
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,382
Me.

502
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,945
I'm sorry.

503
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,551
- You okay?
- Yeah.

504
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,699
Hey.

505
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,600
Hey! Taxi!

506
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,872
Hey!

507
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,943
Taxi! Hey.

508
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,971
Greg? Unlock the door.

509
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,743
Hey, if I'd known you were
coming, I would've stayed downstairs.

510
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,751
Come on. Let me help you out.

511
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:55,653
- You all right?
- Yeah. It's just a rough day, that's all.

512
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,557
You know, it's
been good with you.

513
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,432
- Very good.
- Yeah, it has.

514
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:06,129
Look, I got four days off next
week. How about I come out to D.C.?

515
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,434
- We hang out, have a good time.
- That's sweet.

516
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:13,739
- I'm serious.
- I'm sure you are, but...

517
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,437
But what?

518
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,678
Greg...

519
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,284
it's been fun, you
know, a total blast.

520
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,920
But...

521
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:25,580
this has been like being on
vacation for me, you know?

522
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,191
What?

523
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,602
Bye, baby.

524
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,779
I thought he needed
to be reminded.

525
00:30:56,922 --> 00:31:00,518
- No chips?
- Carrot sticks are better for you.

526
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,629
- I got this. Thanks.
- Yeah. Look, he told me what he did.

527
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,424
Really?

528
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:11,028
I just wanted you to know
that I didn't show him how.

529
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,635
I know. I did.

530
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,238
Didn't think he'd ever try it.

531
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,040
I guess that wasn't
such a good idea.

532
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,675
I'm trying to call Sharon,
see if she'll babysit...

533
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,751
but I haven't
heard from her yet.

534
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,150
Okay.

535
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,656
Eat.

536
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,521
- She's, like, wigging out over nothing.
- Hey, just do as your mother says, okay?

537
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:53,068
- Did he seem okay to you?
- Yeah. Why?

538
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:58,173
It's just really hard doing it all by
yourself, you know? I mean, I try.

539
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,684
- You're doing great.
- Everyone says my kid's a freak.

540
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,515
People talk. So what?

541
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,590
I stuck tweezers into an electrical
socket when I was his age.

542
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,227
- And I knew better.
- Then why did you do it?

543
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,694
Because I was a kid. Kids
do stupid things sometimes.

544
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,899
- You think maybe he needs...?
- Hey, he'll be fine.

545
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,881
- Severa, where's Mrs. Webster?
- Who?

546
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,642
Older black woman, wanderer.
She finally go up to Cards?

547
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,309
Had to park her in the hall.
Morgue hasn't come yet.

548
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,785
- Didn't think she was your patient.
- She wasn't.

549
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,269
Damn.

550
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,443
16-year-old male, multiple
GSW to the chest and abdomen.

551
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,283
- Lost his pulse en route.
- Is he a gang kid?

552
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:15,985
Whatever happened to playing cops and
robbers? Two dead, another on the way.

553
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,288
Open up!

554
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,992
- Trauma 2's clear.
- Hey, I got another one behind me.

555
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,102
Come on, Sheila, Lester, go
with Carter. Neela, stay with me.

556
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,862
- Where do I go?
- They need hands in 2.

557
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,269
9-year-old caught in the crossfire.
Shotgun wound, pressure steady...

558
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,536
- 92/64 after a liter.
- Sam, prime the rapid infuser.

559
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,339
- What's your name, big guy?
- David.

560
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:38,177
Don't be scared, David.
Dr. Kovac is one of the best here.

561
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,835
Martin.

562
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,150
Your dad's gonna be okay.

563
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:22,021
I need to talk to you
about your intubation.

564
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,990
There was...

565
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,868
a problem involving
your spinal cord.

566
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,702
And it seems as though
you're gonna be paralyzed.

567
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,783
I...

568
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,057
<i>V-tach.</i>

569
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,111
All right, shock him
once before we cut.

570
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,897
Two hundred. This guy's got an entrance
wound for every two years of his life.

571
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,937
Missed one in the right axilla.

572
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,200
- Charged.
- Clear.

573
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,135
- It's no change. CARTER:
Give me a 10 blade.

574
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,734
Two units of O-neg infusing.

575
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,312
Suction.

576
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,913
Rib spreader.

577
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,323
All right, everybody.
Watch your feet.

578
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,889
All right, four units of
O-neg, then type-specific.

579
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,157
Come around here and
do internal compressions.

580
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:38,565
The most survivable lesion is
myocardial penetration with tamponade.

581
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,999
- Heart's empty.
- All right, Satinsky.

582
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,505
You want FFP too?

583
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:47,007
- Why FFP?
- If you get a dilutional coagulopathy...

584
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,908
after five units.

585
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,281
- Aorta is cross-clamped.
- Big hole in the left ventricle.

586
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,889
Let's plug it with a
Foley, 30 cc balloon.

587
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:57,752
That'll work?

588
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,984
- Paramedics said he had a pulse.
- It's worth a try.

589
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,789
Fifty mics of fent. He's out.

590
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,660
Vascular's in the O.R. with
a fem-pop. It'll be a while.

591
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,323
He doesn't have a while.

592
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,437
The longer we wait, the
greater loss of arm function.

593
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,436
Get me a vascular clamp.
- From where?

594
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,598
Thoracotomy kit.

595
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,873
Neela, I'm rolling
back with pressure.

596
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:25,279
When you see the end of the artery,
press down hard with your finger.

597
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:29,114
- Have an 0-silk stitch ready on a driver.
- Wound's down through the biceps.

598
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,516
I see humerus.

599
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,126
- Can a vascular clamp repair that?
- It's our best shot.

600
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,887
If the arm is ischemic too
long, we'll have to amputate.

601
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,054
All right, hold compressions.

602
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,062
- V-fib.
- Charge to 30.

603
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,997
- You gotta let go of the Foley.
- No, no. It won't conduct.

604
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,702
Still fib. Shock again?

605
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,636
No. Resume compressions.

606
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,709
Hold this. And
give me a 10 blade.

607
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,813
Heart won't respond to defibrillation until
you've restored volume until it's full.

608
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,883
- So, what are you doing now?
- It's called a clamshell incision.

609
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,021
- He must be bleeding in the right chest.
- Six units in so far.

610
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,850
Keep them coming.

611
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,685
- Got it.
- Clamp.

612
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,330
Push me the pad and
get me some IV tubing.

613
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,567
I'll tie the proximal
end, you do the distal.

614
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:25,670
- Purse-string it with 0 silk.
- That gonna hold a high-pressure artery?

615
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,905
Just a bridge until
Vascular can do a real repair.

616
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,608
- And this won't clot off?
- By then he will be in the O.R.

617
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,417
Releasing proximally.

618
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,626
A little oozing.

619
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:56,040
- Nails are pinking up. NEELA:
Palpable radial-ulnar pulse.

620
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,543
Didn't think you could do that.

621
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,948
- Fine V-fib.
- Been five minutes since the last epi.

622
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,880
Okay, push another amp.

623
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,383
Clear.

624
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,983
- Asystole.
- All right, another mig of atropine.

625
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,956
Is the heart filling? - Yeah.

626
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,722
After eight units, packed cells,
two FFP and a ton of platelets.

627
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,058
Okay, that's it.

628
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,931
- Pretty big mess.
- Can't say we didn't try.

629
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,668
I'll get Housekeeping on it.

630
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,012
I'm glad you went back.

631
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,521
To med school?

632
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,488
Yeah. Me too.

633
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,424
You never should have left.

634
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:54,761
Well... timing is
everything, right?

635
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:58,895
What?

636
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,605
- Nothing.
- What?

637
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,109
You seem happy.

638
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,111
Right back at you.

639
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,915
So we're okay?

640
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,484
We're okay.

641
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,960
Good. Because Kem and I, we're
gonna go get some dinner later.

642
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,791
Wanna come with us?

643
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,464
Well... I'm not that okay.

644
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,636
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

645
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,804
Ready to go?

646
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,482
- Alex.
- Mmm.

647
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:51,145
Come on. It's time to go home.

648
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,029
You can bring your car
around. I can help you carry him.

649
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,329
He's pretty out of it.

650
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:20,414
- You should have waited in the car.
- I haven't seen snow since I was a kid.

651
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,552
- Did you arrange for it?
- Yeah.

652
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:28,784
- Think it's too much?
- I think it's damn cold.

653
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,929
Brr... Oh! Oh!

654
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:36,397
- God, it's a good thing I love you.
- You want me to stop?

655
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,798
Not necessarily.

656
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,573
- We should go. SAM:
Put him in the back seat.

657
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,150
- Good night.
- Good night.

658
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,236
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

659
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,571
- You off now?
- Yep.

660
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:19,738
You need a lift?

661
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,038
I have something
to take care of first.

662
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,611
Okay.

663
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,668
- What are you doing?
- Need to fix my resignation letter.

664
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,166
- So you broke into my office?
- The door was open.

665
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,536
- I'm changing the date on my last shift.
- Let me guess. Sooner?

666
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,267
Actually, later.

667
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,773
You wanna be a
little more specific?

668
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,673
No.

669
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,683
- Not right now, anyway.
- Well, let me know when you decide.

670
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,718
See you tomorrow, Kerry.

671
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,617
Stay out of my inbox.

672
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,619
You'll have another?

673
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,460
Bring it on.

674
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,466
Come by to give me some more?

675
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,663
- Hey, I'll take one of those.
- You got it.

676
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,968
To tell you the truth,
I'm really not in the mood.

677
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,474
Yeah, I heard about that neck
thing. That's some hard stuff, man.

678
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:38,518
Look, we got a big family, okay?
Lots of boys. Val's the only girl.

679
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,887
So we all tend to be
a bit overprotective.

680
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,497
I ever tell you my mom
died when I was 12?

681
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,165
No, you didn't.

682
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,333
That's some hard-ass
stuff right there.

683
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,370
You have to get used to being
by yourself when that happens.

684
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,432
What about your father?

685
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,068
The truth is...

686
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,236
all anybody's got is themselves.

687
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,441
I'm not sure I agree with that.

688
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:08,350
Look...

689
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,751
just say what you have to say
and leave me at peace, okay?

690
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,095
- My sister...
- Played me.

691
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,062
She played me.

692
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,070
Well, you can't say
I didn't warn you.

693
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,870
So you were protecting me, huh?

694
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,141
Look, anyway, I'm sorry.

695
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,903
No worries.

696
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,546
Okay, then.

697
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,306
Have a good night.

698
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,810
No, leave it.

699
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,783
I'll drink it.
