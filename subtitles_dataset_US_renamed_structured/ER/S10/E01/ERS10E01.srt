NARRATOR<i>: Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:07,939
You're going, right?

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:11,578
- To Africa.
- It's not Rio.

4
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,608
But it's not here.

5
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,191
Dr. John, get down! Get down!

6
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,903
Don't do anything stupid.

7
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,446
- Like what?
- Like get yourself killed.

8
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,892
Hi.

9
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,457
Hi.

10
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,896
When did you get back?

11
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,905
Just now.

12
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,348
It's 5:30 in the morning.

13
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,813
My flight from
London was delayed.

14
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,920
I missed you.

15
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,968
Did you just let yourself in?

16
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,970
I'm sorry about how I left.

17
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,517
Can I have my key back, please?

18
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,287
Sorry we're late. I
couldn't get Hannah up.

19
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,390
Same with Katie this morning.

20
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,386
- I don't want to sit in the middle.
- In the car, please.

21
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,223
- I sat there yesterday.
- Hannah, sit in the middle, please?

22
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,476
- Move over, Matthew. LIZZIE:
Can we trade next week?

23
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,396
Steve's leaving. No
one can watch Devon.

24
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,058
Can you call and remind me?

25
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:33,435
Yes. Thank you,
Hannah. Bye, Matthew.

26
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,374
- Sorry you're stuck with the field trip.
- Luck of the draw.

27
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,272
Hey, Beth, it's me.
What do I have at 3?

28
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,840
Can we cancel Howard
or move him till later?

29
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,337
Crap. No, not you.

30
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,517
Traffic. I'll have to
call you back, Beth.

31
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,118
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, ladies.

32
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,187
I'm late for work.

33
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,192
<i>All trains departing. Please
report to the closing doors.</i>

34
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,954
<i>All trains departing. Please
report to the closing doors.</i>

35
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,258
Just made it, you know.

36
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,676
If I'm late again, my
boss is going to kill me.

37
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,974
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah.

38
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,979
Yes, I am.

39
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,721
Where are we, Mommy?

40
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,218
We're almost there, sweetie.

41
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,223
Denise Johnson.

42
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,096
No, Beth, I'm still stuck.

43
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,735
I'm taking surface... Mom? Mom!

44
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,842
Look out!

45
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,136
- Mom, look out!
- Aah!

46
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,750
Yes, it can be challenging,
and at times it is dangerous...

47
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,819
but it's very rewarding. You
know, you get to make money...

48
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,047
and be an asset to
your community and...

49
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,719
Now what?

50
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,327
<i>Attention, due to a
delay ahead of us...</i>

51
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,826
<i>we are unable to proceed.</i>

52
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,090
<i>We apologize for the inconvenience.
Thank you for your patience.</i>

53
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,470
Thank you.

54
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,747
He'll have them out in a few minutes.
- How many?

55
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,579
Four. A mother and three kids.

56
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,415
There's another guy trapped
under a car across the street.

57
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,420
Six-victim MVA.
Great way to start.

58
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,390
I was supposed to
have today off too.

59
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,772
Aren't you graduating soon?

60
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,590
- Yesterday. CHEN:
Congratulations.

61
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,823
What do they call the guy that
graduates last from medical school?

62
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,094
That joke is so tired. - Doctor.

63
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,260
I graduated fourth in my class.

64
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,338
When is this supposed
to be finished?

65
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,226
Weaver said they'd
be done last week.

66
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,140
They should be done
by what, Thanksgiving?

67
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,541
Why don't they just shut
us down during all this?

68
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,648
Oh, please. That would
make way too much sense.

69
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:40,117
Hey. Hey! Hey!

70
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,517
Is that absolutely necessary?

71
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,059
Does anyone know where Susan
is? We're gonna need extra hands.

72
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,286
Think she's in the handicapped head.
- Again?

73
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,659
- We're out of copier paper.
- I'm not chair anymore. Tell Dr. Lewis.

74
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,029
We're over our monthly allocation
and the chief of staff's office...

75
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,228
refuses to authorize
any additional overages.

76
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,465
- That's you, right?
- Excuse me.

77
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,802
Are you deaf? I said stop!

78
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,242
- Excuse me, can you help me, sir?
- You need to find a triage nurse.

79
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,008
- No, I'm sorry. I work here.
- Lucky you.

80
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,310
I'm supposed to start
today. Neela Rasgotra?

81
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,047
- "Rag" what?
- Rasgotra.

82
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,488
Don't we hire Americans anymore?
- Hey!

83
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,255
Hey! I'm talking to you!

84
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,161
- Dr. Lewis in there?
- Oh, yeah.

85
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,061
Susan.

86
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,765
- Yeah?
- See you later.

87
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,999
Yeah. You know what,
maybe. I don't know.

88
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,873
Fire's almost got the MVAs
out. Three adults, three kids.

89
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,247
- I thought you were divorced.
- We are.

90
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,777
- Carter's back.
- Yeah?

91
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,286
- He tried to apologize.
- Did he screw it up?

92
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,947
- Why bother? WEAVER:
You said Friday.

93
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,023
I said maybe.
Didn't say for sure.

94
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,958
Dr. Lewis, you got another TWA.

95
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,061
I'm Susan Lewis.
Are you a resident?

96
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,200
Neela Rasgotra.
Third-year medical student.

97
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,528
Nice outfit. Wear
something different next time.

98
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,534
It gets messy down
here. Put your stuff here.

99
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,264
- Where are the doors?
- Is this your first rotation?

100
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,602
- The glass? The tile?
- We usually wait until...

101
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,937
No! I don't want you to wait.

102
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,774
I want you to take what you
have and do it now, finish it.

103
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,416
Have you ever been in a trauma before?
- No.

104
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,917
Thirty-two-year-old restrained
driver in a high-speed rollover with PSI.

00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,481
Pulse 120, BP, 130/82.

107
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,321

111
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,601
Took CFD a while to cut her out.

112
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,602
How many more incoming? - Three.

113
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,812

115
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,778
- Good enough. Where's Pratt?
- Don't know.

116
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,345
- Frank, where's Dr. Pratt?
- How should I know?

117
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,676
Jerry, I want you to
start paging Pratt...

118
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,318
and don't stop paging
him until he calls back.

119
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,689
- My computer just went down.
- Well, they're all down.

120
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,950
Son of a bitch.

121
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,161
Oh, for God's sake.

122
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,293
Oh, man.

123
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,440
- Hello, I'm a doctor here.
- All right.

124
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,304
Hey! How was Africa? - Hot.

125
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,641
- That's your pager going off.
- Yeah.

126
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,513
- Gonna answer it?
- Nope.

127
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,951
I'll catch up with you later.

128
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,489
Matthew, back middle
passenger wearing a lap belt.

129
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,754
Scalp lac from the dome
light, closed left wrist fracture.

130
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,229
- Doctor, you're late.
- I was outside helping the paramedics.

131
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:46,339
You were supposed to be here at
8, not five after or 10 after or 20 after.

132
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,912
Hey, Frank.

133
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,523
- Where's the lounge?
- Down by X-ray.

134
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,985
Morning.

135
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,994
- You bring Kovac back with you?
- Nope.

136
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,969
Unh! Where's my mom?
Can you call my mom?

137
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,337
Hey, how you doing,
Matthew? I'm Dr. Gallant.

138
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,537
- Good vitals. A and O times four.
- Doctor? When did that happen?

139
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,739
- About 20 minutes ago.
- Where does it hurt?

140
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,178
My arm.

141
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,012
Can you push my
hands with your feet?

142
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,053
Who's in there with Dr. Lewis?

143
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,527
New med student.

144
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,696
Yeah, his belly is tender.

145
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,929
But soft. MATTHEW: Ow!

146
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,037
It's probably just bruised. Get
abdominal CT and a wrist series.

147
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,696
I'll be next door
if you need me.

148
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,243
Hey. You need some help?

149
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:37,544
Sure. Trauma panel includes
CBC, Chem-7, LFTs, amylase...

150
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:41,882
PT, PTT, urine toxicology
screen and a B.A.L.

151
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,524
- I'm Dr. Greg Pratt.
- Neela Rasgotra.

152
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,456
I don't know what
happened. I was driving...

153
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,392
- then we were upside down.
- Neela. That's Indian, right?

154
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,362
- Yeah. DENISE: My
daughter, is she okay?

155
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,924
Please?

156
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,730
We need to make sure you're
fine first. Pupils, 4 millimeters.

157
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,566
Equal and reactive bilaterally.

158
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:03,198
- Sinus tach, HemoCue is 8.1.
- Eight point one, that's pretty low.

159
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,345
We gotta find the
source of the blood loss.

160
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,704
Could be hemothorax
bleeding in the chest.

161
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,904
Chest is clear.

162
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,978
Or it could be
intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

163
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,585
- Belly is soft and non-tender.
- Or it could be something else.

164
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,055
Like a unstable pelvic
fracture, Professor Pratt?

165
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,267
Hey. An attorney called
every day while you were gone.

166
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,965
Said he was the executor of
your grandmother's estate...

167
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,579
needs to talk to you.
Call him back, would you?

168
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,279
I am not your
personal assistant.

169
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,613
- Hey. Welcome back, Carter.
- Yeah, you too.

170
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,962
- What do you have?
- Pelvic fracture with a low crit.

171
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,192
- How was Africa?
- It was great.

172
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,802
- She hypotensive?
- No, pressure's holding...

173
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,496
but a little girl next door
may need some help.

174
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,642
DENISE Is that
Hannah? Is she okay?

175
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,416
- Need a hand? CHEN:
Welcome home, stranger.

176
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,017
Open your eyes, Hannah. - Unh.

177
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,644
Responds to pain. Hannah?

178
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,523
- When did you get back?
- Last night, late.

179
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,492
- They pulled another kid out.
- I'll take the new one.

180
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,691
Let you two catch up. She's
altered. Right parietal hematoma.

181
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,666
- Call for a head CT.
- Crush injury, femur fractures...

182
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,465
with good pulses.

183
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:43,468
- She needs Hare traction.
- She broke both her legs.

184
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,506
- So put on two.
- Not room for two.

185
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,345
- Are we arguing?
- I just don't wanna adduct her legs.

186
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,014
- She needs traction.
- Well, we can rig a Sager...

187
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,017
with a double harness bar.

188
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,012
Why didn't you say
that in the first place?

189
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,755
Morrison's pouch is between
the liver and the right kidney.

190
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,088
Any liquid blood appears
anechoic between the two organs.

191
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,698
- Big black stripe, right?
- That's right.

192
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,746
Can I steal a nurse, Susan?
- Yeah, sure.

193
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,893
Central line's in.
Hook up the infuser.

194
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,266
Dr. Chen, this is Neela,
our new medical student.

195
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,374
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

196
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,911
Okay. No blood visualized.
Moving to the left upper quadrant...

197
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,072
- to view the subdiaphragmatic space.
- Malik, can you join me?

198
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,150
Yeah. CHEN: Thank you.

199
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,012
The transverse supra-pubic scan
looks for blood anterior to the bladder.

200
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,353
- I'm stealing your aprons.
- Okay, go ahead.

201
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,498
I found your present
hanging on my locker.

202
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,265
It was subtle.

203
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,403
It was very subtle.

204
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,766
- All clear.
- HemoCue 7.9.

205
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,101
Bring me the finished
films. How's her pressure?

206
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,437
- 110/78.
- If she's anemic and losing blood...

207
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,773
- why not drop her pressure?
- She's healthy.

208
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,438
Ma'am, we're gonna
stabilize your pelvic fracture.

209
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,145
- I need you to keep traction. Come on.
- This will hurt some, Denise.

210
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,151
I'm gonna go check
on your daughter.

211
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:06,088
Keep two of O-neg on the rapid
infuser, just in case. Be back.

212
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,598
Need a Pedes vent?
- Called for it.

213
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:19,728
Five rib fractures with a flail segment.
Prep for a 28 French chest tube.

214
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,966
I'll get some help.
Gallant, how you doing?

215
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,736
- Fine.
- You want to run it?

216
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,645
Yeah, 8-year-old boy.
Middle rear-seat passenger.

217
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,975
Scalp lac, left wrist
fracture. Seat belt sign.

218
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,482
- Rule out an interperitoneal injury.
- Okay.

219
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,180
Hey, unilateral open-book fracture.
- She drop her BP yet?

220
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,120
- Well, she's a trouper.
- I'll call upstairs. Go next door.

221
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,761
Jing-Mei needs some help.
Frank, can you call Angio...

222
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,329
and tell them to reserve
a room for my pelvis?

223
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,600
- Where's the Thora-Seal?
- I only got two hands.

224
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,362
- I can pitch in.
- Good.

225
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,766
Sure you can tear yourself away
from your med student for a moment?

226
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,500
She's doing fine.

227
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,311
Are they together?

228
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,311
- Who?
- Them.

229
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,487
Oh, yeah.

230
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,488
My hands are starting to cramp.

231
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:16,686
Well, I'll go get
those towel clips.

232
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,963
I don't know what happened.

233
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:28,164
I was driving, and then
we were upside down.

234
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,670
And the truck hit us.

235
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,674
How are Matthew and Katie?

236
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,871
I don't know.

237
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,210
Has someone
called their parents?

238
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,321
Lizzie and Steve are Katie's.

239
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,558
Matthew's dad is Andy. Oh, God.

240
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,562
Is that one of the
girls next door?

241
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,031
Is that Hannah?

242
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,405
Oh, God, Hannah.
Please, please...

243
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,839
be okay, please.

244
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,741
Hannah?

245
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,913
- PVCs.
- What's her pulse ox?

246
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,451
- One-oh-four.
- Thirty of lidocaine. Crank up the O2.

247
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,885
- Think her T waves look peaked?
- It's too early.

248
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:20,083
- Carter, they look peaked to me.
- Just push the damn lidocaine.

249
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,194
- V-tach.
- No pulse. Starting compressions.

250
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,727
Charge it to 30.

251
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,963
What are they doing?
What's happening?

252
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,793
I can't tell from here.

253
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,266
- Is something wrong? NEELA:
Please, ma'am, don't move.

254
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,269
Denise? Mrs. Johnson?

255
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,776
I need some help in here.

256
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,281
Hey! Hey!

257
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,682
What's going on?

258
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,583
Pelvic fracture, anemia,
dropped pressure.

259
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,167
- Who are you?
- Medical student.

260
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,422
- Who's her doctor?
- I'm stabilizing her fracture.

261
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,791
- While she bleeds. You from the East End?
- No, West London.

262
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,161
- What happened?
- I want a second line wide-open.

263
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,599
- How much O-neg has she had?
- None. She was stable.

264
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,239
Well, now her pressure is 60/40.

265
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,137
Did anyone ultrasound the belly?
- Negative for blood.

266
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,335
- What about chest x-ray?
- All clear.

267
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,107
- Pressure's up to 80 systolic.
- I want a second line in, prep for a DPL.

268
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,683
- What's her CBC?
- It's not back yet.

269
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,286
- You. Go pick up her labs.
- Right now?

270
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,685
No, next Thursday.

271
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:27,952
B level, Specimen Processing.
Take the elevator in the lobby. Go!

272
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,995
Prep for an IJ. I'll do
a mini-lap for the DPL.

273
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,258
Excuse me? The elevators?
- Right there.

274
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,202
- And clear.
- Do a V-tach.

275
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,863
Charge again to 60. Let's
open an intubation tray.

276
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,272
- Her chemistries are almost ready.
- And clear.

277
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,106
Okay, sinus tach.
Another half bolus of lido.

278
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,043
- Say that again.
- More lidocaine.

279
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,377
At 8.3, thanks.

280
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,713
Well, her potassium's 8.3.

281
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,123
All right, 30 cc's of bicarb, five
units of regular insulin, amp of D-25.

282
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,658
T waves are peaked.

283
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,754
- You should've listened...
- Later.

284
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,899
Kayexelate by
NG, call for dialysis.

285
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,763
Let's open a 12 French
double lumen femoral catheter.

286
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:16,070
- Spell the last name again.
- Johnson. J-O-H-N-S-O-N.

287
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,972
"Specimen pending." Says
Dr. Shine is reviewing the slide.

288
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,410
- Where's Dr. Shine?
- Hey, you can't go back there.

289
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,244
- Sorry, won't happen again.
- This is authorized personnel.

290
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,579
I'll only be a
second. Dr. Shine?

291
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,813
- Dr. Shine?
- On the other side.

292
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,725
Dr. Shine?

293
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,218
- Are you working on Denise Johnson?
- Who wants to know?

294
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,296
She's crashing in the ER.

295
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,390
This is a very unusual smear.

296
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,805
Pressure's up to 95.
CORDAY: Fluid looks clear.

297
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,810
- Hang two of type-specific. NEELA:
No, don't give her type-specific.

298
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,279
She has an autoimmune hemolytic
anemia. She'll go into renal failure.

299
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,681
- Where's the lab slip?
- I reviewed the slide with Dr. Shine.

300
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:04,449
She's got microspherocytes,
hyperbilirubinemia and a high retic count.

301
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,854
- Hang more of O-neg.
- Get Shine on the phone.

302
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:10,190
She said she was driving and when
she woke up, she was upside down.

303
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,456
The anemia could've
made her pass out, right?

304
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,293
Dr. Shine on line one.

305
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,624
Dr. Shine.

306
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,134
- A med student was there.
- Pressure's 105, pulse is down.

307
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,636
Damn, girl.

308
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,806
- ER, please hold.
- ER. What?

309
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,381
- ER.
- No, this is not CICU.

310
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,541
No, you have the wrong
extension. OB is 1687.

311
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,846
ER. No, this is
not the cafeteria.

312
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,580
- No, Surgical Post Op is 7204.
- Why would I transfer you?

313
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,224
- ER.
- ER.

314
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,724
- What the hell is going on?
- Hold, please.

315
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:45,353
Hey, jag-off! What, are you
screwing up our phone lines now too?

316
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,090
- What do we do?
- Don't answer them.

317
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,962
Charts for waiting
patients over here.

318
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,160
Do an H & P and call
me. You ever do history?

319
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,397
- Yeah.
- Good. Grab an easy one...

320
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,097
and come find me
when you're ready.

321
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,670
Hey, don't you cats
hear the phones ringing?

322
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,079
- Med student?
- Mm-hm.

323
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,689
Yeah, I saw you a bit
earlier. Your first day?

324
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,256
Yeah.

325
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,553
- Are you Indian?
- Yeah. Punjabi.

326
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,528
Perfect.

327
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,866
This must be quite
an adjustment for you.

328
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,768
No, not really. My family
moved to London when I was 11.

329
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,004
Yale for molecular biology and
biophysics, and Chicago for medical school.

330
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,937
Okay, then. Let's
get you started.

331
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,081
Oh!

332
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,319
Penile discharge. Probably
not your ideal first patient.

333
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,923
AV infected graft. Sounds
about right. Come on.

334
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,159
- What is going on down here?
- Glad to see you, Dr. Romano.

335
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,629
Yeah, I doubt it. Who was that?

336
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,463
One of those University of Calcutta
carpetbaggers you people insist on hiring.

337
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,334
- I think she said she went to Yale.
- Yeah, her daddy's probably a drug lord.

338
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,772
Built a new wing on the Yale
library with his poppy profits.

339
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,004
- How's the arm?
- Gone. How's the prostate?

340
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,240
About the size of your head.
I'm up four times a night to pee.

341
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,317
- Why the beard?
- I hear ladies like it.

342
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,919
Whose bright idea was all this anyway?
- Weaver!

343
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:18,148
- Dr. Romano, you're back.
- Hide your wild enthusiasm of my return.

344
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,761
I find overt displays of emotion
embarrassing. Hey, page Weaver for me.

345
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,660
Dr. Carter, you got a minute?

346
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,957
Get her potassium
down and she'll be fine.

347
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,431
Bactroban and OpSite.

348
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,061
Call me if you need me.

349
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,335
I won't.

350
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,272
- What do you got?
- HIV-positive patient.

351
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,972
Came in a couple of weeks
ago with oral candidiasis.

352
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,482
Got a prescription for Nystatin,
but he's back with worse.

353
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,848
What was that all about?

354
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,522
The moons must be lined up
because Jing-Mei's pissed off too.

355
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,559
- What's Deb upset about?
- Misunderstanding.

356
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,788
Abby still mad at you?

357
00:24:58,764 --> 00:24:59,925
So, what did you do, anyway?

358
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:03,193
Oh, I don't know.
I left, I guess.

359
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,598
This guy's not on Medicaid.

360
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,262
He's uninsured so I
referred him to ADAP.

361
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,741
- So, what do you wanna do with him?
- ADAP is out of money.

362
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,038
It would be two months before
they could get him on his meds...

363
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,681
if he's only HIV-positive.

364
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:23,855
Mr. Williams.
Hello, I'm Dr. Carter.

365
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,283
Mind if I take a look?

366
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,595
- How long has he been HIV-positive?
- Two years.

367
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,122
Oh.

368
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,268
- Does it hurt when you swallow?
- Mm-hm.

369
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,964
- I've been taking my medication.
- You're not on the triple cocktail?

370
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:46,145
- AZT, 3TC?
- No, I have a prescription...

371
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,179
but the guy at the pharmacy
told me it's 1200 bucks.

372
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,308
I can't afford that.

373
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,248
Well, I've got some good
news and some bad news.

374
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:58,622
The oral thrush from last week has
spread down into your esophagus.

375
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:03,585
- That's the bad news, huh?
- No, actually, that's the good news.

376
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,163
It's an opportunistic infection.

377
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:10,632
It means you now qualify for
Medicaid and the anti-retroviral therapy.

378
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,968
So, what's the bad news?

379
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:19,308
Candidal esophagitis is
an AIDS-defining infection.

380
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,306
That's why you qualify now.

381
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,148
I have AIDS.

382
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,092
Uh...

383
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,667
We're going to write you a prescription
for Diflucan to help fight the infection.

384
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,704
- What is that gonna cost? CARTER:
Nothing. Medicaid will cover it.

385
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:51,503
We'll send you to the financial counselor's
office to help get your paperwork done.

386
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,482
He came from the
airport to your place.

387
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,310
That's gotta tell you something.

388
00:26:58,484 --> 00:26:59,543
What, he's horny?

389
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,812
Or that he really missed
you and felt bad about leaving.

390
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,822
Tell him how it made you feel.
Give him the chance to make up for it.

391
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,787
- Oh, for God's sake, where do we go?
- Second floor.

392
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,954
- Screw that. ABBY:
He just shows back up...

393
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,795
like he never went away and like
he wasn't a jerk for leaving like that...

394
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,194
and like... That's
the men's room.

395
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,705
Howdy, boys. Don't mind me.
Guard the door for me, would you?

396
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,378
- Make up for it how?
- Flowers, a nice dinner.

397
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,679
If you're really mad, jewelry.

398
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,923
I could use a new
transmission for my car.

399
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,083
You're a real romantic,
you know that?

400
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:44,092
AV graft connects the brachial
vein to the brachial artery...

401
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,390
for easy dialysis access.

402
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,591
- See the redness and the swelling?
- Mm-hm.

403
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,031
- Is there any pain here?
- It hurts like hell.

404
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:54,571
Yeah, the fluctuance and the
infection is pointing with discharge.

405
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,733
Feel for the thrill
over the graft.

406
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,704
Listen for a bruit.

407
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,007
- You have beautiful skin.
- Thank you.

408
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,048
You use anything special on it?

409
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,845
Not really.

410
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,079
What a lovely color.

411
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:13,055
Lastly, you want to check the heart
to make sure there's no murmur.

412
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,762
- What do you think we'd worry about?
- Bacterial endocarditis.

413
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,596
Good, good. So, what do we need?

414
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,633
- Labs? GALLANT:
Yep. CBC, Chem-7...

415
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,133
Gram's stain, and a
culture from the abscess...

416
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,863
and get me 3 grams of
Unasyn IV, piggyback.

417
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,407
- Do we drain it?
- No, not in the ER.

418
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,772
She goes to the O.R. for an I&D.

419
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:36,143
So check her vitals every 15
minutes until she goes up to the O.R...

420
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,785
and grab another chart.

421
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,750
Talk to him. Haven't you
punished him enough already?

422
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,449
- It's not about punishing him.
- Oh, no.

423
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,755
If he starts in on me again, I
swear I'll cut the other arm off.

424
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,295
Get a saw. I'll hold him down.

425
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,127
A same-day surgery center
will get more paying customers.

426
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,735
- It's not your concern anymore.
- This is a money pit.

427
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,236
We have people coming
through the door every day...

428
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,237
and we're legally
obligated to treat them.

429
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,139
Which is why we should grab wood, nail
the entrance shut, and paint "Go away."

430
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,941
- Frank, are the phones working again?
- Two lines. The rest we don't answer.

431
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,313
Some guy looking for Cubs
tickets last time I checked.

432
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,250
Oh, Dr. Carter, that guy from
the foundation called again.

433
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,151
- Take a message?
- I said you were here.

434
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,760
- He's coming with some papers.
- I don't want him here while I work.

435
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,328
Well, tell him yourself
when you see him.

436
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,274
- Hey.
- Hey.

437
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,309
- You want to get a cup of coffee?
- Yeah.

438
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,344
Excuse me, Dr. Carter, right?

439
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,491
Tom Williams. You sent me
up to financial counseling...

440
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,321
to get on Medicaid for
my throat medication.

441
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,190
- Right.
- I filled out the paperwork.

442
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,196
I went to the pharmacy. They
can't give me the prescription...

443
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,493
until I get my Medicaid card.

444
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,534
Should I keep taking
Nystatin until then?

445
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:07,366
- Did they say how long it will take?
- A few weeks.

446
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:12,034
You need to take the Diflucan
now. Can you cover the cost of it?

447
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,543
It's 300 bucks.

448
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,712
Okay, hang out. I'll call
the pharmacy myself.

449
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,146
Now what?

450
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,220
The pharmacy won't fill his
prescription till he gets his card.

451
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,686
We could shoot him.
It would be easier.

452
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,587
My Frank died four years ago.

453
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,052
Liver cancer.

454
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,058
Married 52 years.

455
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,864
I was a teenage bride.

456
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,004
No, really, I...

457
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:43,535
I was 16. Never
dated nobody else.

458
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,770
Never kissed nobody else.

459
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:53,110
That man was a perfect
slob. God love him.

460
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,549
Yeah, had six boys to boot and
not one of them worth a damn.

461
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,555
- You married?
- No. I've been in school.

462
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,894
Well, well, don't put
it off too long, dear.

463
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:09,228
He doesn't have to be handsome.
Just make sure he treats you right.

464
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:15,774
Okay. All done, Mrs.
Ferguson. I'll be back soon.

465
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,038
- Wait. Where do you think you're going?
- It's 2:30.

466
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,879
- So what?
- We stop at 2:30.

467
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,317
- It's barely lunchtime.
- We started at 7.

468
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,717
I started at 6.

469
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,722
This is unbelievable.

470
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,889
- Labs go...?
- Right over there.

471
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,930
- How's it going?
- Dr. Gallant's been very helpful.

472
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,303
I'm sure he has been.
Need another patient?

473
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,570
- Yeah.
- All right. Come on.

474
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,344
No. No.

475
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,587
Here, try this. Take a
history and come find me.

476
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,312
Okay.

477
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,996
Hello, Emergency Department.

478
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,773
I'm sorry, I can't hear
you very well. For who?

479
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,603
- Anybody seen Carter?
- Excuse me?

480
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,938
- He's with Abby on a break.
- The phone was ringing...

481
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,876
and no one was
around, so I answered it.

482
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,776
- Big mistake.
- It's long-distance...

483
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,316
- overseas, for a Dr. Carter.
- Of course. Who else?

484
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,147
Take a message.

485
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,789
Yeah, can I take a message?

486
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,028
Uh, they say it's important.
Someone has died.

487
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,392
- Who?
- Someone named Kovac.

488
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,590
A Dr. Luka Kovac.

489
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,811
So how was it?

490
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,145
It was incredible.

491
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,348
And it was terrible. It was...

492
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,685
It was kids with polio. It was
kids dying from malnutrition...

493
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:20,094
and malaria and
whooping cough and...

494
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,194
And it was beautiful. I
mean, the country's beautiful.

495
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,531
Hospital doesn't
have enough staff...

496
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,377
so the patients' family
members, they stay with them.

497
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:38,006
They cook for them, they clean for
them, they even change the sheets.

498
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,879
It was a life-changing
experience.

499
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,384
I just don't know how yet.

500
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,894
Where's Luka?

501
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,134
- Is that what this is about?
- No.

502
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:05,711
Luka's fine. Luka's
more than fine.

503
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,142
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

504
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,941
Nothing.

505
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,387
Do you know we don't talk?

506
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,991
- We're not talking now?
- Your mouth is moving.

507
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,124
You give the impression we're
having a real conversation...

508
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:27,095
but when you finish, I have
no idea what you're thinking.

509
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,026
I was trying to tell
you about Africa.

510
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,305
You knew I didn't want you
to go and you went anyway.

511
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,304
What, were you
trying to hurt me? I...

512
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,975
- Why would I want to hurt you?
- I don't know.

513
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,046
Why would you want to hurt me?

514
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,478
- It wasn't about you.
- Oh, come on.

515
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,642
You didn't tell me you were
going. If hadn't bumped into you...

516
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,880
- I wouldn't have even known.
- I wasn't trying to hurt you.

517
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,485
I wanted to feel like I was
really doing something.

518
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,339
Did you even think about me?
- Yes.

519
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,759
Okay. What did you think?

520
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,896
What did you think?

521
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,899
- I don't know why you came back.
- You're gonna walk away?

522
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,475
- Yeah.
- Okay, walk away, Abby.

523
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,635
- That's what you do best.
- Okay.

524
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:17,005
Want to know what you do best?
You make this about my problems...

525
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,845
but you know what, you
have some problems too.

526
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:24,217
- You've got some really big problems.
- Why did I come back?

527
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,221
Luka's over there
changing the world...

528
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,087
and I can't get a
hospital pharmacy...

529
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,929
to give an AIDS patient enough
damn Diflucan to keep him...

530
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,693
from dying from a sore throat.

531
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,438
Kisangani, West Africa.

532
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,774
Do they know how? - No.

533
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,472
Does he have family here? - No.

534
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,693
Hey. You okay?

535
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,263
I didn't know him. Who was he?

536
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,560
- An Attending.
- Friend?

537
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,131
No, not really.

538
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,832
So how's your shunt?

539
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,942
- That's where I'm going.
- Well, keep an eye on her.

540
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,476
Surgery should be down soon.

541
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,512
Where did she go? Do you
know where my patient went?

542
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,451
Mrs. Ferguson? Infected
dialysis shunt, older woman.

543
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,489
I have no idea.

544
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,123
What's up? Ready to present
that old guy in Curtain 1?

545
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,288
- Mm, yeah.
- All right.

546
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,892
Seventy-two-year-old man,
notes constipation without fever...

547
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,801
nausea, vomiting, weight
loss or hematochezia.

548
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,101
- Mm-hm.
- His only medication is Vicodin TID.

549
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,713
Abdomen is soft, flat, non-tender.
- Mm-hm.

550
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:59,613
Normal bowel sounds. Negative
guaiac, no evidence of impaction.

551
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:05,086
- So, what's your assessment?
- Constipation due to Vicodin use.

552
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,957
What is the number one neoplasm
in terms of national mortality?

553
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,992
- Breast cancer?
- No, that would be lung.

554
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,427
And number two?

555
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,933
- Colon cancer. CHEN:
Over 50,000 deaths per year.

556
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,971
The common presenting
symptoms are?

557
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:25,337
Anemia, hematochezia
and constipation.

558
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,572
So wouldn't you agree that a
constipated, elderly patient...

559
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,809
- merits an evaluation for colon cancer?
- The stool is negative.

560
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,146
He got all bound up when
he started the Vicodin.

561
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,290
Order a bowel prep and schedule
an outpatient barium enema.

562
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,815
You're serious?

563
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,624
You heard the lady.

564
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,363
Otherwise without complaints.
Refilled his prescriptions...

565
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,299
and referred him to a clinic.

566
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,929
You know, you were pretty rough on
her. You really think that was necessary?

567
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,009
- Who we talking about?
- Come on, now.

568
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,339
I was trying to teach
her. Whatever you think...

569
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,675
Look, no, you come on now.

570
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,811
You were all over her. It's
humiliating and embarrassing.

571
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,511
- I wasn't all over her.
- Don't make a fool of me, okay?

572
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:13,522
- I'm not trying to make a fool of you.
- There's an old lady in here bleeding out.

573
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,715
No breathing, no pulse.

574
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,857
Get the crash cart.

575
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,362
Bag her on 15 liters.
Whose patient is this?

576
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,023
She's mine.

577
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,670
- Greg, start compressions.
- You're kidding.

578
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,503
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.

579
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,339
You left an infected
AV graft unattended.

580
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,142
- She needs a central line and saline.
- What she needs is a hearse and pine box.

581
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,047
The graft was in a major
artery. She needed monitoring.

582
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,085
I was supposed to
check every 15 minutes.

583
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,382
No, she was my responsibility.

584
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,526
- Asystole.
- Amp of epi.

585
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,094
I went to her room and she was
gone. I thought she was in surgery.

586
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:54,391
I moved her in here to give her
more privacy for a 12-lead EKG.

587
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,229
- Did you tell anybody?
- Yeah, I changed it on the board.

588
00:38:57,402 --> 00:39:00,895
- Did you check the patient board?
- It's not her fault. It's mine.

589
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,770
Four units of packed
cells, 4 liters of saline...

590
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,844
and another round
of epi and atropine.

591
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,879
In Zagreb, Kovac, K-O-V-A-C.

592
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,074
Yeah, Croatia.

593
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,686
You can connect me, great.

594
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:21,192
Yeah, in Za... English?

595
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,255
You speak English?

596
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,330
Zagreb, Kovac. K-O-V-A-C.

597
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,869
Hey. Do you know
Luka's father's first name?

598
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,208
There's like 100
Kovacs in Zagreb.

599
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,911
Okay, sorry. No,
thank you. Thank you.

600
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,078
What are you doing?

601
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:51,613
The Alliance will have his contact
information. I can just get it from them.

602
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,461
Do you know whose this is?

603
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,594
- What are you doing?
- There's a 12:00 flight to Paris...

604
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,795
and then I can connect to
Kinshasa with a four-hour layover.

605
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,065
Wait, wait, wait. You're
gonna go back there?

606
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,800
- Why? CARTER:
Because I left him there.

607
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,740
- Left him where? CARTER:
At the clinic in Matenda.

608
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:18,913
- I should have stayed.
- You're not making any sense.

609
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,813
John.

610
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:35,657
- Doctor, what are doing?
- I'll inventory it. You can bill me.

611
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,454
It wasn't your fault.

612
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,692
You've got blood on your sleeve.

613
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,959
What's a TWA?

614
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,466
- What?
- A TWA.

615
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,305
Where did you hear that from?

616
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,702
The old guy at the front desk with the
flat head called me a TWA this morning.

617
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,140
I don't know what it means.

618
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,557
Third World Assassin.

619
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,655
TWA.

620
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,067
Hey, come on, I wanna
show you something.

621
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,509
Come on.

622
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,115
Was that today?

623
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:40,918
Thirty-two-year-old mother of
two with a rare blood disorder.

624
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,758
Still alive tonight.

625
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,624
I'll see you tomorrow.

626
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,591
- You don't have to go now.
- I'll call you from Paris.

627
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,738
Can't you wait until
it's a little bit safer?

628
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:07,949
I can't leave him there.

629
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,833
Well, just... I don't
want you to go.

630
00:43:09,857 --> 00:43:11,817
I'll be gone a couple
days. I'll call you.

631
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,015
John, please. Please, just stay.

632
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,787
I can't keep doing this.
