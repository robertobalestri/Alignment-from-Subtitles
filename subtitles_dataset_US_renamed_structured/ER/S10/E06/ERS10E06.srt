1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,871
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,442
Sam Taggart, new nurse.

3
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,771
I started my Surgical rotation
today. I'm back in med school.

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,678
- So no more nursing?
- No.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,116
I'm still gonna be taking a few
shifts for a while. I need the money.

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,619
What are you nutmeats doing?

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,847
Clearing Triage.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,118
We'll provide good care,
and we're gonna do it faster.

9
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:30,253
We're gonna form a line down the hall,
and you'll be examined three at a time.

10
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,429
- Is this your new hospital?
- Yep.

11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,035
It's even crappier
than the last one.

12
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,468
I'm a 71-year-old man who's going
blind. I've considered everything.

13
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:42,201
I need you to promise me you're not
gonna kill yourself in the next 72 hours.

14
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,038
But Monday would be okay?

15
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,943
I'm off the hook by then.

16
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:54,347
"The friend had, in a weak hour,
spoken with sobs of his own death.

17
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,458
He had delivered a melancholy
oration previous to his funeral...

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,787
and had doubtless in
the packet of letters...

19
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,295
presented various
keepsakes to relatives.

20
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,456
But he had not died...

21
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,693
and thus he had
delivered himself...

22
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,361
into the hands of the youth."

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,970
Oh, sorry.

24
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,775
Are you taking your enalapril?

25
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,178
- Uh, yeah.
- Want me to bump up your Lasix?

26
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,343
Coffee does the same thing.

27
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,777
It also raises your
blood pressure.

28
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:30,286
Well, as luck would have it
you gave me a pill for that too.

29
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,850
You want more espresso?

30
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,291
Not unless I'm
gonna fly to work.

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,201
"The latter felt immensely
superior to his friend...

32
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,862
but he inclined toward
condescension."

33
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,838
You don't have
to keep doing this.

34
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,741
Well, I've got time to finish the chapter.
I've never read this before. It's good.

35
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,350
You don't have to
keep coming here.

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,513
I don't have this book.

37
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,714
Keep it. I'm...

38
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,321
I'm never gonna read it again.

39
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,183
That's why I'm here.
That and the coffee.

40
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,386
He died at 29.

41
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,858
Stephen Crane.

42
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,734
TB.

43
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,537
Just a little trivia.

44
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,343
Nice. Very cheery.

45
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,043
"He adopted toward him an
air of patronizing good humor.

46
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,051
His self-pride was
now entirely restored."

47
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,757
I like this place already.

48
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,325
Don't think they give away
free doughnuts every day.

49
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,931
- Bars give away free peanuts.
- So you get thirsty and buy more beer.

50
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,378
If they gave away doughnuts,
people would buy more coffee.

51
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,560
Please! Can you help me?

52
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,433
I think I'm having
a miscarriage.

53
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,938
- How many weeks?
- Twenty-four.

54
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,303
- First pregnancy?
- First one to last this long.

55
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,475
Oh, she's adorable.

56
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,114
I found six behind my
apartment. She's the last one.

57
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,945
- They don't allow pets in my building.
- They're not allowed in here either.

58
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,280
- Hey, buddy, want a doughnut?
- Frank!

59
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,786
What? Dogs love doughnuts.

60
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,787
Want a pooch?
Free to a good home.

61
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,448
Dogs irritate my asthma.

62
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,527
Hi, I'm Terra King
from Ladokern.

63
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,188
I have gifts and snacks for the Residents.
Is there some place I can set up?

64
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,696
Lester. Lester, can you
take care of this, please?

65
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,336
- What's wrong with him? PRATT:
Come on. Punch it, Cat Daddy.

66
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,472
What are you guys watching?
- Carjacking.

67
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,698
Pratt.

68
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,103
Needs to get on Lower
Wacker to lose the chopper.

69
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,440
This is Denny. Vaginal bleeding
at 24 weeks. Can you take her?

70
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,776
- Sure, sure, let's go.
- Cheering for the carjacker to get away?

71
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,111
No, we just want him
to get a few more blocks.

72
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,221
South of Van Buren he's out of
our catchment and goes to Mercy.

73
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,956
- If there's a crash...
- There's always a crash.

74
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,059
Turn left. Get on
the expressway.

75
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,904
Yes, yes, go, go! - Go, go, go!

76
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,055
Ooh! Hmm.

77
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,291
- Damn it.
- That's gonna hurt.

78
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,142
You have friends downstairs but
you can't let them take advantage.

79
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,583
- The patient was borderline.
- Precisely my point.

80
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,418
He needs to stay in the ER. If his
condition worsens, I'll go back down.

81
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,924
You know they're only
too happy to free up beds...

82
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,824
by dumping patients
onto Surgery.

83
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,862
Dr. Corday, they
need you in post-op...

84
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,466
and the ER is calling
for a gallstone consult.

85
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,196
All right, you go down there,
make your assessment and call me.

86
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,306
Be strong.

87
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,939
Colles' fracture. Put
on a sugar-tong splint...

88
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,273
and have him come back for
casting after the swelling goes down.

89
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,879
- Vicodin for pain.
- Wrist film?

90
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,448
It's not deformed.
Distal neuro-circ intact.

91
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,107
We'll get an x-ray when we cast.

92
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:22,052
Malik, get six units of O-neg down here
before the car crash starts rolling in.

93
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,781
- Already ordered eight.
- Tell me about the gallbladder.

94
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,325
Um, fat and 40 with
a history of gallstones.

95
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,623
I gave her a shot of Toradol. She's
afebrile. Abdomen is non-tender.

96
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,698
- Good. Send her home.
- No ultrasound?

97
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,701
No. No labs, no IV, no x-rays.
Tell her to stick to a low-fat diet.

98
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,792
How'd you do this?

99
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,897
I was using a utility
knife to open a box.

100
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,976
Be more careful. Keep it clean and
dry. Come back in two days for a check.

101
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,807
- What's this?
- 24-year-old female, bladder infection...

102
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,508
- positive for leuks, ICON is negative.
- I ordered Bactrim and Pyridium.

103
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,483
Good. Tell her to
pee after she has sex.

104
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,815
It's a good way to prevent UTIs.

105
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,391
Coop, your subconjunctival hemorrhage
probably happened from sneezing...

106
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,425
and it will get
better in a week.

107
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:06,226
Reassure your patient that he
won't go blind and get him out of here.

108
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,498
Five patients in two minutes. That's a
record. Make sure you're not skimping.

109
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,333
- Skimping? ROMANO:
Yeah, on the billing.

110
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:17,443
- Check off a few more boxes next time.
- I won't bill treatment we didn't provide.

111
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,680
It's called capitalism,
Kovac. Pays your salary.

112
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,711
Okay, there's the heartbeat.

113
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,183
Amniotic fluid index is good.

114
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,753
Excellent fetal movement.

115
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,619
- He's good?
- Yeah, but you're dilated 3 centimeters.

116
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,453
I've already had
two miscarriages.

117
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,090
I was supposed to
start bed rest next week.

118
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,629
I can't go through this again.

119
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,562
I'll give you some medicine
to stop you going into labor.

120
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,135
Junior needs a few more
weeks before he's done.

121
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,797
Let's start with 0.25 of terbutaline
sub-Q and give 4 grams of mag.

122
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,273
Here, magnesium might
make you a little queasy.

123
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,436
I'll be back in a few minutes
to check on you, okay?

124
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,875
Hey, Jerry, what's the
ETA on our car crash?

125
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,278
Two minutes and counting.

126
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,885
- Can I present a patient?
- You better make it fast.

127
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,217
Woman, 23, sudden onset occipital
headache, grade eight out of 10.

128
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,154
- Worst headache of her life?
- Close.

129
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,951
- Thunderclap onset?
- Two minutes.

130
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,392
No history of migraine.
Neuro exam is non-focal.

131
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,396
Okay, get a head CT, and rule
out subarachnoid hemorrhage...

132
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,228
- and get 10 of MS for the pain.
- Thanks.

133
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,226
Kevin Dunn,
32-year-old driver...

134
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,396
high-speed MVA with
prolonged extraction.

135
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,734
- Jacker or victim?
- Jacker. Victim's behind us.

136
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,106
Lap belt. Front impact.
BP, 104/84, pulse 106.

137
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,747
- Creamed the next guy real good.
- We were watching.

138
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,610
Should have turned
left on Stanton.

139
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,777
I would have got away if
that jerk didn't cut me off. Aah!

140
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,583
Oh, looks like a big flail segment
and closed clavicle fracture.

141
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,716
- Put him in Trauma 2.
- Driver <i>numero dos.</i>

142
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:42,090
Thomas Collins, victim. High-speed
restrained impact with head injury.

143
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,426
Turn him, turn him, turn him.
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

144
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,262
I put Mrs. Walters in Exam 2. She
needs a little TLC, maybe some Zoloft.

145
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:53,635
That makes two of us. Look at them.
They are like kids in a candy store.

146
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,333
One hospital I worked
at tried to ban drug reps...

147
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,104
but Residents complained.
They like the free food.

148
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,511
- How they hook you. Food, equipment...
- Oh, don't forget the boobs.

149
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,618
I imagine they have to pay for
those. Keep Kovac away from her.

150
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,983
He's been known to
give away free physicals.

151
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,624
Okay, Ernie, where were we?

152
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,225
I got worms.

153
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,028
- What the hell is this?
- Looks like a hospital bill.

154
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,498
- Accounting, fifth floor.
- They wouldn't help me.

155
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,298
- Well, I can't either. This is the ER.
- All right, Ernie, those are maggots.

156
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:29,239
- When's the last time you changed that?
- Look, look, I was already there, okay?

157
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,412
I sat here for 11
hours with my sick kid...

158
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,346
to have some quack tell me it was a
virus and he'd get better on his own.

159
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,981
Did he?

160
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:42,088
They didn't do anything for him
and I get a bill for over 2 grand.

161
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,483
I wanna see the
doctor who stiffed me.

162
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,154
- Carter. I wanna see this Carter guy.
- He doesn't work here anymore.

163
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,160
- Come on!
- Here's what we're gonna do.

164
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,164
I'll fix you up with a nurse,
something to eat and a bath.

165
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,700
But your friends
there, they gotta go.

166
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,269
- I want this fixed!
- I wouldn't do that, sir.

167
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,170
Are you gonna do something about
this bill? Are you gonna get off your ass?

168
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,177
No. But he is.

169
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,276
- Dr. Kovac.
- Zack Isley, 6-foot fall into gravel...

170
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,010
no LOC, GCS 15.

171
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,180
Superficial lacs and abrasions
on head and right upper extremity.

172
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,759
- Complaining of right shoulder pain.
- Hey, Zack. Dr. Kovac. What happened?

173
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,862
Just goofing around,
took a header.

174
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,930
Can you straighten your arm?

175
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,589
Okay, Curtain 2.

176
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,702
- I just sprained it.
- Why don't you let me decide that.

177
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,236
We'll get you an x-ray.
Clean those cuts and scrapes.

178
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,237
- Might even need some stitches.
- Really?

179
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,933
Don't worry. We'll numb
you up. You won't even feel it.

180
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,707
- No, no medicine. I can take it.
- Tough guy, huh?

181
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,377
Trauma panel, a clot, lateral
C-spine, chest x-ray and AP pelvis.

182
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:49,614
Poor guy's driving down the street,
minding his own business, then: bam!

183
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,621
- Wakes up in the ICU.
- If he wakes up.

184
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,125
- Can't see the pupils, too much blood.
- Laps and saline. Chest is clear.

185
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:59,960
- BP is 140/94, pulse 72. IV is blown.
- How are we doing in here?

186
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,069
Well, he's gonna need to be
tubed but we got it covered. Thanks.

187
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,499
Abby, can you start an IV?

188
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,732
Nurses start IVs. Surgical
students do cutdowns.

189
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,433
- Spank them, Abby.
- Somebody get me a central line kit?

190
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,839
Yeah, I'll send one back.

191
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,015
On the monitor, BP's
106/80, tachy at 111.

192
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,946
- Triple lumen kit next door.
- I can't see into his airway.

193
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,950
No blood in the nares
or around mouth.

194
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,315
SonoSite for Dr. Cooper.

195
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,923
Pain meds on the fly but
let's complete the survey.

196
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,252
Decreased on the left.
Sterile gloves, please.

197
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,157
BP's 104/86. Sats 92.

198
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,924
All right, kids, you're on.
Show Dr. Chen what you know.

199
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,192
Free fluid in the abdomen
and pericolic gutter.

200
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,166
Try there. You could use a
little more jelly on your belly.

201
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,602
- You're the Attending.
- And in Morrison's pouch.

202
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,365
- Meaning?
- Intra-abdominal injury...

203
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,839
secondary to high-speed
mechanism. Needs O.R.

204
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,137
Start the chest
tube. I'll be right back.

205
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,712
Don't be a stranger.

206
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,815
- Guy next door needs a surgeon.
- I'll call Corday.

207
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,545
Mommy, come save me. I'll
decide if he needs surgery.

208
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,883
- He only responds to pain.
- Urine output's good.

209
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,285
Okay, laryngoscope.

210
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,950
No, no, Surgi-Girl, go
next door. Start the workup.

211
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:05,497
- Yeah, I was gonna intubate.
- Next time. Now. Go, go.

212
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,998
Get me a staple gun so I
can put this guy together.

213
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,296
- I feel the inside of the chest wall.
- Surgery.

214
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,133
Hello, surgery. Abby, can
you turn that damn thing off?

215
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,332
- Yeah.
- Okay, lead the guide finger in...

216
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,977
with the other hand,
slide the tube through.

217
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,848
- Got it.
- Sats are up 98 percent.

218
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,644
- Thanks. Nice job.
- Okay, Abby, give me the bullet.

219
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,843
I was trying to fix
the monitor, sorry.

220
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,849
Oh, you're a med student, a nurse,
and technician now. What's next, cowgirl?

221
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,016
I'm pushing the drugs.
You want this or not?

222
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,128
- Yes.
- I told you to evaluate this guy.

223
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,575
I can do it. ROMANO:
I don't care who does it.

224
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,996
Neela, go with Dr. Pratt.

225
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,665
Come back and sew
these in when you're done.

226
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,325
Well?

227
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,674
No fracture or dislocation. You
probably just strained the ligaments a bit.

228
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,211
- Told you.
- Maybe you should be a doctor, huh?

229
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,447
Yeah, not with my grades.

230
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,550
I wasn't a great
student at your age.

231
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,414
I almost failed lunch. Ow! Ow!

232
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,580
- Sorry.
- Kovac, this guy's here for your patient.

233
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,248
Ron Kennedy, I'm a social
worker from Stadler House.

234
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,294
We're a foster care facility.
Zack's one of our residents.

235
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,296
- You mean prisoners.
- Relax. I'm his caseworker.

236
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,031
Zack hopped a fence
on an outing and ran off.

237
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,692
I escaped, you Nazi.

238
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,705
- Call my mom. I'm not going back.
- Zack has a conduct disorder.

239
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,967
- Screw you!
- Could you give us a moment?

240
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,435
- I think he's off his meds.
- Back off, man.

241
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,478
- Hey, stop it, Zack.
- He needs Haldol.

242
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,582
- Go back to the waiting room.
- Get the hell out!

243
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,049
- Get back in bed, Zack.
- He needs to be sedated.

244
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,619
Out!

245
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,187
Hey.

246
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,056
I'm not going back there.

247
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,195
Please, don't let
them take me back.

248
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,296
Please.

249
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,930
- Third crit is down to 29.
- Done.

250
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,471
Let's roll. Call Corday, and tell
her I'm sending her up a gift basket.

251
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,973
Looks good, but if it comes
out, you owe us a beer.

252
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,440
I'm more a cosmo girl.

253
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,340
- Drink or magazine?
- A little of both.

254
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,981
- Did Neurosurgery agree?
- Yeah, diffuse axonal injury.

255
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,913
No operative lesion. They'll
sign off after the second test.

256
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,313
- He's brain-dead?
- Yes.

257
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,819
Bad guy gets patched
up, victim is a vegetable.

258
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,355
Haven't saved this guy
yet. Change that dressing.

259
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,925
- Which O.R.?
- That's not your business. Call UNOS.

260
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,927
Your butt's down here
until the coordinator arrives.

261
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,760
Ah. Ow.

262
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:25,132
You wouldn't feel it if you let
me use just a little analgesic gel.

263
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,140
For six months I've been on
Tegretol, lithium, Risperdal, clonidine...

264
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,039
Benadryl and Klonopin, okay?

265
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,372
I've been so doped
up I didn't know the day.

266
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,147
- Have you been cheeking your meds?
- Had to.

267
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,466
It's the first day I
felt normal in months.

268
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,650
That why you ran away?

269
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,312
I got tired of being
a freaking zombie.

270
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,788
- Did you call my parents?
- Your mom's on her way.

271
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,291
You're not gonna let them
take me back, are you?

272
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,659
We'll talk about it when
your mom gets here, okay?

273
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,205
Hey, Pratt?

274
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,706
- This scan's negative.
- Yeah.

275
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,471
I'm still waiting on a Neurology consult
to evaluate a possible subarachnoid.

276
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,410
- Do an LP.
- They'll be here any minute.

277
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,814
You're wasting time and
resources. What's his problem?

278
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,177
Besides being tackled
in the waiting room?

279
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,982
Possible new onset angina.

280
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:20,855
I've ordered nitro, CBC, chem panel,
serial troponins and a chest x-ray.

281
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,019
And I'm still waiting on Cards.

282
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,687
- EKG's normal?
- Yeah.

283
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,526
- You smoke?
- No.

284
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,997
Hypertension?

285
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,365
- High cholesterol, diabetes?
- No. I'm healthy.

286
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,028
I run about 12 miles a week.

287
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,870
Okay, let me guess. The pain started
after your incident in the waiting room.

288
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,337
Yeah.

289
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,712
It's an anxiety attack.

290
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,076
- Over this stupid hospital bill?
- Probably.

291
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,617
Let me see it.
What's the complaint?

292
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,287
My kid came in with a fever.

293
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,821
Your son didn't need that.

294
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,294
Certainly didn't need chem panel
and two sets of blood cultures.

295
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,455
You should have only been charged
for, what? Three hundred dollars.

296
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,930
Thanks.

297
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,398
Hey, Slavco.

298
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,094
What do you think this is,
some Zagreb Yugo dealership?

299
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,265
On the occasion we do get a patient
with insurance, we don't give them deals.

300
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,378
I expect that kind of idiocy
from Pratt, not from you.

301
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,916
I thought I was his favorite.

302
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,212
Hi. I'm Terra King. Have
you heard of Quinamax?

303
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,288
It's our new once-a-day
antibiotic with excellent coverage...

304
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,425
for bronchitis and otitis media.

305
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,459
Neither of which needs
treatment with antibiotics.

306
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:33,657
It has great gram-positive
coverage, making it ideal for cellulitis.

307
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,566
I have a patient coming
in at 3, Ben Hollander.

308
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,297
When he shows up, just let
him in and come find me, okay?

309
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,964
Sure thing.

310
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,407
Hey, what's up? I got a
27-year-old G3P-zero...

311
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,412
history of cervical
incompetence, EGA, 24 weeks.

312
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,810
Presented in early labor...

313
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,111
cervical dilation progressed
from three to six on terb and mag.

314
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,777
- Fetal distress?
- No. Looks good.

315
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,065
Heart rate's in the
160s, good variability.

316
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,322
Can you repeat the terb?

317
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,517
No. We're maxed
out, and she's tachy.

318
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,184
Send her up to Labor Delivery.

319
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,421
Have a Pedes resuscitation
team standing by.

320
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,465
If she's progressing on tocolytics,
there's nothing we can do.

321
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,092
She's revealing both her upper
and lower teeth when she laughs.

322
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,603
- What?
- Chen. It's a sign of flirting.

323
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,039
There. Hair touching, another
one. Get in there before it's too late.

324
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,542
What are you talking about?

325
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,112
I was a cop for 25 years.
You learn body language.

326
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,840
Look at that. She's
mirroring his motion.

327
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,848
Twenty bucks says
she touches him next.

328
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,283
So what? She slapped him.

329
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,545
First it's a slap, then
it's a tickle. Before

330
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,449
you know it, she'll
be spanking his ass.

331
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,460
Jerry, can you call up to L
and D? Tell them to make sure...

332
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,157
- I need to find a fire hydrant.
- Hey, that's a cute puppy. Can I hold it?

333
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,961
You can have it.

334
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,298
Forty-three-year-old man with
left flank pain radiating to the groin.

335
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,669
Denies fever, vomiting. Exam's
notable for CVA tenderness on the left.

336
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,140
- Urine heme-positive.
- Okay. Diagnosis?

337
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,176
- Kidney stones.
- What else?

338
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,077
CBC, chem panel, and CT urogram.

339
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,311
Okay. And give 30 of ketorolac IV push.
- No.

340
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:05,657
No CBC, no chem panel, and no
CT. You don't even need the damn IV.

341
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,557
It's expensive and takes up nursing
time. Give him 60 of ketorolac IM...

342
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,392
and a bedside ultrasound
to rule out hydronephrosis.

343
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:16,661
- You won't see where the stone is.
- 90 percent of cases pass on their own.

344
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,204
- He's afebrile, and his UA is negative.
- And if it's too big to pass?

345
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,673
It'll cause hydronephrosis,
and he'll come back.

346
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,349
He still thinks he's in
the Congo. Get the CT.

347
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,248
You need to take him up.

348
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,912
That's not how it works. I
come down, I see, I present.

349
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,082
I know how it works. I'm telling
you as a surgeon and head of ER...

350
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,423
take this guy to your service. Do
I need to write you a damn note?

351
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,088
"Dear Dr. Corday, please
admit Abby's patient.

352
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:51,101
He's very sick today and requires an
ex-lap before he gets septic and dies."

353
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,729
- You hanging in there?
- By a thread.

354
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,035
- Dr. Lewis, can you help me?
- Sure. Which patient?

355
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,646
It's about the doctors. I'm getting
conflicting advice from Pratt and Kovac.

356
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:01,872
Welcome to County.

357
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,041
- Kovac is the Attending. Pratt isn't.
- Abby.

358
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,379
This is Patricia Collins.

359
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:11,513
- Husband was involved in the car chase.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Hi. Abby Lockhart.

360
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,053
- I'm Neela.
- Hi.

361
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,387
I worked on your husband.
You'd like to see him?

362
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,154
- Yes.
- I'll take Mrs. Collins in...

363
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,459
while you're waiting for the
UNOS team. This way, please.

364
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,236
- I'm beginning to hate her.
- She's a med student.

365
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,067
I'm a med student.

366
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,472
Now that you mention it,
she's pissing me off too.

367
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,237
Come on, let's
hate her together.

368
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,277
Now, the medicine I gave you hasn't
stopped you from going into labor.

369
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,612
Your contractions are
increasing in frequency...

370
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,777
and your cervix is
continuing to dilate.

371
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,814
My husband had to
go to Seattle for work.

372
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:49,122
He didn't want to go, but I
said, "Don't worry, I'll be fine."

373
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,457
I can't believe I'm having
another miscarriage.

374
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:55,865
No. You're not miscarrying,
Denny. You're gonna have this baby.

375
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,005
I'm sending you up to Obstetrics.
They're set up to handle preemie delivery.

376
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,107
I don't want a preemie.

377
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,210
Our NICU cares for
babies like this all the time.

378
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,176
Yeah, babies with brain damage.

379
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,505
My sister-in-law had a preemie.

380
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,208
They spent every day in
the NICU and it still died.

381
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,945
- This baby has a chance.
- I don't want it this way!

382
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,449
Okay.

383
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,825
Okay.

384
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,026
Problem?

385
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,789
She doesn't wanna have the baby.

386
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,957
- She's 24 weeks.
- What's the weight?

387
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,330
Five hundred twenty
grams on the ultrasound.

388
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,133
Twenty-four weeks, over 500 grams?
That's the hospital's viability threshold.

389
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,071
We're gonna spend half a
million keeping one baby alive...

390
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,644
while we shut down the
lead eradication program?

391
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,043
I've admitted three kids
for chelation this week.

392
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,546
Why stamp out lead poisoning?

393
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:47,380
Just shoot your wad on a little gorker
who can enjoy a lifetime of special ed.

394
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,421
What am I supposed to do?
Mom doesn't want to save this baby.

395
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,560
She doesn't have any rights. If it's over
500 grams, Pedes is gonna resuscitate.

396
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,593
- Aren't you on a surgical rotation?
- Yup.

397
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,823
- Then rotate.
- What's the kid's chance of a normal life?

398
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,662
- Ten percent? Less?
- It's hospital policy, Luka.

399
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,202
- Change the hospital.
- Another good idea.

400
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,397
Let's send her to Santa
Niña Muerta Hospital.

401
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,271
It's called natural selection. Heard of
it? It's worked for a few million years.

402
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,508
So tell me, what
should I do now?

403
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,374
Hospital policy
exists for a reason.

404
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,350
First learn the rules, then
learn when to break them.

405
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,183
What's in her best interest?

406
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,520
The laceration is superficial,
and his shoulder is only bruised...

407
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:32,893
but I do have some concerns
about the medication he's on.

408
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,728
- Zack's had some problems.
- Had.

409
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,529
I'm fine now.

410
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,535
I think he may be overmedicated.

411
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,409
They told me that
was for his own good.

412
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,413
I had a drug problem.

413
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,780
I let him run wild.

414
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,151
And then he was always
doing this crazy stuff.

415
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,381
- He got into fights.
- It's called self-defense.

416
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,188
- He stole a car.
- One time.

417
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,219
I'm not doing that anymore.

418
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,496
They blamed it on me.

419
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,430
They said I was an unfit mother.

420
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,799
Do you have custody?

421
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,298
Not at the moment.

422
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,211
- Has Ben Hollander shown up yet?
- Not that I've seen.

423
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,807
Can you look at a possible
scaphoid fracture in Exam 3?

424
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:27,249
Yeah. Hold on a second.

425
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,253
Mrs. Collins refused to
donate her husband's organs.

426
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,153
I've heard minority families
seldom agree to organ donation.

427
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,918
What, did you
just let her leave?

428
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,360
I told her she could sit with the
body until he went up to the ICU.

429
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,829
I'm looking for Dr. Pratt.

430
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,597
Greg.

431
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,601
There he is. It's 2003. He doesn't
have an answering machine.

432
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,966
He promised me. We
have a therapeutic contract.

433
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,940
Look, I'm sure he's just running late.
Maybe he stopped to get a coffee or...

434
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,443
Jump off a bridge?

435
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,615
- Hi. From Neonatology?
- Yeah. Vargas. Where's your patient?

436
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,615
Her name is Den...

437
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,646
- Hey, Lily, where's Denny?
- I haven't seen her.

438
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,656
- Can you check the bathrooms?
- Sure.

439
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,386
Just give me one second,
all right? I'll find her.

440
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,056
- She left.
- Who?

441
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,996
My pregnant patient.
You talk to her?

442
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,967
- No.
- Well, she took your advice. She eloped.

443
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,300
That was always her prerogative.

444
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,565
I need a doctor out here.

445
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,574
Doesn't mean it was
the best thing for her.

446
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,907
- You're supposed to be teaching me.
- I'm trying, you're not listening.

447
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,313
Some lady is in the back of my
cab. I think she's bleeding to death.

448
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,918
Denny, what happened?

449
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,992
I tried to make it to Saint
Joe's but the baby's coming.

450
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,389
- Is she dying?
- No.

451
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,996
Run inside. Tell them I
need a gurney and a BOA kit.

452
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,065
- Go!
- This is in her best interest?

453
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,032
She wouldn't have left if
you'd done what she asked.

454
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,933
Type and cross Mom for
four units, two large-bore IVs...

455
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,733
and a liter of LR running now.

456
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,398
It's too soon.

457
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,737
All right, Denny. One big push.

458
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,177
Let the NICU know we've
got a 24-weeker on the way.

459
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,175
- Come on. Cord clamp.
- Please, don't save him.

460
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,591
- It's a boy. SAM:
Eyelids are still fused.

461
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,350
Let him go.

462
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,689
I asked for two lines. Who's
working on the second IV?

463
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,264
Come on, we need access. Let's go.
- Full respiratory effort.

464
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,859
- Placenta's delivered.
- I don't want this baby.

465
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,299
Bleeding's picking up.

466
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:29,738
- Heart rate's in the 130s.
- Yeah, uterine atony from the tocolytics.

467
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,277
Run in another liter
of LR and 20 of Pit.

468
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,414
- Do you have a pulse?
- Slow, under 100.

469
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,447
- Start compressions?
- Bag him up first.

470
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,949
No, you need to weigh
him before anything else.

471
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,111
Less than 500 grams, we stop.

472
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,824
Draw up some epi,
get ready with the tube.

473
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,756
Do not tube that baby
until you get a weight.

474
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,255
You hear me, Pratt? I mean it.

475
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,366
- No tubes, please.
- Five hundred and six.

476
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,008
- No.
- Pratt, she doesn't want this.

477
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,106
- I'm following hospital rules.
- Doesn't make it right.

478
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,573
- This kid is alive.
- Systolic's down to 78.

479
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,474
0.2 milligrams of Methergine
IM and rush the blood bank.

480
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:12,345
All right, I'm in. Bag him and give 2
cc's of surfactant through the tube.

481
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,316
You got it.

482
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,604
Mrs. Collins, can I get you
anything? Or anyone I can call?

483
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,106
Tom's sister is coming.

484
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,767
She wanted to say goodbye.

485
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,343
Sorry.

486
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:49,679
Shouldn't be doing this, Pratt. She
has the right to demand a natural death.

487
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,954
We have a family room.

488
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,141
If you'd like to wait
for your sister-in-law

489
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:55,788
in there, it's a
little more quiet.

490
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,796
- I wanna stay with him as long as I can.
- Okay.

491
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,398
What's happening?

492
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,302
They're trying to save
a premature baby.

493
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,377
We just started
trying to have kids.

494
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:27,859
Mrs. Collins, did Neela talk to you
about recovering your husband's organs?

495
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,762
I told her I didn't want that.
He's been through enough.

496
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,160
Why?

497
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,998
Does he have something that
could help the mom or her baby?

498
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:42,369
I don't know. Maybe.

499
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:47,177
But there are lots of
others who would benefit.

500
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:54,516
Tom was always going out of
his way to do stuff for other people.

501
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,856
To the point where they would take
advantage of him, but he didn't care.

502
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,684
I would always tell him, "Don't
you know nice guys finish last?"

503
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,961
He would always say:

504
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,897
"Guys who finish last are nice."

505
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,403
He was so stupid.

506
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:21,305
What would they
do if he was a donor?

507
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,714
The recovery team
would take him to the ICU.

508
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,315
And they run tests, and they
start matching his organs...

509
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,615
- to people who need them.
- Like his kidneys?

510
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,452
Mm-hm.

511
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,588
Several organs can be recovered.

512
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,889
He could help as many
as 50 different people.

513
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,397
Tom would like that.

514
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,736
What all will they take?

515
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,172
Well, his kidneys...

516
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,245
which would go to two people
with end-stage renal disease...

517
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:57,110
and that would free them
from a lifetime of dialysis.

518
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,918
Ben Hollander, Susan Lewis.

519
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,146
No, I'm the doctor. He's
my patient. County General.

520
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,314
Okay, then I'll talk to
the watch commander.

521
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,754
My mom around?

522
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,191
- In a trauma. Wait in the doctor's lounge?
- No.

523
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,297
You get any freaks
in here today?

524
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,762
Guys with Elephant-Man disease
and axes stuck in their head?

525
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,097
- No.
- Should you be looking at that?

526
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,839
I'm gonna become a doctor.

527
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,633
Dollars to doughnuts that kid is
already dissecting the neighborhood pets.

528
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,780
When you put me on hold, you
increase the chance he's in trouble.

529
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,778
- Sure.
- Hey.

530
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,477
You wanna see a puppy?

531
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,513
Why?

532
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,449
I don't know.
Because she's cute?

533
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,449
Where's the morgue?

534
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,286
Your mom says we aren't
allowed to let you go there.

535
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,290
I'll give you 5 bucks.

536
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:51,070
- That kid ever give you the creeps?
- He's right at the age where it starts.

537
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,465
Teen rebellion?

538
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,834
Devil worship. Keep
an eye on that puppy.

539
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,508
Never mind.

540
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:03,480
- You were supposed to be in hours ago.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

541
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:06,483
Oh, these are...
These are for you.

542
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,223
Sort of a peace offering to make
up, you know, for my, ahem, tardiness.

543
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,916
You didn't have to do that.

544
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:17,324
Well, there's a guy outside, you
know, selling them on the street...

545
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,590
so it's, you know, no big deal.

546
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:21,324
Oh, and I...

547
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,003
I brought you this.

548
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,001
We're not finished reading it.

549
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,335
Well, you know, I
know how it ends.

550
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,534
Lily, can you set Ben
up for a blood draw?

551
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,508
Sure. This way, sir.

552
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,347
- That patient brought you flowers?
- And a book. He's a Civil War buff.

553
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,679
I've been reading to him.

554
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,185
- He's losing his sight.
- You're going to his house?

555
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:47,759
Yeah. The guy was a possible
OD on Dig a couple weeks ago.

556
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,054
I'm still not sure it
wasn't attempted suicide.

557
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,755
Wanna make sure he's
reengaged before I cut him loose.

558
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,559
This is a first edition.

559
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,464
Sounds like he's
engaged with you.

560
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,706
He has no one. He's going blind.

561
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,866
He sacrificed everything for his
career and now he has nothing.

562
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,604
No one should end up like that.

563
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,714
- Where the hell is OB?
- Paged them three times.

564
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,977
Denny, stay with us here.

565
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,621
- EBL 1500 cc's. NEELA:
I'm hitting resistance.

566
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,724
When it bounces back, you're
in the liver. Thread it again.

567
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:22,588
- Get him upstairs, Pratt.
- Kovac, I need to talk to you.

568
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,389
- Kind of busy.
- What's the holdup...

569
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,727
with that kid from Stadler House?
They're threatening legal action.

570
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,131
- Still waiting on a Tegretol level to...
- No, you're not. It's back.

571
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,669
He can't go back there, Kerry.

572
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:36,741
Their treatment program is keeping him
so drugged that he can't think straight.

573
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,140
- BP's up to 98/55.
- Good. He's a nice kid.

574
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:43,908
You know better than the psychiatrist
who's been treating him for two years?

575
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,450
- She has too many patients.
- She also has privileges in this hospital.

576
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,454
She's on her way to administer Haldol
because the ER physician refused.

577
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,183
Everybody's so concerned
about the rules and policy...

578
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,658
they forget there's a
kid caught in the middle.

579
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,992
Reform the foster-care system on
your own time. Neela, come with me.

580
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,658
- Discharge this patient.
- Damn it. Kerry!

581
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,361
- Take the baby. I need you here.
- Somebody call for OB?

582
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,700
Yeah, that was
fast. Fill her in, Pratt.

583
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:13,608
Mom just delivered a 24-weeker
now with severe atony, EBL 1500 cc's.

584
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,839
- What's happening?
- You're doing good.

585
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,774
It looks worse than it is.

586
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,780
The tube in his mouth helps him
breathe. Catheters in his umbilical cord...

587
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,354
give him fluid, nutrition
and medication.

588
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:29,794
But underneath it all he
looks good for a 24-weeker.

589
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,820
Really.

590
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,523
Where's Zack?

591
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,295
Zack? Zack?

592
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,141
- What did she give him?
- Four milligrams Haldol IM.

593
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,979
Just to tide him over
till his p.o. meds kick in.

594
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,484
I'm sorry.

595
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,397
You never let me finish
telling you about Quinamax.

596
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,831
Now, it's our new
once-a-day antibiotic...

597
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,903
with excellent coverage for
bronchitis and otitis media.

598
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:17,941
I could put together some
packages for you to take to the Congo.

599
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,842
I've heard that's a
pet project of yours.

600
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,751
Quinamax would be wonderful for the
important work you're doing over there.

601
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,581
You want me to take your
overpriced antibiotic to Africa?

602
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:32,725
It has great coverage for
pneumococcus and H. flu.

603
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,759
Why hasn't there been a new
drug for malaria in three decades?

604
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,789
That's a really good question.

605
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,856
There's no profit in
treating poor people.

606
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,897
- My company...
- Your company spends...

607
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,901
twice as much in marketing
as it does in development...

608
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:50,099
which is why prescription drug
costs have tripled in the last 10 years.

609
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,069
- Get out. I want you out of here.
- If this is a bad time...

610
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,216
Frank, I'm gonna go get some
coffee. Page me if you need me.

611
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:01,149
Okay, Dr. Kovac, if you could...

612
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:07,149
You know, I'll just come
back when you're not so busy.

613
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,295
Everything looks good.

614
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,261
Don't sound so surprised.

615
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:18,268
Ben, I really appreciate the
gesture but I can't accept this.

616
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,905
Well, you said you liked it.

617
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,571
I do, but that book is
worth a lot of money.

618
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,070
No, no, my first edition
Brontës are worth a lot of money.

619
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:32,081
I just think it's...
inappropriate.

620
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,414
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

621
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,250
No, you didn't. It's just that
you've done a lot for me...

622
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,949
and, you know, I just want
to show my appreciation.

623
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,324
I certainly never meant to
make you feel uncomfortable.

624
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:48,263
No, no, you didn't make me
feel uncom... It's no big deal.

625
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,163
I can help you get
a ride if you wait.

626
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,099
No, I'll grab a cab.

627
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,432
Okay, same time next
week for another level.

628
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,905
Thank you for the flowers.

629
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,274
I feel officially lousy.

630
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:06,851
So is it "Jing-My" or "Jing-May"?
I'm getting conflicting information.

631
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,887
Call me Deb.

632
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:12,491
What are you doing after this,
Deb? Wanna grab a beer, shoot pool?

633
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,853
I can't. I'm taking my
parents to the airport.

634
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,858
I'll go with you.
We can go out after.

635
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,293
You'll drive my mother
and father to the airport?

636
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,559
- Good for embarrassing childhood stories.
- No, not my parents.

637
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,999
They're a little distant,
bordering on xenophobic.

638
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,662
My dad has six
toes. Just on one foot.

639
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,364
Has anyone seen Alex?

640
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:33,376
- He was hanging around here earlier.
- Could you find him for me, please?

641
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,948
You should use your fireball.

642
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,522
This your first time playing?

643
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,518
Nope.

644
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,388
You want me to show you
how to do the dragon punch?

645
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,193
Nope.

646
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,564
He's gonna kill you with
his psychocrusher move.

647
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,538
Told you.

648
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,912
I'm thirsty.

649
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,343
That's a good sign.

650
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:14,008
- Can she have some ice chips?
- Let's hold off for a little while.

651
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,690
You lost a lot of
blood in your delivery.

652
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:22,350
We had to give you a transfusion
but the bleeding's stopped now.

653
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,519
You're gonna be fine.

654
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:28,189
- We're taking your baby up to the NICU.
- Good.

655
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,701
- He's doing better.
- Just take him away.

656
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,700
- Denny, just...
- Please.

657
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,924
- Has Abby shown up yet?
- 404.

658
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,723
Doing what?

659
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,564
I've been paging you.

660
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:04,598
I was with this patient.

661
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,069
So I hear.

662
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,572
You convinced the family
to donate his organs?

663
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:19,574
Spending this much time with a
patient is a luxury we don't usually have.

664
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,183
You missed out on an
interesting volvulus repair.

665
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,417
Well, I just felt like
his wife needed me.

666
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,457
You already do this well, Abby.

667
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,797
Sometimes being a doctor is about
distancing yourself from your patient.

668
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,300
- You don't have to stay.
- I'd like to stick around if that's okay.

669
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,782
What the hell is this?

670
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,176
- A Labrador retriever.
- Wrong answer.

671
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:56,810
- Some sort of spaniel. A terrier.
- Who brought it into the hospital? Pratt?

672
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:01,050
- I'm sorry, Dr. Romano...
- I did. She belongs to me.

673
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,218
- This isn't a petting zoo.
- She's not a pet.

674
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:07,628
She's a Seeing Eye dog, aren't you?
Oh, how could you hate a face this cute?

675
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:11,531
- All right, come on. Let's go home. Bye.
- So where is my son?

676
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,968
- Did you show him the morgue?
- Couldn't find him.

677
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:19,168
I know where he is. He's across
the street in the new Jumbo Mart.

678
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,012
Got you now.

679
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,980
- That's cheating.
- I thought you were good at this game.

680
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,679
What the hell are you doing?

681
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:32,249
- My shift ended an hour ago. Why?
- I'm not talking to you.

682
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,553
You cannot just wander off
without telling me where you're going.

683
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,489
Did you eat all this?

684
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,156
- Where did you get the money?
- He bought it for me.

685
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,999
Do you know what time it
is? Did you take your shot?

686
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:48,697
No?

687
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,672
Look at him. He's
hyperglycemic and ketotic.

688
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,703
Did you not notice anything
strange? He's diabetic.

689
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,347
God, I can smell it from here.

690
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,674
I thought he was a street kid. I
didn't know he was your patient.

691
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,283
He's my son.

692
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,090
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

693
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,527
Are you stalking me?

694
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,635
Got his first x-ray.

695
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,802
His heart and lungs look good.

696
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,441
He's fighting.

697
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,550
Told you.

698
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:36,210
- Maybe you should get off your feet for...
- I just wanna stay here a while.

699
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,083
Okay.

700
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,687
He shouldn't have to die alone.

701
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,229
Was this a bad idea?

702
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,799
Oh, no, no, I love dogs.

703
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,267
I grew up with dogs.

704
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:56,807
My parents had a cattle
farm outside of Gary.

705
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,134
So you were a farm boy?

706
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,748
I still would be if my mother hadn't
insisted on my going to college.

707
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,941
What about your parents?

708
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,519
- Wanna hold her?
- Oh, yeah.

709
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,581
My mom is a secretary.

710
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,016
Was a secretary.

711
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,524
- She wanted me to be a flight attendant.
- Really?

712
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,458
Yeah, that wasn't happening.

713
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,496
She died a few years ago.

714
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,624
Oh, I'm sorry.

715
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,101
What about your father?

716
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,639
He's still in Chicago. He's
a test pilot for Barcalounger.

717
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,943
He must be pretty proud of you.

718
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,604
You're not close?

719
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,306
Not really.

720
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,020
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.

721
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,780
It happens.

722
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:51,320
- I have a daughter named Karen.
- Yeah?

723
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,362
Yeah, I haven't...

724
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,295
I haven't talked
to her in years.

725
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,025
You should try to reconnect.

726
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,171
No, it's not gonna happen.

727
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,067
You should call her.

728
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:05,733
No, she blames
me for things when...

729
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,879
When my wife died.

730
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,581
I didn't see that coming either.

731
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,684
Your wife died suddenly?

732
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,650
No, no, not really.

733
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,552
She had cancer. She
fought it for a long time...

734
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:23,661
but we both knew she
wasn't gonna beat it.

735
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:30,499
Still, I guess I never
expected it to end that way.

736
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,193
I just had trouble...

737
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,067
I had a hard time accepting...

738
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,904
- the finality of it all.
- Yeah.

739
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,506
- Three-forty.
- I didn't know he had diabetes.

740
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,448
He's a kid. You're an adult.
You're supposed to be a doctor.

741
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,384
You didn't notice
he was acting weird?

742
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,717
Lots of kids his age are weird.

743
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,520
What are you doing playing
video games with a 9-year-old?

744
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,857
You give him ice cream,
candy... What's up with that?

745
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,530
Can I discharge Mrs. Fionelli?

746
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,262
- Find another Attending. I'm off.
- Oh, all right.

747
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,531
Her pelvic sonogram
results came back.

748
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:12,234
She's got an ovarian cyst so I was
just going to put her on a non-steroidal.

749
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,276
She had an abdominal CT scan?

750
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,471
We were thinking diverticulitis.

751
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,640
- Flip over your chart.
- What?

752
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,048
On the back of your chart there's
a price list of all tests and labs.

753
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,314
You ordered a CBC. That's what?

754
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,049
- One hundred and forty dollars.
- A chem panel and UA?

755
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,626
- Three hundred and fifty, and 90.
- What else?

756
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,956
GC and chlamydia cultures, 300.

757
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,259
IV start and a liter of
saline, at least $200.

758
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:40,929
Morphine's another 50. Abdomen
and pelvic CT, 3000 easy.

759
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,566
- Did I miss anything?
- Pelvic ultrasound, $750.

760
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,409
$4880.

761
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,109
You could have done a negative urine
ICON to rule out ectopic for 15 bucks...

762
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:59,087
performed a thorough physical exam,
treated her with a $2 dose of ibuprofen.

763
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,920
This is why we can't provide
health care for everyone.

764
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,755
Hey, where's Logan?

765
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,022
Rule-out subarachnoid?
She was in Curtain 2.

766
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,133
- Dr. Kovac discharged her.
- Oh, Neurology finally came down.

767
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,328
- Nope. I did an LP about four hours ago.
- You did what?

768
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,029
She'd been waiting all day.

769
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:19,610
Her fluid was clear. No blood, no
xanthochromia, no subarachnoid.

770
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,679
A spinal tap is the quickest,
easiest way to rule out an SAH...

771
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,442
- and it's 100-percent sensitive.
- She was my patient.

772
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,051
Yes, and if I hadn't treated
her she'd still be here.

773
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,450
- Now she's at home feeling better.
- So that's it?

774
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:34,319
This is how I'm supposed to learn?
I do it your way or you take it away?

775
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,894
I'm trying to teach you the way you
practice medicine here is inefficient.

776
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,622
Oh, and letting babies die is?

777
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,897
You really think you
saved that kid today?

778
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,666
For what, 24-hour nursing care?
He's gonna probably require...

779
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,538
a lifetime of commitment.
Are you gonna give it to him?

780
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,147
I'm sorry I'm not in some mud hut
doing amputations with a pocketknife.

781
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:59,341
We have the technology and
expertise to give that kid a chance.

782
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,816
What's the sense of
having it if we don't use it?

783
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:05,423
That kid has about a 5-percent
chance of having a normal life.

784
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,823
- You know how many others we could...?
- I do everything I can for my patients.

785
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,690
That's how I practice medicine.

786
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,355
This is Chicago,
not the damn Congo.

787
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,331
Maybe you should
just go back to Africa.

788
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,662
Maybe you should go to Africa.

789
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,002
I know you didn't
just say that to me.

790
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,506
Maybe you'd learn there's
more to being a doctor...

791
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,510
than ordering tests and consults for
every patient just to cover your ass.

792
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,671
Stay away from my patients.

793
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:34,279
From now on I'll present
to another Attending.

794
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,591
You can just take big bites, you
know. The mortician will do what he can.

795
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,626
I need the practice.

796
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:47,891
All right, well, take your
time. He's not going anywhere.

797
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:01,709
<i>What all will they take?</i>

798
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,908
<i>His kidneys...</i>

799
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,583
which would go to two people
with end-stage renal disease...

800
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,722
and that would free them
from a lifetime of dialysis.

801
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,787
<i>His heart and lungs could go
to as many as three people...</i>

802
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,326
<i>with cardiac and
pulmonary disease.</i>

803
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:23,395
His pancreas and intestines would
go to children as well as adults.

804
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:27,471
His corneas would allow
two people to see again.

805
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:31,939
<i>His skin, bones and other
tissue will help treat burn victims.</i>

806
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:37,242
And his liver will be split
into multiple transplants...

807
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:41,113
and used for children with
birth defects that used to be fatal.
