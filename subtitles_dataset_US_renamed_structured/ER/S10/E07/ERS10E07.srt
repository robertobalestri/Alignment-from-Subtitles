1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,867
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,508
Morris, you bailing?

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,371
Let him walk.

4
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,023
- How do you put it on?
- Donning and doffing are complex tasks.

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,414
I want my damn arm, all
right? I've waited long enough!

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,781
Stay away from my patients. From
now on, I'll present to another Attending.

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,115
- He's diabetic.
- I didn't know he had diabetes.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,882
He's a kid. You're an adult.
You're supposed to be a doctor.

9
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,153
- That patient brought you flowers?
- And a book. He's a real Civil War buff.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,600
Been reading to him.
He's losing his sight.

11
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:31,696
Going to his house?

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,425
He has no one. He's going blind.

13
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,899
No one should end up like that.

14
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,109
You ran out of milk.

15
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,286
- What day is it?
- Twenty-sixth.

16
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,792
What do you want,
front page or sports?

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,656
Do you ever realize that a month's
gone by without your noticing?

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,662
Feds raised rates again.

19
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,495
And it wasn't bad...

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,870
- but it wasn't great either?
- Half a point. I should have bought.

21
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,309
Yes, hello. This is she.

22
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,140
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Yeah. See you there.

23
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,253
Okay, thanks. Bye.

24
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,682
- Work?
- No, my accountant reminding me...

25
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,054
of our appointment
with the IRS today.

26
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,162
I'm getting audited,
which blows...

27
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,028
- considering I file 1040EZ.
- You don't do long form?

28
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,430
Well, I'm single. I don't own
anything. I don't have any dependents.

29
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,164
You want some?

30
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:51,278
- What?
- Kids, instant tax write off.

31
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:56,745
- Yeah, but...
- Come on, baby, let's do it, huh?

32
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,178
We like each other, right?
The sex is pretty good.

33
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,485
What are the odds we're
gonna find someone better, huh?

34
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,553
Whose stupid idea was this?

35
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,255
Weaver says it's
space efficient.

36
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,866
Yeah, take a bucket
of acetone to erase.

37
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,196
- Need a hand with that?
- You trying to be funny?

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,033
- Nope, just trying to be helpful.
- Don't bother, boy scout.

39
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:23,041
I finished your eval. May wanna
practice these words: "paper or plastic?"

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,146
Oh, and speaking of
negative evaluations, sign this.

41
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,215
- What's this?
- Documentation of chronic tardiness...

42
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,375
failure to attend
required conferences.

43
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,453
- I'm pulling six shifts a week...
- And yelling at an X-ray tech.

44
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,717
He gave me a lateral C-spine without
T-1. The repeat took over three hours.

45
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,259
That's unacceptable and
beside the point. Sign it.

46
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,227
- This goes up to Human Resources?
- Nope. Stays with me...

47
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,833
until I have a fat enough
file to pull the trigger.

48
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,902
- Oh, now you're gonna fire me.
- Keep giving me ammo.

49
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,732
- Oh, hey!
- Electrical malfunction.

50
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,397
- Only on women?
- It happens.

51
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,676
I'm telling you,
it's not chickenpox.

52
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,678
Hey, teen mom. News flash.
This is not day care, okay?

53
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,613
Eighty-six the love child and
stop tying up the phone lines.

54
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,016
Yeah, listen, I'm a
nurse, and I'm telling...

55
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,951
Fine. Whatever.

56
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,516
Next time you put a marker on your face,
do it before school so I can get a sitter.

57
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,129
- That means I can stay here?
- Until I can find one.

58
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,289
Now go to the lounge and do
something normal, like homework.

59
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,594
- Hey.
- Hey.

60
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,631
Don't even.

61
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,136
- What's that about?
- Overprotective mother.

62
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,435
- You still on surgical rotation?
- No. I start my ER rotation today.

63
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,048
- Welcome home. PICKMAN:
Got the whole family here!

64
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,983
Low-speed MVA,
rear-ended, no PSI.

65
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,622
Superficial face lac on
Mom, sore wrist on the girl...

66
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,815
and Dad's only
complaint is about his car.

67
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,483
- Six grand in body work, easy.
- What about the baby?

68
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,721
Found on the floor,
no apparent injuries.

69
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,990
- No car seat?
- Cries when he's in it.

70
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,964
So Katie here goes and unhooks him.
- We're all okay here.

71
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,398
Is this totally necessary?

72
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,834
The shock of the accident
can often mask injuries.

73
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:03,136
Most important factors when
triaging children involved in an MVA?

74
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,074
- Restraint use.
- Glasgow coma scale.

75
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,307
Evaluate consciousness and spontaneous
movement. In this case, the baby's a 15.

76
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,510
Good, Neela. What?
You know this stuff.

77
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,587
Hey, Abby, guy over
here needs a Foley.

78
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,088
Oh, wait, I'm sorry, you're
playing doctor today?

79
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,160
Never mind. I'll find a nurse who's not
kidding herself. Here's one. Mom, right?

80
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,696
Good news and bad news. The bad
news is, my enlarged prostate guy...

81
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,859
needs a tube up his urethra. Good
news, he gets to have you in his pants.

82
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,834
I have to take my lunch
hour today. I'm being audited.

83
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,668
- Didn't know we paid you enough.
- You don't.

84
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,334
- My meeting's at noon, downtown, so...
- All right! That is...

85
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,338
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

86
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,279
- Cut it out!
- What are you doing?

87
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,784
He just grabbed my ass. Here, take
this to church and have it exorcised.

88
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,616
Keep walking, right up to
the nursing director's office.

89
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,191
When you get there,
there'll be a pink slip waiting.

90
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,921
Good. Give me plenty of time to
file my sexual harassment lawsuit.

91
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,359
You mind?

92
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,526
Yes, I do. You can have it
back at the end of the day...

93
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,467
- if you learn to behave!
- Give me my damn hand back!

94
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,418
- Dove?
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,995
- That the soap you use?
- Oh. Yeah.

96
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,295
It works... Works...
Works for you.

97
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:12,967
You know, they say that smell is
a more powerful sense than sight.

98
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,637
It has a stronger
impact on memory.

99
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,773
It's true.

100
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,812
Given the choice,
I'd... I'd choose sight.

101
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,290
Could do without
smelling dog poop again.

102
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,289
Or... Or stepping in it.

103
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,055
Can I get a Vacutainer with a red
top? Housebreaking not going so well?

104
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,630
- I can do that for you if you want.
- No, I got it.

105
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,630
No, it's fine.

106
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,966
- Oh, and thanks.
- For what?

107
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,628
The dog.

108
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,866
He laughs at all my
jokes and licks my feet.

109
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,511
I think I'm in love.

110
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,407
If your dig. levels are in
the therapeutic range...

111
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,279
you can stop dragging
yourself down here.

112
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,856
Oh. Great.

113
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,925
Yeah, just see your primary
physician every three months.

114
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:11,363
Okay, and we are done.

115
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,668
Listen, I make a mean tri-tip.

116
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,609
- Seriously, I'm quite... Quite the chef.
- Really?

117
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,109
Yeah. Would...?

118
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,305
You know, would you
like to have dinner tonight?

119
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:34,578
I'll throw in a good bottle of
wine if it would close the deal.

120
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,850
Uh, sure. What time?

121
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,924
- Eight.
- All right, I'll see you then.

122
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:47,532
- Doctor who does her own blood draws?
- Only on friends.

123
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,069
Listen, sorry about earlier, but I
got a rule against ass-grabbing.

124
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,762
It's a good rule.

125
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,407
What did you do with it anyway?

126
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,134
I put it where it ought to
be, under lock and key.

127
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,472
- Here. I don't need the receipt.
- No, I do.

128
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,047
I'm going long form next year.

129
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,079
- Hey. What the hell are you doing here?
- Working.

130
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,881
- I thought you quit.
- Oh, my dad wouldn't let me.

131
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,718
Said he pull my money if I
didn't see this thing through.

132
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,451
- This "thing" meaning medicine?
- Yeah. Want some?

133
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,220
It's 10 in the morning, man...

134
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,889
- Hey, you been smoking weed?
- You know, my roommate tokes.

135
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,399
Can't help it if
the smell sticks.

136
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,240
Katie, knock it off.

137
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,811
Sorry about the mess, doc.

138
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,778
We're med students
actually, and it's fine, really.

139
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,744
He likes you. Colin
usually cries with strangers.

140
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,253
- When's he not crying?
- Seems like a happy enough guy.

141
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,756
Head sheet, ibuprofen,
and Dad's good to go.

142
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,326
Oh, he's not either
of their fathers.

143
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,090
- He's my boyfriend.
- Who's next?

144
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,757
Seven-year-old, no medical
history, ecchymosis of left hand.

145
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,529
Full range of motion,
neurovascularly intact.

146
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,641
X-rays are clear. NSAIDs
for pain, R.I.C.E. and home?

147
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,208
Good. Neela?

148
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,039
Twenty-one-year-old female,
1-centimeter forehead lac...

149
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,545
cleared the neck
clinically, exam normal.

150
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,310
Irrigated the wound, approximated
edges with Dermabond.

151
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,613
- Excellent. Abby?
- Full-term ten-month-old male...

152
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,155
alert and interactive. He
doesn't seem to be on...

153
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,954
- Start with the vitals.
- Afebrile, pulse 118, resps 24.

154
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,825
No hematoma or stepoff.
Lungs are clear, abdomen soft...

155
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:29,800
moves all extremities. Since he wasn't
restrained, think baby gram and head CT.

156
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,371
- A full body x-ray?
- He might need a screening film...

157
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,238
- since he can't tell us what hurts.
- He would with irritability and guarding.

158
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,471
Trust your exam, Abby. No
unnecessary x-rays, no CT.

159
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,242
He already got a portable.

160
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,085
Um, finish the discharge
paperwork and send him home.

161
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,057
Dr. Kovac, I have a UTI in 2.

162
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,218
Maybe you're like me, better
with babies than with school.

163
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,999
Got in a fight, stuck with a
shank made out of a fork.

164
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,192
- Jimmy, I need to see your eyes.
- Can I help?

165
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,338
Stab wound above the
scapula. Tell me what you do.

166
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,674
- ABC's, IV, O2, monitor and pulse ox.
- That and introduce yourself.

167
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:14,042
Hi. I'm Neela Rasgotra. I'm
going to listen to your lungs now.

168
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:19,448
- Okay, head's atraumatic, TM's fine.
- They handcuff in juvenile hall?

169
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,954
He's 18, with the big boys at Joliet for
aggravated assault, B and E. Five to 10...

170
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,027
- but probably get a few more now.
- Clear, no increased work of breathing.

171
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,121
Which means the knife wound
hasn't affected your lungs.

172
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,358
Okay, portable chest with a
lateral neck and a set of hematocrits.

173
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,470
Dr. Chen, there's a call from
China holding on line one for you.

174
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,038
Wonder what time it is
over there. Do me a favor.

175
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,074
Can you tell my parents
the cat's fine and I'll call later?

176
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,610
It's not your folks.
It's the embassy.

177
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,110
Get him set up for suturing.

178
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,912
"B and E," that's
"breaking and entering."

179
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,951
What did you break into?

180
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:58,217
My stepfather's house.
He locked me out.

181
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,221
You still here?

182
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,163
- Who's asking?
- I'm a nurse. I saw you earlier.

183
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,962
Oh, I wish I could say the same.

184
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:14,504
Have you seen a cabbie anywhere around
here? I called for one about an hour ago.

185
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,734
No. I can call
another one for you.

186
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,078
- You okay?
- Me? Oh, yeah, yeah.

187
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,808
Blind, getting
blinder every day.

188
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,580
- Life is good.
- Sam.

189
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,253
- I'll call you another cab.
- Got your backup babysitter on line one.

190
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:35,020
She's glad you called, she's got pinkeye,
wonders can you get her antibiotics?

191
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,926
Fifty pounds of pressure in
addition to being waterproof.

192
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,191
Which makes it perfect
for shucking clams.

193
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,461
- What happened to your other gizmo?
- It's being punished.

194
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,606
- Enough fun and games. Where is it?
- You got a stay of execution.

195
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,266
- Your audit's been pushed an hour.
- Nothing like postponing the inevitable.

196
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,311
- Hey, my hand. Cough it up.
- At the end of the day...

197
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,448
if you don't try
anything with that one.

198
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:59,382
- Need I remind you that I'm in charge?
- You'll have to convince me first.

199
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,618
- Hey, Alex.
- What's a prolapsed rectum?

200
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,988
Shouldn't you be reading,
like<i>, Harry Potter</i> or something?

201
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,620
- You menstruating?
- Hey, look a popped-out eyeball!

202
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,469
- Something wrong?
- My parents were in a car accident.

203
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,665
- I'm sorry.
- Happened in some province...

204
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,140
north of Suzhou. I'm
not exactly sure where.

205
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,212
- Can you get somebody to cover for me?
- Of course. Are you okay?

206
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,714
Not really. I have to pack
and get my emergency visa.

207
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,148
I don't even know if
my passport's still good.

208
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,651
Do you know any details?

209
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,484
Only that there are no
trauma centers in China.

210
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,567
- Something happen?
- Her parents got hurt in China. MVA.

211
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,201
Hey, Jing-Mei.

212
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:57,401
- What's going on? Your folks okay?
- I won't know until I get there.

213
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,445
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, I don't think so.

214
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,173
Okay. Come here.

215
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,016
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.

216
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,950
I gotta go.

217
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,456
Jensen's at a conference,
Stewart's on nights...

218
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,531
Chen's on emergency leave. It
leaves us short one Attending.

219
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:23,227
Ankle sprain, med refill, kid
with cough. I'll pick up her slack.

220
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,605
- She also had a dislocated shoulder.
- I'll give reductions to Residents...

221
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:33,145
with two paws and half a brain.
Elbow contusion, fight-bite lac. Beat it.

222
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,374
What pleasure could you possibly
get out of humiliating people?

223
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,041
- Fun. You ought to try it sometime.
- What did I miss?

224
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,882
Your calling, as a hoodlum.
Here, prison stabbing...

225
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,888
ought to be right up your alley.

226
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,823
If it's any consolation,
we all suffer at his hand.

227
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,056
What do you got?

228
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,755
Franny Meyers, 34 years
old, brought in by paramedics...

229
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,495
with chest pain and palpitations for an
hour. No cardiac history, no risk factors.

230
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,798
I'm Dr. Lewis. Can you
tell me what happened?

231
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,136
Nothing, I felt a little dizzy at
work and somebody called 911.

232
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,006
- I'm fine now.
- Orthostatics are good. I got an EKG...

233
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,078
- which was normal.
- Any medications?

234
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,148
- Nope.
- Are you having trouble sleeping?

235
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,753
- No.
- Do you drink soda, coffee?

236
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,786
- Never.
- Really? That's amazing.

237
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,823
I skipped breakfast, that's
all. Listen, I have got to go...

238
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,689
- pick up my little girl from preschool.
- No, you're not going anywhere soon.

239
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,093
Someone with chest pain
and heart palpitations...

240
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,290
we keep them
overnight for observation.

241
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,699
- My husband can't do everything.
- Find a bed on Telemetry...

242
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,429
and send out for troponins?

243
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,471
Yeah. Have Cards
do a stress test.

244
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,550
I have three kids,
work a full-time job,

245
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,702
every day is a stress
test. This is nothing.

246
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,040
Probably you're right,
but we need to follow...

247
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,615
- your labs and monitor your heart.
- Yeah.

248
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,222
- You seem to be doing well.
- One-on-one. I'm not so hot in a group.

249
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,450
You know, it gets
better. It always does.

250
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,062
- Wanna get something to eat tonight?
- Oh, I have a date, sort of.

251
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,288
- Chuck?
- No.

252
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,457
We should spend either all
our time together or none at all...

253
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,796
and I'm kind of leaning
towards none at all.

254
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,872
- So it's a date with someone new?
- Someone old, actually.

255
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,178
Did that guy's head get
cracked by a bat or something?

256
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,712
- Sledgehammer.
- Really?

257
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,942
No, he slipped in the shower,
bumped his head. He's gonna be fine.

258
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,916
Aren't you supposed
to be in the lounge?

259
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,282
Yeah, but mostly away from you.

260
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,391
I don't know what
my mom's problem is.

261
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,585
I've been in DKA like a
thousand times this year.

262
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,925
- Wasn't your fault.
- I better take you back.

263
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:09,193
Belly pain prior to vomiting and
diarrhea, no fever, no history of stones...

264
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,031
- urine dip negative.
- Might be the seafood Io mein.

265
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,538
- I'm thinking appy.
- CBC results?

266
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,306
I didn't order a CBC. Dr. Kovac?

267
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:22,108
You didn't check the white-cell
count on a possible appendicitis?

268
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,217
I told him not to bother. No
guarding, no rebound, no fever.

269
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,717
CBC is the standard test
used in the diagnosis...

270
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:31,380
For almost everything, but it's useless
for anything else except leukemia...

271
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,085
- which he doesn't have.
- It's a primary indication of infection...

272
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,163
and I have absolutely no
intention of proceeding without it.

273
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,993
Fine, then it was 16,000.

274
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,629
- You told me you didn't order the test.
- I forgot to put the results on the chart.

275
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,810
I still think it's an
unconvincing case for appy.

276
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,576
Exactly my point.

277
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,176
Order a CT with triple
contrast to be certain.

278
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,010
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:03,418
If you're on a mission to subvert
protocol, clear it through Administration.

280
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,185
How do you stand it down here?
Everybody's more agreeable in Surgery.

281
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,761
- Gee, why do you suppose that is?
- Okay, here's a time-waster.

282
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,866
Transport from Geldin, stable
12-year-old heme-onker with fever.

283
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,968
The community
hospital on the east side?

284
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,660
Known as a glorified
Doc In The Box.

285
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,773
Who's expendable? You are.
Since you're neither fish nor fowl...

286
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,341
- you're useless on a mindless transport.
- Robert.

287
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,842
Dr. Corday, you forgot
to sign for the factor eight.

288
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:30,450
Eureka. Our affirmative-action
hero and our sultry hand thief.

289
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,051
Go with God, but more
importantly, just go.

290
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,121
- My kid's here. I don't have a sitter.
- That's my problem how?

291
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:40,659
The nurses can take care of him in the
lounge until you get back, right, Chuny?

292
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,454
- Sure, no problem.
- That's settled.

293
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,224
Ebony and Ivory can go into the sunset
and the rest of us can get work done...

294
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,458
- without being stared at.
- Come on, honey.

295
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,728
- I don't think his mom loved him.
- You on hold?

296
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,065
- Yeah, why?
- Mrs. Meyers wants to leave AMA.

297
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:57,074
Yes, yes, I have an appointment
for today that I'd like to reschedule.

298
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,907
Mrs. Meyers, you need to
see a doctor before you go.

299
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,311
I can't find my shoes.
Somebody stole my shoes.

300
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,077
- They're right there.
- I don't know what I was thinking.

301
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,983
Who's gonna make dinner?
Who's gonna feed the dogs?

302
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,317
- Slow down.
- Who's gonna wash the clothes?

303
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,652
All right.

304
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:18,321
- She barely has a pulse.
- Someone grab a crash cart!

305
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:22,035
I'm okay. I'm okay.

306
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:30,274
- Have you been in prison long?
- Few months.

307
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,505
Busted me right after
my girlfriend got me this.

308
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,040
Her name's Lila.

309
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,713
She's pretty too.

310
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,247
- Stitches can come out in 10 days.
- How's he doing?

311
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,120
Has some bony tenderness,
just on his way to Radiology now.

312
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,229
- Otherwise, completely intact.
- Then we need to make a switch.

313
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,025
Hang on, let me uncuff him.

314
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,135
Let's go. Easy, man.

315
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,237
Dr. Pratt.

316
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,566
- Get her out of here!
- Jimmy, it's all right.

317
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,974
- Just get her out!
- Okay. Okay. Go. Go.

318
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,274
Guys give me a couple of
minutes, all right? Please.

319
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,886
- Want to tell me what happened?
- I'm not a fag, all right?

320
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:20,225
Okay. But you're bleeding
pretty bad. Did they rape you?

321
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,495
Don't come close,
okay? I'm cool.

322
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,825
This is serious.

323
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:30,328
- I said, just leave me alone.
- Okay, so you're refusing treatment.

324
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,905
Just know that you're AMA and going
back to the big house in about an hour.

325
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,139
Now, you let me do the exam,
you buy yourself at least a day here.

326
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,576
- One more time, hard as you can.
- Anybody seen Sam's weird little kid?

327
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,245
- I can't find him anywhere.
- Nope.

328
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,291
- Still SVT.
- Am I having a heart attack?

329
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,156
I don't think so, but
your heart is beating fast.

330
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,457
- No T waves, narrow QRS.
- Has anything like this happened before?

331
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,932
- No, I don't think so.
- EKG tech's on his way.

332
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:06,038
- Supraventricular tachycardia?
- Yes, vagal maneuvers didn't work.

333
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,868
- Adenosine?
- Six milligrams.

334
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,603
We're giving you medicine to convert
your heart back to a normal rhythm.

335
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,839
When we do, we'll be better able
to find out why this is happening.

336
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,452
- I'll administer it. Nice assessment.
- Thanks.

337
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,147
- You never compliment me like that.
- Like what?

338
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,723
"Nice assessment."

339
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,883
- I do.
- No, you don't.

340
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,453
- I don't?
- No.

341
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,594
I give you my time, which is
the highest form of a compliment.

342
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,805
Out of the way. Out
of the way. Shoo.

343
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,512
What's the weirdest thing you've
taken out of someone's body?

344
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:54,313
Prednisone for five days and
Benadryl for itching, okay, Mr. McPhee?

345
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,752
- Like a real long tapeworm?
- Worse.

346
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,357
Can you get a knee
immobilizer for the LOL in 3?

347
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,994
- Yes, doctor.
- A gerbil?

348
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,621
Look, Alex, I really need to work
now. Go back to the lounge, okay?

349
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:13,037
- Chuny, the rule-out appy guy's eating?
- Mr. Persky? He's on his second tray.

350
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,836
Okay, Mr. Persky,
time to go home.

351
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,345
- Let me sign these discharge papers...
- What about the CT Corday wanted?

352
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,542
He's past the common age for
appy, he's not getting any sicker...

353
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,517
- and he's got an appetite.
- You said it was appendicitis.

354
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,451
Not if you can
stomach that much food.

355
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,251
But there was progression
of pain, there was tenderness.

356
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,452
- Could be an unusual presentation.
- Sure, once in a million cases.

357
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,793
Kovac, Radiology wants you upstairs.
Your tibia-fracture lady is agitated.

358
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,801
Mr. Persky, if you experience vomiting,
fever or worsening belly pain, come back.

359
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,536
Otherwise, have a nice day.

360
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,607
Where are you going now?

361
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,639
- X-ray.
- Can I come?

362
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,246
No. The lounge, go.

363
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,209
Hey, Chuny, need you to get
me an Attending for a rape exam.

364
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,377
We use the same kit for
men and women, right?

365
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,796
I'll do it when I get
back from Radiology.

366
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,490
No, thanks.

367
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,489
- A guy can get raped?
- Hey.

368
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,789
- Doctor, got a minute?
- I got 10 patients of my own...

369
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,936
and six med students I'm
avoiding, does it look like it?

370
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,264
- I need you to do a rape kit.
- Wasn't on the board.

371
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,237
- Had a knife wound, he didn't tell us.
- He?

372
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,845
The prisoner you gave me
earlier. He has some rectal bleeding.

373
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,675
Well, you go ahead,
I'll sign off on it.

374
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,409
Per Legal, an Attending
should do all rape exams.

375
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,111
- It'll be our little secret.
- Hey, wait a minute. Wait.

376
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:39,190
You're all over me for protocol, and
now you want me to do a procedure...

377
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,590
All of a sudden you're Mr. By-the-Book?
This is not a stretch for you.

378
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,458
Just do it, break the
rules. You're good at it.

379
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,263
- Coffee break, imagine that.
- You from County?

380
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,099
- Yes, sir.
- Twelve-year-old...

381
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,969
with acute myeloid leukemia
spiked a fever to 102.

382
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,770
It's probably just a cold,
but since she's neutropenic...

383
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,470
she needs admission somewhere
till her culture's negative.

384
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,946
- You don't have a Pedes floor?
- Mm-mmm. Budget cuts.

385
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:08,554
Chest x-ray's clear, UA's
negative, got two grams of Ceftaz.

386
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,451
- Her parents here?
- Yep, brought her over from Ann Arbor...

387
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,992
for a concert, celebrate her
successful bone-marrow transplant.

388
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,188
Girl started feeling sick so they drove
her to the nearest hospital, which was us.

389
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:22,028
- I thought you said she just had a cold.
- I'm Dr. Gallant.

390
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,171
- She didn't look like this earlier.
- Michelle, can you hear me?

391
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,239
- Last vitals were two hours ago.
- They said she was sleeping.

392
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,876
- Oxygen mask.
- She was satting at 100 percent.

393
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,877
Can't get a good pulse ox
through this much nail polish.

394
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,212
- No, a Pedes mask.
- We don't have them.

395
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:39,750
She should be on a monitor. Mix
some ox and gent and hang another liter.

396
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,252
- She was stable.
- Now she's septic. We need Valium.

397
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,084
- Here, catch.
- Will someone tell us what's going on?

398
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,211
She might have a blood infection,
and chemo weakened her ability to fight.

399
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,523
Sats only 81.

400
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,666
- Okay, help me get her onto the gurney.
- Gallant.

401
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:58,031
- I need to explain the risks of transport.
- Gallant, I need to talk to you.

402
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,866
There's chances of worsening
her condition in transport.

403
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,000
Now, doctor. I need
to speak with you.

404
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,406
She's not stable. You need to
stay here or tube her before we go.

405
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,517
She has a strong pulse, we
have her on O2. We scoop and run.

406
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:16,122
- It's 20 minutes till she stops breathing.
- County is 15, tops.

407
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:19,224
Look, if I can't get her tubed,
there's no backup here, none.

408
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,754
Okay, let's go. We're
going code three.

409
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,022
- What does that mean?
- Your daughter's sick...

410
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,031
- we need to get her to a trauma center.
- Can we come?

411
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,693
- No room. We're headed to County.
- Gallant, consent.

412
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,203
Sign here.

413
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:39,871
Your heart rate's back to normal,
which means the adenosine worked.

414
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,379
- Did you get in touch with your husband?
- Yeah. He's picking up the kids.

415
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,745
- That's one less thing for you to do.
- Yeah.

416
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,978
You should try to get some rest.

417
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,985
I can't.

418
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:57,060
- I lied. I don't sleep much at all.
- Really?

419
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,561
Do you think that's weird?
I don't even know anymore.

420
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,400
I think...

421
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:09,673
I think with three kids, it's pretty
hard to do without some help.

422
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,108
You have any help?

423
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,506
A nanny? No.

424
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,682
No, I mean, for energy.

425
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:25,987
Are you taking anything or drinking
anything to give you a little lift?

426
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,687
Because, Franny, if you
are taking something...

427
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,394
it could be doing serious
damage to your heart.

428
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,475
Another mom I
know gives it to me.

429
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,446
It's the only way that
we can get things done.

430
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,553
Please...

431
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,553
don't tell my husband.

432
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,061
Okay.

433
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,059
I'll be right back.

434
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,402
An hour and counting. Do
you think the IRS flagged me...

435
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,635
- because I worked in two states?
- Soccer mom uses crystal meth.

436
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,803
- What?
- You heard me.

437
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,676
- Did she just tell you out of the blue?
- No, I asked.

438
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,250
- Someone help us! We were just here.
- What happened?

439
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,250
He fell asleep and
now he won't wake up.

440
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:31,583
- They came with an MVA this morning.
- They were discharged.

441
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,022
- Any vomiting?
- No, no, but he's not right.

442
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:36,185
You must have missed something.

443
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,586
- Pupils are equal and sluggish.
- He's hypertensive, 110/82.

444
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,021
- Miller two and a 4-0 ET tube.
- What's going on?

445
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,026
- Sir, we're trying to find out.
- Let's get a gram of mannitol.

446
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,426
- Did he get a CT?
- No.

447
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,726
- Cricoid.
- Heart rate's 69.

448
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,732
Tube. No CT after an MVA?

449
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:19,098
He just flew out
of the car seat.

450
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,706
Okay. I...

451
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,276
I'm in. Did you check for a
cranial hematoma for a stepoff?

452
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,471
- Yes. I checked all of that. He was fine.
- Mannitol's running.

453
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,448
- What's wrong?
- He might've had some head trauma.

454
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:35,918
It can cause bleeding in the brain.
I'm sorry it wasn't caught earlier.

455
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,080
Let's get him a CT.

456
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,654
Unrestrained and no CT?
Are you kidding, Abby?

457
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,701
Hey.

458
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,998
What did the CT show?

459
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,407
Parietal skull fracture
with subdural hematoma.

460
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,376
Neurosurg has got
him up in the OR now.

461
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,914
- How could I miss an intracranial bleed?
- It happens.

462
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,950
- He seemed like a healthy baby to me.
- You had an Attending.

463
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,714
If I can't trust my clinical
skills, I should go home...

464
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,551
because the book stuff is
not going that great either.

465
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,250
When I get back, we'll
pull the charts and the film...

466
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,454
and we'll just go over it step-by-step
and see what went wrong.

467
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,759
- It's how you learn. GALLANT:
Need some help in here!

468
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,869
Didn't they tell you
she was septic?

469
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,095
Claimed they didn't know.

470
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,910
- Went apneic in the rig.
- Lost pulse when we pulled up.

471
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,272
- She's in PEA. Milligram of epi, atropine.
- What about your audit?

472
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,400
Third atropine's in.

473
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,775
Weak femoral pulse with
compressions. The trip over did not help.

474
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,813
She wasn't coding.
She had a good pulse.

475
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:14,977
- Dopa's up to 20, don't have a pressure.
- They had no Pedes RTs, no equipment.

476
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:18,646
- It was dangerous to leave her.
- Yeah, they're a bunch of idiots.

477
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,293
Why didn't you tube
her? Stop compressions.

478
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,462
Still PEA.

479
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,063
She was breathing on her own.

480
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:27,157
Dr. Lewis, got your
geriatric boyfriend...

481
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,632
- on the phone. It's important.
- I'll call back. Resume compressions.

482
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,638
- Come on, Michelle.
- More epi. Where are the parents?

483
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,637
- Coming from Geldin.
- Can they get here?

484
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,641
- I think they're from Michigan.
- She's fixed and dilated.

485
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,302
They better figure it out fast.

486
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,281
Dr. Morris, your pancreatitis
is a case of menstrual cramps.

487
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,509
Oh.

488
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:49,154
So perhaps in the future,
before you call Surgery...

489
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,348
- read Chapter 1 of <i>Harrison's.</i>
- Right.

490
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,016
Can you make sure Amanda
Knight gets 600 of ibuprofen?

491
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,958
- Yes, doctor.
- I consulted on him. Why isn't he in bed?

492
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,190
- He just signed in.
- Mr. Persky's back?

493
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,164
- Who let him go in the first place?
- Dr. Kovac let him go.

494
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,237
- Without the CT I ordered?
- Mr. Persky, what happened?

495
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:09,806
- He's febrile.
- Oh, God.

496
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,383
It hurt for a while there,
but it's much better now.

497
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,317
- Think he perfed?
- Yes. Mr. Persky...

498
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,323
when the appendix bursts, it releases
pressure, which abates the pain.

499
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,223
Unfortunately, it releases
fecal matter into the belly...

500
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,557
requiring us to operate on you.

501
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,529
- Like under anesthesia?
- Yes.

502
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,398
Uh-uh. My mother died
that way. No anesthesia.

503
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,270
- During your surgery?
- Yes. Going under is what killed her.

504
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:46,076
Right. Okay, well, let's take
Mr. Persky upstairs and prep him...

505
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,644
- for surgery. I'll be right there.
- Where are you going?

506
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,514
I'm gonna find Dr. Kovac.

507
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,581
Stop compressions.

508
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,620
Asystole.

509
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,096
Resuming compressions.

510
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,723
- Should we try transcutaneous pacing?
- How long has she been down?

511
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,030
- Forty-two minutes.
- Okay, Gallant.

512
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,100
Gallant.

513
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,640
Time of death, 15:37.

514
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:30,083
There's only so much responsibility
you can take. You didn't give her cancer.

515
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,419
So how come that doesn't
make me feel any better?

516
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,958
Those the parents?

517
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,424
Yeah.

518
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,067
- Gallant?
- I'll tell them.

519
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,144
Is it all right if I come in?

520
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:33,674
Sorry it's taking so long.
Dr. Pratt's been tied up.

521
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,015
But then I suppose
you don't mind the delay.

522
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,521
- Will you report what happened?
- I never said anything did.

523
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,526
Because maybe you could be
transferred to another facility...

524
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,789
someplace safer for you.

525
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,460
There's no shame in this.

526
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,967
No one's going to think less of
you for it, not me, not your girlfriend.

527
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,038
I don't have one anymore.

528
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,672
I'm the girl now.

529
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,109
- Jimmy...
- Can you leave me alone?

530
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,087
No! It's gonna hurt my baby!

531
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:14,090
Eloise, you have a broken
leg. You need to settle down.

532
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,592
- No! No!
- Give me five of Haldol.

533
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,425
No! It's gonna hurt my
baby! Please! No! No! No!

534
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,532
I don't... I don't
want my baby...

535
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:28,936
I don't want my
baby to do drugs.

536
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:33,443
- Did you kill her?
- No.

537
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:37,105
Send her up to Ortho and make
sure they cast her before she wakes up.

538
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,921
Sorry you had to see that.

539
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,547
- Did you get scared?
- Are you kidding? It was cool.

540
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,722
So, what does this thing do,
make you glow in the dark?

541
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,127
Yeah, only after 1000 x-rays.

542
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,461
Want one?

543
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,127
Can I have one of my head?

544
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,134
Is it okay?

545
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,935
Long as your department
gets charged for it.

546
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:06,635
Okay. Lay still,
hold your breath.

547
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,956
I understand you overrode my order
for an abdominal CT on the appy patient.

548
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,595
- Yes.
- Well, he's since managed...

549
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,994
to perforate his appendix and
is upstairs waiting for surgery.

550
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,658
Instead of a quick laproscopic procedure,
I'll perform an open laparotomy...

551
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:34,328
- with antiseptic washout.
- That's too bad.

552
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,340
Your actions have made
his life and mine much harder.

553
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:41,139
- You know he wants epidural anesthesia?
- What do you want me to say?

554
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,976
Neither a CBC or a CT
would have been definitive.

555
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,176
- Sometimes the best test is time.
- You're serious?

556
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,516
He was given discharge instructions
and came back as directed.

557
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,181
- The system worked.
- Oh, for you, maybe...

558
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,760
but he'll have a riskier surgery
and I'll miss dinner with my daughter.

559
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,289
Score one for your
bloody mission.

560
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,956
Can you see Morris' crouper
so we can discharge her?

561
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,693
- Yeah, in a minute.
- I need consent for conscious sedation...

562
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,963
- for Carolyn Kinaire.
- Okay, hang on.

563
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,074
- Dr. Lewis.
- You have to present to Kovac or Romano.

564
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,006
I have to call the IRS and
beg not to be imprisoned.

565
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,841
Kovac is not here and Romano's
the reason why I need this.

566
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:19,041
- What did he do now?
- Male rape victim who needs an exam...

567
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,743
and Napoleon's not too
comfortable with the prospect.

568
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,219
- Homophobe. Fine, I'll do it.
- You're the best.

569
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:28,019
- Ready to go over this?
- Yeah, I've denied my bladder this long.

570
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,527
The Helen Keller of County.
You missed a skull fracture today.

571
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,392
You'll be back to
code browns in no time.

572
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,898
Hang on a second. Hey. You.

573
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:39,401
- What is it, Dr. Lewis? I'm a busy man.
- You're one less patient busy.

574
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,563
- I'm taking the rape case.
- Excuse me?

575
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,904
Don't know if it's a
gay thing, or what...

576
00:35:43,928 --> 00:35:45,370
What are you talking about?

577
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,604
- Pratt feels...
- He's a rabid dog who should be shot...

578
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,714
before he infects
the other staff.

579
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:55,477
As for my abilities,
I finish what I start.

580
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:56,501
Okay.

581
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,090
Bang.

582
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,557
- Hey, Frank.
- Back from your little joyride?

583
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,361
- You seen my kid around?
- Yeah, I saw him stalking Kovac earlier.

584
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,869
- Did the IRS call?
- Yes, said something about penalties...

585
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,873
back taxes, you owing
them for their lost time...

586
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:20,069
- and that Hollander guy called again.
- Did he leave a number?

587
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,476
Nope, just canceled dinner.

588
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:26,577
- I spoke with Mrs. Meyers.
- Who?

589
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,050
Meth mom. She's
agreed to seek counseling.

590
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,156
- Social Services will follow up.
- They don't wanna see her?

591
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:36,124
I told them she's obviously devoted
to her family, takes good care of them.

592
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,991
Be harder when she dies of
a drug-induced heart attack.

593
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:42,601
Well, I'm sure this scared her,
enough to get the message, I'd think.

594
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:46,966
- Okay, go with your gut.
- Are you sure?

595
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:50,870
Because it's a bit of a weakness
on my part, not reading people well.

596
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:55,478
Never occurred to me that a working
wife and mother would be a meth user.

597
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,475
People are capable of anything
when put under the right stressors.

598
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,548
Need help
visualizing the fissure.

599
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,496
- Okay.
- You want to swab for sperm too?

600
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,633
No, we have enough.
Help me take this off.

601
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,793
The bleeding's stopped.
The tear will heal on its own.

602
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,301
- Is he good to go?
- Back to the daddy tank...

603
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,670
as soon as his discharge
papers are signed.

604
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,642
Excuse me, Dr. Romano,
may I speak with you privately?

605
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:04,305
You're already my favorite.
You want people to talk?

606
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,008
- His lab workup.
- Why you showing it to me?

607
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,711
Dr. Pratt's on his
way into a trauma.

608
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,468
Some test results
have come back.

609
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,908
You're HIV-positive with a
CD4 count of less than 200.

610
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,904
That means you have AIDS.

611
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,686
Did you hear what I just said?

612
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,287
Yeah, thanks.

613
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,862
At least now I know
it's not gonna be forever.

614
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,803
- That the guy who got punked out?
- Shut up.

615
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,935
He's had a bad day.

616
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,082
- Okay, this all looks well documented.
- Gee, thanks.

617
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,775
Baby had a normal exam and
the mechanism was borderline.

618
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:17,389
I would've scanned the head, but
Kovac might not. It's a judgment call.

619
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,320
- That's why I ordered a baby gram.
- When you read an x-ray...

620
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:24,394
- are you using the ABCD mnemonic?
- Airway, Bones, Cardiac, Diaphragm.

621
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,822
Wait, this is the wrong film.

622
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,763
No, it's Colin Tranh, and I still
don't see it. Is it more superior?

623
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,097
- Do you have the head CT?
- Yeah.

624
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,972
Okay, here's the fracture.

625
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,078
And I still don't see it.

626
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,150
It's not there.

627
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,317
Get a social worker and
find that boyfriend now.

628
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:52,321
- Trauma 1's empty. Come on.
- Dr. Lewis, GSW to the head.

629
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,688
- Went into V-fib two minutes out.
- Robbery, homicide, both?

630
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,659
Self-inflicted. No time to
transfer. Charge to 200.

631
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,162
- Why isn't he intubated?
- Because he's a DNR.

632
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,825
- That's what I told him.
- Suicide is against the law.

633
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,100
If he flinched, he
only injured his cortex.

634
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:08,633
Okay, let's do this. 8-0 tube.

635
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,502
Come on, give me those.

636
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,803
- Dr. Lewis?
- Stand by with epi.

637
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:17,382
Still V-fib, 360. Clear.

638
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,384
Amp of epi.

639
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,120
- He used a gun.
- Charge to 360.

640
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,159
- Stop it.
- Clear.

641
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:32,058
- Stop it!
- I'm saving him. Hundred of lidocaine.

642
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,859
- She knows him.
- Just leave him.

643
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,635
It's what he wanted.

644
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,738
- Is the baby out of surgery?
- Yeah. I spoke to the doctor.

645
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,472
- It went well. Where's his mother?
- At work. I called.

646
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,879
- So he's going to be okay, right?
- Yes, he will.

647
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,748
- This is Mr. Sung. He's a social worker.
- How you doing?

648
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,355
Fine. What's this all about?

649
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:01,755
- You mentioned that Colin cries a lot.
- Yeah. So?

650
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,486
- Was he crying when you got home?
- Why?

651
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,325
It appears his skull was
fractured after he left.

652
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,330
- What?
- He didn't have a fracture...

653
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,560
when he was here earlier.

654
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,228
- Are you saying I hit him?
- I don't know what you did.

655
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,773
Did you slam his head against the
wall? Or the floor? The crib railing?

656
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,605
- I don't have to listen to this.
- I'll take it from here.

657
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,523
Come with me.

658
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:23,907
I didn't hit that kid.
I didn't do anything.

659
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:27,883
Excuse me. You're nuts. Lady, you
don't know what you're talking about!

660
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,920
I didn't hit that
stupid kid. Hey!

661
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,258
Alex, this room is for
families who need privacy.

662
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,859
- Come on.
- Super power punch.

663
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,462
- Quit knocking me off.
- Plus, it's time to go.

664
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,532
- But I'm winning.
- Alex, it's late and I'm tired. Come on.

665
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,760
Fine.

666
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,099
- See you.
- See you.

667
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,433
- Did you make a new friend today?
- Guess so.

668
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,939
Cool.

669
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:55,444
Hey, would it be okay if we invite
him over for Thanksgiving dinner?

670
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,082
- He doesn't really have any family.
- Sure.

671
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,808
Okay.

672
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,715
Oh, wait, I forgot something.

673
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,485
- You finish your homework?
- Yeah, but look.

674
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,595
It's my head.
Dr. Kovac did it for me.

675
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,594
- He x-rayed your skull?
- Yeah.

676
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:14,232
Night.

677
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,825
- Hi.
- You're going home then?

678
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,095
Yeah, my family's
here to pick me up.

679
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,934
Listen, I just want to thank
you for everything, okay?

680
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:27,301
Hey. Do you guys want me to
make spaghetti tonight for dinner?

681
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,477
Neela, labs are back
on my lupus patient.

682
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,949
How do you calculate
creatinine clearance?

683
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,922
Weight in kilos times 140, minus
age, divided by 72, times creatinine.

684
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:45,725
Thanks. Have a good night.

685
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,995
Abby, would you be interested
in studying together some time?

686
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:55,004
- Sorry?
- I'm good at the academic stuff.

687
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:58,803
But you're good with everything
else. Maybe we could help each other.

688
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,470
Okay.

689
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,964
- Hey, Dr. Lewis.
- What is it?

690
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:26,001
The LOL in 2 is
complaining of nausea.

691
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,163
Give her 10 of Compazine and
make sure she gets a dinner tray.

692
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,002
- Pretty rough day today, huh?
- Yeah.

693
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,701
- Did you hear from Jing-Mei?
- She got on a plane.

694
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,171
Did you send in a blood
draw, check a dig. level?

695
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,374
- Yeah.
- The tube you sent was hemolyzed.

696
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,712
They need another
draw. What do I tell them?

697
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:43,218
Tell them he left AMA.

698
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,627
- Times up. Where's my hand?
- In the women's bathroom...

699
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,488
in the tampon
machine. Get it yourself.
