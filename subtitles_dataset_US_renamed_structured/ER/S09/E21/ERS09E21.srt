1
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,576
Dr. Carter?

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,370
Dr. Carter?

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,010
Start dopamine at 10 mics.
- Dr. Carter?

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,050
And mix up Levophed.

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,987
Dr. Carter? You left a note to
wake you if you weren't up by 7.

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,121
Do you want some breakfast?

7
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:33,896
No. No, thanks. I'll just
get something there.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,475
- Dr. Carter.
- I'm up, ahem.

9
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,172
I'm up.

10
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,503
- Hey, you're late.
- Two minutes.

11
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,573
Fifty-seven-year-old, cirrhosis,
vomiting blood. GI lab can scope him at 9.

12
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,108
- Can I get a bagel?
- I haven't had breakfast either.

13
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,836
- You mean dinner.
- Yeah, whatever.

14
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,574
Sixteen-year-old banger, GSW to belly.
O.R. should be grabbing him any minute.

15
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,048
- Like now?
- Then there's the 14-year-old banger...

16
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,120
GSW to the upper leg. Pulse
deficit, in line for angiogram.

17
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,189
- Same shooting?
- I stopped keeping track.

18
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,292
- DVT in 6. On heparin.
- Since midnight?

19
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,691
There's no tele beds. This gang
war's got every department backed up.

20
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:39,731
Where's Jim Carter when you need him?
Bus full of Texans with food poisoning.

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,200
- Good morning.
- For you. Apparently, I'm a vampire.

22
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,862
Wow, you got it so rough.
Three night shifts in a row.

23
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,942
- I been on graveyard two weeks straight.
- I did my residency, thank you.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,480
They're insisting on being discharged
by 2:16 so they can see the stupid eclipse.

25
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,081
I thought vampires
liked eclipses.

26
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,115
Ah, the moon blocks
out the sun. Big deal.

27
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,277
A billboard outside
my apartment does that.

28
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,616
- Catch you tonight, Elvira.
- I thought this was it.

29
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,954
Almost. One more night slumming it
with you cats, then I'm heading it uptown.

30
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,090
You're late.

31
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,325
- You can tell time.
- Ha. So can Carter.

32
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,767
- So, what's he gonna do, fire me?
- Did you catch the eclipse?

33
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,338
- What?
- A solar eclipse.

34
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,409
A celestial phenomenon that occurs only
once every 18 years, 11 and a third days.

35
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,910
- No. I slept through that.
- You slept through it?

36
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,359
I have to sleep sometime.

37
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,780
- Couldn't wake up for 10 minutes?
- Big deal. Moon blocks out the sun.

38
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,853
I got a billboard outside my
apartment that does the same thing.

39
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,183
You don't look so good.

40
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,417
Twelve-year-old near-drowning
in 4, intubated and comatose.

41
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,324
- No movements, waiting on PICU.
- What's with the Buddhists?

42
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,330
- They're here for the nun.
- We got some religious turf war?

43
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,162
Buddhist nun. Transpo's backed
up taking her to the morgue.

44
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,634
- She's dead?
- Reincarnated. It's a cycle of karma.

45
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,330
Six-year-old in respiratory
arrest from cyanide toxicity.

46
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,376
Acidosis is resolved with induced
methemoglobinemia. Waiting on PICU.

47
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,675
- How does a 6-year-old ingest cyanide?
- That is a fatal MI. Family's waiting.

48
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,346
They want to see their
father after he gets cleaned up.

49
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,817
You okay?

50
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:10,480
- DVT in 6 waiting on coags.
- Hold on. I gave you DVT this morning.

51
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,717
- Guy's been there 20 hours?
- Take care of him.

52
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,362
All right, see you.
Nice knowing you.

53
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,730
I start at Northwestern next
week. Tonight's it for me.

54
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,038
That's right, um...

55
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,336
Good luck, Greg.

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,801
Yeah. You too.

57
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,244
Do you realize how much
ambulance traffic we get here?

58
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,541
- They can't go around?
- Clear the equipment away.

59
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,207
It's equipment or
a pile of concrete.

60
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,182
Hey! Park the damn
thing sideways.

61
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,321
- What is this?
- Weaver's moving Triage.

62
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,549
- Something about more beds.
- So the patients can wait lying down?

63
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,217
I don't ask. I thought
you were on vacation.

64
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,914
- Tomorrow. CHEN:
To Martha's Vineyard?

65
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,725
- Nope.
- Thirty-two-year-old, struck by a cab.

66
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,526
- The Cape?
- Rio de Janeiro.

67
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,692
- Ooh-la-la, string bikini.
- With my dad.

68
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,838
- She ran into traffic.
- I wanted more time.

69
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,734
- There were others.
- Head trauma?

70
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,102
- Proximal tibia on the right.
- We wanted time.

71
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,710
They forced us. They wanted
everyone to go together.

72
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,747
- Ma'am, are you taking any medication?
- It's ending today. Today's the last day.

73
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,852
- Can you tell us your name?
- 2:16 p.m. The end of the world.

74
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,349
Aw, great. And I have to work. I'm
always working when the world ends.

75
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,001
- I can't swallow, man.
- Belly's soft. Type and cross for four.

76
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,704
Blood bank's almost empty.
Red Cross doesn't restock until 9.

77
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:17,351
Crit's 30. Let's
stick with saline.

78
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,682
- Decreased on right. Thirty-two French.
- Why can't I swallow? Am I dying?

79
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:25,724
Not if we can help. If you keep shooting
each other, we'll run out of blood.

80
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,522
- I didn't shoot nobody.
- Carter. You should look at this woman.

81
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,189
I've been here half an hour, I got
half a dozen patients. Be more specific.

82
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,530
Buddhist nun, end-stage breast
cancer, vomiting pain meds, Exam 2.

83
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,001
This guy need to go up?

84
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,538
Wouldn't have anywhere
for him if he did. Ten blade.

85
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,802
Have a portable chest, full trauma panel.
- Yo, where you going?

86
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:47,345
You have a collapsed lung. Dr. Corday
is going to re-inflate it for you.

87
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,348
We'll keep an eye on you down
here. Try not to bleed too much.

88
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,883
- You my doctor?
- No.

89
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,647
- I've been waiting an hour!
- Have you came to rescue us?

90
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,757
I'm swamped with physical
improvements. You take point down here.

91
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,086
- Did you fire Romano?
- No, medical leave.

92
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,888
- What, his arm?
- I can't discuss it.

93
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,826
Carter, you know
if CT's back up yet?

94
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,329
I didn't know it was down.

95
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,660
- She had a benign abdomen.
- She's unresponsive.

96
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,858
Add a tox screen.

97
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,795
- She may be coming down from speed.
- Mm-hm.

98
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,770
- She's nuts, right, out of it?
- Unconscious is pretty out of it.

99
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,500
- So I don't check out her story?
- The end of the world?

100
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,339
- The part about men trying to kill her.
- I'd look into it.

101
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,743
I got chronic
pancreatitis. I'm puking...

102
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,942
Let me guess. Need a shot of Demerol.
- Just do it fast.

103
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,088
Mastectomy, radiation, chemo.
Recurs with a pathologic fracture.

104
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,417
- She have an oncologist?
- Surgeon's in Japan.

105
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,559
- I need it now.
- GSW, 10 minutes out.

106
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,126
All right, come find me.

107
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:37,093
Hello. I'm Dr. Carter.

108
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:41,759
Kito Shunko. And this
is the venerable Zuin-An.

109
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,803
- I'm sorry, Sister. Zuin...?
- Zuin-An.

110
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,565
Are you comfortable with me
doing a physical examination?

111
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,913
- Yes.
- Okay.

112
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,073
When was her last chemo?

113
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,879
Three months ago. But it
wasn't working anymore.

114
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,549
I shouldn't have
even brought her here.

115
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,817
But she's in pain and hasn't
had anything to drink in two days.

116
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,552
She'll feel much better with
some intravenous fluids...

117
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,391
some anti-nausea
and pain medication.

118
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,137
"So much sadness."

119
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,141
Whoa. Somebody overcooked
their burger, ha-ha-ha.

120
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,683
- It's arson. Definitely arson.
- Could be electrical.

121
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,551
- I've been brown-bagging since it closed.
- And now the cafeteria has a monopoly.

122
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,819
- Was anybody in there?
- C.F.D. did a sweep.

123
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,930
- Huh. Well, I guess we're closed then.
- We never close.

124
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,225
Neither did Doc Magoo's,
and look what happened.

125
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,368
I wouldn't deprive
you of your last shift.

126
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,403
Come on. Declare internal
disaster so that we can all go home.

127
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,370
No. You're an internal disaster.
That's an external disaster.

128
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,802
Hey, Abby. Got any marshmallows?

129
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,078
Mr. Mednick, you
need to be on a monitor.

130
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,775
What I need is some fresh air.
- Put out the cigarette.

131
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,719
- I'm almost done.
- Put it out! You have a bleeding ulcer.

132
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,858
- I know what I have.
- Okay, that's fine.

133
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,757
Smoke the whole pack. Come and
find me when you start vomiting blood.

134
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,764
- Hey, Abby. Doc Magoo's is on fire.
- Yeah, I can see that.

135
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,600
- Single GSW to the...
- Oh, my God!

136
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,074
- Whoa.
- Now can we go home?

137
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,543
- Lizzie, come to take the before pictures?
- Shouldn't you be in pre-op?

138
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:38,481
Some bovine threw me out here when
a lap Nissen started circling the drain.

139
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,085
- Hand me that.
- The chart?

140
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,482
No, the black marker.

141
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,281
Poor bastard came in trying
to cure aggravated belching.

142
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,791
His wife's probably been in the
coffee shop waiting for him to wake up.

143
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,557
Do me a favor. Write "not
this one, idiot" on my arm.

144
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,063
Oh, like it doesn't happen.

145
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,828
I'll be lucky to get out without
both my legs amputated.

146
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,632
I should have you come in with me
to stand guard over these gargoyles.

147
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:04,040
You can if you want to, you
know. If you're bored or curious.

148
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,304
I'm covering the ER.

149
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,348
- Well, they need you more than I do.
- I'll scrub in if I can.

150
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,653
You forgot "idiot."

151
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,314
- I'll be there, Robert.
- Well, just in case you're not, "idiot."

152
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,197
- Do you think I'm doing the right thing?
- It doesn't matter what I think.

153
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,530
Well, that's a position I
would usually advocate...

154
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,467
but now I'm asking.

155
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,372
You're doing the right thing.

156
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,177
Yeah.

157
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,813
- Something's in my eye. Metal.
- Don't touch it.

158
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,677
- What's it look like?
- CBC, chem, chest, carboxyhemoglobin.

159
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,182
- Satting at 97.
- Uh-huh.

160
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,343
Can someone check
my daughter's ventilator?

161
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
- I'll send a nurse. O'CONNOR:
How bad am I burned?

162
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,557
Mainly second-degree but I
want to ultrasound your belly.

163
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,889
- Can we do another EEG?
- I'll check. SonoSite and a Wood's lamp.

164
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,724
The tank blew my mask right off.

165
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,126
You waiting for somebody?

166
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,858
My husband.

167
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:05,404
- Check with the clerk at the front desk.
- No, he died. He had a heart attack.

168
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,132
Oh. You need someone
to take you to him?

169
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,801
No. He was here. They took him.

170
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,041
We just wanted to
stay here a minute.

171
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,812
- Susan needs help with a central line.
- Is there another room open?

172
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,081
- Exam 1, maybe.
- No, it's all right. We'll leave.

173
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,919
BP, 122/78. Pulse, 114.

174
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,152
- TKO the saline.
- Come on, Paul.

175
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,058
- Dr. Pratt?
- My kid's hypotensive.

176
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,165
I need the SonoSite
and a pair of hands.

177
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,358
Come on, Paul. Paul, now.

178
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,264
Can I instill the Alcaine?

179
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,769
Yeah. Titrate eight of MS.
Keep his systolic over 100.

180
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,704
- Is the lung up?
- It's a GSW to the right shoulder.

181
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,903
Good breath sounds. Can you
feel it when I touch you here?

182
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,844
- I'm good, I told you.
- Pulse ox, 98 on two liters.

183
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,076
Okay. Let's get a pocket
Doppler. CBC, type and screen.

184
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,778
- What is that?
- GSW to the belly last week.

185
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,423
- We took out his spleen.
- You're out running again?

186
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,957
They killed my brother
and crippled my sister.

187
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,096
- We took care of them here?
- Didn't help much, huh?

188
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,129
Is Curtis your brother?

189
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,857
What? You were his doctor?

190
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,236
Dr. Carter, Chen has a
pediatric drowning, full arrest.

191
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,736
- Sinus tach on the scope, 110.
- How are his pulses?

192
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,966
- Radial and ulnar.
- Follow serial crits.

193
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,178
And then come find
me with his films.

194
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:19,579
12-year-old girl. Fell
into the water wh...

195
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,614
Sir, relax and let the
doctor do his job, okay?

196
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,910
- How long was she under?
- Don't know.

197
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,764
- Hold compressions.
- Not perfusing.

198
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,822
Compressions can put her
into V-fib. Let's do a rectal temp.

199
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,787
- How long since last epi?
- Six minutes.

200
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,623
All right. Push another .5. Heated
humidified O2, warm saline, Bair Hugger.

201
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,731
Core temp is 86.5.

202
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,958
Good enough.
Resume compressions.

203
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,899
Still no pulse. Mg of atropine.

204
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,234
- How long has she been down?
- About 45 minutes.

205
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,898
Okay.

206
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,943
Let's go with NG
and bladder irrigation.

207
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,945
- When?
- Five minutes. We suctioned her.

208
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,583
- She triggered the vent.
- Thought she was decerebrate.

209
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,946
She was. PRATT: Wean
it down to 50 percent.

210
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,111
Recheck another set
of lytes. Temperature.

211
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,288
- Ninety-seven point one.
- That's good, right?

212
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,449
- What's her name?
- Heather.

213
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,453
Heather, can you hear me? If
you can hear me, squeeze my hand.

214
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,825
I got a pulse. It's faint.
Let's try for a pressure.

215
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,231
- Rate's up to 72.
- All right. Suction catheter.

216
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,968
- Whoa. Pulmonary edema?
- Or river water.

217
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,043
- Ectopy on the monitor.
- Heart's irritable. Set vent temp to 42.

218
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,009
Four of PEEP.

219
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,009
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

220
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,208
Just follow the
light with your eyes.

221
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,784
Good.

222
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,911
- Very good.
- You're doing great.

223
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,024
BP's steady,
110/72. Sats are 93.

224
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,251
I bet you want that
tube out, don't you?

225
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,693
Okay, when I say "now," you take a
deep breath and blow as hard as you can.

226
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,923
Deep breath.

227
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,261
- Ready with five of albuterol.
- And now.

228
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,868
Clear!

229
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,505
- No change.
- All right, 300.

230
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:57,372
Stand by with 50 of lidocaine.
Second bolus of 25 in five. Clear.

231
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,205
Sinus tach.

232
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,245
- Strong pulse.
- Come on, Heather.

233
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,145
- Wake up. Open your eyes.
- She's posturing.

234
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,950
All right. GCS 131.

235
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,754
Non-rebreather mask,
100 percent, high-flow.

236
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,083
- Daddy.
- Yes, honey?

237
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,192
Try not to talk.
Cough all that stuff up.

238
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,057
Another chest and
repeat the ABG.

239
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,755
Dad.

240
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,199
Mr. Marks.

241
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,704
Yes. Is she gonna be okay?

242
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:28,205
She was in cardiac arrest.
She wasn't breathing on her own.

243
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,707
She's awake. She's
breathing on her own.

244
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,142
We don't know how
long she was in the water.

245
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,908
- And her lungs show signs of damage.
- Her lungs are recovering.

246
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:42,044
It's possible that her brain may have
been deprived of oxygen for a long time.

247
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,519
Oh, God.

248
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,885
Oh, my God.

249
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:48,256
- Her neurologic exam is back to normal.
- You saved her.

250
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,263
- I saw you save her.
- We got her heartbeat back.

251
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:56,802
But you need to know that 30
percent of all near-drownings die.

252
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,703
And another 30 suffer
permanent brain damage.

253
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,342
We're just gonna
have to wait and see.

254
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,410
She's gonna be just fine.

255
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,108
- Thank you. PRATT:
You're welcome.

256
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,848
All right.

257
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,286
- Can I...?
- Yeah, go ahead and see her.

258
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,160
They keep getting
younger, don't they?

259
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,096
- Is neurovascular intact?
- Completely.

260
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,600
But I'd observe for an
expanding hematoma.

261
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,398
You could take his staples out.

262
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,736
We could implant a zipper,
make it easier for all concerned.

263
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,740
- Still waiting!
- You got a bed.

264
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,106
- Still in pain.
- Malik, I need that EEG.

265
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,839
- Neurology's backed up.
- Who isn't?

266
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,587
- Is she feeling more comfortable?
- Yes. Thank you.

267
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:50,985
She's sleeping.

268
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,752
Her dehydration has resolved.

269
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,021
And her vitals look better.

270
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,461
She says it won't be long.

271
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,301
She might be right.

272
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,535
If there's anybody who
would wanna say goodbye...

273
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,140
They're coming from the temple.

274
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,505
She has a gift.

275
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,310
She can see inside of people.

276
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,617
She saw inside of me.

277
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:28,186
She was in prison for demonstrating
for human rights in North Korea.

278
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,887
And I was in prison for...

279
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,390
Well, for other things.

280
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,499
She saved me.

281
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:41,163
I took it on myself
to serve her purpose.

282
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:46,506
But now as I watch her
embrace her death and rebirth...

283
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,149
I truly understand.

284
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,678
Only through our
own acceptance...

285
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,789
do we realize our purpose.

286
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,230
- Is it scabies?
- Impetigo. It's a bacterial infection.

287
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,837
- What if it spreads, gets into his brain?
- We'll treat it with antibiotics.

288
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,838
He must've gotten it from his friends,
because he did not get that in my house.

289
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,202
Don't touch your face!

290
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,743
- I fell.
- Is that how you hurt your wrist too?

291
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,542
- Yeah.
- How'd you get to the hospital?

292
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,575
My boyfriend.

293
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,946
Was he there when you fell?

294
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:31,113
- Ow! Not so hard. Jeez.
- It's gallstones, Anna.

295
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,453
No, I don't have gallstones.

296
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,721
Fatty foods bring out the pain.

297
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:40,060
I didn't even eat dinner.
I just had some pie.

298
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:43,397
- How much pie?
- You know, a pie.

299
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,697
- You a smoker, Mr. Dressler?
- A little.

300
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,966
- Drink alcohol?
- Beer mostly.

301
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,076
- Exercise?
- Well, starting to get back into shape.

302
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,305
I was doing one of my wife's
exercise videos, and, uh...

303
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,314
Uh. Wasn't sure if it was the
chicken wings I had last night...

304
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,645
- or a heart attack.
- Let's hope it was wings.

305
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,617
How long's this gonna stay on?

306
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,983
About four to six weeks.

307
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,920
I have finals in a month.

308
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,459
Well, you can still
study with a cast on.

309
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:12,588
Not exams. State
finals. Cheerleading.

310
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,564
Well, you might have to
give those pom-poms a rest.

311
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:20,139
- I'll give you Compazine for the nausea.
- My doctor tried that, it doesn't work.

312
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,333
- Then why does he prescribe Percocet?
- That's what I'm asking you.

313
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,478
Demerol works. A
hundred and fifty milligrams.

314
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,774
- Woo, big dose.
- It's big pain.

315
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,950
Okay. One shot, one time, and
then that's it. I'm flagging your chart.

316
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,782
- You'll have to see a pain specialist.
- Good idea.

317
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,447
Haleh, 125 of Demerol for Mr...?

318
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,718
Dean. John Dean.

319
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,119
Haldeman. Bob Haldeman.

320
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,663
I'm serious. One shot
of Demerol, and that's it.

321
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,857
The ER is not a place
to manage chronic pain.

322
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,868
Yeah, as soon as my chiropractor
gets back, I'll get adjusted.

323
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,303
Good. Because I'm flagging
your chart. Abby, flag his chart!

Sit right there.
We'll get to you.

00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,158
The old paint
factory was the worst.

00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,253

How about here?

346
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,496
You want me to call your mom?

347
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,166
You don't want to talk to your mom?
- She'll kick my ass.

348
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,608
- Maybe that's what you need.
- Look, man. She don't understand.

349
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,508
I don't understand.

350
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,617
- Dropped my brother, that's all there is.
- No. That is not all there is.

351
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:15,243
You're what, 13 years old?
There's a lot more than that.

00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:20,883
- Not where I live.
- You're not one of those guys. Not yet.

353
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,056
You don't have to be.

354
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,757
- Somebody's gotta take care of business.
- Your business is your mother and sister.

355
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,265
Who will take care of
business when you're killed?

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,220
Hey. Hey, sweetie.

443
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,382
How's that?! Huh?! How's that?!

444
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,622
Clear. Come on, Turner.

Turner! TURNER: Ah!

448
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,970

449
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,836

00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,847
Chest tube and intubation tray!

451
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,217
No, wait. Turner,
you're bleeding.

452
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,850
Security!

453
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,824

00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,959
Start a second line of saline,
prep the left chest. Turner!

456
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:42,304
Time of death, 0028.

457
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,085
- You didn't call him back?
- I'm sure. After four weeks?

458
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,451
You don't know that. Maybe
his grandfather died or something.

459
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,455
There are phones
in funeral homes.

460
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,356
We can get you a little
Valium to take the edge off.

461
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,963
- Dr. Romano?
- What?

462
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,123
Would you like
Valium? Help you relax.

463
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,269
I don't wanna relax.

464
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:04,963
No way.

465
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,969
I thought you were
crazy about him.

466
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,771
- How we doing, Dr. Romano?
- Never better.

467
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,638
- Can you scooch over for us?
- Tank him up with a liter.

468
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,808
- Who's that scrubbing in?
- Uh, Dr. Starkman, third year.

469
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,649
No way! No residents! Jesus,
where's this table been, in the freezer?

470
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,552
I know. It can
get a little cold.

471
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,727
I'll be doing the
procedure, Robert.

472
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,819
Once you're out, we'll
make a circumferential cut...

473
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,931
Yeah, I know the
routine. Get on with it.

474
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,296
Okay. Set up a pre-op
Doppler, a sterile Stryker set.

475
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,199
I thought Corday was scrubbing in.
- What for?

476
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,569
She was with an ER patient.
You want me to page her?

477
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,471
All right. Mix up
a gram of Ancef.

478
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,203
Uh, may want to put
that on the other hand.

479
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,043
Sorry.

480
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,083
Count backwards
from 10, Dr. Romano.

481
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,149
Ten...

482
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,584
nine...

483
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,018
eight...

484
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,722
Hold still.

485
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,696
- Tono-Pen's 20.
- Two drops of Iodipine and Pred Forte.

486
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,027
- I'm losing my sight?
- Maybe partly.

487
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:13,161
The burn and traumatic glaucoma.
Only in the one eye. What's her pressure?

488
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,273
90/60. She's waking up.

489
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,785
Need depth perception
to be a firefighter.

490
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,208
We're not even sure yet.

491
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:22,439
- Where's OB?
- Coburn took a quick look, went to scrub.

492
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,448
Mia, you were stabbed.
We stabilized you.

493
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:30,385
But in order for us to save your uterus,
you're gonna have to go into surgery.

494
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,616
Last crit was 19.

495
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,726
Pratt.

496
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,090
Pratt.

497
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,369
We don't know.

498
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,799
On a scale of one to
10, how bad is the pain?

499
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,636
A high eight, ha.
No, it's a nine.

500
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,507
Sorry to tell you this, it looks
like you're having a heart attack.

501
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,242
We need to take you upstairs and
unblock the vessel with a catheter.

502
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:01,876
Dr. Carter, your dad's on line three.
- Okay, thank you.

503
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,080
Do you want us
to call your wife?

504
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,488
My wife took the kids to
Lincoln Park to watch the eclipse.

505
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,255
- I left a message for her.
- Not to worry. They'll take you right up.

506
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,889
Integrilin bolus, then 15 mgs
per hour. Where is that girl's EEG?

507
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,935
- Tech took it up.
- Well, then get Neurology on it!

508
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,333
Hello? Hey, Dad. How
are you? Where are you?

509
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,504
- John, what the hell happened?
- Uh-huh. What?

510
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,740
- Where did he get a scalpel?
- Too many patients, not enough staff.

511
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,111
And not enough medicine.

512
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,913
Which is why you prioritize
based on severity of illness.

513
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,248
Really?

514
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,652
Well, can't we just
postpone for a couple days?

515
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,690
- I'll stay in Chicago.
- This woman has...

516
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:44,091
I'm on the phone, Kerry!

517
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,762
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,160
No. It's just one of those...

519
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,266
Okay. Yeah. We can reschedule.

520
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,599
Fatal arrhythmia. That's what happens
when you chug too much cyanide.

521
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,371
And are undertreated.

522
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:03,311
- The daughter was less critical.
- And could have died.

523
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,974
The girl didn't have a choice.

524
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:11,321
Waiting room rack is over 30. I'll
take lead for the rest of the shift.

525
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,119
Hey, you're bleeding.
You're bleeding, Carter.

526
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,386
- What?
- Your back.

527
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:23,492
Malik, can you draw up HIV/hepatitis
serologies on that stabbed gangbanger?

528
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:26,161
- Already took him to the morgue.
- Have Pathology do it.

529
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:30,332
- Lab said they can take this guy in 30.
- No, now. He's losing heart muscle.

530
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,341
Push half a dose of TNK.

531
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,743
It's just gonna be one
more minute, Mr. Dressler.

532
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,577
Doc, I got a really
bad feeling here.

533
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,912
Don't worry. We're
gonna take care of you.

534
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,682
Do me a favor. I need a
piece of paper and a pen.

535
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,621
I wanna write a note to
my kids just in case I, uh...

536
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:51,195
In case they get here, and I'm...
- Yeah, absolutely.

537
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:55,459
- We have a good chance of reversing...
- Dr. Carter, we need you!

538
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,430
Is he under?

539
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:00,437
Well, I hope so. I'm
disarticulating at the elbow.

540
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,507
Way up there on the Bovie.

541
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,836
He was asking for you.
- I was detained.

542
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,842
I have an unstable
pulseless tib-fib.

543
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,173
Well, you're here now.

544
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,078
Two large-bore IVs,
trauma labs, four of O-neg.

545
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,776
- What are you doing?
- Ten-foot fall from scaffolding.

546
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:18,117
- Rebar through the right chest.
- C-collar and gurney. Get him to Trauma.

547
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,384
Rebar's stuck in
a concrete block.

548
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,618
Must be 500 pounds.

549
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,455
Can't we just pull him off it?

550
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,258
No. He'll bleed out. Rebar's
compressing torn vessels.

551
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,957
Have fire department
bring extrication.

552
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,126
Get a portable monitor
and an E cylinder.

553
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,101
- Up there?
- And get a HemoCue.

554
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,434
- You can't take it out?
- In the operating room.

555
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,133
Do you feel any numbness
or weakness in your legs?

556
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,573
No, not really.

557
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:43,079
Decreased on the right
but no JVD or tracheal shift.

558
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,877
- Look.
- What?

559
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,723
Some guy wants to talk to the doctor
who treated the pregnant stab victim.

560
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,552
Take a message. You okay? Sir?

561
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:58,220
Just get a little winded sometimes.
You ought to get that thing fixed.

562
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,458
Half our budget comes from
money people lose in that thing.

563
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,932
- What's your name?
- Ray. Ray Jamison.

564
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:08,403
- Mr. Jamison, you have any chest pains?
- More like palpitations. Comes and goes.

565
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,101
I've been to a couple of clinics,
they keep saying nothing's wrong.

566
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,974
- You don't have a doctor?
- Medicare kicks in next year.

567
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,776
- Ever have an EKG?
- Normal, they said.

568
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,781
But my ticker was on
good behavior then.

569
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,115
You should take this. He knows
something about the assault.

570
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,951
I can get you something
that at least looks like food.

571
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,322
- You don't need to do that.
- No. I'm your doctor now.

572
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,953
Thanks. This is Dr. Pratt.
MAN <i>Is my wife okay?</i>

573
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,999
- Yeah, who's this?
<i>- She's alive?</i>

574
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,132
- Yeah, she's alive. Why?
<i>- I've got the baby.</i>

575
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,304
What?

576
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,474
Let's get a 12-foot ladder.

577
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:47,669
HemoCue's 9.4.

578
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,781
Titrate four of MS.
Where's the O-neg?!

579
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,974
Right here! Do we
need an air bag?

580
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,312
- It's pretty tight.
- How much can we raise him?

581
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:57,012
- Maybe an inch. What's his pressure?
- Up to 100.

582
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,648
Dr. Carter, Exam 2's
drowning in pulmonary edema!

583
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,488
- Who?
- The Buddhist nun.

584
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,959
I got it. Go.

585
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,662
- In the alley?
- The north side.

586
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,494
Why didn't he just bring it in?

587
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:13,128
His wife came home with a baby and
said she gave birth while he was at work.

588
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,740
He saw the news and
put it together. Here.

589
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,500
Grab a BOA kit.

590
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:20,612
- Susan. Set up for neonatal resuscitation.
- Where?

591
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,980
Is that for pain?
She's in pain again.

592
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,551
No. This is for the
fluid in her lungs.

593
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,679
I can give her morphine. But it will
suppress her breathing even more.

594
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:01,043
- Where?
- I don't know. He just said in the alley.

595
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,953
No breath sound on the right.

596
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,559
It's a massive hemothorax.
He needs a chest tube tray.

597
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,525
Inflate. HENRY: Ah!

598
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,721
I'll retract the
supinator. You divide.

599
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,230
Mosquito.

600
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,726
Radial nerve.

601
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,096
Bone saw.

602
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,979
Four of morphine onboard.

603
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,918
We better check BP.

604
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,692
No more BPs.

605
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,293
- Find anything?
- No.

606
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:50,325
- Are you sure this wasn't a prank?
- Wait, wait. Shh. Listen.

607
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:56,565
- There must be three liters in there.
- Grab a sterile basin, the biggest we got.

608
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,643
- Tachy at 140. Barely has a pulse.
- Hang another two.

609
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,905
- Doc, get rid of the
O2. CHEN: Make it fast.

610
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,777
Clamping the tube. Go!

611
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:11,351
And cut through the periosteum.
Want the final honors?

612
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,116
No.

613
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,439
Why didn't he put him
where we could see him?

614
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,171
He didn't want
it to get run over.

615
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,441
Find him? ABBY: No.

616
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,311
Slide the backboard
up here. Hurry up.

617
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,853
- Pulse ox is down to 83.
- Get ready to put the O2 back on him.

618
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,615
He's free. WEAVER: Roll him.

619
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,291
Arm's free.

620
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:54,829
Rasp back. You don't want a
bone spur. Little more periosteum.

621
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,491
Three-0 Vicryl.

622
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,535
Hey, over here!

623
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:47,543
Hey there, little guy.

624
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,027
Can you hear me? Hello?

625
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,220
Yeah, barely. What's going on?

626
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:02,026
One of our doctors was hurt yesterday.
Had to be evacuated to Burundi.

627
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,362
<i>- Hurt how?</i>
- We were expecting a fourth.

628
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:07,904
But they're having trouble with her visa.
- Luka, you gotta speak up.

629
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:11,908
Can your contact at the State
Department push her visa through?

630
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,774
- What contact?
<i>- I thought you knew someone there.</i>

631
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,780
Ha, my family had a friend that
was ambassador to Uruguay...

632
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:18,858
Call him.

633
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:21,676
<i>I don't know him.
Can the Alliance fix it?</i>

634
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:22,945
Luka.

635
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,388
Not enough.

636
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,265
<i>- Okay, I'll be right there.</i>
- What?

637
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:38,096
We're trying to travel to Matenda,
but the main road is blocked.

638
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,068
There's a cholera epidemic
in the refugee population.

639
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,368
<i>We can't even get them
rehydration solution.</i>

640
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,773
You want somebody to
pitch in for a couple weeks?

641
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:50,575
<i>- What?</i>
- I've already had my shots, my visa.

642
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,441
I thought you changed your mind.

643
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,747
Yeah. But, you know,
if you're stretched...

644
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,694
Okay, I gotta go.
Can you come now?

645
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,789
Yeah, okay.

646
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,643
<i>Get on a plane.
Call the Alliance...</i>

647
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,960
Charge to 360. When did he arrest?
- Now.

648
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,103
Clear! CARTER: Is that my MI?

649
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,467
V-fib. MALIK: Bigeminy
flipped into V-tach.

650
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,268
How many times did you shock?
- Third one coming.

651
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,933
An amp of epi. I'll intubate.

652
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,840
What the hell's he
still doing down here?

653
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,311
I told you Cath lab
said 30 minutes.

654
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,780
All right. Prep
100 of lidocaine.

655
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,752
He's a little tachy at 165.

656
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,354
Slight flow murmur.

657
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:34,789
Fontanelle's soft but sunken.
He's definitely dry. He's full-term.

658
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:39,420
Mom's in post-op, stable. They
saved her uterus. How is he?

659
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:43,159
Heel stick a glucose, but I think we
have a healthy baby. He's a screamer.

660
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:47,169
Wouldn't you be? Literally ripped from
your mother's womb by some lunatic.

661
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,248
Hell of a way to
come into the world.

662
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:51,503
Yeah. But life only
gets better after that.

663
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,702
I'll bolus 20 per kilo,
bring him up to mom.

664
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,040
I'll do it.

665
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:00,345
What? If Accu-Chek is less
than 50, then I need to push D25.

666
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,487
Whatever you say, doctor.

667
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:05,521
- Asystole.
- All right. Give me the pacing pads.

668
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,823
Let's push three more of epi.
- Resume CPR.

669
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,928
The family's here.

670
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,358
The, uh, letter.

671
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,126
- What?
- Pen and paper?

672
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,527
- Did you give him a pen and paper?
- No.

673
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,229
- Why not?
- What?

674
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,376
He asked for a pen and some
paper to write a letter to his kids.

675
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,977
He didn't ask me.

676
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,172
There it is. It's just
a Subq bleeder.

677
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,378
Clamp that off.

678
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,018
You want cautery?

679
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:37,550
No. I'll use the
silver nitrate sticks.

680
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,317
Don't contaminate the field.

681
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,052
Robert?

682
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,989
Bovie that bleeder.

683
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:50,567
- Pick-ups. CORDAY:
Robert, it's Elizabeth.

684
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,062
Lizzie.

685
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,205
She's one hell of a surgeon.

686
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,975
So beautiful.

687
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,513
Done.

688
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:08,580
That was just a small EBL. But we
can order a post-op CBC just to be safe.

689
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,089
You taking good care of me?

690
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,591
I'm trying, yes.

691
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,695
I love you, Elizabeth.

692
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,432
You need to get some rest.

693
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:28,801
Let's put a fresh pressure
dressing on. And I'll check it later.

694
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,876
Hey, you have a visitor.

695
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,786
- Is that...?
- It's your baby.

696
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,921
- You had a boy.
- Is he okay?

697
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:47,457
Yeah. He's great, active,
likes to play hide-and-seek.

698
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,991
My baby.

699
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,790
You wanna hold him?

700
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,626
Yeah.

701
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:59,760
Come on, little guy.
Gotcha. I gotcha.

702
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,177
He's still asystole.

703
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,082
- He's had two of atropine?
- Oh, yeah.

704
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:19,986
All right. Increase the pulse
duration to 20 milliseconds.

705
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,990
Dr. Carter.

706
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,594
- How long we been going?
- Sixty-two minutes.

707
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,931
All right, stop.

708
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,696
You can stop.

709
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,522
Mrs. Dressler, I'm Dr. Carter.

710
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:04,298
Your husband came in with chest
pain. He was having a heart attack.

711
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,802
He's dead?

712
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,300
We were about to move
him up to the Cath lab...

713
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:14,378
to unblock the main artery
when he went into cardiac arrest.

714
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,352
And I couldn't get him back.

715
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,454
Did he know?

716
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,716
Did he know what was happening?

717
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,897
Yeah, he wanted me...

718
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:39,060
to, um, tell you...

719
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:43,572
that he loves you all very much.

720
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,907
- Hypotensive encephalopathy on Nipride.
- Ugh, let me guess. No ICU beds.

721
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:56,953
Oh, the gang war continues. Dyspareunia
waiting on Gram's stain and wet mount.

722
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,351
- Dyspareunia's better than no pareunia.
- Ha-ha-ha.

723
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:02,084
We have Mr. Jamison here
who is back in normal sinus...

724
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,561
- after I picked up an atrial flutter.
- I thought heart monitors did that.

725
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,462
- Feeling more comfortable?
- It's a miracle. What did you do?

726
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,499
I flipped the circuit
breaker back on.

727
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,639
But now you can be treated
with a simple prescription.

728
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,265
- I come see you at your office?
- This is my office.

729
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,469
- Or was.
- What?

730
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,943
I just work in the hospital.

731
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,777
Well, that's too bad.
You're a fine doctor.

732
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,450
Thank you.

733
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,586
See you, sweetness.

734
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,119
I'll call you later.

735
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,489
Congratulations, Greg.

736
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,823
You survived the
County experience.

737
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:44,368
Oh, no. Not just survived
it. I whupped its ass.

738
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:51,132
- Hey.
- Hey.

739
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,280
Did you see the eclipse?

740
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,007
Yeah. Sort of.

741
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,144
Pretty freaky, huh?

742
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,679
Yeah, I guess.

743
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,586
You have a rough shift?

744
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:13,094
Yeah. There was
this guy, this MI.

745
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:17,360
He asked me for a pen and some
paper to write a note to his kids, and...

746
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:21,466
I couldn't save him,
but I could have...

747
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,007
What?

748
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,610
Nothing.

749
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,344
Nothing's right here.

750
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:40,891
Hey. I haven't seen
you in a week. That's it?

751
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,527
Luka called me...

752
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:54,195
looking for you. He was under the
impression I might know where you were.

753
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,034
You're going, right?

754
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,879
To Africa.

755
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,053
It's not Rio.

756
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,683
But it's not here.

757
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,127
Are you supposed to be in there?

758
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:31,501
It's a first-aid kit. Damn near
the only thing that survived.

759
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,264
- How was your last shift?
- Lots of excitement.

760
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:39,103
Well, if you're ever bored,
God knows we need the staff.

761
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,109
- Yeah.
- Dr. Pratt.

762
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,805
You forgot to give
Jamison his Dig prescription.

763
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,645
- Jing-Mei can do it.
- Point two five or .125?

764
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,150
No. A lower dose.

765
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,485
Next appointment at the cardiology
clinic is in four months. That's okay?

766
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,329
Just let me write it.

767
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:03,695
Aftercare instructions too?

768
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,961
Return to the ER in
a week for a Dig level.

769
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:08,936
Tell him to call Dr. Pratt and
make sure I'm on duty first.

770
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,768
I thought you were
going to Northwestern.

771
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:13,805
Guess I'm more of
a South Side doc.

772
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:15,844
You staying here?
- What the hell.

773
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,641
This place kind of grows on you.
