1
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,014
Patient number two on high-flow
O2 with 500 cc's normal saline in.

2
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,821
- Pressure's 100/80. WATTS:
ETA of about four minutes.

3
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,424
<i>Say again the neuro
exam on patient two.</i>

4
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,958
Ma'am, can you tell me your
name? What's your name?

5
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,029
Still unresponsive
to verbal. GCS is 324.

6
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,029
<i>Copy that, 37.</i>

7
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,794
Hey, are you from
County? Hey, buddy?

8
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,630
County General. Clear.

9
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,363
Sit on my lap and tell me
what you want for Christmas.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,009
I want it to be January.

11
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,976
Ho-ho-ho!

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,173
It's okay, honey.
It's really not Santa.

13
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,251
Frank, can you please
stop scaring kids?

14
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,356
- Since when is Santa scary?
- Since he looks like a fat homeless dude.

15
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,493
- Pratt, two incoming. Stick around?
- Do I look like Bob Cratchit?

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,526
Just hang out
until we see how...

17
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,398
Anybody work here anymore?

18
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,274
- Do you want to go in now?
- I don't know if I'm ready.

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,043
Come on.

20
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:32,257
- Systolic's 100 on maximum dopamine.
- Satting at 91 with 5F PEEP.

21
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,463
He said he was run down,
and I told him to see a doctor.

22
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,292
We're gonna take Rick up to ICU.

23
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,561
Why don't you sit with
him until we find him a bed.

24
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,466
Oh.

25
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,141
He said it was stress
from winter exams.

26
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,308
It's okay.

27
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,072
He moved. Is that good?

28
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,478
It's probably just a reflex.

29
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,247
Repeat the HemoCue
in ABG in half an hour.

30
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,361
Oh.

31
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,692
Try something more cheerful.

32
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,594
- You think we should up his PEEP?
- His pressure won't tolerate it.

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,672
- How'd it go?
- Intermittent decerebrate posturing.

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,537
Neurosurg needs to put
him on an ICP monitor.

35
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,940
- Where's Dr. Kovac?
- He went home.

36
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,171
- Get him back here.
- I think he needs time.

37
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,009
Get him back.

38
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,944
- This shouldn't have happened.
- Not his fault.

39
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,180
- He missed it.
- He's just a little burned out.

40
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,120
I always thought of
you as a big man...

41
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,760
but compared to Jerry
you're an ambitious elf.

42
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,762
- Dr. Romano, will you tell him to change?
- I always do Santa.

43
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,851
- Not since I've been here.
- I have the perfect:

44
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,026
Ho-ho-ho.

45
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,726
Sounds more like
the Jolly Green Giant.

46
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,031
We already have a
wasted Angel of Bethlehem.

47
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,607
- Can we not have feuding Saint Nicks?
- Gastroenteritis in 1 is free to go.

48
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:59,144
The urticaria in 3 is
waiting on Solu-Medrol.

49
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,110
- Who's got the incoming?
- Me.

50
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,251
MVA, LOC on scene. Received
needle thoracostomy in the field.

51
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:05,809
Oh, my God. It's Harkins.

52
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,852
- Know her?
- She's a med student here.

53
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,115
- Last pressure, 100 palp.
- Was she alone?

54
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,918
She was with one of your docs.

55
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,890
Can't get a pulse.

56
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,920
Get a wheelchair.

57
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,464
Let me check your head. Luka.

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,852
Luka, you should sit down.

59
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,855
- Trauma panel. Get four of O-neg.
- We've got enough hands.

60
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,721
- Robert, she might need an ex-lap.
- I'll go free up an O.R.

61
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,386
- Prime the rapid infuser.
- Pulse is 110, thready.

62
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,226
- Why isn't she on a backboard?
- He cleared her clinically.

63
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,095
With a distracting injury?

64
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,431
Gallant, he needs
a fresh Kerlix.

65
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,404
- Pressure's down to 80.
- Squeeze in two liters.

66
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,098
Get her a collar,
tape her head down.

67
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,244
I need x-ray for a lateral
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

68
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,107
She was walking on the scene.

69
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,383
Step back. You might
contaminate the field.

70
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,712
Systolic's only 60.

71
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,054
Free fluid in Morrison's pouch
and the right pericolic gutter.

72
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,351
Probable liver
laceration. Page Trauma.

73
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,394
Dr. Kovac, what happened?

74
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,109
You okay? Did you hit your head?

75
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,311
No. My side.

76
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,249
- Neck pain?
- No.

77
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,125
The door won't open.

78
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,262
Call 911. I'll go see
about the other car.

79
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,260
We hit someone?

80
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,126
Just wait here.

81
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,010
No. God.

82
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,286
- Stay still. I'm a doctor.
- Elbow kills. I can't move my leg.

83
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,826
- Paramedics are on their way.
- It was the other guy's fault.

84
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,860
He was driving like a maniac.

85
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,927
- Son, you all right?
- I don't know.

86
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,659
I think you dislocated your hip.

87
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,770
- Are they okay?
- Who?

88
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:15,272
- Aah! In the other car.
- Yeah, yeah. Don't move for now, okay?

89
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,009
- What's your name?
- Dwayne.

90
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,708
Dwayne.

91
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,614
Take a deep breath.

92
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,482
- It hurts.
- Stridor.

93
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,487
- How bad is that?
- Ouch.

94
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,684
His collarbone may be broken. The
fracture is compressing his windpipe.

95
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,022
Can't breathe.

96
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,330
- Can you help him?
- I'll be right back.

97
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,335
Wait. Don't leave us here.

98
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,373
Adult with a posterior hip dislocation
and a kid with a compromised airway.

99
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,009
Paramedic ETA is less than five.

100
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,169
- I thought I had a toolkit.
- I can't believe you did this.

101
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,338
- I need pliers.
- Pliers?

102
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,014
I have to elevate the
depressed clavicle fracture.

103
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,380
How about a suture kit?

104
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,653
Hold on.

105
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,718
Dwayne?

106
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,386
He's starting to pass out.

107
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,532
Wake up, Dwayne.

108
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,698
This might hurt a little.

109
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,599
- You gonna give him something?
- I don't have drugs with me.

110
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,572
- Shouldn't we wait for the paramedics?
- He's not getting any air. Scalpel.

111
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,343
- You should sit down.
- I'm okay.

112
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,676
Plastics set, 15
blade. I'm okay.

113
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,977
- Wake up, son. Wake up, son.
- Don't move him.

114
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,254
Oh, God.

115
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,789
Gauze.

116
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,586
- You want the Kelly or the needle driver?
- Kelly clamp.

117
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,388
Radial pulse is pretty thready.

118
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,095
I need a tenaculum
or a towel clip.

119
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,103
- Wait, they're here.
- They don't have surgical instruments.

120
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,639
He's getting cyanotic.
- Out of the way!

121
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,071
He's an ER doc.

122
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,542
Possible dislocated hip
there, airway obstruction here.

123
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,221
Okay, take him.

124
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,780
- We should get cleaned up.
- I'm fine.

125
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,530
Looks like 43 got the call too.

126
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,600
- There's some saline and Kerlix over here.
- Okay.

127
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,329
- Did you get the guys in the other car?
- It was just us.

128
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,639
Us?

129
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,106
Erin?

130
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,008
- Weak radial pulse.
- Any other injuries?

131
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,640
She was complaining of right-side
pain. Maybe a lacerated liver.

132
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,655
She needs two liters of saline
and high-flow O2. Hurry up.

133
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,690
- Who was driving?
- I was.

134
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,658
- Squeeze my hand.
- Pressure's down to 90 systolic.

135
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,560
- Pulse ox, 86.
- Turn it up to six liters.

136
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,746
- How far are we?
- About six minutes.

137
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,961
Roads are pretty icy.

138
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,864
I can't hear anything.

139
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,803
- Give me an 18-gauge angiocath.
- She already has two IVs.

140
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,003
- I think it's a tension pneumo.
- Take it easy. Only a few minutes.

141
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,478
I'm gonna needle her
chest. Give me the angiocath.

142
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,810
You've suffered a head
injury, I don't think...

143
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,885
- Then you do it.
- No way.

144
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,384
She's gonna arrest.

145
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,455
- Danny, want me to pull over?
- No. Keep going.

146
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,559
Come on, man, don't.

147
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,363
Sats are up to 92.

148
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,589
- It's not your fault.
- I should have been more careful.

149
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,031
Can you slow down?
These things happen.

150
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,434
Two months in the ER doesn't
make you an expert, okay?

151
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,574
I'm upset too. It's not just
you. Please slow down.

152
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,337
These things don't just happen.
Not if you know what you're doing.

153
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,710
Okay, pull over. Let me out.

154
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,442
Luka!

155
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,519
Luka, they're ready
for Jane in the O.R.

156
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,686
Okay. Thanks.

157
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,889
Don't you want to talk to them?

158
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,933
It's okay. You do it.

159
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,900
Okay. So we're gonna
take you upstairs now...

160
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,203
and the surgeons are
gonna remove the clot.

161
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,404
- Is the other doctor here?
- Who? Dr. Kovac?

162
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,379
- The cute one?
- Dr. Chen, have you seen Luka?

163
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,212
On his way out.

164
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,884
Will you thank him for us? He
made them give Jane the CT.

165
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,250
- Sure.
- Thanks.

166
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,991
What, are you just gonna leave?

167
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,094
My shift's almost over.
Anyway, it wasn't my shift.

168
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,829
- What's going on, Luka?
- I'm fine.

169
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,937
- I'll be fine.
- Not about you.

170
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,077
What you do outside of
this hospital, that's up to you.

171
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:21,442
Not when it starts preventing you from
doing your job. When it hurts patients.

172
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,914
Do you even care?

173
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,749
Do you even care that that kid is
lying out there as good as dead?

174
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,746
Hey, Luka.

175
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,976
Luka.

176
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,643
Hey...

177
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,155
can we get some
coffee or something?

178
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,055
- Dr. Lewis said I should go.
- I need some sleep.

179
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,828
Yeah, but I could use the
company. I thought you might too.

180
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:16,163
- I'm sorry about in the elevator.
- It's okay. It's a crappy day.

181
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,131
Maybe I gave you the
wrong idea last night.

182
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,001
Not at all.

183
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,375
Well, good night then.

184
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:29,274
Hey... can I at
least get a ride?

185
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,820
Did RT adjust the
vent after the last ABG?

186
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,354
Crit's up to 19
with two units in.

187
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,687
- Sats?
- 89 on 100 percent with five of PEEP.

188
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,987
How long was he waiting?

189
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,195
I'm not sure.

190
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,357
Abby?

191
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,701
Harkins, you should go home.

192
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,430
Isn't there something
else I can do?

193
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,700
Not right now.

194
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,504
Okay.

195
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,445
Luka thought he had the flu.

196
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,247
He listened over the
stomach after intubation?

197
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,015
- I don't know.
- Did he use the end-tidal CO2 detector?

198
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,521
I don't know, Susan.

199
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,093
He would have had another
few years. Ten if he was lucky.

200
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,025
He was a lot sicker
than he seemed.

201
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,391
It doesn't matter.

202
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,227
He was a lot sicker than
anyone would have known.

203
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,599
Betadine the neck. More suction.

204
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,240
- It's as high as it goes.
- It's way too much blood.

205
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,741
- Eleven blade.
- Forget it. Bag him.

206
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,038
Number seven sterile gloves.

207
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,307
Skin hook. Suction here.

208
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,713
- Damn it.
- Pulse ox only 72.

209
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,980
- Hemostat.
- Seventy of lidocaine.

210
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,556
- Two by two's.
- Multifocal PVCs.

211
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,224
- I can't see.
- Pulse ox, 68.

212
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,067
Stabilizing the tube.
Susan, give me the bag.

213
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,766
Run of five.

214
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,971
You're in the
pre-tracheal space.

215
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,082
Trousseau dilator. Fresh Shiley.
- Heart rate down to 40.

216
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,684
- Amp of atropine. Open crash cart.
- That a seizure?

217
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,244
Decerebrate posturing.

218
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,946
- Got it.
- Platelets are here.

219
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,591
Squeeze them in.

220
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,325
Easy to bag.

221
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,597
- Go ahead.
- The posturing, is it cerebral hypoxia?

222
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,260
So it's brain damage?

223
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,440
- I'll talk to the girlfriend.
- I'll do it.

224
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,269
- Luka.
- I said, I'll do it.

225
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,143
Leukemia?

226
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,147
He didn't know he had it.

227
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,216
Nobody did.

228
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,860
If we'd sent off
a CBC earlier...

229
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:00,733
we could have started the
transfusion and antibiotics on time.

230
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,234
But now he's showing
signs of brain damage...

231
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,465
because he was deprived
of oxygen for too long.

232
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,446
Isn't it possible he
could still get better?

233
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,178
- It's unlikely.
- But it's not impossible, right?

234
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,217
No, it's not impossible.

235
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,025
We waited out here for so
long before they took us in.

236
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,388
- I know.
- So many people got seen before us.

237
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:32,521
- Why did we have to wait so long?
- He should have received better care.

238
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,972
Do you believe in God?

239
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:47,041
Do you believe he
punishes people?

240
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,841
It wasn't God.

241
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,111
Would you pray with me?

242
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,984
I would feel better if
you prayed with me.

243
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,424
I can get the hospital chaplain.

244
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,051
Get a post-intubation film
and a blood gas in 20 minutes.

245
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,781
- Sats are dropping.
- That's okay.

246
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,722
Give them a minute.
They'll come up.

247
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,555
You look tired.

248
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,992
- Do you want some coffee?
- No.

249
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,191
- This is your flu kid?
- Pulmonary edema. I had to intubate.

250
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,496
- PVCs. Pulse ox is 68.
- Something's not right.

251
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,031
There's a lot of resistance.

252
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,305
Damn. Pull out the tube.
You're in the esophagus.

253
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,138
I heard bilateral breath sounds.

254
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,678
Must have been transmitted.
Listen over the stomach.

255
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,442
- Couldn't you see the cords?
- It was hard to tell.

256
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,116
Bag him up.

257
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,689
Maybe the tube moved
when the nurses taped it in.

258
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,887
- Open another 8.0 ET tube.
- Pulse ox up to 80.

259
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,259
- Luka, do you want me to do this?
- No. Let's go.

260
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,262
- Oh, my God.
- What?

261
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,134
Yankauer. Too much blood.

262
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,044
- CBC's back.
- Go on.

263
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,772
White blood count's 85,000
with 60 percent blasts.

264
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,974
- He's got acute leukemia.
- What?

265
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,881
- Platelets.
- Twelve thousand.

266
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,955
No wonder he's bleeding so
much. Hang two units, type specific.

267
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,922
Cross another four. Platelets
and FFP. Blood cultures done?

268
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,788
Not yet.

269
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,591
He's septic. Bag him. Set up the
fiber-optic and open up a crike kit.

270
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,633
We're gonna have to crike him?

271
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:54,071
There was no indication of leukemia.
He presented with a simple fever.

272
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,232
It didn't look like anything.

273
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,345
An operation could save that
girl, but we have to catch it in time.

274
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,575
I'm sorry, I should
have pushed her ahead.

275
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,914
I need to know that when I ask
you to do something, it'll get done.

276
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,680
Okay.

277
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,451
Whatever happens outside the hospital
doesn't change anything when at work.

278
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,688
Is this about last night?

279
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,126
I'm just trying to
get through the shift.

280
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,697
How are his sats?

281
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,929
RT's coming. Only 82.
What took you so long?

282
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,269
I had a patient who needed a CT
and I wanted to let the Lasix work.

283
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,105
All right. Chen needs
Versed in 3. I'll be right there.

284
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,179
- He's not responding. KOVAC:
Push the induction meds.

285
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,476
Rick, I have to put
a tube in your throat.

286
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,142
- How come?
- To give him more oxygen.

287
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,448
- Call my folks, okay?
- You're gonna be just fine.

288
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,286
When you wake up, a machine
will be breathing for you.

289
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,954
- You won't be able to talk.
- If you need money, hock the ring.

290
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,862
- Shut up. MARQUEZ:
Twenty in. Sux too.

291
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,331
- He's frothing.
- Suction.

292
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,375
- What's going on?
- Pulse ox down to 80.

293
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,643
- Can't see anything.
- Cricoid pressure.

294
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,149
Is something going wrong?

295
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,048
He's too anterior.

296
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,357
- What are you doing?
- It'll help me reach the cords.

297
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,224
- Pressure's down to 75.
- What's happening?

298
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:29,893
- Chuny, maybe Abby can help.
- Let's take a walk, okay? This way.

299
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,566
Start dopamine,
10 mics per kilo.

300
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,214
There. Bag him
and call for a vent.

301
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,257
- You should dress like that every day.
- Why not? You dress like a doctor.

302
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,452
I need my tox screen
back on the girl in 2.

303
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,224
- Where'd we put the tinsel last year?
- In the drug lockup, behind the Viagra.

304
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,766
- Hey, what happened to my menorah?
- We had a security breach.

305
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,530
Bring the food poisoning from Triage.
- Already got it.

306
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,231
This is bad, Frank. A menorah
has great symbolic value.

307
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,434
- Do you know what it represents?
- Anyone taken the GERD in Exam 4?

308
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,602
- Yeah, yeah. Eight crazy nights.
- Hello?

309
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,873
I was going to
say "our liberation."

310
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,880
- You're Jewish?
- Converted.

311
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,882
- Like Sammy Davis, Jr?
- Right.

312
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,247
Can I help you, sir?

313
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,254
I'm investigating an assault on
a man who was brought in here.

314
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,324
Vladko Dor...?

315
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,619
- Dorick?
- Dorich.

316
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,593
- You take care of him?
- Yeah. We both did.

317
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,462
There was also another older
man, might be his attacker.

318
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,729
- That's what the daughter told me.
- I don't remember.

319
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,567
- Me either. ABBY: Luka,
do you have a minute?

320
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,974
This is a serious matter. Dorich is
almost 80 years old. He could have died.

321
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,673
Yeah, but he didn't, and we
don't remember any other old guy.

322
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,318
- You mind if I look around?
- Sure.

323
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,011
Hey, treat yourself.

324
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,986
I did a HemoCue
on Rick Kendrick.

325
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,353
His hemoglobin's
5.2. It's way too low.

326
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,755
- A capillary sample?
- Pulled from his purple top.

327
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,762
- Did you draw above the IV site?
- Luka.

328
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:10,296
It's from his angiocath before he had
fluid. He needs cultures and a workup.

329
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,863
- Dr. Kovac.
- Do another HemoCue.

330
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,473
- Type and cross?
- She's seizing.

331
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,611
Just check the CBC and
hold the clot for the blood bank.

332
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,977
- What's happening to her?
- Push four of Ativan.

333
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,448
- She's not breathing.
- Okay, let's bag her. Open a crash cart.

334
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,587
She bit her tongue.

335
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,454
- Why is she still here?
- CT said they were backed up.

336
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,116
- I was waiting for them to call.
- How long were you planning to wait?

337
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,491
Jane?

338
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,397
- She's postictal.
- Honey, I'm here.

339
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,464
Call CT and tell them
I'm bringing her up.

340
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,466
Luka. Pulmonary edema.

341
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,867
Are you coming?

342
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,542
Pulse ox down to 78.

343
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,804
Pressure's 100 systolic.

344
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,313
Okay. Put him on
100-percent non-rebreather.

345
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,016
- Wet crackles throughout.
- What does that mean?

346
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,157
- Your lungs are filled with fluid.
- What's that mean?

347
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,888
I'm not sure yet, but
the oxygen should help.

348
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,085
One nitro spray
and push 40 of Lasix.

349
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,093
- Should I go ahead without you?
- Coming.

350
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,494
- You're not leaving, are you?
- Be right back.

351
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,828
- Etomidate and sux?
- Have it ready.

352
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,166
I have two criticals ahead
of her, and after that...

353
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,140
Have to do it now. She had a seizure
in the ER while we've been waiting.

354
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:27,411
Dr. Kovac, you are not the
only doctor in the hospital.

355
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,948
Meanwhile, you were playing up
here with a TIA who's clinically stable...

356
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,051
and a drunk with
a simple scalp lac.

357
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,747
- His doctor reported he was acting odd.
- It's called eggnog.

358
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:41,690
This is an 11-year-old girl who could have
an epidural bleed and might need surgery.

359
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:46,357
- Doesn't look like a head trauma.
- She's got ataxia and a positive Romberg.

360
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,864
- Mrs. Gallagher on deck?
- No.

361
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,162
- Yes.
- This is Jane Irby. She's next.

362
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,484
I don't get sick much.

363
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,641
He says he doesn't
get sick much.

364
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,209
Good. Then you
should rebound fast.

365
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,243
- You taking any medications?
- Just vitamins.

366
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,449
Deep breath.

367
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,050
- Pressure's up to 100 after a liter.
- Okay, sounds good.

368
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,884
He might need another two.

369
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,552
His parents are coming for the
holidays, and I need to clean up our place.

370
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,961
It's the first time
I'm meeting them.

371
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,992
- Okay if she leaves?
- I don't think you'll be here long.

372
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:26,070
- She should stay if you need medicine.
- Medicine?

373
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:30,805
Pain meds, anti-nausea agents.
They can make you lightheaded.

374
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,338
Okay. I'll be right back.

375
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,149
Hey.

376
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:42,253
- What do you want?
- CBC, dip a urine, and chest x-ray.

377
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,253
No HemoCue?

378
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,616
- He's looking pretty pasty.
- No. He just needs to be hydrated.

379
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,264
- Are we okay?
- About what?

380
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,592
Last night.

381
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,937
In the bedroom?

382
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,507
Did I do something stupid?

383
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,709
- You don't remember?
- Had a couple of drinks.

384
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,871
A couple of dozen.

385
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,112
Okay, as long
as we're all right.

386
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:18,385
- Let me know when his CBC's back.
- I'm concerned, all right?

387
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,493
He's got the flu, Abby.
You worry too much.

388
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,498
You may need some 6.0 nylons.

389
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,727
Doc, you're not gonna
press charges, are you?

390
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,099
You punched me in the face.

391
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:35,764
- What happened?
- A vicious midget.

392
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,136
Hey.

393
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:40,609
This is Laura Ruiz, Rick
Kendrick's girlfriend. Dr. Kovac.

394
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,509
Thank you for
looking after Rick.

395
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,583
- Doc, I was just reaching up.
- With a clenched fist?

396
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,688
I'm 4'11". My fists
are always clenched.

397
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,348
Come on, Luka.
Let's get you fixed up.

398
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,858
You can't be sick. Your
parents are here tomorrow.

399
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,496
I know. I'm sorry, babe.

400
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,292
We don't think you're gonna
have to stay here overnight.

401
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:03,527
His parents are kind of
scary. They're lawyers.

402
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,471
They think we're too
young to get hitched.

403
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,370
- Look. He gave this to me in the library.
- Wow.

404
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,875
- Mm-hm. Modern philosophy.
- Level-C stacks.

405
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,405
- Don't tell her it's cubic zirconium.
- Shut up. It is not.

406
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,211
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

407
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:21,377
I'm 20.

408
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,078
Older women.

409
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,421
- We met in church.
- So when's the date?

410
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,256
New Year's Eve. We're
gonna elope. Reno.

411
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,754
No time like the present, right?

412
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,334
Congratulations.

413
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:40,064
- Shouldn't you be gone by now?
- I keep trying to leave.

414
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,639
Mm. One of those days, huh?

415
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,572
You know, I learned
a valuable lesson:

416
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:48,373
Never host a party when you
have to work the next morning.

417
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,582
- Are you here through the holidays?
- Yeah. You?

418
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,480
Yeah. I guess so.

419
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:58,147
We're pretty short-handed. Seems
like everyone's got someplace to go...

420
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,487
so us single people
get the short straw.

421
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,155
Couples, people with
kids, they all get to take off.

422
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:11,167
- We have to stay and mind the store.
- Yeah. I don't care.

423
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,534
Christmas. It's not what
it's supposed to be anyway.

424
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,197
No?

425
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,771
Back home it was different.

426
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,745
We'd take the kids sleigh-riding,
cut down our own tree.

427
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,111
My wife...

428
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:29,716
made the fish the night before,
and then turkey for Christmas Day.

429
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,823
Sounds perfect.

430
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,917
Yeah.

431
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:39,555
Wound edges aren't under tension
so I'd keep those in for five days.

432
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:43,600
If you're not doing anything next week,
I'm having people over for Christmas.

433
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,237
Your orphan friends?

434
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:49,535
Just some folks who can't
get home or don't want to.

435
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,106
Rick Kendrick's BP's down to 80.

436
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,745
- Who?
- Your flu kid.

437
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,643
- Oh, put him into a room.
- Already did.

438
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,784
Then give him saline wide open.

439
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,476
He's been waiting all morning.

440
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,486
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

441
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:07,592
- You should think about joining us, Luka.
- I will. Thanks.

442
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,319
Six liters by nasal cannula,
and let's get an ABG.

443
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,489
- That man, I want him arrested.
- Hey, you just take it easy.

444
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,294
Bilateral rales halfway up.

445
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,666
- Any chest pain?
- No. I take aspirin every day.

446
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,808
Oh, good for you. WOMAN: Dad?

447
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,071
- You okay? Was it a mugging?
- I don't know. It happened so fast.

448
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:30,512
- We need to redo the portable chest.
- We need to step out for a minute.

449
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,174
- Come right back. I need you here.
- I will.

450
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,513
Continue his nitro drip and
push another 80 of Lasix.

451
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:43,860
- Did they catch whoever did this?
- He was brought by paramedics.

452
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,193
- He says he knew your dad from before...
- Not important what he says.

453
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,959
- He's not thinking clearly.
- But he's here?

454
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,866
You're helping the
person who hurt my father?

455
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,472
That's our job too.

456
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,506
He brutalized a
harmless old man.

457
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,702
Someone like that
doesn't deserve your help.

458
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,404
You can wait here till they
are done with the x-rays.

459
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,776
What are you doing?
Why not just give it up?

460
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:10,184
- He's 80 years old, Pratt.
- Doesn't mean we should help him lie.

461
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,721
The past is past.
Can't outrun it.

462
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,223
- He's doing a good job.
- Yeah. Until today.

463
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,157
- That's it, you're out of here.
- You started it, fat-ass.

464
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,560
- We want to see our buddy.
- Put down the menorah.

465
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,723
- What's going on?
- Let us see our friend.

466
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,233
- Don't you have reindeer to milk?
- That's it.

467
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,900
Hey, Abby. Fifty mgs of
captopril for the old guy in 2.

468
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,671
- Nope. How about Lotensin?
- Okay. I'll ask Luka if that's okay.

469
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:37,077
- It's okay, 20 milligrams should do it.
- Okay.

470
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,586
- You practicing your suturing?
- Thanks for the kit.

471
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,154
You got home okay last night?

472
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,353
Yeah, I did.

473
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,757
You know, you should be careful.

474
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,459
About what?

475
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,260
There's a lot of
gossip around here.

476
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,768
There's nothing going on.

477
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,168
It's just, he's a doctor,
you're a med student...

478
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,606
Abby, there's nothing going on.

479
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,706
Okay.

480
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,673
But...?

481
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,385
Luka tends to not think
things through sometimes...

482
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:18,046
and I don't think it would
be good for either of you.

483
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,117
Thanks for the pill.

484
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,534
- Up the nitro to 40 mics.
- Oh.

485
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,494
- Do you need plaster for his wrist?
- Twenty of Lotensin.

486
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,000
- I asked for captopril.
- Abby said it was the same.

487
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,471
That's him. Him.

488
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,368
- Sir, calm down.
- Don't help him!

489
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,779
- You taking him up?
- CT showed a grade-three liver lac.

490
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,074
- No splenic damage?
- No, not according to the resident.

491
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,806
- He needs an e-lap to repair it.
- Shh. Shut up.

492
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,316
- You deserve to die!
- You're a madman!

493
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,045
- You're a madman.
- Sir, you're gonna have to calm down.

494
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:53,249
- That guy needs Haldol.
- Put this on. You need the oxygen.

495
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:57,419
He is crazy, you know.
Whatever he's saying.

496
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,068
- So any recent illnesses?
- Nope.

497
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:07,070
- Did you fall in the game?
- No. I think I'm okay.

498
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,299
It was just a headache.

499
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:13,534
Will you walk across
the room, please?

500
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,847
Stand feet together.
Hands out, eyes closed.

501
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,987
Nothing happened.

502
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,858
Jane...

503
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,456
this can also be a lie detector.

504
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,135
I took a hard check in
practice. My helmet flew off.

505
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,537
Coach had me sit down for a few
minutes, but I wanted to get back in.

506
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,873
- Why didn't you say so?
- My dad's really protective.

507
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,048
He'll make me stop.

508
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,342
- Neuro checks q.10 minutes.
- Mm-hm.

509
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:56,147
- And make sure she gets a CT.
- You won't tell my dad, will you?

510
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,222
Let's just get you better, okay?

511
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,594
Here's your cocoa. Sorry,
honey, no marshmallows.

512
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,329
- Hey, are you leaving now?
- No. I'll wait until she's dispo'd.

513
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,024
Okay. Do you want
me to find Dr. Chen?

514
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,136
Let's just get the
girl to CT, okay?

515
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,896
Okay.

516
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,733
- Hey.
- Hey.

517
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,967
- Hey, you ever seen a bullous myringitis?
- No. I've heard of it.

518
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:21,739
I got one in Exam 4. Take a look
at it when she gets back from X-ray.

519
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,905
- Let me know.
- All right.

520
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:28,645
- So how long did you stay at Susan's?
- Not very.

521
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,413
I missed my dance.

522
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,114
I'm sorry about that.
Next time, I promise.

523
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,421
Sure.

524
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,928
- Will the police come?
- Probably. You beat up on somebody?

525
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,897
- How's he doing?
- Mostly worried about getting ratted out.

526
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,696
They won't
understand, the police.

527
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,203
They'll put me in jail,
but I did nothing wrong.

528
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,841
- Didn't you attack Mr. Dorich?
- Yes.

529
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,443
Why would you do
something like that?

530
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,010
- Are you Jewish?
- No.

531
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,777
Still, maybe you can understand.

532
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,114
I didn't see that man
for almost 60 years...

533
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,950
then I see him on the
street, on my own street...

534
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,853
an old man now, like me.

535
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:12,357
But the face, I'll never forget.
He worked for the Ustasha.

536
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,560
The what?

537
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,668
It was like Gestapo.

538
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,635
That man, Dorich,
was our neighbor.

539
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:24,174
He told them where
to find our family.

540
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,404
I ran to the woods...

541
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,975
and I saw them coming.

542
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:35,712
But Mama, Tata, sisters, they
went away to Jasenovac camp.

543
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:37,984
I never saw them again.

544
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,918
Dr. Chen was called on
a penetrating trauma...

545
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,994
before she could do
the workup on Jane Irby.

546
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,721
The hockey girl.

547
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,923
Oh, okay. Start
her up. I'll be in.

548
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,897
- I couldn't find another doctor.
- Okay.

549
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,004
When I saw him at the bus
stop today, he was laughing.

550
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,099
I couldn't control myself.

551
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,935
How can you be so
sure it's the same guy?

552
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:04,207
Some things stay in your head
forever as they were yesterday.

553
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:09,218
Get the SonoSite, full trauma
panel, chest and AP pelvis.

554
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,721
Oh, please. I can't go to jail.

555
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,838
- Hey.
- Hi. I didn't know you were on today.

556
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,703
- Yeah. I got the call from Weaver.
- Oh, too bad for you.

557
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:35,814
Huh. Hey, so, what's the
story with Luka and Harkins?

558
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,450
- There's a story?
- They left together last night.

559
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:41,553
- She probably needed a ride home.
- They were dancing at Susan's.

560
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,985
- So? I was dancing with Yosh.
- Heh. Well...

561
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,716
Oh, hey, Luka.
So you out of here?

562
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,727
Harkins is with a girl in 3 you
might want to keep an eye on.

563
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,559
Okay. Sure thing. See you later.

564
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,994
See, that wasn't so bad.

565
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,499
Couple hours saving lives
and back on the streets.

566
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,837
- I feel like crap.
- You don't look so great either.

567
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,235
Thanks a lot.

568
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,967
Evo Gutter, picked up after
getting sideswiped by a bus.

569
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,977
Bystander said he was
running away from an altercation.

570
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,911
- Why were you running, sir?
- Not much of a talker, this one.

571
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,347
His last name is
Gutter? Is he Croatian?

572
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,190
- He doesn't want the police.
- Okay, Trauma 1 open. I'll be right there.

573
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,259
You had better go before you get
sucked back in there. Everything okay?

574
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,832
Should I stay in case that
guy doesn't speak English?

575
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,799
We're good. Go home.

576
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,853
- Where should this go?
- Oh, back in the box.

577
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,619
- What time did Luka say he was coming?
- He didn't.

578
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,558
You want us to cut
the net off this tree?

579
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,858
Not unless you
want it for next year.

580
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,364
Toberen's scan is negative.

581
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:06,027
- ENT's draining a periauricular hematoma.
- Check that they premedicate him.

582
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,868
- Sure you don't wanna meet in Boston?
- You need quality time with the old man.

583
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,873
- You'll be missed.
- Always am, right?

584
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,137
Luka, two, three hours tops.

585
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:17,282
Just get us through the rough
patch until Chen comes in.

586
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,146
- Kovac and Harkins, huh?
- I don't think so.

587
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,321
- Sure looks that way.
- She's not like that.

588
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,286
Then we got Jane Irby. She's
12, presented with a migraine.

589
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:29,485
Father brought her from hockey practice.
Needs an H & P and dose of Compazine.

590
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,061
- Want to scan her?
- Your call.

591
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,893
Then Casey is the foul-mouthed
drunk and one who fell off the night train.

592
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,297
- Saw him last week.
- He got thiamine and sutures.

593
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,234
He needs to sober up, wake
up, and get the hell out of here.

594
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,806
- How are you doing?
- A little tired.

595
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,840
Serves you right for being a
party animal. Thanks for coming in.

596
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,844
Not my choice. Anything else?

597
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,142
Yeah. College kid in
Curtain 2. Rick Kendrick.

598
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,285
Looks like influenza,
but I'd check it out.

599
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,283
- You seen him?
- Just his triage note.

600
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,013
- Where are you headed?
- Promised my father a couple days.

601
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,749
- Everything all right?
- It's his first Christmas alone.

602
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,518
Have a good trip.

603
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,261
Bye.

604
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:11,459
- Hey. Are you taking over now?
- Yeah.

605
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,464
I feel much better. I don't think I
need anything. I'm gonna tough it out.

606
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,838
Stick around till we're sure.
We'll get to you soon, okay?

607
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,946
- Hey, what do you think?
- Don't know if you're the Santa type.

608
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,213
- What? Too sexy?
- Triage's packed. Mission's on diversion.

609
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,982
- Can Carter stay on?
- No, he's catching a plane at 10.

610
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:35,627
I have to get upstairs for
an administration meeting.

611
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,558
- Who's available to come in?
- Nobody.

612
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,631
- What about Kovac?
- Probably not a good idea.

613
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,028
Call him.

614
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,193
He looked like he was coming
down with something last night.

615
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,147
Hello.

616
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,878
Hello. Is Luka there?

617
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,157
Ahem. Yeah. He's sleeping.

618
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:10,724
- Who's this?
- Just a second.

619
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,488
Luka. Luka.

620
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,763
It's for you.

621
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:29,073
- Yeah.
- Who was that?

622
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,249
- What?
- Weaver wants you to come in today.

623
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,819
- I'm off today.
- I know, but we're swamped.

624
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,754
- It'll just be a couple of hours.
- I didn't promise that.

625
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,995
- Ahem. I can't.
- He can't.

626
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,630
Give me that.

627
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,231
<i>Get your ass in here.</i>

628
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,395
Sorry. Careful driving,
it's icy out there.

629
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,640
We shouldn't have
answered that, right?

630
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,950
Um... I don't get my present.
I don't understand what it is.

631
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,217
Well, this one
is for Dr. Carter.

632
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,257
- What's to get about edible undies?
- It's supposed to help you catch a man.

633
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,859
It's the thought that counts.

634
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,188
Whoo!

635
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,959
Furry handcuffs.

636
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,295
The gift that keeps on giving.
- You'd know.

637
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,369
- Hey, are we done?
- No. You have to open your present.

638
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,905
Oh, I've still got the rubber
sheets from last year.

639
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,488
That's where those came from.

640
00:38:30,512 --> 00:38:32,601
Earrings. I can tell.
It's earrings, right?

641
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,941
Come on. Come on. Open it up.
- Is it edible?

642
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:37,709
Oh. CARTER: Ooh.

643
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:38,906
Hmm.

644
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,985
- A snow globe.
- Oh. It's pretty.

645
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,621
Who gave it?

646
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,254
Well, I guess your Santa
will have to stay a secret.

647
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,985
Um... Susan, where'd
you put my coat?

648
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,493
You're not leaving, are you?

649
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,894
I got to work tonight. - Oh.

650
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,289
Merry Christmas.

651
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,464
- Ciao.
- Happy New Year.

652
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,739
- Hi.
- Hi.

653
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,967
- Going?
- Yeah. It's getting late.

654
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,609
Ooh. Somebody
knows you pretty well.

655
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,241
What'd you get?

656
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,087
You all right?

657
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,992
We don't talk much anymore.

658
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,830
Like we don't know what to say.

659
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,060
Well, we should fix that.

660
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,671
We could get a cup
of coffee or something.

661
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,810
You could come over for dinner.
Carter orders up a mean pizza.

662
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,717
- Miss you, Abby.
- Um...

663
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:50,353
Okay. I'm gonna
take a wild guess here:

664
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:51,817
You've been drinking.

665
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,489
So?

666
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,730
So maybe we should talk
about this some other time.

667
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,397
You don't look happy.

668
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,634
- I'm happy.
- That's good.

669
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,334
I want you to be happy.
I'm saying that if you're not...

670
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,104
I should go.

671
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:22,745
I made mistakes.
A lot of mistakes.

672
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,648
Don't make another one.

673
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,557
- Ready to go?
- Yep.

674
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,164
- Luka, missing all the fun.
- Yeah. You should stay.

675
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,027
Gotta go.

676
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,169
- Are you working tomorrow?
- No.

677
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,532
- Lucky for you.
- Lucky for the patients.

678
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,638
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

679
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,172
Merry Christmas.

680
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,151
Hey.

681
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,020
It's a party. You're supposed
to hang out with people.

682
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,851
You know, I thought someone
was maybe buried under these coats.

683
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:04,354
- Dr. Lewis has the dance floor going.
- Luka don't dance.

684
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:07,021
Come on. Show me some
of those Croatian moves.

685
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,128
Maybe in a minute, okay?

686
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:13,732
Okay, well, I'm not
going anywhere.

687
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:28,242
- Where's the bedroom?
- Whoa. You go too fast.

688
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:32,379
- Let's talk sweet nothings first.
- You need to go to sleep.

689
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,784
- Hey, Erin?
- Yeah?

690
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,227
You are a very pretty girl.

691
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:08,089
You know, if you're trying to seduce
me, this is a very unconventional approach.

692
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,727
Really?

693
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:14,657
- You're supposed to get the girl drunk.
- I thought you were.

694
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,462
The bedroom?

695
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,300
I think it's up there. Heh.

696
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:31,305
- You staying here tonight?
- I'm gonna sleep on the couch.

697
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:36,511
- There's more room in the bed.
- Oh, there always is.

698
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,815
- No, no. I can do it.
- I got it.

699
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,019
You don't have to
work tomorrow, right?

700
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,992
No, no. No work.

701
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,495
That's good.

702
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,199
Why do you want to be a doctor?

703
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:56,967
I don't know. Good at science.

704
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:02,640
I became a doctor
to take care of people.

705
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,841
To heal them.

706
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,491
You do. Every day.

707
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:24,097
But strangers. Only strangers.

708
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,198
And not tomorrow.

709
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,742
Systolic's only 60.

710
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,850
Free fluid in Morrison's pouch
and the right pericolic gutter.

711
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:43,112
Probable liver
laceration. Page Trauma.

712
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,722
Pulse, 140. Sats are down to 78.

713
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,860
- Put her in Trendelenburg.
- Ten blade and a 32 French.

714
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,291
Dr. Kovac, what happened?

715
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,294
She needed a ride home.
