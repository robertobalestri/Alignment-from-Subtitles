1
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,119
Ready? KOVAC: Yeah.

2
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,135
Good afternoon, everyone.

3
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:40,001
Welcome to another fun-filled
Morbidity and Mortality.

4
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:44,235
All right, medical
record number 549274.

5
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,039
"R.K. was a previously
healthy 19-year-old male...

6
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:51,208
who presented with fever,
myalgias and a temperature of 102.4.

7
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,913
CBC revealed a white blood count
of 85,000 with 60 percent blasts...

8
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,819
consistent with acute
myelogenous leukemia.

9
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,189
The attending
physician, Dr. Kovac."

10
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,575
- Need some help?
- No. I got it.

11
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,085
Stay out of this room for
a few days though, okay?

12
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,722
No paint fumes. Okay?

13
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,118
Are you nesting?

14
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,556
I'm painting a room.

15
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,457
Nesting.

16
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,621
Don't you have to go to work?

17
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:16,634
Chicago's toughest firefighter braves
burning buildings and dirty diapers.

18
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,669
- Get out of here.
- Hey!

19
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,035
I hope you don't
treat the baby like that.

20
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,177
You drew bloods, but didn't
send them for two hours?

21
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,008
We were swamped. And the
man looked like he had the flu.

22
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,117
I told her we can't do big
workups on every kid with the flu.

23
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,652
Something all doctors
say at one time or another.

24
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,552
The intubation
problem. Dr. Lewis?

25
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:45,856
Because of the thrombocytopenia,
there was hemorrhage in the hypopharynx.

26
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,696
- We attempted...
- But could you see the cords, Dr. Kovac?

27
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,534
No.

28
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,938
Dr. Kovac felt he'd performed
an endotracheal intubation.

29
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,839
"Felt"?

30
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,311
He listened for breath sounds.

31
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
Did he use an end-tidal
C02 detector to verify?

32
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,846
- When I walked into the trauma room...
- I made a series of critical errors...

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,148
including depriving
the patient of oxygen.

34
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,884
I refused to let Dr. Lewis take over
and proceeded to put the Shiley...

35
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,459
in the pre-tracheal space.

36
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,530
The only thing I didn't do was
put a bag over the guy's head...

37
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,361
- and hit him with a brick.
- We're not assigning guilt.

38
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,869
In a teaching hospital, we learn from
complicated cases and their outcomes.

39
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,998
I had two hours sleep. I was hung-over.
I should have admitted I couldn't work...

40
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,010
but I didn't. I was
sloppy and arrogant.

41
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:35,013
Abby warned me the boy
was sick, and I ignored her.

42
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,879
So fire me, take my
license, shoot me, whatever.

43
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,146
But let's just not pretend
there's anything to learn here.

44
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,187
I killed him.

45
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,990
The patient isn't dead.

46
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,992
Did anyone bother to verify that there
really are medical schools in Croatia?

47
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,896
Anyone?

48
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,005
Don't let Romano get to
you. It only encourages him.

49
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,912
They were more than fair.

50
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,916
I appreciate you
standing up for me.

51
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,520
I told the truth.

52
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,919
You tried to cover for
me. You didn't have to.

53
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,059
It could have
been any one of us.

54
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,090
Time to get back to work.

55
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,630
You think I still work here?

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,895
- Yeah, your shift started 20 minutes ago.
- Check with Weaver.

57
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,705
She just asked for you.

58
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,704
Twenty-eight-year-old, Chip
Mealy, insomnia times three days.

59
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,438
- He called 911 for insomnia?
- Big red taxi.

60
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,913
- Sorry.
- Also complains of obsessive thoughts.

61
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,609
Thanks. What's up,
Chip? Can't sleep?

62
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,223
I took, like, five of those
p.m. things. Nothing.

63
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,325
- Can you give me something stronger?
- Five sleeping pills?

64
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,792
- Were you trying to hurt yourself?
- No. I was trying to sleep.

65
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,558
You stopped sleeping three
days ago. Something happened?

66
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,962
Problem with my girlfriend.

67
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,797
Okay. Sit tight and we'll
get someone to talk to you.

68
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,461
- Can you give me a pill?
- No.

69
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,336
You have to talk to a
psychiatrist first, drugs second.

70
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,500
Chuny, can you call
Psych for Mr. Mealy?

71
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,804
- Sure.
- All right, thanks.

72
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,949
- Did you get a Beta HCG on Mrs. Wilkes?
- No.

73
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,712
- Why not?
- Ha-ha, because Mrs. Wilkes has a penis.

74
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,623
- Excuse me. Come back here.
- It's just my cell phone.

75
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,090
- I set this off every day.
- I'm just gonna look.

76
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,694
Look, I'm Dr. Pratt.

77
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,331
I told you it's my cell
phone. Now I have patients.

78
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,662
- Let me look inside the bag.
- You don't need to. You're new, right?

79
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,327
- Doctors just get to go through, okay?
- It's not okay.

80
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,268
You hear what I
said? Don't touch me.

81
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,772
Hey, hey, knock it off.
It's okay. He's a doctor.

82
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,376
- He set off the metal detector, all right?
- Okay. What's the deal?

83
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,782
Look, I was gonna
give it to a real cop.

84
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,884
I found it outside behind the
garbage can on my way inside.

85
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,685
I figured somebody must
have stashed it coming in here...

86
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,352
and planned on picking
it up later after they left.

87
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,895
You have a license for this?

88
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,828
I told you I found it.

89
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,695
Well, I'm not gonna
leave it outside.

90
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,360
Sir, you're carrying a
concealed, unlicensed weapon.

91
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,005
I'll have to call
the Chicago P.D.

92
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,834
Got a drive-by here. Need a doc.

93
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,847
- Keep the damn gun.
- Where's he going?

94
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,035
Whoa, whoa. He's not going
anywhere. He works here.

95
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,307
You got the gun. Just get his
name and information, leave it at that.

96
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,415
No, no, don't move him.

97
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,416
- Airway's good.
- Name?

98
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,058
I don't know. I hired him
to cut down a dead tree.

99
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,921
- What happened?
- He was on a branch...

100
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,064
starting his chain saw and
slipped. Fell 20 feet onto my roof.

101
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,256
You drove him in?
Why didn't you call 911?

102
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,867
- I thought this would be faster.
- Pulse is 90.

103
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,402
Let's get a C-collar and a backboard.
- Where is Rico?

104
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,905
Mr. Gilman has chest pain...

105
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,168
and shortness of breath
during sex with his wife.

106
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,744
- Sex with his wife?
- BP, 130/82.

107
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,711
- How old is he?
- Ninety-three.

108
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,747
- One, two...
- Koko!

109
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,284
Dr. Kovac, could
you give us a hand?

110
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,444
- Koko!
- Sir, it's okay.

111
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,953
- Ready?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,615
- Go.
- Koko?

113
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,623
She's on her way. - Usual panel.

114
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,693
- His wife.
- Start a nitroglycerine drip.

115
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,422
- Twenty mics per minute.
- Gallant.

116
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,193
- Passing notes in class, Gallant?
- Nitro and a Foley.

117
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,427
It's from Harkins.
She's going home today.

118
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,936
I've been helping her
with her assigned reading.

119
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,870
- You still need me?
- No.

120
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,442
Oh, but could you check...

121
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,943
- post-intubation film in ICU?
- Patient's name?

122
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,444
Exposed bone.

123
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,606
Multiple abrasions
to scalp and face.

124
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,719
- I asked if they knew what to do.
- You speak Spanish?

125
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,218
No.

126
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,118
Oh, my God, this is bad. I
have to go call my husband.

127
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,887
Pelvis is stable but very tender
at the ASIS. Probably a fracture.

128
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,125
Dr. Pratt, these guys keep
insisting that we come get you.

129
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,427
Prep the chest and
open a 32 French.

130
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,002
I understand you blew off
Officer Robbins, Dr. Pratt.

131
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,834
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Jerry, page Ortho and Surgery...

132
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,500
and keep the militia out? Get someone
who speaks more Spanish than we do.

133
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,145
- I need to speak with him.
- Out.

134
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,508
Okay, guys. Come on. Let's go.

135
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,411
It's not what you think.

136
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,324
- Chip. Chip, it can't be that bad.
- It is.

137
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,021
- Nobody's come to talk to you yet?
- No. I just wanna go to sleep.

138
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,860
- I'll see what's keeping them.
- The design is flawed.

139
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,769
Should be a straight
line from the door...

140
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,313
Where you going?
What are you doing?

141
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,939
Wow. Your face is
beautiful. Is it square?

142
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,972
I never know what that means.

143
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,839
It's not true mathematically, but your
face is quadrant enough to be square.

144
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,208
Sorry. She's one
of my Mathletes.

145
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,782
Anastasia, you're gonna have to
go and sit with the rest of the team.

146
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,715
- Mathlete?
- Yeah. She's on the math team.

147
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,985
They compete in
math tournaments.

148
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:46,024
Oh, yeah. We used to call
them geeks. What's she on?

149
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,320
Tox screen hasn't come back yet.

150
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,363
How many cubic inches in the ER?

151
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,298
Is, uh, my face square?

152
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,675
Hi. I'm looking for a portable
chest film on Moriguchi.

153
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,743
Dr. Weaver coming back up?

154
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,572
She's a little busy.

155
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,885
You should pull the
tube back 2 centimeters.

156
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,546
Just write the order.

157
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,056
- How's Kendrick doing?
- Who?

158
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,718
Teenager. Presented
with flu but it was leukemia.

159
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,730
They think he
needs dialysis now.

160
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,338
Mrs. Kendrick? I'm Dr. Kovac. I
treated Rick when he first came to the ER.

161
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,042
I've wanted to meet you.

162
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,920
I'm so sorry about your son.

163
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,536
He was such a funny kid.

164
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,769
He'd have been a good man.

165
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,407
- Did he know about the leukemia?
- No.

166
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,552
By the time the tests came
back, he was unconscious.

167
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,650
- Was he afraid?
- I don't think so.

168
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,955
As he was going under with
the medicine, he made a joke.

169
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,932
He smiled and told Laura she
could sell her engagement ring...

170
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,128
if she needed the money.

171
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,829
That's Rick.

172
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,175
A little humor to get
him through the day.

173
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,403
Dr. Kovac?

174
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,640
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

175
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,953
What are you doing, M
and M with the mother?

176
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,495
- She wanted to know how her son died.
- Peacefully. Leave it at that.

177
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,690
She deserves to know... - What?

178
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:12,167
What, the truth? The truth is you
killed her son. You gonna tell her that?

179
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,833
The word you're looking
for is "no." Come here.

180
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,515
You wanna flagellate yourself in
front of colleagues, that's one thing.

181
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,653
But you admit guilt to this
woman and who suffers? Huh?

182
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,017
Huh? Not you. What's she
gonna do, take your car?

183
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,718
Her lawyer slaps the county and hospital
with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.

184
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,727
Our premiums skyrocket, and
where's that money come from?

185
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,856
Cutbacks in personnel and essential
equipment, affect whom? The patients.

186
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,995
You control your emotions or you will
harm more patients than just this one.

187
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,176
I'll tell you what. You're
off the rest of the day.

188
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,676
I'm fine. ROMANO: Go home.

189
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,043
Oh, and if I see you with this
patient's family again, you're fired.

190
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,684
Look, I know you're on the edge.
Not sleeping makes you feel crazy.

191
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,489
I know how that is.
But Psych's backed up.

192
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,599
We can't give you any meds
until someone's seen you.

193
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,702
It's a liability thing because
you took pills earlier.

194
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,774
I know it wasn't a
suicide attempt, but...

195
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:19,798
Oh, God.

196
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,139
We'll get you something
to help you sleep soon.

197
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,540
Everyone will hate me.

198
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,048
Why?

199
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,179
Why will everyone hate you?

200
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,589
Did you do something?

201
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,389
To your girlfriend?

202
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,623
No.

203
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,562
What?

204
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,896
What happened?

205
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,234
She walked in on me.

206
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,973
With someone else?
Another woman?

207
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,113
No.

208
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,581
- I don't think she realized.
- Another man?

209
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,455
He's only 10.

210
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,923
Who?

211
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,295
Her son.

212
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,729
You were...?

213
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:25,137
- Did you do something to him?
- No.

214
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,831
I was going to, but...

215
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,068
I would have, but she walked in.

216
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,112
I don't wanna be like this.

217
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,644
I don't know if I could
have stopped myself.

218
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,952
- What happened?
- Lost the pulse.

219
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,317
Still V-tach.

220
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,753
Charging to 300.

221
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,860
Bag him on 100 percent,
push an amp of epi.

222
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,586
Clear.

223
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,754
- Got a rhythm.
- Good femoral pulse.

224
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,991
- Welcome back, Mr. Gilman.
- His wife here?

225
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,693
- Not here yet.
- Maybe we should check on her.

226
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,701
Make sure she survived
their sexual encounter.

227
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,871
Dr. Weaver, your coat. You
brushed against some blood.

228
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,175
Get a pressure.

229
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,284
Keep him on lido,
two mgs per minute.

230
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,283
He have experience
cutting down trees?

231
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,614
Are they fresh off the boat?

232
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,952
He's only been here about two weeks.
His uncle's been in the U.S. three years.

233
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,855
Is there any family
we can call for Jose?

234
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,198
We... You're illegal.

235
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,805
Tell him anything that he needs
he can get done here, no charge.

236
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,841
Hi, Dr. Lewis again. Listen, I
know you're really backed up.

237
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,879
But I have a patient Dr. DeRaad
needs to see immediately.

238
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,175
No, don't put me on hold.

239
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,349
Hey, what are you doing? Jerry.

240
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,718
- Ah, that's my board.
- Anastasia, no. Ugh.

241
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,356
- You've erased all our patients.
- Can I write on the board too?

242
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,156
Jimmy, sit back down.

243
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,664
- Why did you do this?
- Ergo, God.

244
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,860
Ergo, Ritalin. Your blood
test says you're on Ritalin.

245
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,733
You took it for the
math competition?

246
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,205
These numbers, discovered
in different cultures...

247
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,608
in different centuries, all add to
zero, proving the universe is perfect.

248
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:17,944
Proving the existence of God.

249
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,552
Hey, I can't even
prove I paid my gas bill.

250
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,747
Jerry, just get the charts
and put all the names back up.

251
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,291
- Make her do it.
- Alphabetical or chronological?

252
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,723
Alphabetical's good.

253
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,387
Do we have any wound-care sheets?
- Yeah.

254
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,294
- So you buying me lunch today?
- Ha, no.

255
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,594
- Hey, it's your turn.
- Dr. Pratt?

256
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,237
- What does "appy" stand for?
- Appendicitis.

257
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,236
Is now a good time?

258
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,070
Sure. I don't know why you guys
are making such a big deal about this.

259
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,472
Where'd you find the gun?

260
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,978
- I told them...
- Look, I know, but he's unstable.

261
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,549
I'll walk him up
myself. Don't hang...

262
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,584
Chip? Where'd he go?

263
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,918
- Who, your weeper?
- He was just here a minute ago.

264
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,355
Oh, damn it.

265
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,969
Uh, excuse me.

266
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,941
I need the SonoSite.

267
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,479
I can't find the heartbeat.

268
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,480
Here, let me try.

269
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,953
- How many weeks?
- Fourteen.

270
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,146
I think...

271
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,293
Try a different angle.

272
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,523
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,792
- Try again.
- Okay.

274
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,133
It's not there.

275
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,338
Are you bleeding?

276
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,347
Are you bleeding?

277
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,947
A little.

278
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,252
I thought I was just spotting.

279
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,082
Do you want me to call your OB?

280
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,760
No, I think it's better
if it happens naturally.

281
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,865
Can you get me some scrubs?

282
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,769
Dr. Weaver, you should go home.

283
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:59,207
Just, um, bring me some
scrubs when you get a chance.

284
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:19,062
Hello. Um, they brought my
husband in. Daniel Gilman.

285
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,461
Uh... Um...

286
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,627
- Yeah. The 93-year-old?
- Is he all right?

287
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,535
- I'll take you to him.
- Thank you.

288
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,413
- You guys are pathetic.
- What?

289
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,313
If you stare any harder, her
ass is gonna burst into flames.

290
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,953
- I'd put that fire out.
- Stop, drop and roll.

291
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,084
He has a dilated cardiomyopathy.

292
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:48,921
We're gonna treat it very aggressively,
but the, uh, prognosis is not good.

293
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,223
He could have a fatal
arrhythmia at any time.

294
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,628
Oh. Danny.

295
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,971
Excuse me?

296
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,109
When can I bang her?

297
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,073
What did he say?

298
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,277
Uh, he wants to know when he
might be able to, ahem, have sex.

299
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,684
We're trying to have a baby.

300
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,790
Uh-huh.

301
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,654
Uh, when you can walk up, uh...

302
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,321
two flights of stairs
without getting winded...

303
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,134
go for it.

304
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,970
Okay.

305
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,209
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,106
Uh, security
needs to talk to you.

307
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,812
I'll be right there.

308
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,635
Wow.

309
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,804
Hey, that's great.

310
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,677
It's my own variation on Buckminster
Fuller's geodesic dome design.

311
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,719
Ugh. Anastasia, I told
you to wait in your chair.

312
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,913
- Sorry.
- No. It's no problem. This is...

313
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,149
- This is very cool.
- A geodesic dome...

314
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,659
Oh, um, they took Jose up to
Radiology to embolize the pelvic bleeders.

315
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,027
Triangles, squares
and rectangles.

316
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,396
What are you doing?

317
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,005
Hi. Just getting
a cup of coffee.

318
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,772
While you were in here with your Lincoln
Logs, security told me about Pratt...

319
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:51,213
- smuggling a weapon into the hospital.
- That was a misunderstanding.

320
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,750
It's an automatic suspension.

321
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,081
He found the gun in the bushes.

322
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,724
The interns are your
responsibility, Carter. I hope...

323
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,554
I know, I know. And I'm taking
care of it. Um, it's taken care of.

324
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,728
- Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
- Move.

325
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,527
- You can't leave. You didn't pay them.
- Out of my way.

326
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,068
- Damn it, stop this car.
- What do you want from me?

327
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:14,105
- I don't even know these men.
- Stop this car. Stop it.

328
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,799
- Pratt.
- You see what I'm dealing with?

329
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,309
Hey! Hey!

330
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,547
- Stupid bitch!
- What the hell are you doing?

331
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,087
- What?
- What?

332
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,226
Your patients know where she
lives. Just report it to the police.

333
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,123
- Yeah. Like they give a damn.
- Like you do?

334
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,993
Look, you come in constantly late.
You're leaving whenever you feel like it.

335
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,100
Hot-dogging patients.
Never follow orders.

336
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:46,569
- Now throwing rocks and bringing guns.
- Hey, I explained about that gun.

337
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,901
- I've seen your type before.
- No, you haven't.

338
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,134
You don't know
anything about me.

339
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,608
I know what I see.

340
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,574
Oh, yeah? What is that?

341
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,148
Someone throwing
their career away.

342
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,659
One, two, three.

343
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,627
- ID says Rosemary Bell, 18.
- Why is she in restraints?

344
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,231
She was flailing and incoherent.

345
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,459
Witness reported she collapsed,
cracked her head. LOC, one minute.

346
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,571
CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine,
Foley with dip, and ICON.

347
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,004
- Pulse, 122. BP's 86 systolic.
- She looks kind of familiar.

348
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,303
I think maybe Dr. Lewis
has treated her before.

349
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,970
Airway intact, normal cephalic.
Rosemary, follow the light.

350
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:32,744
- Sats 98.
- Rosemary, can you understand me?

351
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,547
Call X-ray. Get me a
setup and a red top.

352
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,585
Do you want me
to go get Dr. Lewis?

353
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:43,752
- Dr. Weaver?
- No. Thanks, Abby. I've got this.

354
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,432
Um, where does it hurt?

355
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,001
Yeah, your head? Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

356
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,262
Your head, yeah. And your back?

357
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,707
Here. Your kidneys?

358
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,339
Okay.

359
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,513
Burns when you pee.
What's her temperature?

360
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:07,115
- 103.2.
- She passed out because she's septic.

361
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,879
Can you read lips?

362
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,782
Good. We're going to
take care of you. Okay?

363
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,597
- No. I don't want a lady doctor.
- Jim.

364
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,633
Uh, it's nothing personal. I'm
sure you're very competent.

365
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:26,260
- I'm just old-fashioned.
- Huh. We call it sexist.

366
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,804
What about junior here?

367
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,101
- Would you take care of...?
- In a minute.

368
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,939
- Oh, forget it. I'm out of here.
- No, your leg's bleeding.

369
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,478
Let's take care of that first.

370
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,980
McNULTY: You don't deserve
to call yourselves physicians.

371
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,879
- Let him go. WILSON:
Oh, Dr. McNulty, wait.

372
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,917
McNULTY: You people
should be ashamed.

373
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,649
You've perfected a medical system that
breaks the spirit, humiliates the body...

374
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,315
- and enrages the mind.
- John.

375
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,495
- Yeah, yeah. You're a doctor?
- Thank you.

376
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:53,326
- I got a stethoscope older than you.
- Kids broke into our clinic for drugs.

377
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,161
I hid. But Mr. Former Marine
decided to take them on.

378
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,567
They're lucky my sciatica was
acting up or they'd both be in traction.

379
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,764
They hit him on the
head with a baseball bat.

380
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,341
More a bunt than a full swing.

381
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,842
He fell on broken glass and was
unconscious for several minutes.

382
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,072
- I was assessing my wounds.
- Okay, okay.

383
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,979
Then you may be seriously hurt.

384
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:17,021
- Negative Romberg, no pronator drift.
- Blunt head trauma, prolonged LOC.

385
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,287
- You need a head CT.
- For what?

386
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,361
- To rule out any brain injury.
- I told you I don't have any.

387
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,360
Then what's it
gonna hurt to check?

388
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,363
Oh, please, Jim.
Just get the CT.

389
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,095
Ten bucks says it's negative.
- You're on.

390
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,106
Abby, this is Dr. McNulty,
formerly of Curtain 2.

391
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,540
He needs a head CT,
CBC, Chem-7, urinalysis.

392
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,043
McNULTY: I didn't agree to that.

393
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,044
When was your last tetanus shot?

394
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,842
October... 1949.

395
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:49,216
Well, you might need another
one. I'll be with you in a moment.

396
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,880
Do you have to pee in a cup?
- Yes, he does.

397
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,185
Okay, start peeing, count to
three, pee a little bit in the cup...

398
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,059
- put the lid on and you're done.
- Wash my hands, right?

399
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,133
- You got it. I'll wait for you right here.
- Okay.

400
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,809
Did you dispo your tree
trimmer without my okay?

401
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,348
- I signed off to Chen.
- I was the physician of record.

402
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,480
- What's this?
- Drunk bumsicle with a head lac.

403
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,524
- Hey, I'm not throwing my career away.
- Uh-huh. Did you close the galea?

404
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:34,099
Yeah. It wasn't my gun. I was gonna
throw it in the river after my shift ended.

405
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,998
- Why didn't you do it on the way in?
- I was late.

406
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,199
Titrate five of MS and
get films on that ankle.

407
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,103
Can you give me a hand?
- In a minute.

408
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,540
- You haven't seen my insomniac?
- He went in there.

409
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,543
- Oh, thank God.
- Something wrong?

410
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,942
No. I thought he skipped.

411
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,947
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for a urine sample from a kid.

412
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,619
There's a kid in there? - Yeah.

413
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,948
- God.
- What? What's wrong?

414
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,953
- What's the matter?
- Chip? Chip Mealy?

415
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:59,837
- Hey, I'm in here.
- Unlock the door.

416
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,018
- What are you doing?
- Are you all right?

417
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,629
- I got some on my hands.
- That's okay. Let me take it.

418
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,790
Did anybody...? Did you
see anybody else in here?

419
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,628
No.

420
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,100
Okay. Go outside.

421
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,863
You want me to call Security?

422
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,132
No. Are you sure
he came in here?

423
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,401
Chip?

424
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,636
Chip?

425
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,971
Chip.

426
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:30,221
- Did you do anything to him?
- No.

427
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,551
But I wanted to.

428
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,922
Pressure's dropping.

429
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,491
Dr. Weaver, you okay?

430
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,671
- She's down to 80 systolic.
- Give her another liter.

431
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,569
Amp and gent are both finished.

432
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,112
You have a bladder infection
that spread to your kidneys.

433
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:00,844
Give her two grams cefotaxime. If
she doesn't perk up, we'll add dopamine.

434
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,712
Are you sexually active?

435
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,457
How many partners?

436
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,755
And how long has it
burned when you pee?

437
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,165
Two weeks. Why
haven't you told anyone?

438
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,096
Do you live with your parents?

439
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,867
And you don't want them to
know that you're having sex?

440
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,704
All right. Your parents
don't need to know.

441
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:29,542
But we do need to tell...

442
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,050
We need to tell
them that you're sick.

443
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,556
For at least six hours.

444
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,128
And if the antibiotics don't
work fast, it may be overnight.

445
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:48,028
It's okay. It's okay.
Haleh, take her to CT.

446
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,896
This could be more
than simple pyelo.

447
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,402
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'll talk to you when you get back.

448
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,171
Dr. Weaver, can you look at a
possible erythema nodosum?

449
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,075
- Get Carter.
- I think he's busy.

450
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,580
Then find another Attending.

451
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,423
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

452
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,927
- You can't do that in here. Will you stop?
- Don't stop.

453
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,827
- Get off of him now.
- No!

454
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,400
For crying out loud, he
just had a heart attack.

455
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,438
- Oh, relax. He needs his Viagra anyway.
- Not while he's on nitro.

456
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:30,440
- I want my Viagra.
- Only if you wanna die with an erection.

457
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,204
- No. I want my Viagra!
- Are you out of your mind?

458
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,607
He needs to recuperate.

459
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,272
- I was trying to make him feel better.
- Look, he is in critical condition.

460
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,510
What did you do to him?

461
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,712
My father did not give
her power of attorney.

462
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,017
- Procedures have to be okayed by me.
- These are Mr. Gilman's kids.

463
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:50,287
- Bob, he is really sick.
- I know. I know, honey.

464
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,725
You treating him?

465
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,765
- I'm one of the...
- I want this slut out of here now.

466
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:58,131
I have patients and no beds. He'll
have to get help as an outpatient.

467
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,737
What's wrong with his forehead?

468
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,467
He cut the word "evil" into
his skin to scare people away.

469
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,468
It's not a suicide attempt,
and he hasn't hurt anyone.

470
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,739
Fine, let's toss him your son.
- Abby.

471
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,476
He needs to be kept away from children.
Can't rehabilitate child molesters.

472
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,984
He hasn't molested anyone.

473
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:18,715
He needs medication. He
needs to be in a regular program.

474
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,258
I can't commit people
for thoughts. I can't.

475
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,488
If this guy walks out of here,
he's going to attack a child.

476
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:29,157
This is our chance to intervene,
save this guy, protect his future victims.

477
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,394
He's clearly a threat to others.

478
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,833
He has to say it.

479
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,600
If he articulates a plan,
I'll put him on a hold.

480
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,868
He won't. He's too frightened.

481
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,911
All right. I'll talk
to him again.

482
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,347
The parents and principal
will meet us at school.

483
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,248
- How far is Olney?
- Five hours.

484
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,446
Oh, I think they'll
sleep all the way.

485
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,649
- Mathletes.
- I take you were never on the math team.

486
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,624
Oh, no. I was on a real team.
I think we called it, uh, football.

487
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,990
You were a jock. Ooh.

488
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,189
Well, better to be
a jock than a nerd.

489
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,836
- Are you insinuating that I'm a nerd?
- Yeah, but you're a really hot nerd.

490
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,334
- Ha-ha.
- Phone call, Pratt.

491
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,904
All right.

492
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,042
Where's Weaver? I need some
help with this old guy's family.

493
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,008
- Koko and Captain Viagra.
- It's common knowledge that...

494
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,205
the crazier the woman,
the better the sex.

495
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,439
Just keep your head down.

496
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,416
- Try not to get stabbed in the neck.
- Ha-ha.

497
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,680
Can you call Legal? I need
some help down here now.

498
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,322
Hello? No, I can't come.

499
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,687
Just wait right there, all right?
Just calm down. I'm on my way.

500
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,521
You just stay
right there. Jerry.

501
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,563
- Everything all right?
- I have to leave. Cover for me.

502
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,428
Not again. For how long? Pratt?

503
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,180
Hi.

504
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,340
- Hi.
- How long have you been cramping?

505
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,246
About an hour.

506
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,478
How much bleeding?

507
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,586
Four pads.

508
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:01,193
Okay. We need to get you upstairs.
Do you want me to call Sandy?

509
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,592
- She's at work.
- She'd wanna be with you.

510
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,597
I can't. I don't wanna
check in upstairs.

511
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:11,760
- I don't want it all over the hospital.
- I think you need a D and C right away.

512
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,666
No. Just...

513
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,537
page me if the OB resident
comes down for another consult.

514
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,106
I'm calling Maynard.

515
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,749
- Hey, have you seen Kerry?
- Yeah. She's on break.

516
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,183
- Where?
- What do you need?

517
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,517
- I need Kerry.
- Hey, what are you doing?

518
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:33,920
You can't suture yourself.

519
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,618
I have patients waiting
for me back at my clinic.

520
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:39,856
- Where did you get these supplies?
- The nurse set them up for you.

521
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,262
Forty-five minutes ago.

522
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,798
Nice eversion. Still,
can't let you do it.

523
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,233
Hey, Dr. Carter.

524
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,308
Can't find Dr. Weaver, and Mrs.
Gilman has a special request.

525
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,478
My attorney's on her
way over right now.

526
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,203
Mattie, he wants to do it.

527
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,972
- So do I.
- What?

528
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,583
Koko wants to collect
semen from her husband...

529
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,481
who is 93 and just had an MI.

530
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,121
He was trying to give me a baby.

531
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,984
Don't debase my
father any further.

532
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,821
- He's senile.
- He is not senile. He's horny.

533
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:13,260
Uh, Mr. Gilman
has agreed to, uh...

534
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,524
electroejaculation.

535
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,731
- Come again?
- I'm an electroejaculation technician.

536
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,468
Your parents must be very proud.

537
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,074
I have to ejaculate
him before he dies.

538
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,907
Otherwise, I have to do
a seminal-vesicle harvest.

539
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,106
We wanna make sure
that he doesn't die.

540
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,683
Well, we can still get it now.

541
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,548
Oh, it was always about
the money, wasn't it, Koko?

542
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:39,256
If she doesn't get pregnant before
he dies, she doesn't inherit anything.

543
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,188
- Inherit? BOB:
Seven million, roughly.

544
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,194
My husband signed a release. I
know my rights. I want his semen.

545
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:49,027
Okay. Well, what exactly
is it that's, um, involved?

546
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,433
A rectal probe is inserted, causing
contraction of the vas deferens...

547
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,630
seminal vesicle
and the prostate.

548
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,571
Called a reflex ejaculation.

549
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,208
Okay, good.

550
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,677
Uh, excuse me...

551
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,886
Did you call Legal?

552
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,716
Well, they're sending somebody.
- Carter!

553
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,485
- Three-story fall from a skylight.
- Good luck, Gallant.

554
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,493
- Hey, how should I handle this?
- Gently.

555
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,222
Full trauma panel, Foley and
NG. He needs a central line.

556
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,867
Decreased breath, both
sides. Bilateral chest tubes.

557
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,230
Squeeze in two of O-neg,
type and cross for four.

558
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,133
He's got a dozen
deep lacerations.

559
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,501
Pumpers we have to
clamp off or he's gonna leak.

560
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,076
- We need another doctor. Weaver?
- I don't know. Romano sent Kovac home.

561
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,908
Pressure's dropping. Sats down to 82.
- Right AC is blown.

562
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,980
- Okay, get Pratt.
- He left.

563
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,744
- What?
- He had an emergency again.

564
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,151
Leon.

565
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,656
Where are you, man?

566
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,160
What happened to you?

567
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,926
Did you pass out? Huh?

568
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,072
- Stabbed me and stomped on my hand.
- Did you pass out? Huh?

569
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,765
- I'm dying, G.
- Who did this to you? Dukey and them?

570
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,774
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

571
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,879
He wanted the gun.

572
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,605
- Shh.
- They're gonna kill me.

573
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,841
You have to be
quiet. I have to listen.

574
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:16,546
They wanted it. And I didn't have it. I
got scared. And they're so mad at me.

575
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,281
It was Dukey's gun,
right? They stabbed you?

576
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:23,724
- Where did they stab you?
- In the ass. In the ass, G.

577
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,796
Come on. We got
to go to the hospital.

578
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,523
No, no. Where's the gun, G?

579
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,533
- They're outside.
- We have to go to the hospital.

580
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,695
- No. They're gonna kill both of us!
- Nobody's gonna kill us.

581
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,898
No... Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay...

582
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,382
Where are we?

583
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,984
Don't even bother gloving up.

584
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,915
Time of death, 18:44.

585
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,080
Ugh. Sorry. I came
as soon as I heard.

586
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,923
It's not your fault.

587
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,124
Carter, labs on your
cranky old doctor.

588
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,630
- McNulty. Thank you.
- But he's MIA.

589
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,565
He's diabetic. Get him on the
phone. He needs to come back.

590
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,500
I tried. I keep
getting a machine.

591
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,607
Tell him his blood sugar's
435 and to get back here.

592
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,437
And page Dr. Pratt, 911.

593
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:16,448
I'm gonna have you on the
IV for about another half-hour.

594
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,077
Everything's fine.

595
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,952
- Kerry, you should really think about...
- Pelvic rest.

596
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,425
Return with abdominal pain,
fever, increased bleeding.

597
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,958
Methergine.2 milligrams,
p.o. q.i.d. I know what to do.

598
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,302
I was gonna say you
should take some time off.

599
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,306
Come see me in three days.

600
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,107
Can I get you anything?

601
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,814
You want me to try
and call Sandy at work?

602
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,313
Okay.

603
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,156
Abby.

604
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,296
I can give you a ride
home in about an hour.

605
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,669
Thanks.

606
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,016
We were lucky to capture
that retrograde ejaculation.

607
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:31,418
- Lucky. We're moving him to CCU.
- Oh, Mattie and Bob are with him.

608
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,320
I have to go. I
ovulated this morning.

609
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,553
Let's go. We're
killing spermatozoa.

610
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:41,029
- Did he just say "spermatozoa"?
- That man has an electroejaculator.

611
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,192
- Electroejaculator?
- Does that come with a costume?

612
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,033
- Nope. An extension cord.
- Oh, the mighty Gilman pulled through.

613
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,267
- An inspiration to us all.
- Gallant, Pratt for you.

614
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,777
Abby, have you ever heard
of an electroejaculator?

615
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,881
- You just like saying that word.
- No.

616
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,041
I had an instant ejaculator once.
Tommy Reynolds, 10th grade.

617
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,677
- Poor kid never made it out of his jeans.
- Ixnay on the jaculator-ay.

618
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,723
- Hey, has anybody seen Pratt?
- Uh, Gallant's on the phone with him.

619
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,725
- I don't feel comfortable doing that.
- I want to talk to him.

620
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,796
- Dr. Carter wants to talk to you.
- Where the hell are you?

621
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,432
Pratt?

622
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,569
What's going on, Gallant?
I'm only gonna ask you once.

623
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,068
Ah! It hurts, G.

624
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,574
All right, there he is.
Lay on your stomach.

625
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,937
It hurts all over, G.

626
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,942
Gallant, what took
you so damn long?

627
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:30,241
I see I got through
to you earlier today.

628
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,552
- Running a clinic out of the apartment?
- Come on.

629
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,882
Who's hurt?

630
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:40,921
It's my brother, Leon.

631
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,091
Who are you?

632
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,291
- G?
- Don't worry. He's a doctor too.

633
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,292
Looks like he should be in the hospital.
- No, man. I heard that.

634
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,098
- Calm down. We're not going anywhere.
- I ain't going.

635
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,741
Just calm down. Listen,
we're staying right here.

636
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,400
Either you're gonna
help or you're not.

637
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,774
This is not smart, Pratt.

638
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,439
Everything in my life
is not smart, Carter.

639
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,589
- How long ago did you get hurt?
- Three hours ago, but he's okay.

640
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,453
Gunshot?

641
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,617
Stab wound.

642
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,855
Also fractured fourth
and fifth metacarpals.

643
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,592
He's got broken ribs, bloody
nose, no septal hematoma.

644
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:28,270
Listen to me. Um, I'm good, I
got this. I mean, you can go now.

645
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,135
All I needed was a suture kit.

646
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,104
Why don't you wanna
go to the hospital?

647
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,778
- You don't want the assault reported?
- They gonna kill us.

648
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,409
Nobody's gonna
kill us. Let it go.

649
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,487
Why'd you get beat up?

650
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,320
I didn't have the gun
when they asked for it.

651
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,653
We gotta get it
back, G. They want it.

652
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,293
Holding the gun for
someone else, huh?

653
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,454
My friends.

654
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,863
Some friends.

655
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,002
I'm a danger to
myself and others.

656
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,165
If you went home,
what would you do?

657
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,509
I don't know.

658
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,318
- You have to tell him what you would do.
- Stop coaching him.

659
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,923
Where are you going?

660
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,390
- I have patients.
- Chip, listen to me right now.

661
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,688
If you don't tell the
truth, we can't help you.

662
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,764
This is your last chance.

663
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,906
I'm picking up my
ex-girlfriend's son from school...

664
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:46,411
and having sex with him in my
car behind the baseball field...

665
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,214
as soon as I leave here.

666
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,353
Okay, I'll make room for him.

667
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,638
How are you feeling? Good.

668
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,404
Uh, did you call your parents?

669
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,147
They're gonna worry about you.

670
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:20,943
What did she say?

671
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:25,246
Uh... "They'll worry about me
more if they know I have a boyfriend."

672
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,428
What?

673
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:34,757
She doesn't want to disappoint
them more than she already has...

674
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,925
by being deaf.

675
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:43,264
No. You can't go home.
You have to stay here tonight.

676
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,101
I'll call.

677
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,115
Why was I a patient?

678
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,253
You saw me?

679
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,088
I was...

680
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,862
Leon, he's your brother?

681
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,467
No.

682
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,537
Well, yeah, kind of.

683
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,834
He came to live with me
and my mom when he was 9.

684
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,671
I was 6 then.

685
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,745
I idolized him.

686
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,211
Then when I was 15, my
mom died of liver cancer...

687
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,478
and Leon took care of me.

688
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,917
Made sure I went to school.

689
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:08,924
So when I was in college, one day
he got into a fight in a bar in Detroit.

690
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,422
Ha, believe me, this is
one tough son of a bitch.

691
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,432
I'm trying to tell you, I mean, he
survived a 9 mm bullet to the brain.

692
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:23,068
But in turn, his IQ
dropped about 40 points.

693
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:31,915
Do you have any help?

694
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,749
No. I've been doing it
on my own for years.

695
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,947
I'm good at that.

696
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,721
Well, we work as a team.

697
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,222
We cover for each other.

698
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,564
We lean on each other.

699
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,200
The job's too big to do solo.

700
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,669
And if you can't get that...

701
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,706
maybe you should be a surgeon.

702
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:07,981
Or a superhero, or something else
that doesn't require trusting people.

703
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:11,922
I've never been big on trust.

704
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,984
You know what that turns into?

705
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,489
Nobody trusts you either.

706
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:26,000
Look, self-sufficiency's a good
thing, but it's not the only thing.

707
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,238
Asking for help
when you need it...

708
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,269
doesn't make you weak.

709
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,280
Um, maybe I
should go inside now.

710
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,243
All right.
