1
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:14,204
It's Sergeant Eric Wyczenski.

2
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:20,815
Whiskey, Yankee, Charlie, Zulu, Echo,
November, Sierra, Kilo, India. Wyczenski.

3
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,684
<i>Could you tell me
his squadron number?</i>

4
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,722
Hold on. Do you know
his squadron number?

5
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,484
I don't know.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,993
I'm not sure. You don't
have a central directory?

7
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,290
Johnny's up. He
pulled out his Hep-Lock.

8
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,694
Get Conni. I'm off.

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,564
No, no. I'm calling on
behalf of a family member.

10
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:39,536
Okay. Then can you transfer
me to the confinement facility?

11
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,175
- Stop staring!
- They don't talk to family members.

12
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,675
- I'm not gonna lie.
- I just wanna know where he is!

13
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,337
- Stop staring!
- She offered her cat a teaspoon of acid.

14
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,143
- Get away, freak-o.
- Sine equals cosine...

15
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,809
Hello? Lieutenant Michael
Gallant, U.S. Army Reserve.

16
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,854
- What are you doing?
- Are you deaf? I said, get away!

17
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,718
- Stop it.
- He won't stop staring.

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,360
- He's not hurting anybody.
- He smells like piss, man.

19
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,292
- This way. This way.
- Keep the mental cases locked up.

20
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,558
- It's irrational, but it has a fraction...
- He's not at Great Lakes.

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,101
- I kept trying to call you.
- Couldn't get a phone signal on the base.

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,603
- Sit down.
- It's a rule. It's a constant.

23
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,901
But they did keep Eric
there on Thursday night.

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,977
- They told you that?
- They held Eric there three nights ago...

25
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,047
- then transferred the next morning.
- Transferred him where?

26
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,608
Nebraska, his base.

27
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,776
Might as well be Manila.

28
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,548
There's, like, 100
offices on that base.

29
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,884
Is that Army or Air Force?

30
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:34,256
I was desperate. I thought he
could use military lingo or something.

31
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,896
Great, thanks.

32
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,761
Okay. So they gave me the number to
the 55th Wing Judge Advocate's Office.

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,267
I left five voice mails there.
They're closed all weekend.

34
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,405
Did you get the
name of his attorney?

35
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,302
- I can call back.
- That's okay. Thanks.

36
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,739
I'm just gonna go there.
I'm just gonna go there.

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,572
Okay.

38
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:56,145
Why don't I call the travel agent, see if
we can book a flight out for tomorrow?

39
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,182
- I wanna go tonight.
- Confirm he's there.

40
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,584
I've been trying to confirm where
he is for three and a half days.

41
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:05,351
- Is there a flight out tonight?
- Yep. United, 9:30 to Omaha.

42
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,859
My shift just started five
minutes ago. I can't dump it now.

43
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,499
- You don't have to come.
- You can't go by yourself.

44
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,034
- I usually do this by myself.
- Let me find Chen to cover for me.

45
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,297
She left five minutes ago.

46
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,102
Do you even know how
to get onto a military base?

47
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,677
- There must be a visitor's center.
- You have to have a sponsor.

48
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,873
- I'll figure it out.
- At least take Gallant with you.

49
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,052
- That's what I need, a med student.
- To us, he's a med student.

50
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,450
- To them, he's an officer.
- He has things to do.

51
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,988
He's been on a base
before. He speaks the lingo.

52
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,321
Can you call me a cab, please?

53
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,224
Maybe some T-shirts.

54
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,332
They're in the third drawer
on the right from the bottom.

55
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,163
Just pick out anything that
doesn't look like I slept in it.

56
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,498
What about toiletries?
Toothbrush, toothpaste?

57
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,971
I'll just buy that stuff
when I get out there.

58
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,543
And socks and underwear in the
second drawer. Pull them from the top.

59
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,703
- Why?
- Because those are my respectable...

60
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,007
Oh, right, and...

61
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,082
- Were they open?
- Yeah. Just made it.

62
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,378
- What?
- Dry cleaner.

63
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,351
- My uniform.
- Thought it might help.

64
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,651
- You don't have to do this, Gallant.
- Never been to Omaha.

65
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,721
What's that?

66
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,530
Internal medicine
exam next week.

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,034
Oh, that's great. You coerced a
med student into failing his rotation.

68
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,002
I'm on a 10:00 flight.
I get in at 11:30.

69
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,337
- Call me if you need anything.
- When are you gonna sleep?

70
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,841
Just get in the cab.

71
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,904
Thank you.

72
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,755
- I'll see you in Nebraska.
- Mm-hm.

73
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,292
Okay, Frank, what do we got?

74
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:28,231
Let's see. Four-F with
abdominal pain in Exam 3.

75
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,241
Five hundred and 10, equals 284.

76
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,434
Jacob gave Esau 220
goats and 220 sheep.

77
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,446
Come on, Johnny. Let's see if
we can't get you something to eat.

78
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,370
Come on, foot. Come on. Come on.

79
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,408
You say delayed, but
you mean canceled.

80
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:21,070
<i>- No, sir...</i>
- Well, how long does that usually take?

81
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,975
- Go ahead.
- Can you give me any estimate?

82
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,813
- Go ahead. I got it.
- I could be here a while. Go ahead.

83
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,820
Well, have they even started
to plow the runways yet?

84
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,486
No task on the agenda has
priority over the number 200.

85
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,665
Sum of the main diagonal should
be equal to the sum of each row.

86
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,063
Now, that's tricky, but
it's part of the magic.

87
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,896
Must be equal. Must be all.

88
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,336
Sum of the major diagonal should
be equal to each row and each column.

89
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,705
Now, that's more tricky, but it
can be done if you know the secret.

90
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,104
Sum of three numbers geometrically
equidistant from the center...

91
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,305
You okay?

92
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,678
Yeah. It's just worse
when I wake up.

93
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,286
At least you got some sleep.

94
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,682
- Hey, did it stop snowing?
- Yeah. But don't expect to go anywhere.

95
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:08,954
- I got another 12 hours anyway.
- At least they'll be quiet.

96
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,195
- Hello?
- John.

97
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,665
<i>Hey. Hang on.</i>

98
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,599
- Hey, where are you?
- Looking for Eric's commanding officer.

99
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,368
- You got on the base.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

100
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,477
You were right.
Gallant's a fast talker.

101
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,672
I'm looking at one of those
stealth plane things right now.

102
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,215
- You see the news?
<i>- What?</i>

103
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,843
- I said, did you see the news last night?
<i>- No. What happened?</i>

104
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,422
Three feet of snow
dumped in seven hours.

105
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,757
Carter, I can't hear you.

106
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,522
Three feet of snow dumped
in seven hours last night.

107
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,995
The airport's closed.

108
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,067
I'm at work. I can't get my
car out of the parking garage.

109
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,261
EI's shut down. The El.

110
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,005
Forget it. Is he there?

111
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,974
Eric. Is he there?

112
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,239
I don't know. Nobody seems
to know anything, actually.

113
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:04,418
<i>I thought the military was
supposed to excel in communications.</i>

114
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,554
<i>They had trouble giving direction
on where to park much less...</i>

115
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,246
You all right?

116
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,121
- Yeah, I'm fine.
<i>- Carter?</i>

117
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,725
No, no. Not you.

118
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,521
What? MAN: Off the phone!

119
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,624
You're a civilian in a restricted
area. Get off the phone.

120
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,131
- I'll call back. MITCHELL:
Tell her to get off the phone.

121
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,700
Talk to you later.

122
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,567
Your office issued a visitor's pass and
suggested we look for you in Hangar 12.

123
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,404
- That, lieutenant, is Hangar 13.
- Oh.

124
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,873
- "Oh," what?
- Oh, sir.

125
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,759
- Sir. MITCHELL: You're
Wyczenski's sister?

126
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,941
- Yes.
- Funny guy. Popular too.

127
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,486
Unfortunately, he didn't feel
much responsibility to the Air Force.

128
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,858
Is he here? Because
nobody's telling us anything.

129
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,995
Ma'am, I just came off of a
72-hour live-fire exercise...

130
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,926
short one
air-traffic controller.

131
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,091
- If Sgt. Wyczenski was apprehended...
- Aren't you his commanding officer?

132
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,705
If he was picked up in Chicago,
he would be brought here.

133
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,272
Go to your hotel. Leave
your number with my office.

134
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,376
He's suffering from
a psychiatric disorder.

135
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,138
I'm well aware of the
"near-miss" depression.

136
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,842
Bipolar disease. Manic depression.
He needs to see a psychiatrist.

137
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,986
He needs to be evaluated
and medicated now.

138
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:18,057
So wherever he is, wherever you
seem to have lost him, he needs help.

139
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,503
<i>Snow day for all city
offices and school...</i>

140
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,120
- Did you hear that?
- Closed.

141
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,390
City offices. Read
the sign. We're county.

142
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,863
They haven't plowed the bay.

143
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,127
They're having trouble
getting on the road.

144
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:33,239
Chuny, Lydia wants to know, since you're
stuck here, if you'll take her shift.

145
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,033
Tell her to break
out the shovel.

146
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,042
Hey, repeat troponin's
negative on 5.

147
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,203
Send him home with a
sled and some Huskies.

148
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,544
- It is so quiet.
- I know. Kind of freaky, huh?

149
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,311
- So you trying to rent a snowmobile?
- Considering it.

150
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,979
- Do they deliver?
- I can't get them to answer the phone.

151
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,923
Rack is empty, Triage is clear and
labs are pending on my only two patients.

152
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,086
- Good.
- So, what do I do now?

153
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,424
I don't know. Go
play in the snow.

154
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,727
Hey, Ella!

155
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,759
Please tell me daycare's open.

156
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,905
There's a kindergarten
teacher in Exam 4.

157
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,234
My nanny couldn't get
out of her front door.

158
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,900
- That's what windows are for.
- I'm soaked to my knees.

159
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,672
- All we did was walk from the El.
- The EI's open?

160
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,609
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- We're outside.

161
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:24,087
- On an Air Force base.
- Do you need clearance to smoke too?

162
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,622
You can't talk on a cell
phone. You can't smoke.

163
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,591
You see that truck?

164
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,192
- Yeah.
- That's jet fuel.

165
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,027
Amy Lockhart? - Abby.

166
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,602
Lieutenant Ottenson, your
brother's detailed counsel.

167
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,740
- Has he been charged with something?
- No. Not officially.

168
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,900
- Acting combative or argumentative?
- I don't know.

169
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:44,629
Delusional?

170
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,603
I haven't seen him.
I just got the jacket.

171
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,180
Can I go in there? I
really need to talk to him.

172
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,017
He's not here. The judge advocate...
- Wait a minute!

173
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:56,350
Wait! His CO said that they took
him to confinement Friday afternoon.

174
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,788
And transferred to base
hospital Saturday morning.

175
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,462
Oh, my God! I'm
so sorry. I'm sorry.

176
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,540
- I thought you were Malik.
- Do I look like Malik?

177
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,699
Sorry, man. You
ain't that good-looking.

178
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,379
- What are you doing?
- You told me to play in the snow.

179
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,777
You can't let him
outflank you like that.

180
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,010
Yeah, right.

181
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,383
- Commuting on skis.
- What?

182
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,217
- You're skiing to work.
- Yeah. I don't live far.

183
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,222
- Nice coat.
- Goodwill box.

184
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,258
- Hey, did you find him?
- Who?

185
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,952
Abby's brother.

186
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:39,099
I'm gonna catch a train to
Midway and wait for it to open up.

187
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,733
- Where are you going?
- Nebraska.

188
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,892
She's already there.
She left last night.

189
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,971
- You didn't go with her?
- I had a shift.

190
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,672
- I sent Gallant with her.
- Gallant?

191
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,471
- Yeah. Why?
- Carter, we've got multiples coming in.

192
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,669
Luka's here.

193
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,611
Three criticals.
One adult, two kids.

194
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,948
Some drunk plowed through a family
making a snowman in their front yard.

195
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,453
- Where's Weaver? LEWIS:
She can't get her car out.

196
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,852
The EI's running.

197
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:09,621
It's hard walking through the snow
with a cane. She's disabled, remember?

198
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,298
I thought we were closed to ambulance
traffic. How's anybody gonna get in?

199
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,302
We'll do a hot unload. Stay with me.
Approach the helicopter from the front.

200
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,873
It'll be windy as hell up there. If
anything blows away, don't chase it.

201
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,636
- It's far too easy to become disoriented.
- Right.

202
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,212
- You need some help?
- I've got it.

203
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,749
Your stethoscope will be useless.
So will your ears, for that matter.

204
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,012
Rely on your other senses.

205
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:38,318
Look for chest excursion, feel
the pulses, study the monitor.

206
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,518
Pulse ox, ECG, dynamap.

207
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,425
They'll tell you all you need
to know about the status.

208
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,499
Don't even try to
take a history until...

209
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,995
You have a tremor on the left.

210
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,696
That's the Sinemet. It
works faster when I chew it.

211
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,366
I've only noticed it on the right. Have
you had symptoms on the left before?

212
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,913
- Stress, you know. Sleep deprivation.
- Or a progression of your disease.

213
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,151
My rotation's almost over.

214
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,684
Why do you do this to yourself?
Working these insane hours when you...

215
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,724
Please don't treat me
like I'm dying, okay?

216
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,195
Can we just go get this patient?

217
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,196
Keep your head down. Stick with
me and stay clear of the tail rotor.

218
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,435
- They gave him a drug called "Depacot."
- Depakote.

219
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,044
- And Zy...
- Zyprexa.

220
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,440
Apparently, he's coherent.

221
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:37,573
He's scheduled to go up against
a Rule 706 sanity board at 1200.

222
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,049
- "Up against"? OTTENSON:
It's just a formality.

223
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:44,486
- If he was psychotic...
- "Manic," actually, is the term. Manic.

224
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:48,128
Then they won't court martial. They'd
process him on medical discharge.

225
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,592
How long will they hold him?

226
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,095
If he's mentally stable,
they'll release him.

227
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,257
No one calls me to
get a family history...

228
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,733
or gives me time to set
up treatment for him?

229
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,235
You'll just boot him out?

230
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,238
If he'd asked for family, someone
would have contacted you.

231
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,239
- He's not thinking clearly.
- Abby.

232
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,414
Hi.

233
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,313
Hi.

234
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,818
The doctor's in with him now.

235
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,755
- Name?
- Mother's screaming for Toby and Matt.

236
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,523
- I don't know which is who.
- Toby. The other one's Matt.

237
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,826
Cushing's response. Vital signs
negative. No hemotympanum.

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,528
Pupils blown. Seven mm
bilaterally non-reactive.

239
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,606
No corneal or gag
reflex. His brain is mush.

240
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,676
- Tell me the drunk driver died on impact.
- It was one of those monster trucks.

241
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:39,869
He hit the whole family?

242
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,912
Dad was getting a
carrot for the nose.

243
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,574
- CT's ready.
- Scan the belly along with the head.

244
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,119
- I need to get to the other one.
- Epidural hematoma?

245
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,449
- If we're lucky. KOVAC:
Set me up for a central line.

246
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,218
- Pulse ox is only 85.
- Is that the mother?

247
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,417
C-spine is clear.

248
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,620
Jumped in front.
Truck hit straight on.

249
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,764
Does your belly hurt, ma'am?
- Chest.

250
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,025
Flail segment.
Thirty-two French.

251
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,862
Please.

252
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,769
My boys.

253
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,207
Please, save my boys.

254
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,608
Full trauma panel. Type and
cross for 4, portable chest and pelvis.

255
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,544
Another unit on the second
line. Let's set up for a femoral.

256
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,047
- We have blood?
- We'd better.

257
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,811
He's got contusions and
crepitus over the left chest.

258
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,887
- They left my mom.
- No, they didn't.

259
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,149
- They left her in the snow.
- Follow this light with your eyes.

260
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,452
- She's here. We're helping her.
- Where's Toby?

261
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,425
He's here too.

262
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,460
Decreased on both sides.
Bilateral thoracostomy.

263
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,895
Ten blade. CORDAY: Times two.

264
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,778
Pressure's holding,
but he's tachy.

265
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,795
All his ribs are shattered.
He should be dead.

266
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,736
He would be, if his mother
hadn't jumped in front of him.

267
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,069
Have you talked to him?

268
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,142
Just briefly on the phone.

269
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,019
It's happening...

270
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,790
Mom.

271
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,188
It's happening to him.

272
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,268
He showed up in Chicago with
this girl that he had just met...

273
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,701
and I knew he didn't have that
much leave, but I... Mostly I just...

274
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,902
saw it.

275
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,668
I just felt it right away.

276
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,412
I should have
called you. I'm sorry.

277
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,345
But I didn't know what to do. Then
the MPs came and arrested him.

278
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,562
Actually, I got him arrested.

279
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:33,516
Abby, don't start.
This is not your fault.

280
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,889
No. I needed to know.

281
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:40,193
I had to know, so I called here
and I got his medical records...

282
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:44,133
and they had misdiagnosed
a depression in May.

283
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,467
They thought it was stress, which
is why he was transferred here.

284
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,978
We thought it was situational.

285
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,384
What?

286
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,880
I made him see Dr. McMangus.

287
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,823
You knew about his depression?

288
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:10,896
McMangus is a mood-disorder
specialist. Even he thought it was PTSD.

289
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,158
PTSD? Mom, you're bipolar.

290
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,429
Insomnia, loss of appetite,
inability to concentrate.

291
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,006
It was all specific to the event
and resolved without medication.

292
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,042
Do you even know
anything about your disease?

293
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,112
Yes, Abby. I
know a lot about it.

294
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,840
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I wanted to protect you.

295
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,214
Protect me? What
about protecting him?

296
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,754
Your brother didn't
want you to know.

297
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,589
- Can't get a pressure.
- No femoral pulse. Check a Doppler.

298
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:45,528
V-fib. Crash cart. Thoracotomy
tray and prep the chest.

299
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,065
- It's blunt trauma.
- She had a pulse and was talking.

300
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,830
Ten blade. Get FFP from the
blood bank and page Cardiothoracic.

301
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,267
If they can get here.

302
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,072
The husband wants to come in.
- No!

303
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,504
Rib spreader.

304
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,167
- Metz and pickups.
- Nathan.

305
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,371
Sir, you've gotta
come with me. Sir?

306
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,279
- No pericardial infusion.
- Oh, God.

307
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,353
- No cardiac lacerations.
- Satinsky. Nathan, now.

308
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,548
- You've got to come outside with me.
- No.

309
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,522
- Starting compressions.
- I'm her husband.

310
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,693
She is bleeding into her chest.
They are trying to save her.

311
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,162
- The aorta is cross-clamped at 10:27.
- Heart's empty.

312
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,665
- Empty?
- Please, please.

313
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,360
Blood must be in the right
chest. Get me another tube.

314
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,665
- Set up a Thora-Seal.
- Dr. Corday.

315
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,003
- Swab stick. Suction on high.
- Boy's not oxygenating at 100 percent.

316
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,805
Carter thinks a rib
punctured his heart.

317
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:40,049
- Squeeze in four units, then defibrillate.
- 3-0 nylon and OpSite.

318
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,245
- What happened? CARTER:
Rib lacerated his LAD.

319
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,687
He's got a huge V-Q mismatch, low
PO-2 and diminished lung compliance.

320
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,090
Troponin is 32. CK,
925 with 20 percent MB.

321
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,729
He's having a massive MI.

322
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,060
- Cath lab first?
- Probably heart muscle damage.

323
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,327
Okay. Let's call Cards
and set up for a Swan.

324
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,734
- Carter, Abby on 2.
- Get a number, see if I can call her back.

325
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,170
- Ectopy.
- You can't repair the coronary artery?

326
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,334
- It would just be feeding a dead heart.
- Another run. Ten beats.

327
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,545
Okay. Okay, call a perfusionist.
We're gonna put him on bypass.

328
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,086
- Bypass?
- Just do it!

329
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,450
Susan.

330
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,251
- Susan! LEWIS:
Neurosurg is on the way.

331
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,088
- All they can offer is ICP monitoring.
- No subdural?

332
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,753
Diffuse cerebral edema with
intraparenchymal bleeding.

333
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,764
Complete effacement of ventricles.
Knocked out the brainstem.

334
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,095
Get a stat EEG and
mobilize transplant service.

335
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,602
- Transplant?
- Toby? Is that Toby?

336
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,707
I'm Dr. Corday. I
need a word with you.

337
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,742
- Aren't you working on my wife?
- I'm working on your family.

338
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,104
How bad is he hurt?
He wasn't talking.

339
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,948
There's a massive
swelling of his brain.

340
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,775
He's in a coma?

341
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,885
No. He's brain-dead, I'm afraid.

342
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,870
Brain-dead? CORDAY: I'm sorry.

343
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,237
We still can't get a rhythm.
- Be right there.

344
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,095
- 1500 cc's out the right side.
- Susan, can you help Luka?

345
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,392
- Get him in the Suture Room.
- This is sudden.

346
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,468
But your other son,
Matt, his heart is failing.

347
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,935
The artery that feeds it
was severed by his rib.

348
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,301
His lungs are bruised
and filled with blood.

349
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:12,969
His only chance is a heart and lung
transplant within the next six hours.

350
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,408
Do you understand?

351
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,516
School was canceled and
the street was blocked...

352
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,481
and the boys wanted
to make snowmen.

353
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,847
Sir, do you understand?

354
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,684
I need your permission to take Toby's
heart and lungs and give them to Matt.

355
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,453
- What?
- This son is dead.

356
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,187
I might have a chance
to save your other one.

357
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,697
- No, you just save them both.
- I can't.

358
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,531
- Elizabeth, you need to open a chest.
- Kids are resilient.

359
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,367
- He'll bounce back, right?
- Elizabeth, I might need you.

360
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,169
- Not now.
- Drunken driver with distracting injuries.

361
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,337
No! Look, I know this is difficult,
but I need your consent now.

362
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:52,007
You can't just wait a couple
days? See if he wakes up?

363
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,683
Elizabeth.

364
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,685
Sir, I'll be right back. Nathan.

365
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,994
You need to calm him down,
explain it to him, get consent.

366
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,153
He's not in the state
of mind to understand.

367
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,199
So you make him understand. We
just have one shot at his other boy.

368
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,201
What, they're worried
about national security?

369
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,534
It's protocol.
Military's big on it.

370
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,472
They already said
they'd discharge him.

371
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,509
How long can it take
to talk to a lawyer?

372
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,011
I guess he needed to
brief him on the hearing.

373
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,207
There's a PX. You
want something to eat?

374
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,976
No, thanks.

375
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,212
You haven't eaten
anything since last night.

376
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,878
I'm fine.

377
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,684
- Mrs. Wyczenski?
- She's fine too.

378
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,556
Look, Gallant, you came here to
help me get on base, and I got on base.

379
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,392
Thank you. Now you should go.

380
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,194
- I mean, I can stay.
- You have a test.

381
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:46,567
- But Dr. Carter said if I did need...
- I don't care. Dr. Carter's not here.

382
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,534
And besides, this is my
family. You should go.

383
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,038
- Well, there's only one car.
- Mom, do you have a rent-a-car?

384
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,340
- Yes.
- You can take it.

385
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,343
- Come on, go. Go.
- I'm gonna take him over in 45 minutes.

386
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,612
- Can I go in now?
- He asked to see his mom.

387
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,882
- Let's go.
- Only his mom.

388
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,092
- Does he know I'm here?
- Yes, ma'am.

389
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,529
And he doesn't wanna see me?

390
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,235
Not right now, ma'am.

391
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,597
I'll talk to him, Abby.
He'll come around.

392
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,299
Right this way.

393
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,673
Spreader.

394
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,778
At least 2 more liters
in the right chest.

395
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,443
- Suction.
- Vascular clamp.

396
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,614
- Looks like a hilar injury.
- Tore the pulmonary artery and vein.

397
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,728
- Got it. KOVAC:
Resuming compressions.

398
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,799
- Is he getting consent?
- He's trying.

399
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,765
- HemoCue, 6.2.
- Comes in handy, I guess.

400
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,769
- What?
- He's good at talking patients into stuff.

401
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,635
- Another eight of packed cells.
- She's in arrest too long.

402
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:59,768
- We only got hemostasis a minute ago.
- He's in V-tach!

403
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,780
- Four units on the rapid infuser.
- Thirty-five kilos. Charge to 50.

404
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,919
- Where's my perfusionist?
- Still trying to get through the snow.

405
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,483
- .35 mg of one to 10,000 of epi.
- Sinus.

406
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,422
- Okay, bolus lidocaine and...
- V-tach. Pulseless.

407
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,653
- Starting CPR.
- All right, 120 again.

408
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,127
I got it.

409
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:20,129
- He consented?
- I showed him the EEG.

410
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,029
Everybody clear.

411
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,602
All right, sinus. He wants to convert.
- V-tach.

412
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,331
Heart's ischemic, lungs can't
oxygenate. Move to the OR.

413
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:32,501
We don't have a stable rhythm
yet. Lidocaine, IV push and charge.

414
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,476
- You got a signature?
- He's signing now.

415
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,047
And clear.

416
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,344
- Sinus.
- Okay, then get his brother upstairs.

417
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,317
- Hold right there.
- We need that transplant team here now.

418
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:45,219
- Back to V-fib.
- Damn it. All right, charge again to 120.

419
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,860
Procainamide, 300 mg
IV over the next half-hour.

420
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,393
Charge again. CORDAY: Wait.

421
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,689
- Back to sinus.
- Okay, that's it. Let's go.

422
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,356
Lido infusion at 40
mics per kilo per minute.

423
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,367
- We shouldn't move him.
- We have a window. He's in sinus now.

424
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,801
- For 10 seconds.
- We need to get him on bypass.

425
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,669
- He can't last that long.
- You wanna do a heart transplant?

426
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,537
You have any other ideas?

427
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,470
I'm here, kiddo. It's
not gonna hurt. I'm here.

428
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,216
We'll set up. Have the
bypass catheters standing by.

429
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,554
- Subclavian?
- No. Femoral. Ten French.

430
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,357
- Ectopy again. We gotta hustle.
- What's wrong?

431
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,663
- Hey, hold the elevator!
- Sats down to 78.

432
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,565
- He needs to be suctioned.
- You gotta make this work.

433
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,457
- We'll do our best.
- No, promise me.

434
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,906
- Promise me this will work.
- We have to get upstairs.

435
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,568
Pressure's down to 80 systolic.
Let's open up the dopamine box.

436
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,878
It's okay, baby.

437
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:47,414
You're gonna help your brother,
okay? You're gonna help your brother.

438
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,587
My wife.

439
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,357
If we bring him in to my
wife, she's gotta say goodbye.

440
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,627
- Amp of bicarb in.
- I think I just broke his last rib.

441
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,034
Good pulse with compressions.
Where are we headed?

442
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,868
- OR 2.
- V-fib!

443
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,136
Hold compressions. Charge the paddles.
- Charging.

444
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,711
Clear.

445
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,377
- Battery's dead.
- Check the connection.

446
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,212
- Still energized.
- Okay, stop. Clear!

447
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,152
There's a crash cart in the OR.

448
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,821
- Let's go. Grab the slider.
- One-fifty.

449
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,461
- Charged.
- Clear.

450
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,561
Sinus.

451
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,025
Three milligrams
per kilo of heparin...

452
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,002
- then prep for THI cannula.
- One, two, three.

453
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,867
- Where's my transplant team?
- What do you want me to do?

454
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,082
Keep him in V-fib.

455
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,337
Heparin's in.
Waiting on gradient.

456
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:50,108
- Run a V-tach. Half-bolus of lidocaine.
- Two hundred units per kilo.

457
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,581
Sinus. CORDAY: Then
one per mil of prime.

458
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,014
Shirley? SHIRLEY: Right here.

459
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,917
Meet the donor at the elevator.
Get him prepped next door.

460
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,558
- Repeat BP.
- 100/60.

461
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,920
Ten blade.

462
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,943
Starting bypass at 11:46. Hey.

463
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,743
Just got him hooked up now?

464
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,887
LAD is shredded. Irreversible
ischemic damage to left ventricle.

465
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,955
And I thought I had a snow
day. Get the harvest team going.

466
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,558
Keep pH at 7.4. PCO2
between 30 and 35.

467
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,217
- Wow. Wow.
- Yeah.

468
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,920
Yeah.

469
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,125
He doesn't blame you.
He just can't hide from you.

470
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,997
You saw him manic, and
he hasn't accepted it yet.

471
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,967
He's taking the meds.

472
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,903
Not by choice. That
could take some time.

473
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:53,136
He's emotionally exhausted.
And he's ashamed.

474
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,110
Try not to be confrontational.

475
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,613
I've got this down. Thanks.

476
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,352
Hi.

477
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,494
Were you expecting
a straitjacket?

478
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:12,988
No.

479
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,864
You look nice.

480
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,161
Fashion's key
at a court martial.

481
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,332
It's not really a court
martial, right? It's a Rule 70...

482
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,342
I know what it is, Abby.

483
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,443
You wanted out anyway, right?

484
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,984
Yeah. It's all a ploy.

485
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,020
You know I love you, right?

486
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:46,497
You know that. I was worried
about you because I love you.

487
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,863
- And you think I'm crazy?
- No, not crazy.

488
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,230
Oh, right.

489
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:57,536
Sick. Mentally unstable. Suddenly
plagued by a psychiatric illness.

490
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,043
Truth is I was having
a pretty good time.

491
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,242
I want you to come
back to Chicago with me.

492
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,747
Oh, wow. That
sounds like a lot of fun.

493
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:12,391
Maybe you could
call the MPs again.

494
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:15,685
Eric, you've seen this.

495
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,388
You know if you don't stay
medicated, it can get bad. I mean, bad.

496
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,428
- You could end up wasting...
- Abby, she's right here.

497
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,570
I know she is. It's not a secret.
She knows it. She'll tell you.

498
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,707
She will tell you.
Mom, tell him.

499
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,101
Tell him, Mom!

500
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,710
Mom, tell him.

501
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,288
I'll be in the waiting room.

502
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,322
- What the hell, Abby?
- Yeah, what the hell?

503
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,163
You called her?

504
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,167
You didn't...? It took
me three days to find you.

505
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,464
- I talked my way in here.
- I didn't ask you to.

506
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:03,803
But you called her? The most unreliable,
undependable person in our lives?

507
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:07,538
- And you're dependable.
- Yeah. To you, I am. Yes.

508
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,481
Then I'm sorry.

509
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,780
I have to apologize
to poor Abby.

510
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,921
Poor, poor Abby.

511
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,021
My career is over, but she
doesn't get to be the savior again.

512
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,957
You need help. Mom screwed
up the first time you went to her.

513
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,097
One, I don't need help.

514
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,790
And two, I didn't go to her.

515
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,498
She thought she saw something.
She dragged me to her doctor.

516
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,469
I went to make her happy, and
her doctor proved her wrong.

517
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,398
She wasn't wrong.

518
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,739
Then why am I not
allowed to call her?

519
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,549
Better get going, sergeant.

520
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,485
Hey, make sure you
check my knee too.

521
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:52,091
It's killing me. I hit it
on the steering column.

522
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,487
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

523
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,494
Then get me something
for the pain, brother.

524
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,293
All the alcohol wasn't
enough, brother?

525
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,800
- I only had one beer.
- This the driver?

526
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,566
Right-side tenderness.
The ultrasound looks clear.

527
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,607
Hey, what's your problem, man?

528
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,781
You got Tourette's or something?

529
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,048
- Did you do it?
- Ask me in six hours.

530
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,845
The transplant team's working.

531
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,617
- Did you talk to the father?
- Large seat-belt contusion.

532
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:29,023
- Safety first. LANCE: They
let you be a doctor like this?

533
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,093
Only on the patients
they don't care about.

534
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,899
Hey, did you just dis me,
man? I think he just dissed me.

535
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,036
Do you know what you did?

536
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,263
- Do you have any idea?
- Yeah. I banged up my knee.

537
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,739
You killed a whole family!
A mother, her two kids!

538
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,242
- No. I hit a snowman.
- They were making a snowman, you jerk!

539
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,711
Perhaps you should help
out with another patient.

540
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,754
You have to give him time, Abby.

541
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:09,793
Oh, now you speak?
Now you have an opinion?

542
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,767
He can't feel we're
ganging up on him.

543
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,905
- Just don't push him.
- I didn't push him.

544
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:23,048
You were already talking
about going back to Chicago.

545
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,712
They are discharging
him, Mother.

546
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:31,118
Where do you suggest we put him
up, in a psychiatric hospital in Omaha?

547
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,826
I'm not so sure he
should be hospitalized.

548
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,725
Well, that's not
really your decision.

549
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,126
Is it yours?

550
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,132
You know, he only looks
normal because he's on Depakote.

551
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:47,762
- And if you had seen him...
- I know the pathology, sweetie.

552
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:54,974
And, yes, the easy thing would
probably be to try to commit him.

553
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,611
Easy?

554
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:01,914
But he's got to accept the
disease, accommodate it.

555
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:07,526
And until he does, he needs to be
supervised or he will go off his meds.

556
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,856
You always did.

557
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,927
Well, he probably will
at one time or another.

558
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,300
But, Abby, trust me
on this. It's like AA.

559
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,444
It's got to be his decision.
He's got to want it.

560
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,602
And it's way too early for that.

561
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,338
Mom...

562
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:33,349
I have been living with
this disease my entire life.

563
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,544
Please don't lecture me on it.

564
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,448
I know you've been living
with this your entire life...

565
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,355
- but you've never been inside it.
- What is that?

566
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,189
What is that? "Inside it"?

567
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,560
Like you two have some
sort of special bond now?

568
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,668
- Because you're both inside of it?
- Abby, stop it.

569
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:53,863
This is about Eric. You can't
go back to the way you two were.

570
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,871
There's no quick fix.

571
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,808
Your brother will be struggling
with this for the rest of his life.

572
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,080
Abby.

573
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,818
- Has she been vomiting?
- Twice this morning.

574
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,583
She started to run a
fever so I brought her in.

575
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,350
Is anybody else sick at home?

576
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,928
Her little brother had an earache a
couple days ago, but he seems fine.

577
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,032
- Let's take a look. LANCE:
God knows where they've been.

578
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,897
Well, you can't take my blood
alcohol. I don't give you permission.

579
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,663
We don't need your permission.

580
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,569
- So you hungry at all, Kiley?
- No.

581
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,336
- Any diarrhea, Mom?
- No.

582
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,410
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

583
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,246
It was an accident. I scared
her more than anything else.

584
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,251
- Are you all right?
- Did you hit the TM?

585
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,083
He just jammed
that thing in her ear.

586
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,954
- I don't think I really hurt her.
- Well, why is she crying?

587
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,254
- Here.
- Where you going?

588
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,094
- I'm going home.
- Come back here and finish the workup.

589
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,429
No, thank you.

590
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,820
We were able to get
Matt stabilized on bypass.

591
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,252
The transplant team's at work.

592
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,616
Is there anybody
you'd like me to call?

593
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,129
When will you know?

594
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:30,767
It's a delicate procedure,
especially on children.

595
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,900
There's a waiting
room on the third floor.

596
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,602
I can't seem...

597
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,675
to walk out of this room.

598
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,477
What time is it?

599
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:51,123
It's almost 5.

600
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:56,120
I'd be getting home about now.

601
00:34:57,162 --> 00:35:00,792
Silvia would probably pick
up a pizza or some Chinese...

602
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,800
because she got busy
with the boys after school...

603
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,767
and didn't have time to cook.

604
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:13,206
Toby would have a picture that he
drew that he'd want me to look at.

605
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,209
And Matt would want
me to test him on his math.

606
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,053
You made the right decision.

607
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,916
The only one you could.

608
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,026
We woke up this morning...

609
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,355
everything was white.

610
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,029
They were so happy.

611
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,195
We all got to stay home.

612
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,209
It may not seem like it...

613
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,204
but I know what you're feeling.

614
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:53,910
- I understand what you're feeling.
- I'm sorry, doctor, but you...

615
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,544
You don't know what I'm
feeling. You don't have any idea.

616
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,452
I don't even know.

617
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:14,501
My husband... his name
was Mark. He died...

618
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:19,901
My God, I was about to say last
year. It was only six months ago.

619
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,083
I tried to pretend...

620
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:33,851
once Mark was gone, that I could
pull myself up, continue like normal.

621
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,059
But it doesn't work like that.

622
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,601
You see, you can't
run away from it.

623
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,938
It's like this big,
relentless wave...

624
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,002
that you have to ride.

625
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:58,041
But in riding it, somehow...

626
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,243
you hold on to what you've lost.

627
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,721
And you find a way to
go on without shutting off.

628
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,919
It's not easy, but you do it.

629
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:21,531
I know... someday soon...

630
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,467
when you look into
your child's eyes...

631
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:31,408
all you will see are the
beautiful things that live on in him.

632
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,753
He needs to be okay.

633
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:42,154
I need him to be okay.

634
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,358
He will be.

635
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,504
He will be.

636
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,911
Based on his testimony, they don't
have enough information to conclude...

637
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,549
- that he was mentally incompetent.
- Why is he here?

638
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,618
- He's demanding due process.
- He needs to stay medicated.

639
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,721
I'll contact the
convening authority...

640
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:12,323
to get him released
from pre-trial confinement.

641
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:17,553
The door doesn't open from the inside.
Pick up the phone when you're finished.

642
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,939
- You requested a court martial?
- No.

643
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,439
- That's what the lawyer says...
- I was gone less than 30 days.

644
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,943
The worst they'll do is discharge me,
maybe a couple weeks' confinement.

645
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,241
You don't have a
couple of weeks.

646
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,814
I haven't hurt anyone.

647
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,079
I haven't broken any laws. I
haven't acted irresponsibly.

648
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,156
- I just needed a change.
- You went AWOL.

649
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,623
That's between me and them.

650
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,088
They want me to say
I'm crazy. I won't say it.

651
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,163
- Nobody's saying you're crazy.
- You are.

652
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,994
- No, I'm not.
- Come on, Abby. You were there.

653
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,535
You even tried to hide it
from me. Mom was crazy.

654
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,832
She was out-of-her-mind
crazy. And I'm not like that!

655
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:05,940
I'm not her.

656
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,845
You can say it all you want.

657
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,782
I'm not her.

658
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,358
Hey.

659
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:28,194
Shirley, she said she saw you out
here on her break almost an hour ago.

660
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,994
You okay?

661
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,468
No symptoms.

662
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,269
It's perfect timing, huh?

663
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,878
You need something?

664
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,487
I owe it to you to give you
this in person. Your evaluation.

665
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,791
- You're not going to open it?
- Open it for what?

666
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,498
There's no middle
ground with you, is there?

667
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:07,196
- Blind optimism or self-pity.
- It's just the truth.

668
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,674
It's gonna cripple me.

669
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:19,180
Just when I learn how to deal
with another symptom, it progresses.

670
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,582
- What were you expecting?
- Time.

671
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,855
I expected time.

672
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,852
Enough time to figure out a...

673
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,397
Time's gonna kick my ass.

674
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,430
So, what, that's it?

675
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,231
You're just gonna give in?

676
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,700
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- No.

677
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,868
No. I wanted you to
recognize your limitations.

678
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,073
I thought you were
trying to prove something.

679
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:55,652
But you probably saved
that little boy's life today.

680
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:59,790
You connected with his father
when he was completely lost.

681
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,393
You guided him to
make the right decision.

682
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:07,958
Any idiot can suture a
wound, put in a chest tube.

683
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:14,098
But you have a gift, Mr. Nathan.
The gift of a physician.

684
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:19,173
Now it's up to you to decide
if you want to share that gift.

685
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,674
And then find a way.

686
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,849
By the way, I keep my promises.

687
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,959
I failed you.

688
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,954
All they have is Diet Shasta.

689
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:11,528
- They still make this?
- I hope so.

690
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,491
Um...

691
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,227
They might ask you
to testify, you know.

692
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,163
Yeah.

693
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,571
Mom, I need you to be with me
on this. He can't stay in military jail.

694
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,712
I'm with you.

695
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,551
I'm sorry.

696
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:48,360
I'm just scared for
him... and I'm angry.

697
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,895
I'm angry at you for
having to do this again.

698
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,530
- And you didn't do anything.
- No.

699
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:02,108
- You're angry at me for giving it to him.
- No, no. I didn't...

700
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,349
I know you feel
like a mother to him.

701
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:09,476
Why shouldn't you? You practically
raised him. You have a right.

702
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:13,486
But I'm his mother
and I gave it to him.

703
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,586
I gave it to my son.

704
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,094
All I can do now...

705
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,424
is try to be his mother.

706
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:31,273
- I'm sorry. I gave his lawyer this number.
- I'm gonna try to find us a hotel room.

707
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,775
This may take a few days.

708
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:38,439
Hello?

709
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,381
<i>Hey, you turned
on your cell phone.</i>

710
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,522
- Hi.
<i>- Well, did you find him?</i>

711
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,386
Yeah, I found him.

712
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,652
They might court-martial
him, but I found him.

713
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,058
<i>Did you tell them
that he's sick?</i>

714
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,466
They already knew.
It's a long story.

715
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,763
- You still snowed in?
<i>- Oh, the city's a mess.</i>

716
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,906
How are you holding up?

717
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,585
- Do we have any spare monitors?
- For what?

718
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,347
- Fiber-optic otoscope.
- Oh, try Trauma Hall.

719
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:20,115
Good news. Your
appendix appears normal.

720
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:23,318
- No swelling or inflammation.
- Can she get something to eat?

721
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,759
- She's getting her appetite back.
- A good sign.

722
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,990
- What do you feel like eating, Kiley?
- Pizza.

723
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,930
Pizza. That sounds good.

724
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,866
But you should have some
soup until your tummy's settled.

725
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,335
All right. CT's negative.
She can go home.

726
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,805
Drink some clear liquids,
and come back tomorrow.

727
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,500
Excuse me, Dr. Weaver.

728
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,943
- I never finished checking Kiley's ear.
- You don't have to. We're fine.

729
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:45,015
It's okay. I'm not
gonna hurt her.

730
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,049
- Can you help me?
- Tell him we're fine.

731
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:49,119
Don't worry. She's safe.

732
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,085
I think I saw something...

733
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,590
so I want you to
hold the scope...

734
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,795
and put it in your ear very gently.
You even get to watch it on TV.

735
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:01,729
- Me?
- Yeah. You get to be the doctor.

736
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:06,863
- Is that my ear?
- Actually, it's your eardrum.

737
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,237
- Gross.
- Use cotton swabs?

738
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,535
- Yeah, every night. NATHAN:
See, that's the problem.

739
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:15,235
The cotton swab rubs the protective
wax. It can cause an ear infection.

740
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:18,941
- And what can you do about that?
- Well, I could give her some drops.

741
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,587
It's better if she never sticks anything
in her ear smaller than her elbow.

742
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:26,713
- My elbow? I can't fit my elbow.
- You can't?

743
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,258
- Mr. Nathan, are you almost finished?
- Yeah, almost.

744
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:32,693
- You're needed upstairs.
- What is it?

745
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,924
Field is dry.
Anastomosis site's intact.

746
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:40,730
You're either gonna make me famous
or get me arrested for cases like this.

747
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,840
Dr. Nathan, Dr. Carmichael.

748
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:45,327
I toil for eight hours,
and you get the honors.

749
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:47,242
- Excuse me?
- Over here.

750
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,937
Cardioplegia
solution is withdrawn.

751
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,413
Okay. Shut it down.

752
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,214
This is where you jump from the plane
and hope you packed the chute correctly.

753
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,880
Better grab those paddles.
- What?

754
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,954
Paddles. We're gonna need them.

755
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,524
V-fib.

756
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,732
That's your cue.

757
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,607
Clear.

758
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:29,051
Heart rate, 70. - Wow.

759
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:34,084
And that, my friends,
makes it all worthwhile.

760
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,955
Start the epi. Take
down the catheters.

761
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,595
I guess his brother
will always be with him.

762
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:44,963
Wow.
