1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:11,136
How you doing? How you doing?

2
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,644
How...? How you doing? How
you doing? How you doing?

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:17,443
Hey, why is there a rule-out
MI parked in the elevator lobby?

4
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,529
Because there's no beds.
- Two's open.

5
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,782
Two was open.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,617
Lithobid, 300 in 5,
50 of Benadryl in 6.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,988
I know the system is overwhelmed,
but you gotta manage better.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,653
Kerry, I swear to you I'm about to
lose it. Unless you wanna take over...

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,924
Move all non-criticals
off of monitored beds...

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,262
and into the hallway,
treat and street triage.

11
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,461
Have you seen the hallways?

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:38,999
Does he have to be here?

13
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,301
- He can go when his banana bag's done.
- Then do it outside.

14
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,944
Are you serious? ALL: Yes!

15
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,477
Room 1847, please.

16
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,808
- Gallant, is this guy yours?
- Yeah, yeah.

17
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,280
- Mr. Fierson?
- Come on, get out of my way.

18
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,585
- Eric Wyczenski. WEAVER:
Okay, I'll lean on Mercy...

19
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:57,418
- see if they can accept some overflow.
- Break some legs if you have to.

20
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,253
It's Abby. I'm totally
swamped here.

21
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,363
I'm not gonna be able to make lunch.
Page me and we'll reschedule for dinner.

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,466
- Frank, call Security.
- You have to let me go!

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,266
- How'd your patient get the needle box?
- I'm not part of the place!

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,429
You'll kill me! You'll kill me!

25
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,633
Mr. Barney, we don't wanna
kill you. We wanna help you.

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,209
- You...
- I take it you called Security.

27
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,541
You can't keep me here!

28
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,684
Probably out ticketing our cars.

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,649
Are those the guys that plant
orange stickers on our bumpers?

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,380
- They're multitalented.
- They're impossible to get off.

31
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,687
Try Goo Gone. Or Goo...
Goo Off from Pep Boys.

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,692
- Really? That works?
- Comes right off.

33
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,694
Know how to get blood
out of white suede?

34
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,799
Try white vinegar and club soda.

35
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,960
- Really?
- Hey. How you doing?

36
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,003
Groovy. How you doing?

37
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,380
Damn.

38
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,925
Hey, check this out.
Foreign body, 10 inches.

39
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,223
- Uh-huh.
- Extra-large vibrator, still on.

40
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:47,891
I'm gonna show you my bowling
pin x-ray. Little guy but very flexible.

41
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,502
My pain is 10 out of 10!

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,765
- Mr. Mullen, today is not a good day.
- I know. I got a slipped disk.

43
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,202
I need a pain shot.

44
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,534
I just saw him bending
over the water fountain.

45
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,078
I've seen him in here 15
times asking for Demerol.

46
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,966
You're Security,
we're doctors, okay?

47
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,050
We shouldn't have to take
down a needle-throwing psychotic.

48
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,654
We can't be everywhere at
all times. Simple law of physics.

49
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,723
- We need you here when we call.
- We've been through this.

50
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,622
- Why can't we hire a new company?
- Hey, I'm understaffed...

51
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,992
- MVA rolling up.
- I got turnover up the wazoo.

52
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:20,601
Ten bucks an hour is not gonna
keep any half-decent guys here.

53
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,207
- What's open?
- You're kidding.

54
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,205
Harkins, get on up. You're with me.
- I am in agony here!

55
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,637
- Turf this guy. PRATT: No,
I'm waiting for him to LEBS.

56
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,573
- LEBS?
- "Leave without being seen." LEBS.

57
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,736
GC is 14, no LOC,
BP and pulse stable.

58
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,974
- I am not leaving! Give me my shot!
- Can you tell me your name?

59
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,947
Anonymous.

60
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,451
- Hey, Morales! Move your patient.
- I'm waiting for a bed.

61
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,758
Have you been
drinking, Anonymous?

62
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,326
I thought he was nice.

63
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,986
He paid me extra. Then he tried
to run me over with his Mercedes.

64
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,999
- Oh, God! Did you call the police?
- Yeah, I got them on speed dial.

65
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,797
We got swelling to the
right lateral malleolus.

66
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,271
- We got abrasions to the left forearm.
- I think she's posturing.

67
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,467
No. She's greedy.

68
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,507
- Can you let go?
- I worked hard for that!

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,980
She'll put it in a safe
place. Does this hurt?

70
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,346
- Does this hurt?
- Lower.

71
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,077
- Right in here?
- Yep.

72
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,485
Bilateral lower quadrant
tenderness. What next?

73
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,124
Ask if she sees a gynecologist.

74
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,356
- Do you see a gynecologist?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,087
Every Sunday after confession.

76
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,824
One, two, three.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,798
How'd he fall? He
can barely move.

78
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,289
- They gave him a bath.
- Are you in pain, Mr. Berk?

79
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,464
- He's gorked out.
- What nursing home?

80
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,667
- Garden Sunrise in Schaumburg.
- Sunset is more like it.

81
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,904
Yeah. I wouldn't send my mom
to that dump. I hate my mom.

82
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,913
This the hip fracture? - Yeah.

83
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,311
Hard to get a baseline.

84
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,983
- End stage Huntington's.
- Luka's screaming for you.

85
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,021
Says he's been waiting for 45
minutes for a lighted speculum.

86
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,887
- I'm an hour and 45 minutes behind.
- Great.

87
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,187
Piss him off some more.

88
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,854
Protecting his airway. That's
a clue. What do we know?

89
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,193
Huntington's. Hits you
in your 30s and 40s.

90
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,359
Starts with emotional
lability, depression.

91
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,734
Leads to progressive loss of
motor control and cognitive function.

92
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,205
Death in 10, 20 years.
He's been diagnosed for 15.

93
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,367
- Let's roll him.
- What's he pissed about?

94
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,212
Well, hurt.

95
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,515
- About what?
- Abby.

96
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:20,650
Oh, no. He doesn't care.
Ew, nasty pressure sore.

97
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,547
Ten by 18 centimeter decubitus.

98
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,749
- Have you talked to him about it?
- Why?

99
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,258
I don't have to. He's fine.

100
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,348
- Is that sacrum?
- To the bone.

101
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,522
We got this. Will you
get him his speculum?

102
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,994
Hey, Abby. I need a
frog-leg finger splint.

103
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,229
Try Central.

104
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:42,573
Abby. I need a detox bed for
the child prostitute in the hall.

105
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,837
- They're as jammed as we are.
- She's 12 years old.

106
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,346
- Cocaine, probably crack.
- Okay, I'll see what I can do.

107
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,508
- PID?
- Tubal-ovarian abscess.

108
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,383
- Oh, lovely.
- Hey, how does Original Thai sound?

109
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,682
We take your brother out. I hear
embarrassing childhood stories.

110
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,556
- He's allergic to MSG.
- That's unfortunate.

111
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,993
I really think we
should switch places.

112
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,463
Come on. Keep it coming.

113
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,932
- Kovac's pelvic exam?
- Curtain 3.

114
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,739
- You push enough Valium?
- Any more and he'd be unconscious.

115
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,807
- Ah!
- Damn.

116
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,069
- Let him pick the place.
- He doesn't know any.

117
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,444
First time in Chicago?

118
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,706
Usually we have to
meet up in a strange city...

119
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,441
in front of some
psychiatric institution.

120
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,609
- You said your mom sounded fine.
- She is.

121
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,653
- She does. She's fine.
- Good.

122
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,654
How about Morton's?
He's not a vegetarian?

123
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,759
No. Beef's good.

124
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,261
- You started.
- Finished.

125
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,294
Didn't know when you'd get here.
- Done?

126
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,660
Yeah. You can put your
legs down, Mrs. Lundgren.

127
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,301
Effie, please.

128
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,959
Lundgren's my husband's name.

129
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,106
Mrs. Lundgren tried to
vacuum out her period.

130
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:50,506
- Menstrual extraction. Common practice.
- Practice for what?

131
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,623
The day when the men who run the
world take away your freedom of choice.

132
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,558
Until then, you
could perforate your

133
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,948
uterus, end up infertile,
or bleed to death.

134
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,586
If men needed abortions...

135
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,622
there'd be drive-throughs with
beer on tap and TVs tuned to ESPN.

136
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,816
It's no reason to
do this to your body.

137
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,684
You gotta wake up, honey.

138
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,626
- We're at war.
- Conscientious objector.

139
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:16,799
CBC, type and screen,
beta, and a urine.

140
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,370
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

141
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,371
Honey, I don't have anywhere
to go or anyplace I'd rather be.

142
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,111
Are you taking any
oral contraceptives?

143
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,546
You wanna give me a reason to?

144
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,183
Birth control pills can increase
your risk of getting blood clots.

145
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,519
- Here, lift your leg for me, please.
- You say that to all the girls.

146
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,685
- These are yours.
- Thanks.

147
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,361
That's it? "Sorry" and "thanks"?

148
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:52,501
- What do you want from me, Kathy?
- Nothing. I don't want anything.

149
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,137
- ICON too?
- What?

150
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,143
Menstrual extraction.
Want an ICON too?

151
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,509
Yeah. If she wants me to do...

152
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,049
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,086
That was just...

154
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,014
- You know.
- Yeah.

155
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,317
But are you okay?

156
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,828
Yeah, managing 14 patients,
little too much grappa last night.

157
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,558
- Other than that...
- Other than that?

158
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,637
Yeah, I'm... I'm
happy for you, Abby.

159
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,578
- A golf ball?
- The size of a golf ball.

160
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,448
Around your fallopian
tube, near your ovary.

161
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,082
What do you do to get rid of it?

162
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,748
Antibiotics might clear it up.

163
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,759
If not, laparoscopic surgery.

164
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,696
- It's sexually transmitted.
- No duh. I ain't stupid.

165
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,395
Well, maybe you can tell me
your name. Your real name.

166
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,934
Tina. Tina Jones.

167
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,272
Well, Tina Jones, I don't
know what got you in here at 12.

168
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,846
But if you want
to make it to 20...

169
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,276
you gotta stop smoking crack.

170
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,315
- I can get you into a detox bed today.
- Yeah. That'll fix everything.

171
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,479
That'll fix one thing.

172
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,791
Then maybe you can
get started on the rest.

173
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,450
Carter, Lewis wants you to
ship McPheny to outpatient.

174
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,154
- Not now, Malik.
- When do I get my money back?

175
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,129
- After detox.
- You can't do that.

176
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,300
Sleeping with
strangers for money.

177
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,462
That's what you want?

178
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,039
I gotta take care of myself.

179
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,568
Well, I'm trying to give
you a chance to do that.

180
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,646
You don't know what it...

181
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,274
You don't know.

182
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,387
I know it's not too late.

183
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:54,283
School, friends...

184
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,823
birthday parties.

185
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,299
The things a girl your
age should be doing.

186
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,833
You have a choice.
I'm giving it to you.

187
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,971
Carter, high-speed
MVA coming in.

188
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,970
Excuse me.

189
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,506
Excuse me.

190
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,837
I will be right back.

191
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,193
Excuse me. You Dr. Carter?

192
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,180
- Hey, you...
- Hey, Gallant.

193
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,819
Why is Stella on
the monitored bed?

194
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,551
Positive Homan's.
She could have DVT.

195
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,021
- Sorry. Quick question.
- Triage. Down the hall.

196
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:29,458
Get a venous Doppler and then street
her. You are not her personal physician.

197
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,528
I'm looking for Abby.
She's a nurse here.

198
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,327
- You Eric? Hey, John Carter.
- Yeah.

199
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,063
- Sorry. Things are crazy today.
- The guy at the desk told me you closed.

200
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,036
I was expecting
you in your uniform.

201
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,505
- Well, I'm undercover.
- Dr. Carter? Excuse me.

202
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,202
- Pathology won't analyze a foreign body.
- Get a Polaroid for the records.

203
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,711
- How do I get a camera?
- Look.

204
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,761
Do I have to puke to
get some attention?

205
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,545
We have heart attacks, strokes and
bleeding ulcers. They're all ahead of you.

206
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,744
- Abby.
- What?

207
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,185
- I have been here for four hours.
- How are you?

208
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,668
You haven't done a thing.
- What you doing here?

209
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,527
- I thought you were gonna feed me.
- I'm in pain. Hey!

210
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,424
- I am talking to you.
- Pratt!

211
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,858
No. Not him. He
doesn't want to help me.

212
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,062
Dr. Pratt is only concerned that
you're building up a tolerance.

213
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,198
- Yeah. Well, that's why I need more.
- Is it like this every day?

214
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,004
Who the hell are you?

215
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,578
- Eric.
- Well, yes, Eric...

216
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,080
I'm in pain every day. And they
don't wanna do anything to help me.

217
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,447
If I came in a suit and tie, they'd
give me my meds in two minutes.

218
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,779
- Yeah. Get out of here.
- Well, it's about time!

219
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,550
Oh, wait a minute. Vicodin?

220
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,420
- Take it or leave it.
- One Vicodin's not gonna do it.

221
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,824
That's all you're gonna
get. Go play Lake Shore.

222
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,692
- Hello? Hello?
- Oh, yeah, thank you. Thanks very much.

223
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,630
You think you're a bunch of
heroes or something. Look around!

224
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:46,603
You are not doing anything!
You're not helping anyone!

225
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,435
Hey! Get out of here!

226
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,105
We like excitement.

227
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,109
- Did you hear she got a dog?
- Yes.

228
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,151
Dumpy? Is that right?

229
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,950
Because he was
dumped at the pound?

230
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,615
Yeah. Turns out he's
got a vitamin deficiency.

231
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,355
He needs a special diet so she cooks
him bacon and eggs in the morning.

232
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,793
Never made me breakfast.

233
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,662
- But she'll cook for the dog.
- Oh, no. She cooked for you.

234
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,463
Well, she can cook for the
zoo as long as she's happy.

235
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,072
I mean...

236
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,834
she's good, even. I
think, maybe this time...

237
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,342
Maybe.

238
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,877
Thanks.

239
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,613
I'm sorry I wasn't
there the last few times.

240
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,147
It's okay.

241
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,920
No guilt. It's not our
fault. Remember?

242
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,826
- Where's the Baggie of fingertips?
- In Exam 2.

243
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,896
- The cops brought them in before the run.
- It ain't there. Chen's freaking out.

244
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,000
- Baggie of fingertips?
- Yes.

245
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,262
Neighbors trimmed their hedge
by hoisting a lawnmower in the air.

246
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,939
- Thank you.
- Teamwork.

247
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,941
I don't think I'm gonna get a break
so we should meet at your hotel at 6.

248
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,773
- Adele Neuman for you on two.
- Can you take a message?

249
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,245
Seven would be better. Then we
can go out to dinner, show you the city.

250
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,250
I can't because I gotta
get an 8:15 bus to Offutt.

251
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,446
- Offutt? What's Offutt?
- Offutt Air Force Base, my new station.

252
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,615
- Abby? I need a transfusion set up in 5.
- Okay, in a minute.

253
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,920
- Menstrual extraction victim.
- You cleared her.

254
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,529
No, a different one.
Some kind of party.

255
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,928
- One hell of a party.
- You're getting transferred?

256
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,068
Re-assigned. Gotta
report in the morning.

257
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,259
Again?

258
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,702
- Yeah. It's the Air Force.
- Okay. Can you hold this for a second?

259
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,364
Okay, blow out all your air.

260
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,032
Now breathe in.

261
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,438
- Right there, honey.
- Yeah.

262
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,911
- Order a right upper quadrant ultrasound.
- Have you seen a Bag...?

263
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,051
- Bucket of ice by the x-rays.
- Thank you.

264
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,048
Don't ask.

265
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,085
- When?
- Last week. Read your e-mail.

266
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,555
- Well, how come it's so soon?
- I'm sorry. That's top secret.

267
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,956
- Okay. I got them.
- What happened?

268
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,460
- Got here before they did.
- They're all in one bag?

269
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,259
- They didn't sort them at the scene.
- We need to sort them.

270
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,492
Okay. One minute.

271
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,564
- Where's this?
- Nebraska.

272
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,535
Hey! Yo, nurse!

273
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,499
Is she gonna get
her clothes back?

274
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,438
They're in a bag under the bed.

275
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,475
I heard it's kind of pretty.
It's closer to you, to Mom.

276
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,344
- Abby. LOL in 4 has diarrhea.
- Oh, good.

277
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,918
- You said you needed a stool sample.
- If you can scrape it off the floor.

278
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,919
Starting to appreciate
why you dissed me.

279
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,785
- Sorry.
- You actually like this?

280
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,717
Yeah. Not that different
from air-traffic controlling.

281
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,556
Without the menstrual extractions.
- Hey!

282
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,695
- Where are her shoes at?
- Yeah, in a minute.

283
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,162
You do what you
gotta do. I'll wait.

284
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,327
Okay, I'll be right
back. Hey, Frank.

285
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,938
Take care of my baby brother.

286
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,665
Is he potty-trained?

287
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,310
Pressure bottomed out.
- He's septic.

288
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,037
But he is so pale.
Is it a hematoma?

289
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,375
- Are you his nurse?
- No, I'm his mother.

290
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,813
Sixteen in the left AC.
He's still got good veins.

291
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,453
Get some O-neg from trauma,
type and cross four more.

292
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,215
Phillip, I'm sorry.

293
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:56,296
I... It was the best home that I
could... I could get. I don't have much.

294
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,522
Nothing definite. Get
me a triple-lumen kit.

295
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,724
Pressure's up to 86.

296
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,993
He's in pain. Can't you
give him something?

297
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,139
He had 200 of fentanyl. Could be
the cause of breathing problems.

298
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,137
But he's suffering.

299
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:12,677
Can't you see how much
he's suffering? Please.

300
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,476
- Morales? Morales?
- What?

301
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,551
- What are you doing?
- Loose connection.

302
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,354
Can I get a bed now?

303
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,821
This would go a lot faster if these
guys identified their own fingers.

304
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,553
What if we made a mistake?

305
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,698
Do you think this
is a pinkie or a ring?

306
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,694
Looks like a cocktail wiener.

307
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,994
Got Morales's TIA in 4.
- Oh, yeah.

308
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,934
- Put her on a 12 lead. I'll be there.
- You seen my brother?

309
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,700
- What's he look like?
- He's six feet, has brown hair.

310
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,241
Looks like he might be my brother.
- He's cute.

311
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,935
- He went to get coffee.
- Oh, yeah.

312
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,239
- The place was tripping him out.
- I wonder why.

313
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:52,010
Pratt, you have three thumbs. Unless
one of your patients is a circus freak.

314
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,950
- If you can do a better job, be my guest.
- I just did.

315
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,884
What's this? CHEN: Match game.

316
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,491
Pratt's having a little
trouble fingering it out.

317
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,927
- Aw...
- Come on. That's funny.

318
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,124
- So you got my detox bed?
- Oh, shoot!

319
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,928
- I have to call Adele back. Sorry.
- You didn't admit her?

320
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,763
No. They're clearing a space.

321
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,235
- Then where is she?
- Who?

322
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:16,399
My patient. She was there a second ago.
Somebody move the navicular fracture?

323
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,239
- I think she eloped.
- Why didn't you come and get me?

324
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,280
She didn't say anything. She
just took off with some guy.

325
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,278
- He asked me for her clothes.
- What?

326
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,081
He asked for her clothes.
I didn't know who she was.

327
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,986
- I asked you to get her a bed.
- I was trying to get a bed.

328
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,991
You think he was her
pimp or something?

329
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,790
Her pimp, her dealer, her boyfriend.
Damn it, I had her talked into it.

330
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,990
- Who let the guy back there?
- Hell if I know!

331
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,792
The world can
waltz right through.

332
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,493
- Dr. Carter.
- What?

333
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,797
Give me the shot now.

334
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,600
Now!

335
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,339
No, no, no, no, no! Nobody move.

336
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,206
All right. It's cool.
Nobody move.

337
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,447
- It's cool.
- No, it is not. It's not cool.

338
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,812
I am in pain.

339
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,553
I need Demerol, and
you're gonna give it to me.

340
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,588
Yes, I am. I am gonna...
Abby, go to drug lockup.

341
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,624
- Get a case of Demerol.
- I don't need a case. I just need...

342
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,784
I just need my
shot, 150 milligrams.

343
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,827
Okay, 150 milligrams then.

344
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,727
There's no
problem. It's all right.

345
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,599
- Look, no problem.
- No, we got a problem!

346
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,794
This is supposed to
be a county hospital!

347
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,029
Call the police.

348
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,106
- You're supposed to care.
- Call the police.

349
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,468
We care now.

350
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,471
Yeah. That's right, you do.

351
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,981
What's taking so long in there?
- I'm coming.

352
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,984
You care because I'm making
you care, because I got this gun.

353
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,555
Because I'm the one
who gets to decide.

354
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,225
- You don't have to.
- I get to decide who feels pain...

355
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,918
who's not gonna
feel pain, just like you.

356
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,693
Every day.

357
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,660
Show it to me.

358
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,832
Show me it. Show me the label.

359
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,773
- Abby?
- Stay right there, Eric.

360
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,742
Come on. Come on. Hurry up.

361
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,812
We're gonna give you the shot.

362
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,677
- Why don't you put the gun down?
- I'll hold onto it.

363
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,715
Okay. Where do you want it?

364
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,265
Why'd you wanna be a doctor?

365
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,667
Excuse me?

366
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,535
A doctor.

367
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,840
Was it the money?

368
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,509
That's part of it.

369
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,579
And what was the other part?

370
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,907
It's complicated.

371
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,978
Well, explain it to me.

372
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,812
I mean, you can't tell me that
you actually wanted to help people.

373
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,456
Or maybe you
did, right? Maybe...

374
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,863
Maybe you all wanted to help.

375
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:56,867
But then, little by little, you realized
there's just too many people to help.

376
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,732
Who's gonna survive?

377
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,712
Thank you.

378
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,088
Hey, remember this!

379
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,157
For next time.

380
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,424
How much did you give him?

381
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,993
Four hundred.

382
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,825
That'll do it.

383
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,133
- Is he breathing?
- What do you care?

384
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,836
I don't. Get some
Narcan off the rig.

385
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,339
We'll need to monitor his
breathing. Get a gurney.

386
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,501
Four-point restraint, put him
on a pulse ox and call Psych.

387
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,909
- You should go inside and lie down.
- I'm fine.

388
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,743
- Lie down.
- I don't need to lie down.

389
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,748
Where are you going?

390
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,347
What happened to the metal detectors?
- Not now, John.

391
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,288
- We were supposed to have those.
- It's all part of a security plan.

392
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,854
- What security plan?
- We're working on it.

393
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,891
- So you like it here then?
- Yeah.

394
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,728
Keeps the days from
blurring together, I think.

395
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,568
- What are you doing, Abby?
- You came on a wrong day.

396
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,641
From what I can tell, you're
smarter than most people here.

397
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,277
Smart enough to know you
shouldn't be working here.

398
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,309
That career advice is just
a little bit late but thank you.

399
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,549
You don't find it a
little self-destructive?

400
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:51,876
No.

401
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,920
No! Honestly, I think I'm happier
than I've been in a long time.

402
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,151
Besides the gun in
my face, you know?

403
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,326
What happened to med school?

404
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,162
I have to go back to work.

405
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,631
I'm sorry. But call me
and give me your numbers.

406
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,731
- I got three more hours.
- I'm already juggling 10 patients.

407
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,135
There's more stacking
up. I'm not gonna have time.

408
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,899
So call me and
have a great trip.

409
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,574
Okay?

410
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,177
Read the newspapers. Healthcare
expenditures are down over 30 percent.

411
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,317
I don't have to read
the papers! I'm here.

412
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,181
- Security is not a place to save money.
- Yeah. We're wasting it on patient care.

413
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,687
You know these aren't
the same budget cutbacks.

414
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,916
We were supposed to
have the metal detectors!

415
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,459
- It's not just the metal detectors!
- It's a start!

416
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,620
If you put them up,
you gotta man them.

417
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,129
Oh, that's a crazy idea.

418
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,290
I'll talk to the Medical
Executive Committee.

419
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,627
Where do you want him?

420
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,693
- Take him to the unit.
- We need it now!

421
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,272
We need a secure triage area, we
need more guards, we need better guards.

422
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,968
- You just work on clearing the board...
- I cannot clear that board!

423
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,376
I am treating a 12-year-old girl,
on the street, cracked up, PID...

424
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,709
tubal-ovarian abscess,
run over by a car!

425
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,579
I got two minutes
to spend with her.

426
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,687
- We're over capacity!
- We're buried...

427
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:05,291
- while we stand here arguing.
- I managed to talk her into detox.

428
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:09,394
Before I can get her a bed, we let
her pimp walk in and waltz her back out.

429
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,155
- I am just as frustrated as you...
- Do something about it!

430
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,232
I am!

431
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,297
You just treat your patients.

432
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,996
Wow. Way to go, boss.

433
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:25,138
Frank, where's the Yellow Pages?
- Bottom shelf.

434
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,310
Hey, in the future, can we try
not to agitate the drug seekers?

435
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,316
It's not my fault he
got a gun in here.

436
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,183
- I never said it was.
- What are you doing?

437
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,725
I'm ordering metal detectors.

438
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,692
Now you're talking. Get some
cattle prods while you're at it.

439
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,627
Shut up, Frank.

440
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,159
So he went home, got
the gun and came back?

441
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,236
Probably went to the corner, bought it.
- Dr. Lewis.

442
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,771
- God, sometimes I hate this place.
- Sometimes?

443
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,101
Pulse ox 90. He vomited
twice before I could turn him.

444
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,007
There's little use
for the peg now.

445
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,513
- He can't breathe. LEWIS:
Get a RT and set up for a vent.

446
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,516
Okay, he's full of junk. Aspirated
and decreased on the right.

447
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,417
Not again. His cords
are scarred from last year.

448
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,353
He was on the vent two months.

449
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,856
- Meds are in.
- Okay.

450
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:17,463
Be ready to roll him. The
etomidate could make him vomit.

451
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,196
Once you put that
tube in, that's it, right?

452
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,034
That's not coming out.

453
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,072
Yeah... Yeah, we want the bulletproof.
- What's he doing?

454
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,145
- Contracting out our new triage.
- Are we finally getting that?

455
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,714
Yeah. I've got the phony
purchase orders to prove it.

456
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,545
- What about Stella?
- She has a positive Murphy's sign.

457
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,710
Because you keep
feeding her cafeteria food.

458
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:45,187
- I still need to rule out cholelithiasis?
- Yes.

459
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,322
Get her out of here before she
presents with something else.

460
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,589
- She's gonna suck him dry, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

461
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,328
No, no. Sooner than that.

462
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,368
As soon as you can. Why don't
you come look at the space?

463
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,866
What are you doing?

464
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,335
I'm trying to make us all safer.

465
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:08,305
- You ordered six metal detectors, retail?
- Yes.

466
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,676
- They should be here in half an hour.
- No.

467
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:16,311
We have a procurement department
that handles all capital expenditures.

468
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,083
- You canceled it?
- Yes. I canceled it.

469
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:22,524
This is not your job. And
believe me, you don't want it.

470
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,959
We had another 15 percent
budget reduction again this year.

471
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,930
- I am trying to keep the doors open.
- Close them.

472
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,933
You shouldn't risk
your life to work here.

473
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,470
Of course not. But
be responsible about it.

474
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,505
You have to get competitive bids.
- No.

475
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,166
You know what's
irresponsible is letting this go on.

476
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,939
And I have been in staff
meetings 14 hours a month...

477
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:43,378
for the past two
years working on this.

478
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,381
Where have you been?

479
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,788
- Where are you going?
- The ambulance bay...

480
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,048
to wait for my metal detectors.

481
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,820
When he calms down,
have him see me.

482
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,864
Abby.

483
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,500
Answer the phone, Frank.

484
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,478
You know, we have
patients to care for.

485
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,639
He's right, Kerry.

486
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,501
You have a plan?

487
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,694
No.

488
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,514
Plain or peanut? - Huh?

489
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,445
M&M's.

490
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,347
No?

491
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,846
Gum? Cheetos?

492
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,084
- How about some nylons?
- What?

493
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,197
Well, I hear they sell panties
in vending machines in Japan.

494
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,194
Save your quarters.

495
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,200
You sure? You know, chocolate
is a universal comfort food.

496
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,066
Listen, I'm sorry
about what happened.

497
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,137
What?

498
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,211
The guy was a known drug hound.

499
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,714
And I wasn't gonna
play his game.

500
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,886
But you gotta understand, I would
never do anything to jeopardize you.

501
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,613
Carter, maybe.

502
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,155
But not you.

503
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,886
Not my future love slave.

504
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,295
Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

505
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,367
I get a little punchy when I
get nervous. I was scared too.

506
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,435
Oh. Oh, you... You were scared.

507
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,040
You know, I'm the one who
almost had a cap busted in my head.

508
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,740
Oh, oh, and that's funny too?

509
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,470
- Cap busted in your head. Come here.
- What?

510
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,342
- Come here.
- No. What are you doing?

511
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,245
- I'm consoling you.
- Well, don't.

512
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,249
Come here.

513
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,920
Come on.

514
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,014
All right?

515
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,668
You finished?

516
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,431
Yeah.

517
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,801
Plain.

518
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,406
I want plain M&M's.

519
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,141
Voilà.

520
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,848
Did you hear a fire alarm?

521
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,392
Oh, not another evacuation.

522
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,171
Now what?

523
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,671
I have no idea.

524
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,139
You got everybody
here. Say something.

525
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,303
- Why you talking like it's a prison break?
- In case this gets ugly.

526
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,642
- You don't know me?
- That's right.

527
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,311
Hey, what's going on?

528
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,587
Talk to Norma Rae.

529
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:12,147
We're not working until
they install metal detectors...

530
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,350
and get some
additional security.

531
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,755
- Really?
- Yeah.

532
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,862
Cool. My shift's over
in an hour anyway.

533
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,259
Looks like a showdown.

534
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,902
Listen up! Unless you
are on a scheduled break...

535
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,370
you are in violation of
your hospital contract...

536
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,374
and are all in danger
of being summarily fired.

537
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,774
Part of our contract guarantees
that the hospital provides us...

538
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,385
- with a safe working environment.
- Look, today's incident was horrific.

539
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,750
We are already taking steps to
ensure that it doesn't happen again.

540
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,857
You always say that.
Nothing ever happens.

541
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,220
- I don't always say that.
- We've heard it before.

542
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,692
And this is how you
choose to solve the problem?

543
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,728
Hey, what's going on?

544
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,599
We got a 62-year-old man,
hypotension, low back pain, BP's 80 palp.

545
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,898
- You need to do something about this.
- Everyone needs to get back...

546
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,564
while they still have a job.

547
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,734
Don't think about touching that patient!
- Get him in there.

548
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,678
Gallant, you are a student. You
don't have a contract, you just fail.

549
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,721
All right, let's go.

550
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,649
Could be a ruptured aneurysm.

551
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,727
Go, go, go.

552
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,012
Hi.

553
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,551
It'll be another couple hours
before I can get him up to the OR.

554
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,656
His sats have leveled off and we're
giving him as much pain medication...

555
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,588
as his blood
pressure can tolerate.

556
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,219
Do you know what it's like to
watch someone die for 25 years?

557
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,796
That's what I did with
his father, every day.

558
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:10,209
I mean, I loved the man.
But I hated what it did to him.

559
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,436
I can refer you to another nursing
home. I don't know what you're paying now.

560
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,780
He was a singer.
Did...? Did you know?

561
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,317
Opera singer. A tenor.

562
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,721
When he sang, it was the
most beautiful sound in the world.

563
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,615
And I...

564
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,722
I prayed it would pass him over.

565
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:39,471
When he got to be
29, I thought, "My God!

566
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,640
Maybe we got lucky."

567
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,738
Then he started
having trouble at work.

568
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,982
Forget things.

569
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,651
And when he'd talk, sometimes
it was hard to understand.

570
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,681
And of course...

571
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:07,163
Of course he
couldn't sing anymore.

572
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,800
It just takes everything away.

573
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,006
Everything.

574
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,503
Can I have a piece of paper?

575
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,682
What for?

576
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,507
I'm gonna start
work on my résumé.

577
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,520
- You'll be fine.
- I know.

578
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,457
Usually they just
decapitate the leaders...

579
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,389
and send the peasants back
to work tending the fields.

580
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,291
But thank you.

581
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,226
What took you so long?

582
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,030
Abby, I need a repeat blood
gas on my Huntington's patient.

583
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,365
- We're staging a walkout.
- Yeah, I get that.

584
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,030
I need a pH. He's
throwing PVC's.

585
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:53,167
In fact, I have 10 other patients on
monitored beds who no one is watching.

586
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,573
So maybe somebody
will pay attention.

587
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:22,071
- So you quit, go outside and pout?
- Too many patients.

588
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,335
No room, overwhelmed
staff, and it's dangerous.

589
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,536
We're not gonna be
able to treat anybody.

590
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,044
News flash. The
healthcare system sucks.

591
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:32,568
Our job is to treat
people in spite of it.

592
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:33,643
I can't. Not anymore.

593
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,880
I don't expect you or anybody
else here not to. But I can't do it.

594
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,302
Too bad that the
10-year-old arrests?

595
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,875
We've already had one staff
member murdered on duty.

596
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,773
And nothing happened.

597
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,278
I'm trying to save people
that roll in tomorrow.

598
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,279
I know. You're an
emergency-room doctor.

599
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,111
It's about getting
through the shift.

600
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,152
Do you even know how many
guns and knives pass through here?!

601
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:38,811
I don't. I do know how many people
are depending on us at this very moment.

602
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:43,080
I got stabbed, Lucy got killed, and today,
Abby and Chen get a gun to their head.

603
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,985
No. It's gotta stop.

604
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,750
Otherwise, it's not worth doing.

605
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,986
You know what? You fix tomorrow.

606
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,654
I have to go treat the
patients that need us today.

607
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,483
He coded?

608
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,233
- Think they closed the paramedic runs?
- Can't tell.

609
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,803
- You think that they replaced us all?
- I can't tell.

610
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,065
Think it's gonna rain?

611
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,108
Look, a new recruit.

612
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,713
Shouldn't she be
waving a white flag?

613
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,551
Dr. Carter, let's take a walk.

614
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:27,089
The metal detectors will be here
either tonight or tomorrow morning.

615
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:31,889
And we've accelerated our
negotiation with the new security firm.

616
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,256
- What about triage?
- Construction starts...

617
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,766
as soon as we can
approve the bids.

618
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,501
- Thank you.
- No. You don't get to thank me.

619
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,767
You go back inside
and clear off that board.

620
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,411
You are already
four hours behind.

621
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,173
- Fair enough.
- And it will be hard to avoid...

622
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,476
a disciplinary
committee hearing.

623
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:56,248
It's nothing personal. We
just need to protect our people.

624
00:35:56,421 --> 00:36:01,826
Yeah, well, speaking of that, I had
hoped to control some of these costs.

625
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,452
But now that we're paying
more for immediacy...

626
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,659
you'll have to offset that by either
laying off three senior nurses...

627
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:17,008
and hiring new grads or canceling
x-ray and lab service after 10 p.m.

628
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,006
- Whatever you think.
- No.

629
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:24,339
No, John. You forced us to
do it this way. You get to decide.

630
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:30,118
You can't run a trauma in the
middle of the night and go to the lab.

631
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,985
- Patient could be dead before you return.
- That's true.

632
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,289
Nurses then.

633
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,123
Three.

634
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,334
I want their names on my
desk first thing in the morning.

635
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,508
Congratulations.

636
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,342
Very nice. Very nice.

637
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,016
What? I know you're
not going inside.

638
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:04,713
- Oh, I got patients.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

639
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,916
Shouldn't you be getting some
very serious therapy right now?

640
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,995
What? And ruin all this hard
won repression and denial?

641
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,359
So you're serious, huh?

642
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,364
- Go home, Pratt.
- You sure you're good?

643
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,265
You know, it's not
your fault. Go home.

644
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,099
- You're okay?
- Stop asking me that.

645
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:24,174
- Okay.
- Yo! I-Am-Spartacus, come here.

646
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:28,507
That proletariat revolt you staged
left us a little short-handed down here.

647
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,545
- Did you think that was clever?
- Yeah.

648
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,183
It wasn't a joke.

649
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,014
I told Weaver to fire you but you
can't trust a lesbian to do a man's job.

650
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,749
So instead, I ended up babysitting
three gorks and a dirtball with the DT's.

651
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,860
Last time I did ER scut work, I
had a ponytail and a lava lamp.

652
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,757
I do not enjoy
revisiting those days.

653
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,227
- Am I clear?
- Yeah.

654
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,730
Dr. Romano, the
tab is A-negative.

655
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,562
Should we give her RhoGAM?

656
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:55,036
Some of the med students take their
oaths more seriously than the doctors.

657
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,437
Dr. Weaver cornered me
before I could get outside.

658
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,306
She gave me this speech about
what it means to be a doctor.

659
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,312
Well, that you need to
figure out all by yourself.

660
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,109
I'm looking for a doctor.

661
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:09,311
Why don't you try sitting in Chairs? Over
there. We'll be with you soon as we can.

662
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,922
True? Construction
is starting in a week?

663
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,424
I don't know. You know what
they say about construction.

664
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,231
- Nice work, Dr. Carter.
- Let's hope you feel that way tomorrow.

665
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,593
- What do you mean?
- Go home.

666
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,428
- And lie down?
- And lie down. Yeah.

667
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,765
Dr. Carter, I need you to sign
a Prevacid scrip for Exam 1.

668
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,804
- Stella?
- She still has esophageal reflux.

669
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,271
She's still here?

670
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,104
- I was outside with you.
- Which I appreciate.

671
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,046
- I'm looking for a doctor.
- Right here.

672
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:40,413
You'll need to take a seat. Someone
will see you as soon as they can.

673
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,213
I need to see him.
He works here.

674
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:44,498
Did he treat you for something?
- Security!

675
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,388
- I don't know how to get home.
- Security!

676
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:49,050
I can't help unless you tell
me who you're looking for.

677
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:51,526
- Just tell me where he is.
- We need you to leave.

678
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,757
- Hold on! Hold on!
- I don't know which way to go!

679
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,265
Where do you live? LEON: G!

680
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,767
- Get G! He's my brother!
- Who?

681
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:03,705
- Who is G? Who is he?
- G. Pratt! G. Pratt!

682
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,901
Somebody get Greg
Pratt for me, please?

683
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,808
- New career?
- I've been on hold for 15 minutes.

684
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:17,615
Hold that. Trubull's had his ReoPro.
Let's move him to the cath lab.

685
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,957
Shelby's chest is negative.
Let's treat him with ibuprofen.

686
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,595
Still waiting on the dig.
Level in 6. What's his name?

687
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,924
- Cordova.
- Yeah. Find him, get it, then find me.

688
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,897
Can you find my stethoscope?
I left it in the ambulance bay.

689
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,970
- Wasn't your shift over hours ago?
- Five and a half.

690
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,471
- How long are you staying?
- Until we clear the board.

691
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,075
So you decided to die here?

692
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,871
- Excuse me.
- I sent you home.

693
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,105
I was in the middle of six criticals
when that psycho came back.

694
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:46,581
- So go home now.
- I've got about a dozen charts to finish.

695
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,317
Forget the charts. I just got
stood up. Let's go hit a club.

696
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,512
- What?
- Hot date?

697
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,692
Hot. But clearly not datable.

698
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,827
Orbital's playing at
the Shadow Room.

699
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,587
What the hell?
I lost a patient...

700
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,322
almost got killed
by another. I'm in.

701
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,796
You too. Girls' night out?

702
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:06,666
- No, I think I'm gonna go home.
- Yeah. If I'm going, you're going.

703
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,164
You're asking him?

704
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:14,142
Okay. No late-night
confessions. No male strippers.

705
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:17,009
Okay. You got it.
Give me 10 minutes.

706
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,182
- What?
- What? Go.

707
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,978
Dr. Lewis?

708
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,246
- Dr. Sung on three.
- Who?

709
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,049
Primary on your Huntington's.

710
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:29,860
Dr. Sung? This is Dr. Lewis. I
saw your patient, Phillip Berk.

711
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:33,897
Right. He came in this morning with
aspiration, pneumonia and cellulitis.

712
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,557
We intubated him and
gave him antibiotics...

713
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,500
but he got septic and
died about an hour ago.

714
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,073
Have you seen him
in the last month?

715
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,006
Would you mind signing
the death certificate?

716
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:50,046
Yes. Yes, thank you. Thank
you. I'll send it right over.

717
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,878
No coroner?

718
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,850
We can release the
body to the mortuary.

719
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,694
- Are you older or younger?
- Older.

720
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:16,364
- His mama took me in when I was 9.
- Oh. Was she nice?

721
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,700
Not really.

722
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,876
And so, what
happened to your family?

723
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,673
Don't know, don't care.

724
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,112
G's my family.

725
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,887
- What happened to you?
- I went by the hospital.

726
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:33,491
- What? You got lost again?
- I remembered where the hospital was.

727
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,850
Come on.

728
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,756
Come on!

729
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:41,696
I tried to call. Nobody answered. So I
got Shannon to give me your address.

730
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,529
- That place sucks, G!
- Yeah, thanks.

731
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,439
I knew I threw my back
out as soon as I fell.

732
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,409
My chiropractor says
I got mild scoliosis.

733
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,242
Everybody's got mild scoliosis.

734
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,543
It's just something
chiropractors say.

735
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,050
- You can't give me anything?
- No. You'll be fine.

736
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,419
Donahue is guaiac negative,
Schwartz's repeat Accu-Chek is 87...

737
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:08,321
and the urine ICON is positive.

738
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,428
- Did you find my...?
- Can I go home now?

739
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:13,258
LOL with altered mental
status and abdominal pain.

740
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:14,865
- LOL?
- Little old lady.

741
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,261
- All right. Down to one board.
- Dr. Carter.

742
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,407
Thought you might
wanna sign for these.

743
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,509
Four entrances, six
metal detectors. Rush.

744
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,145
- Yeah, that's right.
- Sign there.

745
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,275
You gonna show me
where you want them?

746
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:33,646
- Right this way. MAN:
Oh, how you doing?

747
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:37,016
Don't make many night deliveries.
We gotta pull old ones out?

748
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:41,091
- No. These are the first.
- Hey, how you doing?

749
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,458
I'm good.

750
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,759
He gets defensive. "What
are you laughing at?"

751
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,768
And I thought, "He's not
bad-looking." I missed the signs.

752
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,429
That is the last
time I ask a guy out.

753
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,632
- Oh, you asked him out?
- Yes!

754
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,778
And he stands me up!

755
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,642
- Who was he?
- Oh, he's in venture cap...

756
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:08,150
Capitalism, or private
equity, something or other.

757
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,312
I don't know. One of those
undefinable money jobs.

758
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,857
Right now, you would probably
be sitting in his apartment...

759
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:19,327
listening to Thelonious
Monk or something.

760
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:20,829
You're right.

761
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:26,369
But women who date those kinds of men
don't get vomited on on a regular basis.

762
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,870
- Or get a gun to the head.
- Another one?

763
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,635
Yes, thank you!

764
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,511
- Want anything?
- No, thanks.

765
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:36,808
Where is she anyway?

766
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,041
I think she went
to the bathroom.

767
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,879
You think she'll be okay?

768
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,553
Yeah, I think she's
gonna be fine.
