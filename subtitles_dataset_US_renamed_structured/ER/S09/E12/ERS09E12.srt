1
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,179
He's a hard worker, he's
strong, he's got a great attitude.

2
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,384
- How's he gonna work with a bad hand?
- It don't hurt.

3
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,852
- The cast will be off in three weeks.
- Cool, G. You said six before.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,514
I've seen you around,
right? You, uh, work upstairs.

5
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,525
Yeah. I'm an ER resident.
All part of the County family.

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,529
I hate doctors. Y'all think you're
the queen of the damn Rose Parade.

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,724
I'm not a doctor.

8
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,504
Not the sharpest
nail in the box.

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,003
Just give him a
chance. You'll see.

10
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,839
Okay, kid. Let's talk. Alone.

11
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,671
All right, look. Listen, listen. I
gotta get back down to the ER.

12
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,340
Make sure you tell him that
you work real hard, okay?

13
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,985
- Okay, G.
- I'll see you at home.

14
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,053
- All right.
- All right.

15
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,518
I work real hard.

16
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,023
I don't want to be here.

17
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,895
Sand truck rolled
on I-40. Three DOAs.

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,367
Jessie Callahan, 35-year-old
restrained passenger.

19
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,702
High-speed T-bone, BP 122/78. Pulse
93, bloody scalp lac, she got a liter.

20
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,037
- Okay. Trauma 1.
- Tom? Where's Tom?

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,703
- Jessie, can you tell me where it hurts?
- I left Tom. I left him all alone.

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,192
Her husband's still in the car.
Fire department's cutting him out.

23
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,675
Paramedics are working on your
husband. Gonna let us help you?

24
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,515
So just Neosporin
on the abrasion?

25
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,091
And tell him to stop for a while
or he's literally going to jerk it off.

26
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,694
- Lewis. Paramedics pulling in with a fall.
- Okay.

27
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,525
Jerry, call the morons in Engineering
and tell them to get down here.

28
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,032
We're okay. Nobody
panic. Nobody panic.

29
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,898
And call Psych. The sun
goes down, the nuts come out.

30
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,300
Are we ready for him?

31
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,235
- Who?
- The alderman.

32
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,103
Have you been
drinking, alderman?

33
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,745
Hey, back up. You
can't come in here.

34
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,574
All right, keep them back.

35
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,911
- John Bright, 55, 8-foot fall off a stage.
- It was a dais.

36
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:02,421
BP 124/82, pulse 79. No LOC.
Complains of neck, hip and right knee pain.

37
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,491
Alderman, it's an honor to have
you here. I'm Dr. Kerry Weaver.

38
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,118
- Are you taking any medications, sir?
- No. And call me John.

39
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:14,000
Gently, people. CBC, chem
panel, type and hold, UA.

40
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,636
- Chest is clear.
- Chest is clear.

41
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:21,173
All right. Pupils 4
mm and reactive.

42
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,141
- Who you on the phone with?
- Uh, the office.

43
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,745
She's my assistant.
Jennifer, honey, try to breathe.

44
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:30,179
- Shut that cell phone off in here.
- You can use our phones. Just dial nine.

45
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,181
- Have you been drinking?
- You don't have to answer that.

46
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,448
No, I haven't. I'm on the
program. Just got my two-year chip.

47
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,759
Okay, then. Open wide
and stick out your tongue.

48
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:44,091
Okay. Don't worry, sir. You're
in the finest hospital in Chicago.

49
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,492
Okay.

50
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,647
The emergency power
will kick on any second.

51
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,851
- Let there be light.
- Shooting.

52
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,725
<i>Thank God something's working.</i>
Get that into Exam 2. Move it.

53
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,698
We're gonna take a scan of your belly to
make sure you're not bleeding internally.

54
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,564
- Is Tom here yet?
- We'll find out.

55
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,104
Come on. Get the lead out.
We got a VIP customer waiting.

56
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,207
- Leon, what are you doing? I work here.
- Me too, G. I got the job.

57
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,376
- Okay, good. That's great.
- It's cool, man.

58
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,715
Hey. Hey, this is
Dr. Weaver in ER.

59
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,554
Get your fat union asses
down here and fix the power.

60
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,626
Got the job! We're
gonna work together!

61
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,595
Pratt, hey, kiss your friend
goodbye and get back to work.

62
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,893
Hello.

63
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,400
- Damn it. Hello? LEON: It's
good. It's gonna work out...

64
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,163
Does anyone have
a carrier pigeon?

65
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,568
- Good.
- I get the overtime...

66
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,333
- Leon. How's it going?
- I got a job.

67
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,875
Glad to hear it. She's stable.

68
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,410
But check another HemoCue
before you send her to CT.

69
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,047
- She may need some blood.
- Okay.

70
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,581
You got nothing to
worry about. This is cool.

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,686
After I get off, we'll go to
Mario's, get pizza and celebrate.

72
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,413
No, G. I'm working
tonight on the late shift.

73
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,149
- Tonight?
- I get my own uniform. Isn't that cool?

74
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,762
- And you know where to pick it up?
- I got the address. They wrote it down.

75
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,264
- I can find it by myself.
- All right, good.

76
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,662
- Congratulations.
- Stop worrying, man.

77
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,598
We're gonna be
working together, man.

78
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,863
- We're gonna be working together, ha-ha.
- Shh, shh!

79
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,025
All right, G. I'll
see you later, man.

80
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:07,598
- All right.

81
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,506
Work on a press release and fax it
over. Somebody get me a fax number.

82
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,910
All right. Engineering is coming
down now to work on the power.

83
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,447
How are you feeling, alderman?

84
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,882
Pampered. I'm sure
you have other patients.

85
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,919
This ER sees about
90,000 a year, doesn't it?

86
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,456
- Hmm. That's why I'm tired all the time.
- More like 110,000.

87
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,457
It's a damn miracle
what you people do.

88
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:31,029
We have a great team. But we could
do more if we had better resources.

89
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,167
No medial or
lateral instability.

90
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,725
You probably tore a
ligament when you fell.

91
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,872
There goes my dream of being
an Olympic gymnast, ha-ha.

92
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,271
I'll page Dr. Hullverson. He's
our top orthopedist, excellent.

93
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,933
Give the alderman
six of morphine.

94
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,976
We should see
a tox screen first.

95
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,382
What? Who are you?

96
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,117
- Was it cocaine, alderman?
- Oh, my God. Get out.

97
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,651
Ray MacGee, <i>Chicago
Times.</i> I have a right to be here.

98
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,312
Listen, hey. Leave this
man alone. This is a hospital.

99
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,321
You ever heard of
the First Amendment?

100
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,824
Ever heard of an
awake colonoscopy?

101
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,657
Wherever you stole that
scrub top from, I want it back.

102
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,992
Jerry, can you try and
keep out the fake nurses?

103
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,462
So many rules to remember.

104
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,830
- Fake nurses?
- Uh, don't ask.

105
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:13,132
Don't we have enough
trouble with the real ones?

106
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,434
- Ah, looks busy.
- Lucky you.

107
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,237
I hate nights.

108
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,810
MVA coming in, two minutes.

109
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,642
- Is that from the I-40 pileup?
- That lady's husband.

110
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,793
I'm off. Can you make sure
somebody finds her if it is?

111
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,080
- Sure.
- Good.

112
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,811
Ooh, hot date?

113
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:31,948
No. I gotta give a check at
this symphony fundraiser thing.

114
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,151
- Lifestyles of the rich and famous, baby.
- Hey!

115
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,024
- Look what the patient fairy brought you.
- Ah, ha-ha, no.

116
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,292
Mrs. Hawkes, 44, fever,
cough times three days.

117
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,666
- I'm juggling 10 patients already.
- I'm just waiting for a chest film.

118
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:48,536
If it comes back clear, just write her a
little scrip, send her home. Easy dispo.

119
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,541
Okay. Probably just the flu.
Give it to Pratt. He'll hate it.

120
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,543
- Done.
- Ten minutes.

121
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,648
Ah, you two have fun.

122
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:59,484
- So you sure you wanna go?
- Definitely. Free canapés.

123
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,282
What is a canapé anyway?

124
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,855
- Don't worry. I'll use the right fork.
- Next time we'll do something fun.

125
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,553
Next time we'll do
something that you wanna do.

126
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,699
Oh, you mean like
miniature golf or bowling?

127
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,562
Things my people enjoy doing?

128
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,896
- It's too bad <i>Cats</i> closed.
- I'll just shut up now.

129
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,807
- That's sexual harassment, isn't it?
- You bet.

130
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,306
I'll circulate a petition.

131
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,910
- Excuse me. Dr. Carter, right?
- Yeah.

132
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,673
I'm Sarah Wilson. I
work with Dr. Mac.

133
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,578
Um, you called the clinic,
said he needed to come back.

134
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,049
Oh, yeah. He left before
his chem panel came back.

135
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,849
Oh, he's dizzy. He's dehydrated.
And I'm worried about his diabetes.

136
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,151
Yeah. Well, he really
needs to come in.

137
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,091
There are always patients at
the clinic. He won't leave them.

138
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,264
Uh-huh. And what, there's
nobody to cover for him?

139
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,731
A one-man show, seven days a week.
- Dr. Carter.

140
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,735
Another one from the pileup.
Pulse 110, 20-minute extrication.

141
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,429
Take a deep
breath, Mr. Callahan.

142
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,370
- My wife, Jessie...?
- Mr. Callahan. She's here. She's stable.

143
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,738
We'll let someone know
you're looking for her.

144
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,437
I need you to come down
to the clinic and talk to him.

145
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,708
- What makes you think he's gonna listen?
- Well, he likes you.

146
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:08,446
- Sure had a good way of hiding it.
- He's going to kill himself.

147
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:12,251
He won't listen to
me. Stop by, please.

148
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,865
- Carter.
- Just for a minute.

149
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,189
Calling for anesthesiology
backup in Scanner 2.

150
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,456
That's Pratt's patient.

151
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,622
Jessie Callahan. She
crashed on the CT table.

152
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,734
- Excuse me.
- Will you come?

153
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,268
Uh, if you leave the
address at the desk, I'll try.

154
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,464
She might not make it down.
Prep the rapid infuser in Trauma 1.

155
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,242
Pneumonia. Her right
lobe's completely socked in.

156
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,648
So much for an easy
dispo. Did you run labs?

157
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,052
White count is 27,000 with a left
shift. Gram-negative rods in the sputum.

158
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,954
Call ICU.

159
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,288
It's got to be klebsiella
or pseudomonas, right?

160
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,987
Yeah. Not good.

161
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,826
Sats are only 85 on two liters.

162
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,831
Crank her to five
liters, nasal cannula.

163
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,300
Get a gram of cefotaxime,
IV, and 500 of Biaxin.

164
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,935
This is Dr. Lewis.

165
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,141
I've never had flu this bad.

166
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,779
She's coughing a lot. Do you
guys have cough medicine?

167
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,415
We're giving her all the
medicine we can right now.

168
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,983
I need to talk to your
mom for a minute, okay?

169
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,519
Hey, you guys want a soda?

170
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,519
Go on.

171
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,354
- Is our mom really sick?
- Well, she has pneumonia.

172
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,194
It's a serious disease, but we're
doing everything that we can.

173
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,903
- We should call Doug...
- No. Mom would freak.

174
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,138
Call who?

175
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,333
Doug. He's our brother.

176
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,035
- Does he live with you?
- No. He's 20.

177
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,204
He has like 50 earrings.

178
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,647
I just need some sleep. Marten
never should have called 911.

179
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,051
Well, I'm glad he did. This type
of pneumonia's very dangerous.

180
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,987
My kids have homework.
They need dinner.

181
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,651
Mrs. Hawkes, you're too
sick to leave the hospital.

182
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,856
Write me a prescription. I want
to get it filled on the way home.

183
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,799
If we take you off the
medicine, you will probably die.

184
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,238
Is there anyone we can call?
A relative to be here with you?

185
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,933
- Someone to watch your kids?
- My husband died last year.

186
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,545
My Aunt Sara.

187
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,440
She lives in Detroit.

188
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,584
And what about your son Doug?

189
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,648
No. I don't want him here. I
don't want him near my kids.

190
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,486
Is there anyone else
nearby we can call?

191
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,027
No. I'll call Sara. She'll come.

192
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,925
Pratt, Carter needs you now.
Your MVA, she crashed in CT.

193
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,263
Charge to 360.

194
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,436
All right, clear.

195
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,939
- Still in V-fib.
- Another mg of epi, charge to 360.

196
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,577
- What happened?
- Shut up and bag. The second HemoCue?

197
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,110
- Did you check it?
- Yes, I did.

198
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,976
- Coarse V-fib.
- All right and clear.

199
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,346
Let's go.

200
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,779
Sats dropping to 91.

201
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,618
- Push the lido. Ten blade. Say it.
- Ten blade.

202
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,283
- Can you find my wife?
- We will, Mr. Callahan.

203
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,554
Right down to the rib.
Curved Pean clamp next.

204
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,529
Pressure's falling, down to 80.
- Keep the elbow up.

205
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,399
Push harder. Lean with your hip.

206
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,031
Okay, tension pneumo. Line's in.
Let's hook up two units of O-neg.

207
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,074
Okay, pressure's coming up.

208
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,141
Nice work.

209
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,745
Malik, hook up the Thora-Seal. 0
silk on a driver and Vaseline gauze.

210
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,580
- What do you have?
- Tension pneumo, intraperitoneal blood.

211
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,551
Ex-lap. Don't even
bother to scan him.

212
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,156
Come on upstairs, sir,
where the good drugs are.

213
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,988
Mr. Callahan, you are bleeding in
your belly. You need an operation.

214
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,426
Is that Jessie?

215
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:42,099
The other doctor is taking care of her.
But we need to take you up to surgery.

216
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:47,172
I just want to see her. I
need to know she's all right.

217
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,943
One minute, okay?

218
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,443
No pressure.

219
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:57,106
She should never have left.
Got a huge retroperitoneal bleed.

220
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,342
- Carter?
- Not now, Luka.

221
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,179
Mag and bicarb
are in, round four.

222
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,413
- Jessie.
- Can you close that door?

223
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,350
- V-fib. Shock again?
- Yeah. Charge 360, stat.

224
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,552
- Charged.
- All right. Everybody, clear.

225
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,200
- Looks like sinus.
- No pulse. It's P.E.A.

226
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,464
- How long?
- Ten minutes. She's brain dead.

227
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,574
Her heart's barely beating.

228
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,545
He wants to see her before
we take him up to the O.R.

229
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,706
- Shall I bring him in?
- Yeah.

230
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,949
- I'll tell him.
- Thanks.

231
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,990
All right, everybody.
See you tomorrow.

232
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,650
Hey, Jerry, can you call Housekeeping?
Pizza kid with braces puked again in 3.

233
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,988
- Sure. Nacho?
- Oh, thanks. Cheesy.

234
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:19,064
- Jerry, where's our alderman?
- Um, I think he's still up in X-ray.

235
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,860
Damn it. I asked them to put a
rush on it. Get them on the phone.

236
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,834
Mm. Kerry, we need
to discuss our alderman.

237
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:29,135
Did you know he's the one who wrote the
bill to finance the spousal abuse shelter?

238
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,574
- He's one of the good guys.
- Mm-hm. Not too good.

239
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:36,506
When we were checking for pelvic
fractures, I found a sore on his penis.

240
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,015
I think it's syphilis.

241
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,417
- Did you swab it?
- Yeah. We're waiting on labs.

242
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,649
Uh, they just finished with the
alderman. They're bringing him down.

243
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,920
- Thanks, Jerry.
- How should I handle it if he's positive?

244
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,425
You won't have to. I will.

245
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,599
Her heart's still beating.

246
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,172
Her pupils are dilated.

247
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,102
That means her brain was
deprived of oxygen for too long.

248
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,303
Maybe she'll wake up.

249
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,746
No, she won't.

250
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:19,416
Mr. Callahan, your
bleeding is getting worse.

251
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,255
We have to take
you up to the O.R.

252
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,721
We wanted a family.

253
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,832
We couldn't.

254
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,633
I couldn't.

255
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,102
She didn't like talking
about donors or anything.

256
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:40,337
She's gone. You're
putting yourself in danger.

257
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,776
I can't just leave
her here to die alone.

258
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,655
Okay, I got a vascular
surgeon, an anesthesiologist...

259
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,234
and three surgical residents in an
O.R. suite that rents $5000 an hour.

260
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,565
- He wants to be with his wife.
- That's touching.

261
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,606
- She's dying.
- If she doesn't die faster, he'll die.

262
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,167
- I explained all that.
- I'm going upstairs.

263
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,404
If he's not up there in 10 minutes,
I'm gonna take out your spleen.

264
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,349
We're the richest
country in the world...

265
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,419
and we can't provide basic
health services for our citizens.

266
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,111
Yes. Not just emergency care.

267
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,848
Prenatal screening, drug
and alcohol treatment.

268
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,118
We do what we can
with limited resources...

269
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,421
Everybody at City Hall
should come down here...

270
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,757
and see what kind of
war you fight every day.

271
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,025
You've been fighting
some big wars yourself.

272
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,328
Don't tell me we can't
find him a private room.

273
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,164
Nice to see you
again. Robert Romano.

274
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,772
Heard you were here.
Getting all the care you need?

275
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,774
- We're waiting on a few tests.
- I don't want a private room.

276
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,539
Lets me experience the kind of service
my constituents get when they come in.

277
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,511
You're in good hands
with Dr. Weaver.

278
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,777
But if you need anything at
all, hope you'll give me a call.

279
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,882
Find him a room.

280
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,649
I was on the committee
that hired that man.

281
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:01,192
- Oh, he's an excellent surgeon.
- Tragic about his arm.

282
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,626
Lots of people downtown
wish it had been his head.

283
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,525
You haven't broken your knee.
Looks like you have blood in the joint.

284
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,899
- Is that serious?
- No. You'll feel better once we drain it.

285
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,937
That sounds unpleasant.

286
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,999
It sounds worse than it is.

287
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:22,406
- Could you give us a minute?
- Oh, sure. Espresso's calling.

288
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,074
Girl lives on caffeine
and chocolate.

289
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,152
Alderman...

290
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:32,019
when Dr. Lewis examined
you, she found a sore.

291
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,456
Yeah. Is it what I think it is?

292
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,461
- We're still waiting for the lab results.
- But you have some idea.

293
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,666
It's probably syphilis.

294
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,937
That wasn't the
diagnosis I was hoping for.

295
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,270
- How many partners this year?
- Only one.

296
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,412
Okay. We'll give you a shot
of antibiotics and you'll be fine.

297
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,603
Good.

298
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,215
But we'll need to report it
to the Health Department.

299
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,381
Any way we can keep it
out of my medical record?

300
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,718
It's automatic once
the labs are done.

301
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,690
But there's no need to worry,
your records are confidential.

302
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,761
No, your health
records are confidential.

303
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,455
Every time there's an
election, I have to release mine.

304
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,898
And syphilis is not a word
the voters love to hear.

305
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,735
- I understand your concerns.
- We'll both get treatment.

306
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,900
You don't think everyone
deserves some privacy?

307
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:31,115
- Her sats are still falling, down to 83.
- Okay. Call Lewis and put her on a mask.

308
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,616
- Doug!
- Ha. Hey, monkeys.

309
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,483
- You came.
- You making trouble?

310
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:40,320
- Nice to see you.
- Hey, I'm Dr. Pratt. You must be Doug.

311
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,519
Yeah. Hey.

312
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,329
Hey.

313
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,776
What's he doing here?

314
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,395
He was worried about you.

315
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,338
He doesn't worry about
anyone but himself.

316
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,911
Ah, good to see you too, Mom.

317
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,979
- Did you find Lewis?
- She's coming.

318
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,173
I told you not to call him.

319
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:07,620
I don't want you near my
kids, Doug. Make him leave.

320
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,787
- What's up?
- Her sats are down to 83.

321
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:17,693
- Doug, you're high, aren't you?
- No.

322
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,422
Get the hell out of here.

323
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,490
- Who's he?
- Her son.

324
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,693
Mom, please. Let Doug stay.

325
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,270
So you can sit around
and watch him get stoned?

326
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,375
Come on. They live with you,
watch you sit around and get drunk.

327
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,009
Get the hell out
of here. Get out.

328
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,881
Take slow breaths.

329
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,545
- Oh, God.
- Mom?

330
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,120
- Sats are down to 78.
- Up the 0-2. Get them out.

331
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,816
- Come on. Come on. PRATT:
She's not moving any air.

332
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,224
Bag her. Get 20 of etomidate,
100 of sux, set up for an intubation.

333
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,890
You called him?

334
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,157
Aunt's in Detroit. He's
here. I tried to help.

335
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,292
You can help by learning to listen when
the patient asks you not to do something.

336
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:04,243
Jerry, Dr. Lewis mislabeled a
swab. Can we pull it from the lab tray?

337
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,811
Labs went out an hour ago.

338
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:12,017
I need you to call and
cancel it. It's under Bright.

339
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,914
- The alderman?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,918
I can try.

341
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,191
She's oxygenating well. Turn her down to
80 percent and check gas in half an hour.

342
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,229
- ICU is full.
- Call again. She needs a bed.

343
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,197
Listen, sorry about that. I
was trying to do the right thing.

344
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,860
You exacerbated a terrible
situation. I told you to call the aunt.

345
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,202
I did. She's 69 with MS. She
can't take care of those kids.

346
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,276
Well, you think stoner
boy's gonna do any better?

347
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,037
Doug?

348
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,383
Okay, guys. I gotta talk
to the doctors, all right?

349
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,924
- You okay?
- Uh...

350
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:57,655
Yeah, I smoked a little this afternoon,
you know, but I'm fine now, so...

351
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,427
- Hey, did I kill her?
- No.

352
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,729
We had to put a tube in her
throat to help her breathe.

353
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:09,740
- Why did she cough up all that blood?
- She has an infection in her lungs.

354
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:16,041
Hey, look, I'm sorry
I said all that stuff.

355
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,982
It's just... God,
she just gets to me.

356
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,712
Your mom's in
stable condition...

357
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,983
but she's gonna have to
be in ICU for at least a week.

358
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,426
Rachel and Marten
need a place to stay.

359
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,393
Tonight, at least.

360
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,458
Yeah, I guess.

361
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,170
It doesn't look like your mom's
aunt will be able to help out.

362
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,637
Who? Aunt Sara?

363
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,833
She can't even feed herself.

364
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,608
Is there anyone else who
can take care of those kids?

365
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,008
No.

366
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,511
There's nobody.

367
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,584
Packed cells are in.

368
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,929
Tom, listen to me. You
have to go to the O.R.

369
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,328
I won't leave her.

370
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:13,730
- You could die too if you don't.
- She's not dead.

371
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,449
Malik, can you see if the
next two units are ready?

372
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,679
Yeah.

373
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,484
Remember when we went up to
Lake Louise biking that summer?

374
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,124
Is that it?

375
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,063
Yes.

376
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,341
She's gone.

377
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,311
Time of death: 19:34.

378
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:10,586
- Mr. Callahan?
- Thank you for letting me be with her.

379
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,830
Okay, let's move him.

380
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,105
I'll call Surgery and catch up
to you at the elevators, Malik.

381
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,936
You got it.

382
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,059
Labs came back on your
alderman. Positive for syphilis.

383
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,296
I asked to pull the
swab. It was mislabeled.

384
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,737
You want labs, can't get them. You
don't want them, they get efficient.

385
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,434
Chuny, I need a repeat
potassium on Mrs. Callahan.

386
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,705
- I'll get it.
- What is she still doing here?

387
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,315
- She's an MVA.
- Kovac pronounced her an hour ago.

388
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,452
She's in and out of V-tach.
But she's got a pulse.

389
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:11,713
Jerry, I thought I asked you
to pull the alderman's labs.

390
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,384
- I called them. I'll call them again.
- It's all right. I'll take care of it.

391
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,792
Paramedics are pulling
up with a kid. Took a fall.

392
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,163
Don't they call ahead anymore?

393
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,599
Jerry, make sure those TV news
vans are out of the ambulance bay.

394
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,100
Hey, Luka.

395
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:29,174
Why is Jessie Callahan still in Trauma
1? Because she died an hour ago.

396
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,776
Her husband wouldn't go
to the O.R. until she passed.

397
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,913
So I unhooked her leads
and pronounced her.

398
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,274
Good God.

399
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,975
What happens when he gets back from
surgery and finds out his wife is alive?

400
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,019
- I'll tell him it was a miracle.
- We need a doctor over here.

401
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,022
This isn't funny, Luka. You unhooked
the monitors of a critically injured woman.

402
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,286
Hardly in the best
interest of your patient.

403
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,089
She wasn't my patient, he was.

404
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,927
David Scott, 9 years old. Altered after
a fall from the top bunk of a bunk bed.

405
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,501
Neighbor was babysitting,
heard a crash, called 911.

406
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,662
GCS 235.

407
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,637
- The real one will be bigger.
- I hope so.

408
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,975
- Quiche?
- Oh. Thank you.

409
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,377
Have you tried these?

410
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,781
- They're like perfect little salty things.
- Don't fill up on those.

411
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,056
With any luck, we may get out
early enough to get some real food.

412
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,934
How much are
they trying to raise?

413
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,126
Fifty-eight, I think.
We're throwing in 10.

414
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,525
- Thousand?
- Million.

415
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,323
Right.

416
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,399
So I guess that means
you get great seats forever?

417
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,059
Gamma will.

418
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,864
What do you do with $58 million?

419
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,700
You get architectural
significance.

420
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,172
What's the point of
building a cultural edifice...

421
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,710
if you're not gonna prove
your civic superiority?

422
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,744
Well, that's a lot
of civic superiority.

423
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,643
McNulty's clinic's
not far from here.

424
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,876
What do you think
he'd do with $58 million?

425
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,021
- Hot hors d'oeuvres in his waiting room?
- Hello, John.

426
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,020
Hello, Gamma.

427
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,716
- Hi, Steve.
- John.

428
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,327
I'm Millicent Carter,
John's grandmother.

429
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,761
- Hi. Uh, Abby Lockhart.
- Gamma, you've met Abby before.

430
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:04,835
Oh, I'm sorry. So many
people in John's life.

431
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,870
Don't you look beautiful.

432
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,735
What exactly are canapés?

433
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,608
I mean, are they
different from appetizers?

434
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,875
I'm not sure, dear.

435
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,048
There's a foundation board
meeting on Thursday, John.

436
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,017
- Can you come?
- No. Thank you.

437
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,614
I'd appreciate it. We're
electing new officers.

438
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,555
Oh, well...

439
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,754
I thought that was a whoever's-in-
the-bathroom-is-president kind of thing.

440
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,231
I'm stepping down. I'd like you to
take your father's place as treasurer.

441
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,030
How did Dad get off so easy?

442
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,266
I've asked your father to
take my place as president.

443
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,205
Don't you think you're
getting a bit long in the tooth...

444
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,746
for the disaffected
youth role, John?

445
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:55,086
Gamma, thank you. But, no,
thank you. I already have a day job.

446
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,891
David, can you open your eyes?

447
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,826
Looks like a Colles' fracture.

448
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,762
- I'm assessing his mental status.
- He responds to painful stimuli.

449
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,426
David, do you know where you are?
- I don't know.

450
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,732
- All right. Let's get a head
CT. KOVAC: Lots of old bruises.

451
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,139
- Active kid. Hockey, maybe?
- We should do a long-bone survey.

452
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,441
We have to rule out intracranial bleed.
- You guys seen Pratt?

453
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,446
Mrs. Callahan's potassium's 3.2.

454
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,484
- Okay. Add 20 of KCL to her next liter.
- She's a DNR.

455
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,487
And if she arrests we'll let
her go, until then we treat her.

456
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,783
She's dead, Kerry.

457
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,417
Oh, great. Just what I need.

458
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:39,121
- This is a decision for her husband.
- He's had surgery.

459
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:40,698
If you'd told him the truth...

460
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,631
he could have given us
instructions on his wife's care.

461
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,202
Now we have to decide.

462
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,362
Give her the K.

463
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,535
What can I do for you?

464
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,509
I'm finished for the day and I
come down to say good night...

465
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,707
and who should I find still
sitting in the middle of the ER?

466
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,342
- We're waiting on tests for the alderman.
- Alderman Bright, that's right.

467
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,649
Five hours later. Did I not tell
you to find him a private room?

468
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,952
- He didn't want a private room.
- You should've given him one anyway.

469
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,564
He should have had two doctors
and five nurses over him every minute.

470
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,063
"Can I get you anything?
More ice for your knee?"

471
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,473
- We only have five nurse...
- I don't give a damn.

472
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,902
Whatever he needs, whatever he
wants, you do it and you do it now.

473
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,038
Here you go.

474
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,177
- That was a little rude.
- Stay out of it.

475
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,373
- Excuse me...
- So was that.

476
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,814
Could I have your attention?
With 200 fewer seats...

477
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,319
larger rehearsal hall and
dressing rooms, world-class...

478
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,515
My grandmother doesn't want
me to be treasurer of the foundation.

479
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,058
- She wants me to quit working.
- She's old.

480
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,753
She's probably looking to
you to take some of her load.

481
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,991
Embrace my familial
responsibilities?

482
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,063
Join the family business?

483
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:53,231
Which is what exactly?

484
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,068
It's this. It's giving away
money. It's cutting ribbons.

485
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,267
It's waving to the common man.

486
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,435
It's Prince Charles
without the castle.

487
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,275
Don't know about no castle.
Seen your grandmother's house.

488
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,384
Abby, I know that
you mean well...

489
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:10,546
but don't try to tell me what
to do with my life, okay?

490
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,247
Okay. MILLICENT: John Carter.

491
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,900
CT's ready and he's waking up.

492
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,098
- Where's my dad?
- We called him.

493
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,674
How did you get hurt, David?

494
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,203
I fell off the top bunk.

495
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,040
Okay, we're gonna
take care of you.

496
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,150
This is Chuny. She's taking you
up to get a few more tests, okay?

497
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,809
- You'll find my dad?
- We've already called him, honey.

498
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:44,445
- He should be here any minute.
- Dr. Kovac, kid's x-rays are back.

499
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:48,321
Finally. I thought Tuesday
nights were not busy, huh?

500
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,325
Who told you that?

501
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,924
Oh, damn it. JERRY: What?

502
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,761
- Is DCFS still around?
- Excuse me. Um...

503
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,494
They told me my son was
back here. Uh, David Scott.

504
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,674
Ambulance brought him in a
few minutes ago. He fell out of bed.

505
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,002
Mr. Scott? SCOTT: Yeah.

506
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,144
Where is he? Is he okay?

507
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,247
Your son has a broken
wrist and he hit his head.

508
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,752
He gets hurt all the time.
More since his mom left.

509
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,519
- His exams showed some old injuries.
- Yeah. You see, he doesn't pay attention.

510
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,654
The injuries are suspicious.

511
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,719
What?

512
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,864
Are you suggesting
that I hurt my own son?

513
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,465
- Do you?
- No. No, of course not.

514
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,268
We're giving her all
the right antibiotics...

515
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,309
but her sepsis is very advanced.

516
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:42,038
So, what are her chances?

517
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,614
I'm afraid they're
not very good.

518
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,610
I just need to determine...

519
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,952
what is the best living situation
for your brother and sister.

520
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,320
Yeah.

521
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,827
Do you think living with you
is the best thing for them?

522
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,825
Uh, probably not.

523
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,627
So I should find someplace
else for them to stay?

524
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,361
Wait a minute. You're not
trying to keep them together?

525
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:11,371
- Is this coming from you?
- I think Doug agrees that foster care...

526
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,808
is the best option for
his brother and sister.

527
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,971
Doug, do you know
what foster care is like?

528
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,208
Most likely, they
won't even be together.

529
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,477
We'll do our best to
keep them together.

530
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,315
- But that doesn't always happen, right?
- We do our best.

531
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,149
Do you know what
that means? Hmm?

532
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,356
That means they're
gonna get split up.

533
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:33,032
Their mom's dying, and
they're gonna be separated.

534
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,532
Living with strangers,
is that what you want?

535
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:41,606
- Hey, Doug. Doug.
- Oh, she's right!

536
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,708
Listen, your mom might die.

537
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,003
You need to stay together.
They love you, man.

538
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:50,274
Ha-ha, right, right. The dumb
stoner who makes them laugh.

539
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:55,387
- You care about them. That matters.
- Hey, I can't take care of two kids.

540
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,682
You'd be surprised
at what you can do.

541
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,883
No.

542
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:06,387
Hey, trust me. I know.
You just need to step up.

543
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:14,397
You never should have called
me. All right? My mom's right.

544
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,109
They're all right.

545
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:22,077
Make them wrong.

546
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,350
I can't, all right?

547
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,386
Bright to Williams,
right? Got the new label?

548
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,155
Uh, specimen two was mislabeled.

549
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:43,393
Happens. We don't want the
paperwork guys to strike us dead.

550
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,697
We just need a Dr. Hancock.

551
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,404
Mm-hm.

552
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,046
That's it? CANDI: That's it.

553
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:59,713
I think Shaw's is open late if you
still wanna get something to eat.

554
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,786
No, I'm not hungry.

555
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,422
Not hungry, or pissed at me?

556
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:11,720
I'm sorry, but I don't think you have
any right to lecture me about my family.

557
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,066
Was that an apology?

558
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,935
I don't owe you an apology.
- Ticket, sir?

559
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,101
Look, you want me to
end up like my father?

560
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,439
At Gamma's beck and
call, handing out checks...

561
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,708
so the Art Institute gets a de Kooning
or the symphony can have travertine...

562
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:35,479
Why don't you just get involved with
the foundation and change the priorities?

563
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,624
Give the money to health care, education.
Anything you feel passionate about.

564
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,319
I feel passionate about what I
do. I feel passionate about County.

565
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,794
- Who says you can't do both?
- Ha. I do.

566
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,729
Okay, look, you were
born really, really rich.

567
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,132
- So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

568
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,468
No? You drive a Jeep.

569
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,303
You wear a cheap watch. You
rent a two-bedroom apartment.

570
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,278
- What do you want? Me to drive a BMW?
- No. I don't care.

571
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,849
I couldn't care less.
But you care a lot.

572
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,613
You want everybody to think that
you're just like them and you're not.

573
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:13,122
You just signed a check for $10
million in there. You didn't even blink.

574
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,351
I write a check for over
$100, I get a stomachache.

575
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,122
I give something more
important than money. I give time.

576
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,130
I do it every day to real people
and it makes a difference.

577
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,098
And I think that's
great. I really, really do.

578
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,261
But money makes
a difference too.

579
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,200
You know where my
money comes from?

580
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,469
You know where the money for the
Carter Symphony Hall comes from?

581
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,847
Great-grandfather made a killing in the
Depression cornering the coal market.

582
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,111
In the winter of 1933, a
lot of children froze to death.

583
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,618
And my family
made out like bandits.

584
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,553
That was 70 years ago, Carter.

585
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,624
You can't give the
money back now.

586
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,331
Why not help give it to
people who really need it?

587
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,399
There are still lots of kids
freezing to death every winter.

588
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,397
Black Jeep.

589
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,140
- How's the knee?
- Sore.

590
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,212
Well, swelling's down. Looks
like we can get you started home.

591
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,849
Ah, almost 11. Should be safe.

592
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:14,919
Right, local news usually packs up
and goes home if they miss the 10:00.

593
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,349
I'll go get the car.

594
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:21,289
All right. Your thigh will probably
be a little sore from the penicillin shot.

595
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,689
How do we stand on the
medical-records issue?

596
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,530
It's been handled.

597
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:33,995
Good. Good. Thank
you for your discretion.

598
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,232
I'm glad I could help.

599
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,241
Bright is discharged, Jerry.

600
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,006
- Did we ever get his labs back?
- They're negative.

601
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,910
That lesion was
right out of <i>Netter's.</i>

602
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,574
- We should run it again.
- It's fine.

603
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,544
- He could have untreated syphilis.
- He's fine. Let it go.

604
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,350
Don't touch me.

605
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,551
Yeah. Almost midnight.
Let the shouting begin.

606
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,925
- He's scared. He needs me.
- We can talk here or go to the precinct.

607
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,759
- This is you, right?
- Calm down.

608
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,596
No, I'm okay. But this is
crazy. I have never hurt my son.

609
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,318
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

610
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,103
- What the hell was that about?
- Father abusing his son.

611
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,110
- Where's Social Services?
- They were busy.

612
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,941
So you called the police?

613
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,107
- Kid has multiple old fractures.
- Wait. Did you talk to the child?

614
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,549
Of course I did. He was scared.

615
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,893
Hey.

616
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,259
You got the blue
cast. It's my favorite.

617
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,833
Is my dad coming back?

618
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,267
Well, he had to
talk to some people.

619
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:44,239
- You get along pretty well with your dad?
- Better since Mom left.

620
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,571
He says we're like
<i>Starsky and Hutch.</i>

621
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,139
That's an old TV show
we watch on Nick at Nite.

622
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,479
- Sounds nice.
- Yeah.

623
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,248
You've been hurt a lot
in the last few months.

624
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,092
I don't pay enough attention.

625
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:08,157
Did you really fall out
of bed today, David?

626
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,268
I...

627
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,666
I jumped.

628
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:24,849
Is that the truth, David?
It's okay. You can tell me.

629
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,643
Hello?

630
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,376
McNULTY: We're closed.

631
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:59,007
- Dr. McNulty? McNULTY:
If you're sick, go to County.

632
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,081
Dr. McNulty, we met the
other day. I'm Dr. Carter.

633
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,590
You left before your
tests came back.

634
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,322
Your blood sugar was 435.
Your diabetes is way out of control.

635
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:15,661
- I take my Orinase.
- Orinase?

636
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:19,202
- They still make that?
- Works fine for me.

637
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,899
Not according to your tests.
There are newer, better drugs.

638
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,542
Yeah. Thanks.

639
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,270
Goodbye.

640
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:35,481
You're not gonna be able to help anybody
down here if you're in a coma or dead.

641
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,218
Actos. Six-month supply.

642
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,452
Hey, hey, you steal those from
County? There are laws against that.

643
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,997
You gotta watch your sugar too.

644
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,192
Sure.

645
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,098
Don't get your tux
dirty on the way out.

646
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,044
Looks like you could use
new equipment around here.

647
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,874
No, no. You're not doing that.

648
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,881
You can get yourself
a cardiac monitor.

649
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,712
Chemistry analyzer.

650
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,823
Twelve-lead. Anything
else you might need.

651
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,651
What's this?
White liberal guilt?

652
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,054
Probably.

653
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,562
Lots of guilt.

654
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,967
No, thanks.

655
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,303
I'm not here to
make you feel better.

656
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,932
There must be
something I can do.

657
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,944
Yeah.

658
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,841
You can sweep.

659
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:42,177
- Did ICU come for my pneumonia?
- Went up a couple of minutes ago.

660
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,289
DCFS is taking the
kids up to say goodbye.

661
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,824
Hey, she's still alive, right?
- Yeah.

662
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,828
- You came back.
- Well, I never really left.

663
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:58,000
You know, she said I was
the biggest mistake of her life.

664
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,698
I don't want to let them down...

665
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:07,434
- but I don't know if I can do it.
- You just do the best that you can.

666
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,103
That'll be enough.

667
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,444
Come on. I'll take
you up to see them.

668
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,018
Stay with her as
long as you want.

669
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,454
Okay.

670
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,957
Go ahead.

671
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,464
Thanks.

672
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:32,535
- He came back, huh?
- Yeah.

673
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,873
Hey, um, I was
out of line before.

674
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,374
Whatever. I'm an
adult. I can handle it.

675
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,912
You should worry about those two kids.
- Hey, Pratt. Phone call.

676
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,586
Hello. Dr. Pratt.
Hey, Mrs. Knightly.

677
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,244
What?

678
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,991
Oh, man. When?

679
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:55,727
Okay.

680
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,159
Jerry, I'm off in 15. Tell
Weaver I had to leave.

681
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,527
I'll come in early and
make it up in the morning.

682
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,999
- Was that Pratt leaving again?
- Uh, yeah. He had to go early.

683
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,762
- Go where?
- Didn't say.

684
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:10,534
Well, guess what? I want to go
too. Maybe I should just leave.

685
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,406
What do you say? Just
leave because I feel like it.

686
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:19,178
Your child abuser was a case of a
boy wanting to spend time with his father.

687
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,511
- Who? The Scott kid?
- Yes.

688
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:24,952
The kid hurts himself so Dad will
stay home and watch TV with him.

689
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,957
- Did you page me for a post-op seroma?
- Yeah. Exam 4.

690
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,595
Your Mr. Callahan's
finally in Recovery.

691
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:35,393
Send your patients up to the O.R. a
bit more promptly in future, all right?

692
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:39,731
And next time, get DCFS down
here before you call the cops.

693
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,453
Tom's out of surgery.

694
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,699
He's gonna be okay.

695
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,203
You can let go now.

696
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,273
Pratt left again? Man, when I
was an intern, it was a full-time job.

697
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:21,640
Yeah. It still is.

698
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,476
Ugh. I just want to go
home and get into bed.

699
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,242
What do you think
the odds are...

700
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,477
that Antonio Banderas
will be waiting for me?

701
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,623
Oh, I almost forgot. Here.

702
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,419
I know it's a little early, but I was
in Field's buying a gift for my niece...

703
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,959
and I saw the infant stuff.

704
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,495
I pass those little clothes
and I go into a trance.

705
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,326
- I have to buy something.
- Susan...

706
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,436
Those Onesies and jumpers, they
have control over me. And the little shoes.

707
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,334
I don't know if it's a boy or
girl so I got green, neutral.

708
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,773
If you hate it, I have
the gift receipts...

709
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:52,375
Uh, I'm not pregnant anymore.

710
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,680
I miscarried.

711
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:03,182
Oh, uh, God.
Kerry, I'm so sorry.

712
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,854
Embryonic loss rate after implantation
is about 30 percent in IVF. It isn't rare.

713
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,264
- Thank you for the thought.
- Sure.

714
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:22,202
And when you see Pratt, why don't
you remind him this is a full-time job?

715
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,137
Good night.

716
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,034
They brought him in on a
10-29, possible stolen car.

717
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,079
Car was clean. But they found
a shotgun with a clipped barrel.

718
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,716
The others have criminal
paper, your brother's clear.

719
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,479
Just hanging next to the
wrong car at the wrong time.

720
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:36,893
This is against like 15 regs...

721
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,546
- so make it fast.
- Thanks.

722
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,150
I ever get shot, I want
to end up at County.

723
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,852
- You guys always take care of us.
- Thank you.

724
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,021
Don't be mad. Don't be mad, G.

725
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,530
Please, it wasn't my fault.

726
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,191
It was Dukey's fault. He's
the one that had the gun.

727
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:54,032
What were you doing with
those boys? Didn't they hurt you?

728
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,538
I was telling them about
the job you got for me.

729
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,608
While I was telling
them, the cops came.

730
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,405
Okay, okay, listen to me.
Do not talk to anybody in here.

731
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,344
Not the police, no one.
Not until I get you a lawyer.

732
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:08,111
Tell Mr. Keegan I
won't be late next time.

733
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,016
- Leon...
- Was he mad? Tell him I promise.

734
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:14,216
Leon, you didn't show up.
You probably lost that job.

735
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,223
No, G. No.

736
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:25,233
I don't want to stay in here, G.
Come on, please? Can't we go home?

737
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:28,567
The judge sets bail in the
morning. Then I can take you home.

738
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,368
- In the morning? I...
- Doc, you gotta go.

739
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,307
G, I can't spend the night
here. I don't know these people.

740
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:37,039
First thing in the morning, okay?
- Doc?

741
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:39,411
- G.
- First thing.

742
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:43,043
Don't leave me, G.
G, don't do that, G.

743
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,452
G, come on. G.

744
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,216
G.

745
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,919
Don't leave me here. Come on.
