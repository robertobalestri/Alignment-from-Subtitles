1
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,439
- Oh, God!
- LOC on scene.

2
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,639
But awake when we got
there with a GCS of 13.

3
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:15,855
What have you got?

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,850
17-year-old. Auto versus
multiple peds at a high school.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,614
Facial fracture, abdominal pain,
sounds like she dropped a lung.

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,950
BP, 110/70, tachy
after one liter.

7
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,288
- Her name's Gayla Ray.
- Break out epistaxis tray, page Trauma.

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,021
Do you have any medical
problems we need to know about?

9
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,632
- That's a yes.
- Is this the full-arrest crush injury?

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,701
Pinned between a car and wall.
Kids got nailed on the steps at school.

11
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,893
- Drunk driver?
- Worse.

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,663
16-year-old got
a driver's license.

13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,167
Still no pulse.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,172
- Resume CPR.
- You tube her in the field?

15
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,174
She's anterior. I
had to scoop and run.

16
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,506
Car versus pedestrian,
steel wins every time.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,512
- Chest full of sub-q air.
- Thoracotomy?

18
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:52,414
Tube in every hole and pronounce.
Since Pratt's wearing a tie this morning...

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,817
- let him needle the pericardium.
- She's young. She might convert.

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,426
And there might be a new Hyundai
behind door number 1, but more likely...

21
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,721
- it's 50 cases of elbow macaroni.
- Vaseline gauze.

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,695
I'll give you $200 if you've
got a surgical candidate.

23
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,199
ENT, Ortho, and general
to start. Let's turn her.

24
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,597
I can't breathe.

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,605
Gayla, don't try and swallow,
okay? We'll get that blood out for you.

26
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,367
I'm scared. ROMANO: Don't be.

27
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,011
I never let anything happen
to pretty girls like you.

28
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,238
Tachy at 120. BP's 100 systolic.

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,043
Frazier-tip suction
for the nose.

30
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,707
Zygoma is mobile.

31
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:28,049
- It looks like a LeFort three.
- It hurts when I press here?

32
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,690
We need to operate on
your belly, but you'll be fine.

33
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,792
Robert, have a minute
to speak privately?

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,226
I've got a girl losing blood by
the pint. But sure, what the hell.

35
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,297
Call and tell Maser
we have a hot e-lap.

36
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,639
- You think posterior bleed?
- Place to start.

37
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,095
- Left you a number of messages.
- Cefotetan.

38
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,796
Make sure the blood
bank gets a clot.

39
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,169
You were sent a memo.
She stable enough for CT?

40
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,736
- Tachycardic and hypotensive.
- Let's get this little minx upstairs.

41
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,608
- I'll take her.
- What are you doing?

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,241
Based on your fine assessment, an
e-lap. Have a surgical residents scrub in.

43
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,252
- I did for Dr. Romano.
- Even though he has no O.R. privileges?

44
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,914
- I'm a supervising Attending.
- On operations you can perform yourself.

45
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,085
- What are you saying? I can't scrub in?
- I'm saying read my memo.

46
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,924
Now let's get this
young lady to the O.R.

47
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,327
Oh, and congratulations, Kerry.

48
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,429
No one deserves it more.

49
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,534
If you can't vote, you
shouldn't be able to drive.

50
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,903
- I got my license the minute I turned 16.
- You were never a "teenager" teenager.

51
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,340
You were responsible.
I was a total idiot.

52
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,172
All I cared about was
finding a boyfriend.

53
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,541
Mm. Nothing like now, right?

54
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,310
Do you think Carter can
cover the last hour of my shift?

55
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,545
- He's leaving for Belize.
- Ah. The scuba thing.

56
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,053
Mm-hm. A week of fun in the sun.

57
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,187
Yeah, while you get
stuck here in the rain.

58
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,853
But all of his diving buddies are
nitrox certified, whatever that means.

59
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,498
And I can barely snorkel.

60
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,027
- Still.
- Do you have a date or something?

61
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,502
Friend set me up with some guy.

62
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,935
Blind date.

63
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,373
It just proves that some of us
never really leave high school.

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,878
Sasha Melman, 16, bilateral femur
fractures. Amazing she's not worse.

65
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,450
Books, shoes, blood everywhere.

66
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,747
- It hurts so much!
- Sasha, I'm Dr. Lewis.

67
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,789
Can you wiggle your toes for me?
- I don't think I can.

68
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,450
- Good popliteal pulses.
- Okay. Page Ortho.

69
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,459
A gram of Ancef, 300 of gent.

70
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,928
- My friends okay?
- Yes. We're helping them.

71
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,365
Helen Broznich. Limping at the scene.
No LOC, no chest or abdominal injuries.

72
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,371
- Any ETOH or drugs on board?
- She denies both, but she's agitated.

73
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,304
- Thing's choking me.
- This the driver?

74
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,706
Helen, I'm Dr. Weaver.
Where are you hurt?

75
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,642
Everywhere, all the time.

76
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,372
- What's open?
- Trauma 2.

77
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,909
- Come on, damn it.
- Still agonal.

78
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,315
Try Isuprel, wide open.

79
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,651
What's going on? You completed
the P.E.A. algorithms 10 minutes ago.

80
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:55,386
- We wanna give her a little longer.
- You gave her longer. Call it, or I will.

81
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,554
Oh, sorry. I thought
the room was clear.

82
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,496
- Is she dead?
- Get Helen to another room for now.

83
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,966
That's Terri. Is she dead?
- Gallant.

84
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,298
I thought I hit the brakes.

85
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,943
Time of death, 11:29.

86
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,848
Hmp. What do you figure
this cost the taxpayers?

87
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,080
"Kerry, congrats to
the best doc in Chicago.

88
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,588
- Alderman Bright."
- Think he's trying to get her...

89
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,987
to change teams or what?

90
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,185
My guess? "Or what."

91
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,419
Hmm.

92
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,430
I can pick up a bottle of this
stuff for us tonight if you want.

93
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,659
That stuff is about
200 bucks a pop.

94
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,675
- Well, I guess you're buying then.
- Ha-ha-ha.

95
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,499
Dispo'd Mr. Pagini.

96
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,666
Waiting on a bed on Mrs.
Golove. Mary Galloway is up in CT.

97
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,369
I'm off to the second largest
barrier reef in the world.

98
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,036
- Bring Dramamine.
- And repellent.

99
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,706
They got mosquitoes the
size of eagles in Belize.

100
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,942
- Not to mention pirates.
- So Deb?

101
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,381
- Hmm?
- You and Pratt, huh?

102
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,646
Yeah, I guess.

103
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,381
- You guess?
- Well, we're not exclusive or anything...

104
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,721
- ER. Maggie. Let me check.
- We're just kind of casually attached.

105
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,863
Frank, we hear anything from
OB about a bed for Kim Cohen?

106
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,625
No. But I got your
mom on line one.

107
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,068
- Abby, line one.
- Yeah. I'm on my way out.

108
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,796
- Can you take a message?
- You mean another one?

109
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,497
- Maggie called?
- Twice.

110
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,665
- Why?
- I don't know.

111
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:20,746
She wants to talk to me, make
it up, be a family, whatever.

112
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:25,415
- You're not interested in doing that?
- No. Not really.

113
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,419
If you're mad at your mom, you
should tell her. Don't just ignore her.

114
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,519
Okay, thanks.

115
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,085
I took a split shift so
I could see you off.

116
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,061
- My flight's not for hours.
- I know.

117
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,179
- Did you see the car coming?
- Mm-mm.

118
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,601
Two-inch scalp lac,
GCS 15, no LOC.

119
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,672
I was gonna throw in a 5-0
nylon and give her a head sheet.

120
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,071
- Did you hear the brakes?
- Switch to Prolene.

121
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,609
Blue stitches are
easier to find for removal.

122
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,715
- Any other minor injuries in the accident?
- Just the driver in Curtain 3.

123
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,783
Bad ankle. She lost
control of her car.

124
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,852
Dr. Lewis, this one's got a clotted
PICC line. Can you take him?

125
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,751
Sure. Give me a
couple minutes, okay?

126
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,451
16 years old with stable lateral
malleolus fracture and multiple abrasions.

127
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,119
- Blood alcohol and tox screen?
- First thing I checked. Came back clean.

128
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,061
- Head CT's negative...
- She's concussed?

129
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,632
Well, it's hard to tell.

130
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,634
- Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.
- I remember you.

131
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,705
Says she was here last week,
got diagnosed with hepatitis.

132
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:24,971
Oh, yeah, right. So, Helen,
what happened today?

133
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,115
There were these squirrels at
my school. I saw them in the road.

134
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,547
- And you swerved?
- Squirrels are rabies carriers.

135
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,654
So are raccoons.
Is my dad here yet?

136
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,086
We'll go check, okay?

137
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,993
She's not jaundiced enough
for hepatic encephalopathy.

138
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,220
Yeah. She'd be
altered, not just weird.

139
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,626
Dr. Lewis, your
blind date called.

140
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,165
The restaurant you
picked doesn't work for him.

141
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,429
- Oh, for God's sake.
- He wants you to call him and regroup.

142
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:54,665
- Hey, you choose someplace exotic?
- Yeah. A steak house.

143
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,811
So Keener's thyroidectomy will
now be supervised by Dr. Corday.

144
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,345
- Correct.
- What about Jocelyn Gaines' Billroth II?

145
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,244
Push it if possible. I'm buried
in administrative backwash.

146
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,009
- If not?
- Anspaugh will take it.

147
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,245
Robert. ROMANO: Kerry.

148
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,619
- There's gonna be a press conference.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

149
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,091
I know you wanted the position. I
just wanted to check and make sure...

150
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,562
- you were feeling okay about all this.
- Well, how am I feeling?

151
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,860
Pretty damn grateful, actually.
I've got a good heart, good soul...

152
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,368
and, unlike our new
liaison, two good legs.

153
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,040
Dr. Weaver, we're ready for you.

154
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,540
Ask yourself what you
did to deserve this, Kerry.

155
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,373
- A lot of hard work, actually.
- And what the alderman wants in return.

156
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,809
He doesn't want anything.

157
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,541
Not everyone's an
opportunistic asshole like you.

158
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,710
Yeah. So I'm told.

159
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,552
- Still okay with me going?
- Yeah. I said I was.

160
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,317
You meant it?

161
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,823
What are you thinking?

162
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,464
Nothing.

163
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,397
- Work?
- No.

164
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,163
- Your mom?
- God, no.

165
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,640
- Go on, tell me.
- It's a song.

166
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,470
- Oh, yeah? Which one?
- Mm-hm.

167
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,737
From the '70s.

168
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,175
- It's goofy.
- "Blinded by the Light."

169
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,789
- No.
- "Love Will Keep Us Together."

170
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,350
- No.
- What?

171
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,091
No.

172
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,123
Something, something.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,263
You done?

174
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,102
Oh, no. Please
don't. Please don't.

175
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,010
- You want to get that?
- No.

176
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,223
It's an utterly
thankless position.

177
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,696
No money, endless
paperwork, countless meetings.

178
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,563
But it still remains
a great honor.

179
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,398
Therefore, on behalf of the
board of commissioners...

180
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:11,340
I am proud and privileged to name
Dr. Kerry Weaver as medical liaison...

181
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,743
to Cook County's public
healthcare administration.

182
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,052
Thank you, alderman. I couldn't
have accepted this position...

183
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:25,556
without the continued support
of my colleagues here at County.

184
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,184
Dr. Weaver, how are you
qualified for this office?

185
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,924
You mean can a
nonpolicy wonk do the job?

186
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,262
Uh... Well, running a trauma center is
perhaps the ultimate training ground...

187
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:41,533
for public healthcare, and
we are in a healthcare crisis.

188
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:46,169
This position allows me the
opportunity to apply practical solutions...

189
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:50,613
to problems that have been dealt
with all too bureaucratically in the past.

190
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,183
Are there any other questions?

191
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,584
How will balancing two demanding
jobs affect your home life?

192
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,021
It won't.

193
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,457
She's single. So am I.

194
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,687
We make a handsome
couple, don't you think?

195
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,464
- Congratulations, Dr. Weaver.
- Thank you.

196
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,071
I reached Helen
Broznich's father.

197
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,011
- No chicken either, huh?
- I'll come back.

198
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,982
Really. They actually fry tofu.

199
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,816
Okay. Well, I'll see
you tonight at 7. Bye.

200
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,355
Your date's a vegetarian?

201
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,187
No, a vegan, whatever
the hell that means.

202
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,488
Nothing with a face.

203
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,695
No meat, no eggs, no dairy.

204
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,492
Oh. Oh, you're the
guy with the PICC line.

205
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,829
Sean.

206
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,665
- Need a doc over here!
- Oh, got to go. You want these?

207
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,501
Wilma Rasmussen, 94 years
old with altered mental status.

208
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,304
- BP 85/60.
- That's pretty low. Pneumonia?

209
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,106
She's had that
before. This is different.

210
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,680
- Her daughter.
- She live with you?

211
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,045
No. I live with her.

212
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,148
Hey, save some Donnatal for me.

213
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,346
Cut it out.

214
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:08,358
- What? I just need two tabs.
- Oh. Sorry.

215
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,588
No. Actually, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

216
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,699
I was out of line earlier.

217
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,270
This is work. And the last thing
you need to deal with is gossip.

218
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,998
I get that and I respect it.

219
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,506
You do?

220
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,439
Yes, I'm the same way.

221
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,809
Hey, Pratt. You have a patient
waiting for you in Curtain 1.

222
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,344
I'll be right there.

223
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,487
So are you two
gonna get engaged?

224
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,483
No. Not even close.

225
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,094
I don't know about that.
Pratt's been acting all in love.

226
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,824
Dizzy, weak, lightheaded.

227
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,830
Classic symptoms
of a low blood count.

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,162
Tinnitus, palpitations...

229
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:54,132
Drove my wife nuts over it.
She divorced me because of it.

230
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,173
Trouble is you
don't look anemic.

231
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,073
Yeah, but in pernicious
anemia, symptoms may occur...

232
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,339
even in the absence
of a low hemoglobin.

233
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:05,076
Trust me on this, doc. If I don't get a
shot soon, it's gonna get a lot worse.

234
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,914
- You've been taking B12.
- Up until two months ago.

235
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,086
I went to see my doc in '86
because I was feeling really run-down.

236
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,592
My doc made the diagnosis.
Since then I've been feeling real fit...

237
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,754
as long as I stay regular on it.

238
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,863
The bastard died
on me a month ago.

239
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,094
My doctor. That's why I'm here.

240
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,263
- For your B12 fix.
- I take up to 100 micrograms a month.

241
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,673
I think since it's been so long, I should
take half a milligram. I'm way overdue.

242
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,746
I'll need to check out a few
things before prescribing anything.

243
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,145
Save yourself the trouble.

244
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,722
"Victims of Pernicious Anemia"?

245
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,948
You're looking at the president.

246
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,756
- What do you think it is?
- Your mom has a kidney infection.

247
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,889
- Does that explain why she's so groggy?
- Possibly. She has other health problems.

248
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,037
Haleh, can you send this up
for culture? And 500 of Levaquin.

249
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,195
Start her on dopamine
at five mics per kilo.

250
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,308
- Well, that sounds serious.
- At 94, everything's serious.

251
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,570
Our friends were brought here.
There was an accident at our school.

252
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,044
- What are their names?
- Terri, Sasha, and Janey.

253
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,274
- And Lissa got hurt too.
- Can we see them?

254
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,784
Excuse me. We can only give that
sort of information out to relatives.

255
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,285
But they're our best friends.

256
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,789
Have your parents call the school,
and they'll update you on everything.

257
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,325
- Was it that bad?
- Did they die?

258
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,659
- Oh, God. We totally cut class today.
- I can only give information out to...

259
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,165
Was she there? Did
she see this happen?

260
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,893
Hey, you can't go in there.

261
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,129
Helen, you have to
tell us what happened.

262
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,002
- Why are you asking me?
- Who all got hurt?

263
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,609
- You don't even know me.
- Forget her. She's a freak.

264
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,747
Let's call my mom. She's
friends with the principal.

265
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,514
They're popular.

266
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,113
- You did good, kid.
- You think?

267
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,350
I only wish I'd fallen off
a stage two years ago.

268
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,963
Would've kept us from appointing
your god-awful predecessor.

269
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,598
Still having trouble with that?

270
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,030
Kennedy had chronic back
pain and ran the country.

271
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,465
The least I can do is
tolerate a bum knee.

272
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,801
You know what? Let me write you a
prescription for some more Vicodin.

273
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,840
- That's all right.
- Don't be ridiculous.

274
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,944
Why suffer if you don't have to?

275
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,512
- Touch base later this week?
- Look forward to it.

276
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,117
Don't put your pen away. I need
another signature for a subdural.

277
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,844
So congratulations on your
appointment, by the way.

278
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,784
- Thank you.
- So, what is it?

279
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,686
- A county committee type thing?
- Something like that.

280
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,953
Well, if you can get us two
more nurses a shift, I'm all for it.

281
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,620
- Still no word from Dr. Kovac?
- Nope.

282
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,132
- And you tried calling him again?
- Yes, ma'am.

283
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,170
<i>This is Luka. Leave a message.</i>

284
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,967
Yeah, Luka. This
is Kerry Weaver.

285
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,406
I'm down two Attendings
and up 40 patients.

286
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,069
If you don't start working
your scheduled shifts...

287
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,409
I'm gonna call the INS, tell
them your green card's a fake...

288
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,074
and have your ass deported.

289
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,383
You'll need longer arms if
you're treating her from here.

290
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,323
- Why haven't you cleared her?
- She needs a posterior splint.

291
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,520
Hold on. Look, we're
buried here, Gallant.

292
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,530
- I realize that...
- If you and your Attending can't handle...

293
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,396
a simple ankle fracture,
I'll do it. Now, clear the bed.

294
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,593
Where do you want it?

295
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,795
The lounge. I don't
wanna be disturbed.

296
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,076
- What'd I miss?
- Two more messages from your mother.

297
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,180
- She says it's important that you call.
- Right.

298
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,942
- Carter get off okay?
- Yes, he did.

299
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,951
Mm. Five Sigma Nu's loose in Belize.
I hope they brought a lot of bail money.

300
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,386
I have friends on the P.D. who can
run a background check on your date.

301
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,288
- Already checked. No arrests.
- Or he hasn't been caught yet.

302
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,292
Aren't you the optimistic one.

303
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,796
- You don't have plans tonight, do you?
- Excuse me?

304
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,629
Carter's off with the boys.
It'd be fun. Dinner and drinks.

305
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,963
Don't let her talk you
into being her chaperone.

306
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,265
- How's everyone know about my date?
- You told them.

307
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,932
I got a lady won't get out
of my cab. I need a doctor.

308
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,442
- Where's she hurt?
- I don't know. She ain't moving.

309
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,043
Know her name?

310
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,382
Yeah, she showed her birth
certificate before I picked her up.

311
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,818
Ma'am? Ma'am, wake up!

312
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,425
She's been beaten up. Come
on. Open your eyes for us.

313
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,289
She's got a weak radial pulse.
There's blood on her hands.

314
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,260
Ma'am, can you tell
us what happened?

315
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,898
Oh, wow. CHEN: Oh.

316
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,556
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

317
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,663
I'm not gonna get paid, am I?

318
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,566
- No hemotympanum.
- Systolic's 120 after the first liter.

319
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,105
This may burn a little.

320
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,836
- I'm just numbing up your belly.
- Do you know who did this to you?

321
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,605
- Kids.
- Kids?

322
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,976
I need to pick my
kids up from school.

323
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,085
We can have them brought here.
We need to know your name first.

324
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,482
Monica Walker.

325
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,284
Monica, we have to figure
out if you'll need surgery.

326
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,623
Gotta go. CHEN: No, no.

327
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,160
You have to talk
to the police later.

328
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,697
No. Can't do that. Please.

329
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,130
Somebody beat you pretty badly.
- It's okay.

330
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:52,704
She owes me 11 bucks and
change. Check the bra for cash.

331
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,170
- What?
- She's a hooker. It's where they keep it.

332
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,640
Hey, get the hell out
of here. Now. Out! Out!

333
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,143
- What have we got?
- Penetrating abdominal injury...

334
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:04,444
- of uncertain depth. And these are?
- Three lab-coated tumors.

335
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,984
- You're teaching?
- This is a teaching hospital.

336
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:11,147
- Good bowel sounds, normotensive.
- Can you tell how long the knife was?

337
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:14,692
You collect box tops to get into med
school? You didn't get in on your IQ.

338
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,988
Help me retract here. - Okay.

339
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,725
Only into the sub-q. But there could
be an intraperitoneal component.

340
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,664
Deep fascia's intact. Gram of
Ancef and update her tetanus.

341
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,134
- No surgery.
- That's right.

342
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,500
You boneheads in the
ER are gonna have to work.

343
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,906
Irrigate the wound, loose approximation,
and follow serial exam. Let's go.

344
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:35,344
Whose signature do I get for the chart?
- Excuse me?

345
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,881
For the official
surgical consult.

346
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,514
I'm head of surgery
and chief of staff.

347
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,018
That should do it. That way.

348
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,323
Turn left.

349
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,658
- I don't like to be touched.
- Dr. Weaver's almost finished.

350
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,032
- They'll hate me even more now.
- Who will?

351
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,605
Everyone at my school.

352
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,902
- Why? Because of what happened?
- Helen, what happened was tragic.

353
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,342
But it was an accident.
It was raining...

354
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,209
you lost control of your car.

355
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,550
- Who's your Attending on this?
- Dr. Lewis.

356
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,244
Get her.

357
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,880
Helen, do you ever have any
problems with rigid muscles or jerkiness?

358
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,856
I can be a real spaz sometimes.

359
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,723
You shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

360
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,729
What is it, Kerry?

361
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,696
She has gold-colored
deposits on her cornea.

362
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,563
I don't like to be touched.

363
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,899
- Kayser-Fleischer rings.
- Pathognomonic for Wilson's disease.

364
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,303
- What's that?
- Your body may have an inability...

365
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,535
to excrete copper, so it
builds up in the liver and brain.

366
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,942
- Really?
- We need to run some tests to be sure.

367
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,582
But I'll be right back, okay?

368
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,810
- She was here a week ago?
- I treated her and released her.

369
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,113
- Did Gallant do an eye exam?
- Of course he did.

370
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,416
But Wilson's is a total
zebra to a med student.

371
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,991
- What's your excuse?
- The rings may not have been...

372
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,597
- as prominent last week.
- Okay, send off a serum ceruloplasmin...

373
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,595
and find me when
you get the results.

374
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,461
- She's having trouble breathing.
- Who?

375
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,626
Your old lady. Pulse ox
down to 82 on five liters.

376
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,302
- What's happening?
- Respiratory rate's up to 30.

377
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,602
The fluid we gave to raise her
blood pressure is going to her lungs.

378
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,800
So, what do you do?

379
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,105
Normally we use Lasix
and nitroglycerine...

380
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,011
- but they'd lower her pressure further.
- Oh, God.

381
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,176
I know you love your mother very
much, but you need to think about...

382
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,150
how aggressively
you wanna handle this.

383
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,290
You don't
understand. I need her.

384
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:29,122
- Of course you need her.
- No. I need her social security checks.

385
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,164
Another 4-0 nylon.

386
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,129
He was a regular.

387
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,428
Just went nuts on me.

388
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:41,563
- It might be time for a new profession.
- I gotta feed my kids.

389
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,809
How old are they?

390
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,072
Luke's 7, Christy's 12.

391
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,378
- They know what you do?
- No.

392
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,546
Don't need to.

393
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,985
I'm there when they leave for
school, there when they get back...

394
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:00,092
and I'm there till they
go to sleep at night.

395
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,629
Wait. You go out
after they're in bed?

396
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,823
Look, I'm not a junkie.

397
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,992
And I don't have a pimp.

398
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,967
I just work enough
to support my kids.

399
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,167
But they're home by themselves.

400
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,674
That was fast. MONICA:
I don't wanna talk to him.

401
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,016
They have to
document the assault.

402
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,709
I don't want to
talk to the police.

403
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,088
She doesn't want
to file a report.

404
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,554
- You Abby Lockhart?
- Yeah?

405
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,019
Officer Beechum, Chicago P.D.

406
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,218
- We were asked to come find you.
- Me?

407
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:42,066
Minneapolis P.D. reported that an aircraft
your brother was flying has disappeared.

408
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,500
Your mother asked
us to notify you.

409
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:49,073
- She was unable to reach you by phone.
- Okay.

410
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,075
Okay, what does that mean,
disappeared? Where was he?

411
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:56,045
Well, radar last picked him up
over Lake Superior 11 hours ago.

412
00:21:56,582 --> 00:22:00,075
You can call the FAA up
there for more information.

413
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,050
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:13,727
Okay. Explain to me how
somebody just goes off radar.

415
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:21,397
What you're saying is you
think he went down. Right. Just...

416
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,167
What are the
other possibilities?

417
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:30,213
Okay, did you have any communications
from him? Like a mayday or whatever?

418
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,678
No.

419
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,582
Yes, I'm reachable here.

420
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:41,258
I thought he was an
air-traffic controller.

421
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,292
He always wanted to
fly. He just got his license.

422
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,600
Did you reach Carter?

423
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,634
I had him paged in Miami. I
guess the flight already took off.

424
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:54,103
- Does your mom know anything?
- I haven't called her.

425
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,408
Do you think you should?

426
00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:57,437
I think I'm stressed
out enough as it is...

427
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,638
- without having to deal with her too.
- Yeah. You should go home.

428
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,712
Do people know?

429
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,787
About Eric? Some.

430
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,883
I'd rather they didn't.

431
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,958
- You should still go home.
- I'm gonna stay. Thanks.

432
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,960
Hold, please. Radiology needs
you to send Stewart back up.

433
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,156
- Film's bad.
- Abby, guy from the school district...

434
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,632
- dropped off Monica Walker's kids.
- Who?

435
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,102
- The hooker with the slashed belly.
- Okay.

436
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,302
Hi.

437
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,770
- I'll take you to see your mom now.
- Is my mom gonna be okay?

438
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,913
- Yeah, she is.
- Did she get mugged again?

439
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,783
Thanks anyway.

440
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:43,320
Her kids are here.
Go ahead. Go right in.

441
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,788
Hey, guys. Oh, good to see you.

442
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,453
She denied everything, told
the cop she fell through a window.

443
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,498
Probably tell her
kids the same thing.

444
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:58,160
You think it would be better if
she told them a john slashed her?

445
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,465
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

446
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,141
Mr. Marshman? Could you turn
your hearing aid down, please?

447
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,143
- Thank you.
- What?

448
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,183
Labs back on your
B12 guy, Vitelli.

449
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:16,618
Hemoglobin's 14,
hematocrit's 42.

450
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,484
Anything wrong?

451
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,956
Stan, my man, this
is your lucky day.

452
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,655
- You giving me my shot?
- No.

453
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,301
Your doctor never did a
Schilling test on you, did he?

454
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,028
I knew it was unlikely,
given your age, your ethnicity.

455
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,230
My grandmother's
from northern Europe.

456
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:38,309
90% of pernicious anemia patients
have the anti-parietal cell antibody.

457
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,140
And your blood test
was negative for it.

458
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,842
So I'm in the 10 percent
without the antibody.

459
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,212
You have a normal
cobalamin level.

460
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,480
- Do you know what that is, Stanley?
- Vitamin B12.

461
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,553
And what causes
pernicious anemia?

462
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:57,060
B12 deficiency from
lack of intrinsic factor.

463
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,726
You don't have the
disease. You never did.

464
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,427
I can stay home
and take care of you.

465
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,106
Don't even think about
missing school on my account.

466
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,902
He's only trying to get
out of a math test anyway.

467
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,075
I am not, butthead.

468
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,682
My little brother's goofy.
Ignore him. That's what I do.

469
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,078
Were you talking to me?

470
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,954
They're good kids.

471
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,022
I do the best I can, you know?

472
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,891
I really do.

473
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:34,124
I don't think I'm gonna be able to
get home as early as I'd thought.

474
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,929
- Well, how about a late supper?
- Kerry, labs are back on Helen Broznich.

475
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,239
Sandy, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

476
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,206
- Father here?
- Yes. Want me to tell him?

477
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,208
Absolutely not.

478
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,779
Hello. I'm Dr. Weaver.

479
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,110
Walter Broznich. Hi.

480
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,619
This is all so terrible.
How are the other girls?

481
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,483
I'm not sure.

482
00:25:56,688 --> 00:26:00,819
I shouldn't have let Helen drive in
that damn rain. Is she gonna be okay?

483
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,752
In addition to the injuries your
daughter sustained in the accident...

484
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,129
we found that she has a rare
disorder called Wilson's disease.

485
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,465
I'm confused. Last week you
people said she had hepatitis.

486
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:15,005
She does. In the sense
that her liver is inflamed...

487
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,005
as a result of
copper accumulation.

488
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,803
I have some in my brain too.

489
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,812
Wilson's is a genetic
condition that can cause...

490
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:27,316
both psychiatric and motor disorders.
In particular, jerky movements.

491
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,955
It's usually not symptomatic
until adolescence.

492
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,622
Is that why I hit the
gas and not the brakes?

493
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,090
That would be my
suspicion. Yeah.

494
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,092
- It's curable?
- It's manageable.

495
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,789
There's a Rick Kelly
who's a wildlife artist.

496
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,630
- Click on that other web site.
- You think it's the rock climber?

497
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:49,002
How cute, especially
with those tight shorts.

498
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,836
- What are you doing?
- Googling your blind date.

499
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,471
What? That is so rude. If you wanna
know anything about him, just ask me.

500
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,278
- Why? You've never even met him.
- Wow.

501
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,212
- Buns of steel, huh?
- Hmm.

502
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,983
Maybe I can live with the vegan
thing. Are you sure this is him?

503
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,356
What's so funny?

504
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,157
What?

505
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,565
Sorry about what's
happening with your brother.

506
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,035
Hopefully they'll find
him safe and sound.

507
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,641
Well, I'd better get
back to the phones.

508
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:30,010
- Where's that Bell's palsy patient?
- Exam 1. Here, I'll show you.

509
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,180
- I wish you'd go home.
- Why? So people can talk more...

510
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:38,222
- about my tragic family?
- That's not where it's coming from.

511
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,916
You know that.
They're concerned.

512
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,358
Yeah, I know.

513
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,732
All we can do is
interview the children...

514
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,370
get a better sense of home life.

515
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:54,939
If she's got customers going home
with her, there could be endangerment.

516
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,838
- Who's this?
- Bruce Dorchester, social services.

517
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,672
I'm new. I don't
think we've met.

518
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,247
So if your findings support removal,
will the children be kept together?

519
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,748
- We'll make every effort, yeah.
- Great.

520
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:08,183
- Why are you doing this?
- I know you mean well...

521
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,845
- but we're trying...
- But what? They're good kids.

522
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,548
Their mother provides for them.

523
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:16,593
- Yes, by actively prostituting herself.
- She has been arrested twice.

524
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,230
Is she under arrest now?

525
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:21,925
She admits to leaving her minor children
home alone at night. That's neglect.

526
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,195
- We've seen much worse.
- By law, we have to report this.

527
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,464
Look, I shouldn't have
to explain this to you.

528
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,235
You have to explain it
to somebody. It's wrong.

529
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,305
- This isn't your call.
- Is it yours?

530
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,916
You're a nurse, Abby. You don't have
the power to make this kind of decision.

531
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,785
I think this sucks.

532
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,272
What is her problem?

533
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,589
She's using accessory
muscles to breathe now.

534
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,254
- Is she talking at all?
- Asked where her daughter was.

535
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,266
- Where is she?
- Bathroom, I think.

536
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:59,098
Go to 20 mics of dopamine.

537
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,503
Mrs. Rasmussen?

538
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,940
I need to talk to you
about your condition.

539
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:11,783
Your lungs aren't working too
well anymore. Neither is your heart.

540
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,478
If it gets much worse, we're
going to have to intubate you.

541
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,818
Your daughter has asked us to
do everything we can to save you.

542
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:27,899
But in situations like this, often the
treatment is worse than the condition.

543
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,636
There's something you can sign
called a "do not resuscitate" order.

544
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,135
Plums.

545
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,167
What?

546
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,974
There are plums
in the back yard.

547
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:46,681
They're so lovely, sweet.

548
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,046
Do you like plums?

549
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,533
I brought an
umbrella just in case.

550
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,741
- It is beautiful from up here, isn't it?
- Yeah.

551
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:23,352
Listen, if you need any help,
need me to make some calls...

552
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:26,185
- answer some questions, I...
- Do you believe...

553
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,890
- people can die instantly?
- Sorry?

554
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,156
I don't know. I'm a nurse.

555
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,569
I don't know if I believe
it happens instantly.

556
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:42,106
A second can
seem like a lifetime.

557
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,178
Like when you hit the
brakes to avoid hitting a car...

558
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,712
it seems like it
takes forever to stop.

559
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,922
But maybe if you go
nose-first into the water...

560
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:02,789
at 200 miles an hour,
it is instantaneous.

561
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,623
At least I hope it is.

562
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,770
Why do you think
he went nose-first?

563
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,584
I don't know.

564
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,522
I'd better get back to work.

565
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,591
So you say you're sick, you're broke,
you're unemployed and uninsured.

566
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,760
Yeah, sure. Come on over.

567
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,373
Mr. Willner is regular again, and
I'm out of here. What you getting into?

568
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,941
I think I'm gonna
stay, do some studying.

569
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,635
- I missed a diagnosis.
- It happens to the best of us.

570
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:57,407
- Hey, you get one of these?
- "Greetings from Baltimore."

571
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,144
- Frank, Exam 1's clear.
- Tell it to the next clerk. I'm history.

572
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,653
- Damn it.
- Sounds like Leon's having a nice time?

573
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,052
- Guess he's adjusting okay.
- Yeah.

574
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:11,060
- Abby, Carter's on the line for you.
- I'll take it in there.

575
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,460
- Well, have a good night.
- Yep. You too.

576
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,567
Plan on it.

577
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,896
- Hey.
- Hey.

578
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,339
Stanley, thought you'd be
out painting the town by now.

579
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,841
Well, all my friends
are too tired to go out.

580
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:29,175
- You're kidding me, right?
- They all have pernicious anemia.

581
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,243
Everything in my life
was built around it.

582
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,910
Support groups,
therapy, committees.

583
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,247
- What do I do now?
- Well, you could try enjoying yourself.

584
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,021
How?

585
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,787
So your flight
was all right then?

586
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,123
<i>Yeah.</i>

587
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,924
Um...

588
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,402
Eric's plane disappeared.

589
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,272
It went off radar or something.

590
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,801
They don't know.

591
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,104
Have you been in the water yet?

592
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,142
No, Carter. You
don't have to do that.

593
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,981
Carter, he could
show up in an hour.

594
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,649
I just want to wait and
see what happens, okay?

595
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,628
Okay?

596
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:22,366
All right, I have to
go. I'll call you later.

597
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,369
- Good night, Abby.
- Good night.

598
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:34,741
- I hope everything's okay.
- Thanks.

599
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:38,706
- Okay, I'm taking six more.
- Cut down on the caffeine.

600
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,513
Or give some to Conni. Her
shift started 10 minutes ago.

601
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,678
- Need something done?
- A Nipride drip in 1.

602
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,824
- I'll do it.
- You rock.

603
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:49,723
- Have you been here since yesterday?
- Well, there's no place like home.

604
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,831
Help. I think my mother's
having a heart attack.

605
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,399
How's this?

606
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,695
Smells better anyway.

607
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,328
I don't know how you
people stand all this crap.

608
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,202
Me either.

609
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,606
- You want some privacy?
- I wanna get out of here.

610
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,837
All right. I'll see
what I can do.

611
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:13,748
- They still haven't found a bed upstairs?
- My dad went to find out about it.

612
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,717
Did anybody else die?

613
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,756
In the accident? A couple
of girls were seriously injured.

614
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,292
But they're in Recovery
now. They should be okay.

615
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,895
- So just Terri died?
- Yeah.

616
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,893
Not Sasha?

617
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,261
No.

618
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,426
I don't know how that happened.

619
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,902
It was raining pretty hard.

620
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,768
Sasha was meaner.

621
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,237
- Sorry?
- They weren't very nice to me.

622
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,480
They were never very nice to me.

623
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,843
Come on now. - No! No!

624
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,256
It'll be all right.

625
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,909
- Mommy!
- No!

626
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,112
Why are you
letting them do this?

627
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,655
Everything'll be all right.
- Mommy! No!

628
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,123
It's just till I get better.

629
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,285
Everything's gonna
be all right, all right?

630
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,693
- Mommy, no!
- I love you.

631
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,265
It's okay. - No! No!

632
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,165
She left them alone at night.

633
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,471
Yeah.

634
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,943
- What happened?
- She coded.

635
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,014
Shocked her twice, intubated
her, and she converted.

636
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,516
Guess this rules you out as a
second signature for her DNR.

637
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,122
- It's what she wanted.
- I need to talk to you about Helen.

638
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,192
Keep her systolic above 90,
and let's get her up to the MICU.

639
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,896
- It may not be the disease.
- What? What are you talking about?

640
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:36,523
Helen hated those girls. And they
weren't too crazy about her either.

641
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:41,139
Teenagers torture each other in
high school. Believe me, I remember.

642
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,242
Yeah. But they get upset
when they run over classmates.

643
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,344
Her flat affect could definitely
be part of the Wilson's.

644
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,980
Just because she
has a disorder...

645
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,378
doesn't mean she didn't
know what she was doing.

646
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,144
Are you implying that she
hurt those girls on purpose?

647
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:58,653
She seems disappointed more of
them didn't die. That's what I'm implying.

648
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:03,261
- Doctor, the appy in 4 is asking for you.
- Excuse me.

649
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,158
Your blind date called and
said he'd just pick you up here.

650
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,165
- Fine.
- I have a brother that's single.

651
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,496
Clotted PICC line.

652
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,170
Maybe I missed my turn. I got
up and walked around for a while.

653
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:21,075
Here's a tip. Never give up your place
on the waiting list at a county hospital.

654
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:24,842
- It's no big deal.
- Yeah, it's a huge deal. Come on.

655
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,783
No, really. It gave me a
chance to people-watch.

656
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,684
Well, that's putting
a positive spin on it.

657
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,857
So why do you have a PICC line?

658
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,998
Uh... Stage 3C
testicular cancer.

659
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,103
These two should be
reviewed in surgical committee.

660
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:50,208
- You got it.
- I remember you.

661
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,744
Rocket.

662
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,435
How'd I do?

663
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,013
Very, very well.

664
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,883
Because you promised
you'd take care of me, right?

665
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,282
Get some rest.

666
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,651
Send them to the QA office?

667
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,123
Mr. Dresden can
transfer to Four West.

668
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,993
And I am going
home to soak my feet.

669
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,929
Donald, have a minute?

670
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,935
- Dr. Romano, what can I do for you?
- Well, I read your memo...

671
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,073
and I think your
concerns are valid...

672
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,676
so I'm willing to limit my surgical
supervision to fifth-year residents.

673
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:27,506
- Keep going to physical therapy.
- Wait, look. Hear me out.

674
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,978
They already have
all the skills they need.

675
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,413
I'd just be there to
comment and observe.

676
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,950
You have physical liabilities.

677
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,146
It'd be one or two cases a week.
I wouldn't have to lift a finger.

678
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:41,282
We simply cannot expose patients
or the hospital to unnecessary risks.

679
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,121
Look, look, look.

680
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,256
Just keep me on the schedule,
even if it's in name only.

681
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,367
- Dr. Romano...
- Damn it. Please don't make me beg.

682
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:53,096
Until your recovery
has progressed further...

683
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,298
let's use your expertise
to help our students.

684
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,979
- They ready for us?
- Almost.

685
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,149
I'd like to get a psychiatric
consult before admitting Helen...

686
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,817
to the medicine
floor for treatment.

687
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,657
Why?

688
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,334
Mr. Broznich, although the
disease impacts the brain...

689
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,960
it doesn't necessarily
explain all behavior.

690
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,667
What do you mean?

691
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,739
Your daughter has the
ability to make decisions.

692
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,847
She goes to school.
She drives a car.

693
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,312
I don't understand.

694
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,879
I think you need to speak
with the police again.

695
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm a spastic. You said that.

696
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,124
No, Helen. I didn't say that.

697
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,519
That's why I hit the
gas and not the brakes.

698
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,219
- I'll send the detective in.
- Wait.

699
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,192
- It's not the disease?
- That will have to be decided.

700
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,266
It was her?

701
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,499
- I don't know.
- She could have done this?

702
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,541
I don't know.

703
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,545
Okay. I'm going to inject something
called streptokinase into your port...

704
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,684
which should dissolve the clot
and make your line functional.

705
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:17,414
A good thing, because your white
blood counts are almost nonexistent.

706
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,080
I had chemo 10 days ago.

707
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,850
Your neutrophiles
are below 500...

708
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,517
making you susceptible
to life-threatening infection.

709
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,664
The ER is the last
place you should be.

710
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,425
Really? I kind of like it here.

711
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,293
Okay. Now I know you're sick.

712
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:37,369
When you're done with this, go home,
take your temperature every four hours.

713
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,979
Anything above 100.4 and
you get your butt back here.

714
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,272
- Wouldn't it just be easier to stay?
- No.

715
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,077
- Hey.
- You out of here?

716
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,220
- Yeah.
- Any word?

717
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,252
- Nothing.
- Is Carter coming back?

718
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,789
- No. I told him not to.
- You don't have to be alone tonight.

719
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,723
Go with you on your
blind date? I don't think so.

720
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,558
- Call me if you need me.
- I'll be fine.

721
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,256
Good night.

722
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,000
Is that him?

723
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:07,396
Uh... Yeah.

724
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,834
Have fun.

725
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,437
Hi. Heh.

726
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,580
- I'm Susan Lewis.
- Rick Kelly.

727
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,945
So are you ready to go?

728
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,585
Actually, I have to stick
around with a patient.

729
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,786
A kid with testicular cancer.
I should've called you.

730
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:28,093
- I drove in from Lincoln Park.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

731
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,327
Okay, then. Should
we reschedule?

732
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,796
Probably not.

733
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,289
Really?

734
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,259
Well, you know when you
meet someone and you can tell...

735
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,632
if there's a connection or not?

736
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,800
Actually, I don't wanna
give up steak. I'm sorry.

737
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:51,680
What happened to your date?

738
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,375
Oh, it wasn't meant
to be, I guess.

739
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,521
Let's get you a
shot of Neupogen.

740
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,351
CHEN. Mm.

741
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,857
Did you get new furniture?
It feels different in here.

742
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:07,357
- It's less crowded.
- Ah. Maybe that's it.

743
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,499
You miss him?

744
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,869
Sometimes.

745
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,804
I never lived with anyone
aside from my parents.

746
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,071
- No?
- But they weren't around much.

747
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:25,315
Guess that's why sometimes
I love my alone time.

748
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:31,381
Not me. I grew up around a whole
bunch of cousins and kids in the projects.

749
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:34,583
- Mm.
- I like it loud. The more the merrier.

750
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,587
You like kids?

751
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,892
Why do you ask?

752
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,700
I don't know. You ever
think about having them?

753
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,503
Okay, okay. You're
not the maternal type.

754
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,040
No. No. I love kids.

755
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,178
Well, good. Me too.

756
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,170
I...

757
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,706
I had one.

758
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,682
You have a kid?

759
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,855
I gave him up for adoption.

760
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,720
Why?

761
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,956
I don't know. It's complicated.

762
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,263
He's being raised
by good people.

763
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,229
Aren't you good people?

764
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,373
I guess I wasn't ready.

765
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,049
Well, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

766
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,710
- Mm.
- Mm.

767
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,718
All right?

768
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,196
Mom, are you there?

769
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:31,003
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
call you back earlier.

770
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,276
But I need to talk to you now.

771
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,483
Mom, if you're there,
could you please pick up?

772
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,286
<i>Okay.</i>

773
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,486
<i>Maybe you're sleeping. Um...</i>

774
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,322
<i>Call me back. I should be home.</i>
