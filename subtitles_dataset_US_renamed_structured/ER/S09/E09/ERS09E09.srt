1
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,307
- Where's Mom?
- You need cable.

2
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,376
I broke a bowl. I'm sorry.

3
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,536
I'm making scrambled.
You want some?

4
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,271
No.

5
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,982
- Have you got some cheese?
- Just the stuff in a can. What time is it?

6
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,585
Almost 5.

7
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,466
It's early for breakfast,
don't you think?

8
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,418
Not if it's your last supper.

9
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,992
- Nothing fresh?
- I'm not hungry anyway.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,254
You need to eat something.

11
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:07,496
He's been up since 3.
Maybe you should talk to him.

12
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,937
Hey.

13
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,805
What are you watching?

14
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,465
Nothing.

15
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,508
Everything.

16
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:22,313
- You having trouble falling asleep?
- Trouble staying that way, actually.

17
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,782
Kind of a crappy
neighborhood you live in.

18
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,752
You wanna talk about it?
Tell me what's going on.

19
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,828
You had me medically discharged,
and I'm about to check into a loony bin.

20
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,362
- What do you think's going on?
- Treatment center.

21
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,831
It's one of the best treatment
centers in the city, and it's just days.

22
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,970
My days.

23
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,674
- It's been a long trip.
- The more aggressively we treat this...

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,207
- the better your chances are...
- My chances.

25
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,640
- I'm tired. He's tired.
- We agreed, Eric.

26
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,213
When the hell did
this become "we"?

27
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,843
When you started
having to take Depakote.

28
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:02,412
Is that how it works? Anything over
500 milligrams gets you locked up?

29
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,987
- Eric.
- You're lucky you're only 250.

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,153
It's weight-based.

31
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,660
Follow my finger
with your eyes, Timmy.

32
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,062
Good.

33
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:18,638
He came in saying he had a headache,
swears nothing happened to him.

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,467
You wear a helmet
when you ride a bike?

35
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,075
Yeah, but I wasn't.

36
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,143
They can't play
outside the yard.

37
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,405
So, what were you
guys doing out there?

38
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,709
Playing catch? Playing
a little cops and robbers?

39
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,684
Might help me figure out whether
Timmy needs medicine or an operation.

40
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,490
Or both.

41
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,251
Gravity.

42
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,584
Is that some kind of game?

43
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:46,159
Uh... I hold him
up by the ankles...

44
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,360
and see how long it takes him
to hit the ground after I let go.

45
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,368
- One 1000.
- Okay.

46
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,235
- Chuny, let's get a head CT, no contrast.
- You bet.

47
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,934
How many times have I
told you not to torture him?

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,944
- Another Kodak moment?
- Kid has a concussion...

49
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,947
- wouldn't rat out his brother.
- That'd make him a squealer.

50
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,778
It's a fate worse
than head trauma.

51
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,420
- When's Abby due back?
- She's back. Yesterday.

52
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,078
Yeah? Everything okay?

53
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,954
Yeah. I mean, other than needing
a vacation from her vacation.

54
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:17,461
Ugh. No kidding. If I was
stuck on a train with my family...

55
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:21,193
It's a bad example because I'd
throw myself on the tracks. Bye.

56
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,803
Not so fast. Weaver
wants you to cover her shift.

57
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,633
That's the second time this week.
- And it's only Tuesday.

58
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,400
Is she moonlighting or slacking?

59
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,306
"Getting involved with labor
negotiations" is what I heard.

60
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,706
Something like that.

61
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,314
Well, so much for salsa tonight.

62
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,974
- You losing all your party pals?
- Yeah, between work and boyfriends...

63
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,212
nobody seems to have
time for fun anymore.

64
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,153
- Excuse me. Are you doctors?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,259
But you have to
sign in over at Triage.

66
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,157
I can't do this. I just can't.

67
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,233
Shall we look or call security?

68
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,660
Both.

69
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,097
Check the umbilical stump.

70
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,934
Less than an hour old.

71
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,036
Every day begins with
90 minutes of group.

72
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,875
Individual sessions
are twice a week...

73
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,240
with recreational therapies
rounding out the schedule.

74
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,109
- Monday through Friday.
- Eight to 4.

75
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,477
Busy day.

76
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,586
Now, we have found that a
four-pronged approach is most effective.

77
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:24,088
Therapy, structure, social
interaction and, of course, meds.

78
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,692
- Which you dispense?
- Absolutely.

79
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,962
Through there, there
are some lockers...

80
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,496
where patients can
store their belongings.

81
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,996
We provide a hot lunch.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,999
And on occasion, take the
group to nearby cultural events.

83
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,604
- What about recess?
- Pardon me?

84
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,376
I mean, no swings, no monkey bars,
no slides, not even a merry-go-round.

85
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,408
- Eric.
- Honey, why don't we go talk...

86
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,208
- to some of the other people.
- Oh, for bipolar show-and-tell? Okay.

87
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,811
Hey. How you doing? Yeah.

88
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,478
There's always an
adjustment period.

89
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:01,290
- Will you be keeping him on Zyprexa?
- He needs to be on an anti-psychotic?

90
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,556
He's had some delusional
thoughts with his mania.

91
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,757
Well, before
prescribing anything...

92
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,426
I'll wanna review his medical
records and, of course, talk with him.

93
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:13,904
I can probably tell you
anything you need to know.

94
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,242
Be more helpful
coming from the patient.

95
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,403
But down the line, family therapy
may well be a part of the program.

96
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,310
I'll let you know.

97
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,684
Appears term. Skin's good.

98
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,913
Well perfused. No jaundice.

99
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,149
No ID, no
information, no nothing.

100
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,624
Fontanel is soft, a little
sunken. Definitely dehydrated.

101
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,286
- You think she had any help?
- Delivering? I doubt it.

102
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,263
Umbilical cord is clamped
with a Powder-puff Girls barrette.

103
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,765
Powerpuff Girls.

104
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,767
We just call Social
Services, right?

105
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,600
Safe Haven Law. Mom can
drop off a newborn, no questions.

106
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,767
Bilateral red reflex, pupils reactive.
At least she did the responsible thing.

107
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,439
- Did she?
- The baby could've ended up in a dump.

108
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,549
Where's the father,
the girl's parents?

109
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,686
Where's the girl? Out there
living like nothing happened.

110
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,685
- Need a heel-stick.
- And a diaper.

111
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,450
Double MVA, 12-year-old
girl with ankle deformity.

112
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,389
- The driver is shocky. Abdominal trauma.
- Kid's vitals okay?

113
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,859
Go find out. They're
rolling up right now.

114
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,963
- Coming?
- Hmm.

115
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,702
Yeah. In a minute.

116
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,308
He's vomiting.

117
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,966
Gil Brenner, rollover t-bone.

118
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,978
Poster boy for blunt
trauma. BP, 100/72.

119
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,809
- Any LOC?
- Awake at the scene.

120
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,316
- GCS, 14 so far, but he keeps heaving.
- Blood and urine in his pants.

121
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,852
- Mr. Brenner, I'm Dr. Carter.
- Morgan.

122
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,581
- His kid's in the next rig.
- Your daughter's behind you.

123
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,852
Page Trauma Surg and set up
for a chest tube. Hang in there.

124
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,051
Where's my 10 bucks?

125
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,323
- Staying in my wallet.
- Making that "no shake, no pay" noise?

126
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,490
- Hi. I'm Erin. What's your name?
- Morgan.

127
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,694
Left ankle deformity. No other
injury. Truck hit the driver's side.

128
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,862
- Where was she?
- In the back, opposite.

129
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,167
Daddy says he can keep
an eye on me that way.

130
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,835
- Why? You get into trouble?
- No, he's a worrywart.

131
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,038
Lateral C-spine, chest
and pelvis to start.

132
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,238
It's just me.

133
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,385
- Normal heart, decreased on the left.
- Can you open your mouth?

134
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,284
- Good radial pulses.
- No dental fractures. Mandible is stable.

135
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,816
- Mother's gone.
- Sats, 90.

136
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,860
- 28 French on vascular clamp.
- He's got a left clavicular fracture.

137
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,963
- A pneumo.
- She doesn't understand.

138
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,689
- Ten blade.
- This the MVA?

139
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,300
- Dropped a lung. Check out the belly.
- SonoSite.

140
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,028
I'm Dr. Corday. I'll be
assessing your need for surgery.

141
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,536
Hope not. Aah!

142
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,441
- Tender abdomen, hypotensive.
- Tube's going in.

143
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,600
- Aah!
- Fluid in Morrison's.

144
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,472
Mr. Brenner, you probably have
an injury to your internal organs...

145
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,617
which we'll need to repair.
Anybody you'd like us to call?

146
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,446
- Your wife?
- No.

147
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,885
- Daughter's next door.
- Need a cell saver for the Thora-Seal.

148
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,287
- Is it bad? CORDAY:
Stay with us, Mr. Brenner.

149
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,620
- Don't need a Doppler.
- Extra cell saver?

150
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,490
Catch.

151
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,722
DP and PT pulses strong.

152
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,834
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Your father's in good hands, Morgan.

153
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,402
Yeah. We got our second-best
doctor working on him.

154
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,566
- Second?
- Number one's with you, isn't he?

155
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,346
- A distal tib-fib. Get her to X-ray.
- Where are they taking him?

156
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,505
Might need a test
we can't perform here.

157
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,740
Or surgery.

158
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,320
- Hey, you got a favorite color?
- Yeah, why?

159
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,754
We need to put a cast on your ankle, and
we've got all the colors in the rainbow.

160
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,323
- I like pink.
- Heh. Me too.

161
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,090
Look for images...

162
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,862
that best describe
your feelings...

163
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,268
during the hypomanic
phases of your illness.

164
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,274
Hey, does anybody
have a Viagra ad?

165
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,712
- Kidding.
- We find that this exercise...

166
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:45,113
really helps them to identify
the seductive side of their mania.

167
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,776
Seems so simple.

168
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,055
Has to be in the beginning.

169
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:52,852
They are used to chaos,
to acting on their impulses.

170
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:58,795
This allows them to move into a
world of structure and self-discipline.

171
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,957
He'll adapt.

172
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,296
Obviously, you did.

173
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,836
- See you this afternoon.
- Thanks, doctor.

174
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,635
- You ready?
- I guess.

175
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,543
- Something wrong?
- No.

176
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,975
Mom.

177
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,174
- Think this is the right facility for him?
- Okay...

178
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,218
- how did I know that was coming?
- I'm not saying it's not.

179
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,323
But seeing it, seeing what
they're making him do...

180
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,326
Okay, the collages are stupid.

181
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,658
- But that's only one part.
- It'd be great if he was 10 years old.

182
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,994
- Well, emotionally, he pretty much is.
- No, he's not.

183
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,261
Okay, 15 then.

184
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,607
I know how he feels, like we're
trying to take away his personality...

185
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,867
the thing he likes
about being him.

186
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,034
Which is also the
thing destroying him.

187
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,511
What if he does it independently?
Sees a psychiatrist, gets a job...

188
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,345
- tries to learn how to deal with it?
- How do you keep him on his meds?

189
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,511
You can't force meds
or this so-called therapy...

190
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,487
- down your brother's throat...
- Ha-ha-ha.

191
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,788
- If he's not ready for it. It won't work.
- "So-called therapy." What will?

192
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,088
Why do you do that?
We're not talking about me.

193
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,754
You always shove it in my face.

194
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,527
You keep insisting that you're
the expert, that you know best.

195
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,192
Maybe this once, I do.

196
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,930
You know, you are
not exactly cured.

197
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,803
And he needs someone stable
to help get him through this.

198
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,877
- I'm his mother.
- Oh, come on.

199
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,544
In and out of hospitals for the past
30 years. You're not anybody's mother.

200
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,554
Okay, wait.

201
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:35,623
- He looks good. How's he doing?
- Temp's normal, pulse down to 140.

202
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,765
- I think he likes it here.
- No beds upstairs, huh?

203
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:43,131
I don't mind. It's nice to have a
healthy baby down here for a change.

204
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,397
Repeat the bolus
of 20 cc's per kilo.

205
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:49,168
Then try him on 30 cc's of Enfamil q
two hours until Pedes takes him up.

206
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,176
I don't know how anybody
could give him away.

207
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,576
Well, I'm sure she had her
reasons. Call me if he won't feed.

208
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,809
45-year-old woman, four hours of
abdominal pain, vomiting times 10.

209
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,950
Epigastric tenderness
without rebound.

210
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,522
- Deb, have you seen Kovac anywhere?
- Nope. Sorry.

211
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,286
Ah. He's only the
swing shift Attending.

212
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,921
- Hemoglobin's normal, as are LFTs.
- The doctor you should be presenting to.

213
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,468
- UA and ICON are normal and negative.
- I'm the only one here with a work ethic.

214
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,936
So I'm thinking food
poisoning. Gastroenteritis.

215
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,599
But she has intractable vomiting
despite Compazine and Reglan.

216
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,876
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.
How are you doing?

217
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,983
- Not so good.
- Otherwise you wouldn't be here, right?

218
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,880
Do you know what's wrong?

219
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,279
It's okay. He's my boyfriend.

220
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,857
Your tests show an anion gap,
which could be due to vomiting...

221
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,358
dehydration, a lactic acidosis.

222
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,462
We'll need to run more
tests to make sure.

223
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,958
So will you need to admit me?

224
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,896
You hate hospitals
as much as I do?

225
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,626
You kidding? She lives in them.

226
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,065
I'm an RN.

227
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,900
We can't send you home if
we can't control your vomiting.

228
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:58,303
Yeah. And she can't come to my
house either. I just got new rugs.

229
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,873
Just kidding.

230
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,312
We'll be right back.

231
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:13,182
- Give Mr. Brenner another 25 of fentanyl.
- You got it.

232
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,987
- Are you comfortable?
- No.

233
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,428
How long will I be out?

234
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,932
We need to identify,
then stop the hemorrhage.

235
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,197
- We may have to remove your spleen.
- No.

236
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,772
Out of commission.

237
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,000
There's a possibility
you injured your bowel.

238
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:34,671
That's the case, requires a pull-down to
reattach your intestines after it's healed.

239
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,848
My daughter?

240
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,846
Morgan has a fractured ankle.
I understand she's doing fine.

241
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,182
Are you sure we can't
contact your wife for you?

242
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,521
She barely remembers her.

243
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,526
- Sorry?
- She left us.

244
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,630
- Your wife passed away?
- No, no, no.

245
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:56,361
She couldn't be there for her. She
left it to me to be a mom and dad.

246
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,433
- Need some help over here!
- Kovac, you're late.

247
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,542
- Blame my alarm clock.
- What's her name?

248
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,275
- Hip fracture, 82-year-old woman.
- Not "old woman." Matilda.

249
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,440
BP's 100 palp. Pulse,
120. Gave 500 of saline.

250
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,485
Left hip is ecchymotic with shortened
leg and externally-rotated foot.

251
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,714
- Beautiful name you have.
- Bruising on the leg. When did she fall?

252
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,724
Figure a couple of days
ago. Landlord found her.

253
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:21,848
She taking anything?

254
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:23,829
Would've. Found
enalapril and glipizide...

255
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,830
- about two feet away.
- Diabetic. Lucky she's not in a coma.

256
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,663
- Coming through. Watch it.
- We're putting you in another bed, okay?

257
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,396
One in which we can
keep an eye on you.

258
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,564
From what I hear,
you're a troublemaker.

259
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,267
- Is there a bathroom anywhere?
- It's down the hall...

260
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,071
but I need to find a wheelchair.

261
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,578
What she means is
they've been getting stolen.

262
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,582
- I kind of have to go bad.
- Better get her a bedpan then.

263
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,413
- And go here?
- Don't worry.

264
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,987
We'll close the door,
give you some privacy.

265
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,317
- Need some help?
- I think I can do it by myself.

266
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,925
Okay.

267
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,762
Push four of morphine and
find her mother's number.

268
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,455
Pop's gonna be in
surgery for a while.

269
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,365
It's okay!

270
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,233
Go ahead.

271
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,336
Hey, Morgan? I'm coming in.

272
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,978
- No, don't!
- Oh, my God.

273
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,977
You're a boy.

274
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,049
A 12-year-old cross-dresser?

275
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,446
All I know is,
anatomically, she's a he.

276
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,214
- And you're sure?
- I've seen my fair share of penises.

277
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,050
- Really?
- Anyway, she's...

278
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,852
He's pretty upset, and I
think you should talk to him.

279
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,392
- Found the mom?
- Working on it.

280
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,257
No, work faster.

281
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,768
Hey. How you doing?

282
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,904
I wanna see my dad.

283
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,134
He's still in surgery.

284
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,404
How much longer?

285
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,572
I don't know.

286
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,184
So, what's the deal?

287
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,349
Why you going around
dressed like a girl?

288
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,722
Because I am one.

289
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,693
I have the wrong body.

290
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,961
You're kind of young to be
thinking that way, aren't you?

291
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,693
No, I always have.

292
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,236
Is your dad in on this too?

293
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,774
He moved us so I can
start over at a new school.

294
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,206
Nobody knows.

295
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,540
Well, they're gonna find out
eventually, don't you think?

296
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,650
Not if we keep moving.

297
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:28,879
And when I'm old enough,
I'm gonna get the operation.

298
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,286
What does your mom
have to say about that?

299
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,887
She has a different family now.

300
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,299
Look, your dad's
gonna be a while...

301
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,997
and we need someone
to come get you.

302
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,233
My dad's friend lives near us.

303
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,340
Your mom would
be more appropriate.

304
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,313
She thinks I'm a
freak! Just like you do.

305
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,910
Please.

306
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,152
What's this friend's name?

307
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,993
- What do we do? Who do we call?
- Don't do anything.

308
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,030
- G! G!
- Leon, what are you doing here?

309
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,599
He made me leave.

310
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,169
- Who?
- He gave me no reason.

311
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,895
He just told me
that I was fired.

312
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,106
- What?
- He was mean, G. Hit me with a broom.

313
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,767
- I didn't even do nothing!
- Pratt, Urology, line one.

314
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,106
Yeah, take a message. Come on.

315
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,715
All my spare time. Hold.

316
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,441
County.

317
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,951
- Someone's asking for you.
- Did you get a name?

318
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,022
Anita Coffee?

319
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,160
- A pseudonym or a cry for help?
- Pretty clever, huh?

320
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,762
- Hey. It's freezing.
- Hi.

321
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,162
- Why didn't you come inside?
- Didn't feel like dealing with anybody.

322
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,325
- You get someone to cover?
- Everything okay?

323
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,028
Yeah. Just need
a little company.

324
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,003
I was hoping the mailman
would come, that he'd hear me.

325
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,403
Good pedal pulses.

326
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,439
Is the pain medicine working?

327
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,546
I don't get much mail.

328
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,078
No letters from your grandkids?

329
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,774
Well, junk, mostly.

330
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,046
Matilda, I need you to be quiet
while I listen to your chest, okay?

331
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,518
2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

332
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,186
Matilda?

333
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,789
- Wake up! How much fentanyl she get?
- A hundred mics.

334
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,796
That wouldn't knock her out.
She could be losing her airway.

335
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,628
Matilda, wake up. - Got them.

336
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,763
Initial glucose is
576. Bicarb is normal.

337
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,803
Not DKA. Maybe
hyperosmolar coma.

338
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,101
I'll check for the gag.

339
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,304
What the hell are you doing?

340
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,914
Are you okay?

341
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:40,144
Well, I was having a nice rest
till this bitch started choking me.

342
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,788
Nice. HALEH: Dr. Lewis?

343
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,117
Jeremy Cranston is
here to see his mother.

344
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,261
Oh, yeah. Hi, Jeremy. Right this way.
- Your lungs sound good.

345
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,828
A neighbor said she
went to the hospital.

346
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,161
- She started throwing up this morning.
- Throwing up?

347
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,598
She might have food
poisoning, but we're not sure.

348
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,671
- What did you have for dinner last night?
- Steak. I'm not sick.

349
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,603
Well, like I said,
we're still working on it.

350
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,012
Mom, how come
you didn't call me?

351
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,614
- I thought you were going to.
- I didn't get a chance.

352
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,011
I'll get another chair.

353
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,812
Honey, you don't have to
stay and watch me sleep.

354
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,387
I want to. Besides, Bill's
gotta go to work, right?

355
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,114
No, that's okay. I can stay.

356
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,860
Let me get you something to read.
- Thanks, honey.

357
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,293
The gift store's upstairs.

358
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:29,299
If you need anything official or whatever,
ask me and not her boyfriend, okay?

359
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:34,099
- Is there a problem?
- No. He's just kind of a jerk sometimes.

360
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,534
So how was it left?

361
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,704
She went back to my
apartment, I came here.

362
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,553
I'll pick him up tonight. We'll
all have dinner. It'll be fine.

363
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,420
As soon as she leaves.

364
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,853
What happens then?

365
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,289
Then Eric and I will get into a routine
with his treatment and I'll work days...

366
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,433
so I can keep an
eye on him at night.

367
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:04,864
- Really?
- And I'll probably get a bigger apartment.

368
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,435
You're gonna be roommates now?

369
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:11,374
Well, I can't just let him
wander off and hope for the best.

370
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,568
He needs my help.

371
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,341
You think that's too much?

372
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,078
I think that it's a responsibility
that you could share.

373
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,880
With who? Maggie?

374
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,085
Do you know when
she'd leave us...

375
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,094
she used to do it when
we were sleeping?

376
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,597
Did I ever tell you that?

377
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,036
It became part of our
morning routine. Get up, pee...

378
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,901
check and see if Mom
had abandoned us.

379
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,201
And on the mornings
when she was gone...

380
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,674
I was left with
my little brother...

381
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:50,044
this skinny little kid who
never, ever did anything wrong...

382
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,414
and was good and
beautiful and sweet...

383
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,885
and I would have to tell him...

384
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,889
that everything
was gonna be okay.

385
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,291
What would he say?

386
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,500
"You're a liar."

387
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,641
Still V-tach. Amp of epi.

388
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,972
- Charge. SHIRLEY:
Epi in. Lido in.

389
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:23,014
Why tell me all this if
you aren't gonna fight?

390
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,950
Clear.

391
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,151
Still V-tach. You have a
daughter who needs you.

392
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,155
Charge to 300. Clear.

393
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,320
- Asystole.
- Change the leads. Make sure.

394
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,623
- It's not the leads.
- Just do it.

395
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,031
Clear.

396
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,633
- Still flatline.
- Leads are fine.

397
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,270
- Milligram of atropine. Five more of epi.
- He's oozing everywhere.

398
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,273
No pulse, no pressure.

399
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,411
God, I hate this.

400
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,917
We'll keep you comfortable
till they're ready in surgery.

401
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,684
All my life, I've been terrified
of going under the knife...

402
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,693
done everything
I could to avoid it.

403
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,660
You'll be fine.

404
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,800
No wedding ring.

405
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,561
Good-looking man like you?

406
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:20,805
Oh, it's okay now. But before...

407
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:24,604
being alone... being a spinster.

408
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,439
Terrible.

409
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,578
- Called women like me "lonely hearts."
- Were you?

410
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,645
No more than a lot of women
I knew who were married.

411
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,684
Oh, what the hell.

412
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,453
Gave me time to
improve my chess game.

413
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,191
I'm a killer.

414
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:48,097
- Is that right?
- Damn well better be, at my age.

415
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,199
Maybe we should play
sometime. I'm pretty good myself.

416
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,474
- And what about Mr. Boyle?
- Uh... Refresh my memory.

417
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,372
- Overeater with abdominal pain.
- Oh, yeah.

418
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,241
Give him an extra lunch and
pray a bed opens up in Psych.

419
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,405
Dr. Weaver called and
asked that you cover...

420
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,245
- the Finance Committee meeting at 2.
- She asked?

421
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,252
- Well, not exactly.
- Dr. Lewis.

422
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,653
I used to think that would be
so cool to hear. "Dr. Lewis."

423
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,192
Toxicology came back
on Melody Cranston.

424
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:18,422
Negative for drugs of abuse.
Serum iron level normal.

425
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,860
Any osmolal gap?

426
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,866
No. But her salicylate level
is 41 milligrams per deciliter.

427
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,004
- Aspirin overdose?
- Looks that way.

428
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,604
She's a nurse. She knows better.

429
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,901
She also knows that's not enough
to do anything but make her sick.

430
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,567
- Do me a favor. Pull her records.
- Munchausen's?

431
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,146
Maybe she wants to get
medical attention, not give it.

432
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,914
- Dr. Lewis?
- What?

433
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,574
What do you think
of the name Elias?

434
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:44,856
Don't ask me. I named my dog Puddles.
Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy.

435
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,458
- Someone getting a dog?
- No.

436
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,855
We're trying to come up
with a name for the baby.

437
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,020
Which do you like
better, Percy or Oliver?

438
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,255
Rudyard.

439
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,106
- Hasn't he suffered enough?
- What's the matter with Rudyard?

440
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:57,396
John?

441
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,266
I'm afraid Mr. Brenner
didn't make it.

442
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,965
- Where's his daughter?
- Pratt was treating her.

443
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,872
- She might be in Exam 1.
- Does she have family here?

444
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,877
Hey, Harkins?

445
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,713
- You worked on Brenner's kid, right?
- Yeah.

446
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,910
- Did you reach the mother?
- Dr. Pratt said he was gonna handle it.

447
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,078
- Did he?
- I don't know. He's on a break.

448
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,814
Well, the girl's
father just died.

449
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,092
Boy.

450
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,686
- What?
- Morgan's a boy.

451
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,893
- I guess the proper term is transsexual.
- Wait, I'm sorry.

452
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,932
His daughter is
actually his son?

453
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,764
Yes. I wanted to call the
mother, but Dr. Pratt didn't.

454
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,668
- You get the number?
- Mr. Brenner mentioned an estrangement.

455
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,002
- Harkins?
- Yes. I have it.

456
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,509
Then call. She's next of kin.

457
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:49,183
Have a good night. - Hi.

458
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:52,655
- How'd it go today?
- Not so well.

459
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,623
He left.

460
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,521
What do you mean, "He left"?

461
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,790
He withdrew from the program.

462
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,595
- And went where?
- You should probably ask your mother.

463
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:08,434
- Excuse me?
- She came and got him an hour ago.

464
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,480
I got no problem with you.

465
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,609
Fire Leon and you do. Use a broom
on him, and you've got a bigger problem.

466
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,085
He wouldn't leave.

467
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:27,784
Shows up every day, works his ass off
and does every damn thing you tell him.

468
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,327
He gets kicked to the
curb, he doesn't understand.

469
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:33,227
Somebody gets in my
store after hours with a key...

470
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,061
how the hell do you
think they got one?

471
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,668
Think I left it in the door?

472
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,395
- For all I know, Leon ripped me off.
- No.

473
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,563
- He's not like that.
- Everybody's like that.

474
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,938
Even if it was his friends, they
tricked him. He wouldn't have a clue.

475
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,602
That dumb-ass brother
of yours ain't so dumb...

476
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,443
Hey! The man took
a bullet to the head.

477
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,812
- He's not dumb.
- Get away from me.

478
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,517
Look, he wouldn't do this.

479
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,682
Get away, or I'm calling
the cops on you and him.

480
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,791
Leave Leon out of this.

481
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,927
You understand me?

482
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,960
Leave him out of it.

483
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,466
Mrs. Garding?

484
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,133
- What happened?
- Hi. I'm Dr. Carter.

485
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,864
- I don't know how much you were told.
- Next to nothing.

486
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,838
Your ex-husband and your son
were involved in a car accident.

487
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,843
Morgan has a broken
ankle. It's relatively minor.

488
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,537
Thank you, Jesus.

489
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,984
Mr. Brenner's injuries,
however, were far more extensive.

490
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,786
- And...
- Did he die?

491
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,820
Oh, my God.

492
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,391
I understand that it's been some
time since you've seen Morgan.

493
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,224
Three years.

494
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,190
And are you...?

495
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,868
Are you aware that
he's been living as a girl?

496
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:50,566
His father and I disagreed
on how to handle that.

497
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,304
Morgan wanted to live with
his dad, so I didn't fight it.

498
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,078
Morgan hasn't been told
about his father's death.

499
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,751
- I can't be the one. I'm sorry. Um.
- That's okay. I can take care of that.

500
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,753
I do think it would be
better if you were there.

501
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,984
Okay.

502
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,526
Morgan's gonna need
crutches for about six weeks.

503
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:17,192
There's a chance that he may
require a little physical therapy.

504
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,929
Otherwise, he
should recover fully.

505
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,733
Good.

506
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,471
Morgan?

507
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,473
What's wrong?

508
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,012
Honey?

509
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,118
What are you doing here?

510
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,845
Where's my dad?

511
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,024
Morgan, your dad was hurt
very badly in the accident.

512
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:46,757
- No.
- We did what we could for him here.

513
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,367
- Then he went up to an operating room.
- No!

514
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,067
They worked on
him for a long time...

515
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,638
in hopes that his heart
would start pumping again.

516
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,399
No.

517
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,409
But it didn't. And he died.

518
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,640
No! No, no!

519
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,651
It's gonna be okay.

520
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,377
Sweetie?

521
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,046
I'll take care of you, okay?

522
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,916
I'll take care of everything.

523
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,491
How soon before I can
play basketball again?

524
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,655
Soon.

525
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,995
After the reduction, put
Mr. Trotter in a sugar tong splint...

526
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,636
until the swelling goes down.

527
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,398
And the short arm cast
for six weeks after that?

528
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,974
Your ears get red when you lie.

529
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:38,845
- How are you holding up, Matilda?
- You don't even have to try, do you?

530
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,183
- Sorry?
- With women.

531
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:47,623
I checked with Surgery. They should
be ready to take you up in an hour or so.

532
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,490
Is that pronounced Ko-vack?

533
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,528
Ko-vach.

534
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:56,100
Spell your first
name for me, please.

535
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,828
- What are you doing?
- Mm. Tipping you.

536
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:02,634
- You seem like a nice young man.
- I can't accept your money.

537
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:06,074
- Why not?
- Because you need it for yourself.

538
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,707
I never had a
soul to spend it on.

539
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,372
Not even a cat.

540
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,052
I'm frugal. I'm 82.

541
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,653
Trust me.

542
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,213
I have enough to last.

543
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,155
- I can't.
- Says who?

544
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:26,631
Take it! I'm an old arthritic woman.
I can't hold my arm out forever.

545
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,357
Now, take it.

546
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,830
- Can someone really do that?
- Never had it happen before.

547
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,405
- How much is it?
- I didn't look.

548
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,166
A patient writes you a
check, and you don't look?

549
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,743
Oh, my God. You accepted
money from a patient?

550
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,209
I'll look at it.

551
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,905
That's completely unethical.

552
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,482
It made her feel good to give
me a token of appreciation.

553
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:46,846
So, yes, I took it.

554
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,181
Hello. Have her send
you a basket of muffins.

555
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:53,121
- It'll probably bounce anyway.
- Uh... It's for $10,000.

556
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,425
Melody Cranston's medical recs.

557
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,829
- Thick enough to support Munchausen's.
- Maybe not.

558
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,096
Six months ago, she had a
fractured orbit from falling off a ladder.

559
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,264
- Which is pretty damned impossible.
- Yeah? A month after that...

560
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,909
she was back. Multiple abrasions
a contusion and a forearm fracture.

561
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,604
Broken jaw in 2000.
Broken ribs in 2001.

562
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,076
Looks like Melody's
got a lousy boyfriend.

563
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,153
I tried to call.

564
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,255
- What's the matter with you?
- He doesn't want to do it this way.

565
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,159
He doesn't? Or you don't?

566
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,095
Where is he?

567
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:38,636
Abby, the only way someone with this
disease gets better is if they want to.

568
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,796
What, so until then
we just wait it out?

569
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,600
- Is that it?
- No. I didn't say that.

570
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,938
Well, then what are you saying,
Mom? What's the plan here?

571
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,310
Does he even have one?

572
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,979
Do you have one?

573
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,208
We're going back to
Minnesota in the morning.

574
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,383
What? No, you're not.

575
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:00,286
Do you have any idea how many strings
I had to pull to get him into that center?

576
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:03,190
I'll get him to see my
psychiatrist at least once a week.

577
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,354
This is a proven program!

578
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,625
- I'll keep him on his meds if I can.
- If you can?!

579
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,999
- I realize this is hard to understand.
- No, it's impossible, actually.

580
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,504
- I love him too.
- So what?

581
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:18,872
You think you're the only one
that's there for us. Maybe that's true.

582
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:23,243
- No! That is true!
- All right. But, Abby, I'm here now!

583
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,417
Where is he?

584
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,216
Afebrile, normal vitals
after 280 cc boluses.

585
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,430
- What about his glucose?
- Last two were fine.

586
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:36,221
Slow start on the
Enfamil, but he's good now.

587
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,728
Okay, then. Time to go, baby.

588
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,559
Excuse me.

589
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,601
We've both have been in here for hours,
and I haven't seen his face. Could I?

590
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,169
Hey, your first roommate
wants to meet you.

591
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,902
- Beautiful, isn't he?
- I love this age.

592
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,568
It's when they really need you.

593
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,707
- Okay. Say bye-bye.
- Okay.

594
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,114
Bye-bye.

595
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,988
Did you ever figure
out a name for him?

596
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,922
No.

597
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,391
- Did your boyfriend leave?
- He had to get to work.

598
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,794
Right.

599
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,027
- So how are you feeling?
- About the same.

600
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:21,901
Hmm. I mean, in general.
Have you been upset?

601
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:26,239
- Or depressed?
- No. Not really.

602
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,438
Then why'd you take
an aspirin overdose?

603
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,447
What was it? Like, 20 pills? That
must've been some headache.

604
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,282
Are you trying to get his sympathy,
or are you trying to get away from him?

605
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,721
We both know you've
been beaten. A lot.

606
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,762
Melody, someone is hurting you.

607
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:52,894
- You have to turn him in to the police.
- I can't do that. I couldn't.

608
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:57,500
- Violence isn't going to stop on its own.
- I just need a few days.

609
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,510
- Look, we both know...
- He's joining the Navy.

610
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,839
Your boyfriend?

611
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,649
My son.

612
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,348
All right, Jerry, talk
to me. What'd I miss?

613
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,993
Security stopped a guy
with a crossbow coming in.

614
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,823
Yosh forgot to put Conni's
ice-cream cake in the freezer.

615
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,558
- Carter's wondering where you've been.
- Hey, I had business to attend to.

616
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:25,066
- I signed my patients off to Chen.
- He asked and you asked.

617
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,865
- Did you dispo the diabetic ulcer in 1?
- Yeah.

618
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,803
And Mr. Barnsdale
got moved to the ICU.

619
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,671
Mr. Brenner back
from surgery yet?

620
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,574
- He exsanguinated in the OR.
- What?

621
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,749
- Died about an hour ago.
- Where's Morgan?

622
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:41,080
- With his mom, I think.
- I thought I told you not to do anything.

623
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:44,347
- Well, you weren't here.
- Learn to follow simple instructions!

624
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,549
I did, per Dr. Carter!

625
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,821
- What are you doing?
- I can't bring him home this way.

626
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,592
Please, put down
the scissors. Come on.

627
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,701
His stepfather will
never accept him.

628
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:02,933
- You do not need to do this.
- It's my right.

629
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,371
He's my little boy.

630
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,878
I'm doing this for him.

631
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,911
It's the best thing.

632
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:24,225
- So how often do you get earaches?
- Only when it's cold and windy.

633
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,059
- And you live in Chicago, huh?
- Well, blame my parents.

634
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,566
Much rather have grown up in
Jamaica. Where'd you grow up?

635
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,567
Dr. Chen?

636
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,772
She described you. She
said she'd been here earlier.

637
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,432
Excuse me.

638
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,908
- Hi.
- I changed my mind.

639
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,910
- I want my baby back.
- Oh.

640
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,810
- Is this the mother?
- Yeah.

641
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,952
- Do you want to tell me what happened?
- No. I just want him back.

642
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,643
Oh, yeah? For how long?

643
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,619
Can you give me the
potassium level on Mr. Pinkus?

644
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:56,057
Look, I was just really scared
before, but I'm not anymore.

645
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,787
- What's your name?
- Romy.

646
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,456
Do you think you can really
take care of a baby, Romy?

647
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,392
- My mama will help me.
- You told her?

648
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,800
No. But I'm going to.

649
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,806
He's mine. Can I see him?

650
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,342
- Chuny?
- Yeah?

651
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,276
- Please take Romy to see her baby?
- Sure. This way.

652
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,111
- You gonna call Social Services?
- Yeah.

653
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,919
- Mother of the year, huh?
- At least she's trying.

654
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:26,115
She left her baby with a bunch
of strangers. How's that trying?

655
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,625
Make sure she gets an
examination before she leaves.

656
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,994
- V-tach.
- Not surprising...

657
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,635
after lying on the
floor for two days.

658
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,034
She probably got a blood clot
that broke off and went to her lungs.

659
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,175
Happens all the time.

660
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,800
- Why didn't someone come get me?
- She had an advance directive.

661
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,209
No heroic measures.

662
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,552
- How come I didn't know about it?
- Gave it to me a little while ago...

663
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,520
wanted to make sure it was out of
her purse and in a medical record.

664
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,656
V-fib.

665
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,352
- Aren't you off yet?
- An hour ago.

666
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,021
I've got this if you wanna go.

667
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,497
Need the monitor on?

668
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,693
Yes.

669
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,539
Asystole.

670
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,536
- Where's the Accu-Chek?
- Exam 3.

671
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:20,577
- Hey, you going to bingo tonight?
- Can't. I need the overtime.

672
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:25,206
- Blackout jackpot's 5 grand.
- Yeah? Maybe I should go.

673
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,349
Sorry.

674
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,351
Have you called it?

675
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,488
1928.

676
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,254
- So Navy, huh?
- Yeah, what can I say? I like the water.

677
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,162
Can't fault you for that.
- Jeremy?

678
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,393
- She ready to go?
- Uh... Not quite.

679
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,904
Has the beginnings of a stomach ulcer,
probably from taking too much aspirin.

680
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,243
She's always complaining
about headaches.

681
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,243
Yeah. Anyway, we'll need to
keep her here for observation.

682
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,112
For how long?

683
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,581
We need to treat her abdominal
pain, keep her hydrated on IV fluids.

684
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,447
A couple of days, at least.

685
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,488
- I'm shipping out in a couple days.
- Good thing they invented telephones.

686
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,353
Good luck.

687
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,858
Maybe I misheard.
What was your diagnosis?

688
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,260
- Unintentional aspirin overdose.
- Unintentional?

689
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:18,767
- What she's telling the social worker.
- And we're admitting her?

690
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,963
Her son knocks her around.

691
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,801
- Her son?
- And he leaves for good in two days.

692
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,674
She doesn't want
it to be for jail.

693
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:32,641
- So you made up a diagnosis.
- No, I stretched one.

694
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,380
Sounds unethical.

695
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,952
So's eavesdropping.

696
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,188
- What number?
- 309.

697
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,888
- You have a key?
- Yes.

698
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,099
Eric, it's Abby.

699
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,840
Can you let me in?

700
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,702
- I need to talk to you.
- Are you alone?

701
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,475
No. Mom's here too.

702
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,112
- Why'd you bring her?
- She's worried about you, Eric.

703
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,919
- I don't want you here.
- Okay, just hold on, all right?

704
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,531
- I don't want you in my life right now.
- What?

705
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,633
Are you coming in?

706
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,567
- Okay. Wait a minute. Eric, don't do this.
- Move your hand.

707
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,537
- You need help.
- I don't wanna hurt you.

708
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,506
You can't do this by
yourself. You need stability.

709
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,146
- Let go.
- Someone you can rely on and trust.

710
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,009
That's not you anymore, okay?

711
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,879
You don't understand.

712
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,683
- Yes, I do.
- You think you do. But you don't.

713
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,952
You're not like us.
You never will be.

714
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:54,095
I'll call you when
we get settled.

715
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,733
Don't bother.

716
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:01,739
Abby.

717
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,431
Abby!

718
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,645
Taking off?

719
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,252
I have to make up time.

720
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,322
Seems like I took
too long of a break.

721
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,720
You can't just leave.

722
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,793
I signed out to Chen.

723
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:27,558
Breaks are for 10 minutes in the
hospital. You were gone for over an hour.

724
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:33,633
Look, you weren't here. So I
overrode your order to Harkins.

725
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:37,105
- But it's not like I had much of a choice.
- You could've waited...

726
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,870
paged me. You could've
respected the kid's wishes.

727
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,604
- He's a minor.
- You could've called Social Services in.

728
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,841
To do what? Remove
him from the home?

729
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,753
Hey, I feel bad about
what happened too.

730
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,253
But like it or not,
she's his only family.

731
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,848
Define "family."

732
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,891
That's her.

733
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,896
She never told me that...

734
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:39,469
I just thought that she
gained some weight.

735
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,629
Thank you.

736
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,978
Oh, I so need a margarita.

737
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,076
- Are you ready?
- I think I'm gonna pass.

738
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,047
Oh, come on. I
hate drinking alone.

739
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,551
I mean, I'll do it, but...

740
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,417
- See you tomorrow.
- Oh.

741
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,164
Next in line.

742
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,070
- Help you?
- Yeah, I need to cash a check, please.

743
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,208
ID and most recent pay stub.

744
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,670
You realize there's a 20 percent fee
for cashing a personal check this size.

745
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,839
Yeah. That's fine.

746
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,310
Hundreds okay?

747
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,611
Sure.

748
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,090
Hey.

749
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,886
What's up?

750
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,461
Better if I got my job back.

751
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,856
- It ain't gonna happen.
- You talked to him?

752
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,558
Yeah.

753
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,737
- Find anything?
- Maintenance in an apartment building.

754
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:52,343
- They want somebody with experience.
- Anything else?

755
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,244
McDonald's.

756
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,780
But it's minimum wage. Wouldn't
be so bad if it was all-you-could-eat.

757
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,747
- Hey, what's this?
- Xbox, G.

758
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,647
Yeah. What are
you doing with it?

759
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,048
My friends heard I got
fired and gave it to me.

760
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:07,090
- What friends?
- You know, my boys.

761
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,750
They gave it to me.
They won it or something.

762
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,860
Leon, did it come in a box?

763
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,442
Every once in a while...

764
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:35,511
I'll have a really
perfect cigarette.

765
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,679
You know?

766
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,156
Everything about it is
perfect. The taste, the moment.

767
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,851
Of course, 99 percent of
the time, it tastes like crap.

768
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,122
- Causes cancer.
- That too.

769
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,562
I left you a message.
How'd it go?

770
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,160
With what?

771
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,132
With your brother.

772
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,700
You gonna let me in or
do I have to guess or...?

773
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,675
Nothing happened.

774
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,209
Nothing.

775
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,943
Come on.

776
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,289
Despite the best-laid
plans, nothing happened.

777
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,620
Mostly because they left.

778
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,651
What?

779
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,122
They went off into the
sunset. Very romantic.

780
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,961
- Wait, your mom and Eric, they're gone?
- You know...

781
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:27,230
I don't wanna talk about this now,
because it's ruining my perfect smoke.

782
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,304
Sorry.

783
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,513
It's okay. I'm done.

784
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:43,010
I'm done with the both of
them. I'm done with all of it.

785
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,826
Cancel Christmas.
