1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,372
There it is. I can
see his heartbeat.

2
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,509
You can tell it's a
boy? Because I can't.

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:23,180
No, it's just a
figure of speech.

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,518
Just a pronoun.

5
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,690
Are you hoping for a boy?

6
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:32,492
Not particularly. I mean,
a boy would be nice...

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,899
but I don't care.

8
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,195
I don't even really wanna know.

9
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,906
As long as it's healthy, right?

10
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,041
- The rash of Lyme disease is...?
- Erythema migrans.

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,330
Starts two to 20
days after the tick bite.

12
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:48,205
Occurs in 60 to 80
percent of cases.

13
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,895
- The hallmark of the rash is...?
- Erythematous plaque.

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,680
Yeah. And the most common
neurological symptoms?

15
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,049
Facial nerve palsy.

16
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,554
Okay. All right. Settle down.

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,215
This is a teaching hospital,
not medical <i>Jeopardy!.</i>

18
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,294
- Where are all the doctors?
- Who?

19
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,090
Anyone. Carter, Weaver,
Pratt, I'm not picky.

20
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,961
Carter's stuck in Triage.
Pratt's on at midnight.

21
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,194
- And Weaver's MIA.
- What else is new?

22
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,963
- Kovac is sleeping.
- With who? I thought he's suspended.

23
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,698
He's back. In the lounge.

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,968
Harkins, wanna try casting a
Colles' fracture on a cranky old lady?

25
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,612
Sure.

26
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,713
- What's the antibiotic of choice?
- Doxycycline!

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,878
Beth, this is Erin. She's
gonna be putting your cast on.

28
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,217
Beth? Miss Garrison?

29
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,519
- I can't feel a pulse.
- Oh, jeez. She's cold.

30
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,356
- She's dead?
- Bag her on 15 liters.

31
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,054
I need a crash cart in here!

32
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,563
- Sister Beth?
- She was a nun?

33
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,568
- She is.
- Oh, boy.

34
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,085
Nathan. Nathan, let's
shake a leg. Come on.

35
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,160
Corday's looking for you, man.

36
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,092
Be right there.

37
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,605
ER, please hold. Think you
could take this somewhere else?

38
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,408
- I need to use the computer.
- Use one over there.

39
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:05,177
I don't want you near me when God
strikes you dead for killing that nun.

40
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,321
- I didn't kill her.
- You didn't save her.

41
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,683
She was an 87-year-old
woman in poor health.

42
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,791
What, you only save
the healthy ones?

43
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,257
She stroked out. No
one could foresee that.

44
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,762
You don't have to explain to me.
I'm not the one doing the judging.

45
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,366
GSW, 10 minutes out.
- I'll be right there.

46
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,594
Is Dr. Corday still down here?

47
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,534
John Doe. Found in the park.
No signs of serious trauma.

48
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,106
Promise me you won't
let them near my face.

49
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,766
Sir, what's your name?

50
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,004
- They dropped right out of the trees...
- We got good breath sounds.

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,014
- Nobody's near your face, sir.
- No, don't let them near me!

52
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,277
Settle down! Okay,
get five of Haldol...

53
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,284
- Don't let them bite me!
- Relax, sir.

54
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,253
- No, no. We're trying to help you.
- Get Security!

55
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,619
- It's the dyskinesia.
- Still need the Haldol?

56
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,456
Yes.

57
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,195
We got it.

58
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,390
We're going to need a head CT.

59
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,968
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks.

60
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,468
Are you okay?

61
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,471
Nothing that 12 hours
of sleep wouldn't cure.

62
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,508
Put him on pulse ox, two
liters O-2 by nasal cannula.

63
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:07,045
Mineral oil on a cotton
ball should act as a solvent.

64
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,485
Come on in. Let's
get him inside.

65
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,485
Make sure his nasal
passages stay clear.

66
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,180
Hey, Jody. What
are you doing here?

67
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,019
I'm looking for Eric.

68
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,758
Abby.

69
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,659
- Hi, Abby.
- Hey. What's going on?

70
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,164
- Where's Eric?
- I was hoping you knew.

71
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,663
What do you mean?

72
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,204
I don't know. We were in Indiana
on our way back from my parents'...

73
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,834
- They had a fight. JODY:
It was hardly an argument.

74
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,381
He got really angry. I was just asking him
about us, our future, stuff like that...

75
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,780
and he took off. I didn't
mean to upset him.

76
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,887
- Maybe he went back to his base.
- No, I called.

77
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,250
They said he's been
UA for two weeks.

78
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,917
- UA?
- Unauthorized absence.

79
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,618
Abby?

80
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,963
- He's AWOL?
- Yep.

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,464
Joel Seaton, 67, syncopal
episode at Navy Pier.

82
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,229
Paramedics found him
dehydrated, systolic of 90.

83
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,962
Came up with 500 of saline.

84
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,631
Joel was diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer three months ago.

85
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,201
What treatment have
you been on, Mr. Seaton?

86
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,779
Megace and Gemzol.

87
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:18,647
They said I might have a year with
the chemo, but I'm not doing too good.

88
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:22,084
He's had two stents in his common
bile duct to relieve the obstruction.

89
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,451
It's probably clogged,
which explains the fever.

90
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:28,061
- How's your pain?
- Every night I go to bed...

91
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,096
I keep hoping I'll wake
up in the morning...

92
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,234
and I'll be better and
the pain will be gone.

93
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,963
Think there's a surgical
alternative that could help?

94
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,607
I'm afraid not.

95
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:45,273
What happens if you
don't do anything?

96
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:51,916
You'll get more jaundiced, slip
into a coma from liver failure.

97
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:56,455
Your kidneys will fail and your heart
will stop from a high potassium level.

98
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,682
Is that a painful way to die?

99
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,589
Not once you slip into the coma.

100
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,525
We can arrange for
home hospice care.

101
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,099
A nurse will visit you twice a day
to give you the pain medications.

102
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:11,466
When my wife was living,
she used to always say...

103
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:16,474
I'd probably die in my Barcalounger
watching the football game.

104
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,305
I'm starting to think that's
not such a bad way to go.

105
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,818
Does that mean you're no longer
interested in further treatment...

106
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,353
Mr. Seaton?

107
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,951
Sorry. Let's have Ativan now.

108
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,292
- I can't see. I can't see.
- All right, just relax.

109
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,694
Need some flush?

110
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,835
Did you try to kill
yourself, Greg?

111
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,871
No. It was an accident.
He didn't mean it.

112
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,565
Page ENT and Ophtho. Get a
Wood's lamp and fluorescein.

113
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,177
- Who, Greg? Who shot you?
- Tommy.

114
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,944
- Ativan's onboard.
- A friend?

115
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,573
He's my brother. He's 10.

116
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,981
Need a two view of the face
along with a trauma panel.

117
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,415
Look at this light, Greg.

118
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,579
- Can you see this light?
- A little.

119
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,549
- Where'd Tommy get the gun?
- He was playing with our dad's gun.

120
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,730
I tried to take it away from him so he
wouldn't hurt himself, but it went off.

121
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,065
We'll do everything we can
to make you comfortable.

122
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,569
Thank you.

123
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,409
Let me know if there's
anything else you need, okay?

124
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,102
Thank you.

125
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,315
- We should have pursued other options.
- What?

126
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,680
With Corday. There are
treatments to consider.

127
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,880
I asked for surgical consult.
She didn't think it was a good idea.

128
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,049
What if it's in the
patient's best interest?

129
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,662
You went up against Carter on a
terminal patient. That's not your job.

130
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,822
- You're a med student.
- This guy could just be having a bad day.

131
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,094
We try to do what's best for the
patient and respect their wishes.

132
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,501
If we're lucky, we get to do
both. This is one of those times.

133
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,334
Have Pedes page me and
get me that Ophtho consult.

134
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,479
Dr. Kovac.

135
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,912
Mike Dobbs. I think you
know my wife, Heather.

136
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,047
Look, we've been having
some rough times recently...

137
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,020
but I'd appreciate it if
you'd stop seeing her.

138
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:15,253
- You should speak to your wife about it.
- Yeah, I did.

139
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,692
Are you married?

140
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,758
I was.

141
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,494
Then you know
how hard it can be.

142
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,740
Look, I'm not trying to threaten you or
anything, man, but I got two daughters.

143
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,071
What do I tell them when their
mother doesn't come home at night?

144
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,773
I don't know.

145
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,609
Just trying to keep my
family together, that's all.

146
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,661
Hey, Eric, it's me again. Listen,
could you please call me back?

147
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,263
You don't have to talk to me.

148
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:55,766
Just leave a message on my
machine, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

149
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,139
Looks like your day's
sucking as bad as mine.

150
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,771
Yeah. I'm worried about my
brother. I can't get in touch with him.

151
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,435
At least you haven't
killed anyone. I'm 0 for 2.

152
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,139
All these patients
could be my next victim.

153
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,281
Aha.

154
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,182
"I think I have the
crabs and it itches bad."

155
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,847
- So you're not taking the chest pain in 4?
- Not if he wants to live.

156
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,516
Guy in Exam 2 with scrotal
swelling. Pretty safe bet.

157
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,094
- I'm not that desperate.
- At least it's medical.

158
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:27,462
- He's pushing 300 pounds!
- It's a big scrotum.

159
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,867
He's a heart attack waiting to
happen. Half these patients are.

160
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,269
Old, diabetic, old,
old and diabetic.

161
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,637
- Did you reach him yet?
- No, I get his voice mail.

162
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,614
Oh, screw it. Give me
the swollen scrotum.

163
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,781
Maybe he's off with
a buddy or something.

164
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,044
Dr. Carter, could you reassess
my allergic reaction in 2?

165
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,847
- I'll be right there.
- Where's Jody?

166
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,649
She's checking into a hotel.

167
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,224
- Wanna get coffee?
- He didn't respond to Benadryl.

168
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,486
- Try Solu-Medrol.
- I did. He's still wheezing.

169
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,621
- Try an albuterol treatment.
- It didn't work. Should I push an IV epi?

170
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,791
- I'll be right back. What are his sats?
- Eighty-three on oxygen.

171
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,335
Why didn't you come get me?
- I just did.

172
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,157
<i>- Base operations.</i>
- Medical facility, please.

173
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,423
<i>One moment.</i>

174
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,895
<i>Medical.</i>

175
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,898
I'm from Chicago's County
General Emergency Department.

176
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,506
We're treating a patient from
your base, Eric Wyczenski.

177
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,938
We're gonna need his
medical records faxed over.

178
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,944
<i>- Yes, ma'am. Who's his doctor?</i>
- I don't have the chart in front of me.

179
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,116
- Does it matter who the doctor is?
<i>- Yes.</i>

180
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:53,947
<i>- We can't release his records otherwise.</i>
- Okay, just a second.

181
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,197
Um, the physician's
name is Dr. John Carter.

182
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,366
<i>Dr. John Carter.
Thank you, ma'am.</i>

183
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,364
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

184
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,166
It's okay.

185
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,170
How are you feeling, Greg?

186
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,848
My eyes hurt.

187
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,451
Can you see anything?

188
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,987
No.

189
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,518
Hey, Chuny?

190
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,917
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

191
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,652
About everything.

192
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,329
Me too.

193
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,337
Am I blind?

194
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,064
You have a shotgun
pellet inside your eyeball.

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,573
We're bringing in an
eye specialist to repair it.

196
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,037
You're lucky. You could've
blown your head off.

197
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,909
My dad would be less
mad at me if I was dead.

198
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,949
He shouldn't be angry with you at all.
You probably saved your brother's life.

199
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,252
- Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
- Shoot.

200
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,224
Carter! Carter!

201
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,890
- Is there anything wrong with him?
- Not that I can tell.

202
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,794
Neighbor heard the baby crying. Found
Mom in the backyard, kid in the swing.

203
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,632
Mom's got no sign of trauma.
Could be a possible mixed OD.

204
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,797
GCS, 415, but
she's uncooperative.

205
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:24,775
- BP, 122/78. Pulse, 84.
- Okay. What's her name?

206
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,778
Neighbor wasn't sure,
thought it was Tenji or Tong-yi.

207
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,940
- She didn't have ID.
- Ma'am, can you tell me your name?

208
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:35,020
I have a 16-year-old boy who's gonna
go blind if he doesn't get here fast.

209
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,953
Tell me where he is so I
can call for some initial orders.

210
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,525
<i>- He's on the golf course.</i>
- He's where?

211
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,924
<i>He's playing golf
at the country club.</i>

212
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,992
Eyes open to painful stimuli.

213
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,034
- Is your name Tenji? Or Tong-yi?
- Is she oriented to person?

214
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,798
- Her little boy's fine.
- Does she understand English?

215
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,874
Gag reflex is present. I
smell alcohol on her breath.

216
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,440
- Got your bloods.
- Okay, what do you want?

217
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,479
- CBC, lytes, ETOH.
- Aspirin and acetaminophen levels.

218
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,445
Hello?

219
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,108
Eric!

220
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,178
- What about charcoal?
- Where are you?

221
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,790
The 2001 recommendations
from Clinical Toxicology...

222
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,487
- didn't support the administration...
- I need to talk to you.

223
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,656
- She can't tell us when she took it.
- Twenty-five of charcoal.

224
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:24,327
I need some Surgilube and an NG
tube. Abby, she needs a Foley, tox screen.

225
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,299
- Damn it.
- And let's change the saline to D-five...

226
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,000
half at 75 an hour. - Hello?

227
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,339
Blunted deep tendon
reflexes. Could be benzos.

228
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,813
- Should we try Flumazenil?
- Only if you want her to start seizing.

229
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,812
- Did you lose him?
- Yeah. I lost him.

230
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,217
It's not unusual to
experience these feelings...

231
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,186
when dealing
with chronic illness.

232
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,019
Mr. Nathan, may I have a word?

233
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,551
Excuse me.

234
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,826
- What's he doing in there?
- That's Dr. Harvey.

235
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,061
- He's the Attending psych...
- I know. I asked you what he's doing.

236
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,432
He was on a psych
consult on another patient...

237
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,904
and I asked if he would
speak with Mr. Seaton.

238
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,374
- Did you run this by Dr. Lewis?
- No.

239
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,740
Dr. Harvey agreed.
Mr. Seaton was depressed...

240
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,508
and wasn't objective
about his own treatment.

241
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,778
- He's refused treatment.
- He's willing to consider other options.

242
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,889
- A Whipple, for instance...
- A Whipple?

243
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,922
No. Please don't tell me you
suggested a Whipple for this patient.

244
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,290
I'm not sure who brought it up.

245
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,455
Well, whoever did
must be utterly insane...

246
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,897
because nobody in their right mind
would suggest a 6-hour operation.

247
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,470
An operation that requires months of
recovery, assuming he ever recovers.

248
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,403
- And for what?
- He's dead in 2 months if we do nothing.

249
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,602
That's right. But only you seem
to be unwilling to accept that.

250
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:42,442
Well, shouldn't we at least present
him with all the facts and let him decide?

251
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,247
You've done enough, thank you.

252
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,419
Normal vitals, satting
well on room air.

253
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,192
- You get your phone working?
- No.

254
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:02,427
Tox screen is positive for barbiturates.
Blood alcohol level's only .065.

255
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,833
Urine dip's negative,
but ICON's positive.

256
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,597
She's coming around.

257
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,299
Ma'am? Do you know
that you're pregnant?

258
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,103
You speak English?

259
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,269
Where's Chen? Maybe
she can translate for us.

260
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,610
I wanna rule out an ectopic.
Where is the portable ultrasound?

261
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,776
- I'll get it. Can I do it?
- Yeah. I'll be right back.

262
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,445
I'm sorry, but it was right
in the middle of a trauma.

263
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,489
Maybe he'll call back.

264
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:30,262
- Check your home machine?
- No. I didn't have a chance to.

265
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,796
Well, how did he sound?

266
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,761
Depends on who
you ask. Sounds great.

267
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,371
He's happy, he's carefree,
he's having the time of his...

268
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,800
life.

269
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,777
Just the fact that he
called is a pretty good sign.

270
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,208
Yeah, he's manic, Carter.

271
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,442
Say, Abby, here's two of the
country's finest looking for a patient.

272
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,019
I'm Sergeant Andrews with the Air
Force Office of Special Investigation.

273
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,555
I understand you're
treating Eric Wyczenski.

274
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,225
No.

275
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,658
We were, but we're not now.
He left against medical advice.

276
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,297
Any idea where he may be going?

277
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,229
I'm sorry we can't be more
helpful, but we have an emergency.

278
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,960
- What about the doctor who treated him?
- He's upstairs.

279
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,901
If you leave your card, we'll
call you if he shows up again.

280
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:18,073
- What was that all about?
- I was about to tell you.

281
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,406
These are your
brother's medical records?

282
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,981
I said we were treating him.

283
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,011
You'd still require
his signature.

284
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,315
And a written request from
his Attending physician...

285
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,427
which in this case was...

286
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,295
You forged my name too?

287
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,296
- We could get into trouble for this.
- Just read it.

288
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,098
No. I have no right to read
this, and neither do you.

289
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,900
He took a leave of absence for
stress following a near-miss incident.

290
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,738
Yeah, so? He's an
air-traffic controller.

291
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:55,370
- It's a stressful job.
- He had therapy but wasn't medicated.

292
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,017
Probably no reason to.
Just a reaction to the event.

293
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,710
What if it isn't PTSD?

294
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:06,621
What if it was depression? The
initial presentation of a bipolar disorder?

295
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,351
- He's too old.
- He's under 30.

296
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,690
Well, then he'd be at
the far end of the curve.

297
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,230
He's been suffering from
insomnia, lack of appetite.

298
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,097
- Both of which are consistent with PTSD.
- Six months ago he was depressed.

299
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,399
Now he's cycling up to a manic
phase. The timing is perfect. I know.

300
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,805
- Why didn't the Air Force catch it?
- They're not looking for it.

301
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,535
Look.

302
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,273
"No family history of psychiatric
disorders." He's lying to the doctors.

303
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,747
Just like you did to
get those records.

304
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,277
Oh.

305
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,390
- I thought this was a surgical consult.
- It was.

306
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,925
- What happened?
- Fat lady sang.

307
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:45,053
Fat man, in this case. We did
everything but order him a deep-dish pizza.

308
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,962
Yeah. Just say no to drugs and
double bacon cheeseburgers.

309
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,166
His size is probably something
that he couldn't control.

310
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,937
Certainly not if he
was running downhill.

311
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,811
- Nathan, we didn't mean to offend you.
- You didn't.

312
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:03,643
- I'm sorry. I'm having a really bad day.
- Not as bad as him.

313
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,948
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

314
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,121
- You can't drive on here, you idiot.
- Which one of you is Dr. Abrams?

315
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,660
- I'm Abrams.
- You need to come with me now.

316
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,094
I've got a 14-year-old
boy with a ruptured globe.

317
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,962
He may lose his eyesight because
you didn't answer your page.

318
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,966
You're insane.

319
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,099
- Get in the car.
- Get out of here.

320
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,226
Get in the car now!

321
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,299
You don't have to
listen to this guy, Vic.

322
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,171
- Are you a doctor?
- An oral surgeon.

323
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,178
- Then shut up. Let's go!
- What about my clubs?

324
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,576
You, take his clubs.

325
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,445
You're doing a good
job clearing the patients.

326
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,952
Easy to be fast when
you're just killing them.

327
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,148
- I'm gonna be taking some time off.
- Yeah? For what?

328
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:49,193
Just to deal with some personal
things I've been putting off for a while.

329
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,920
With Romano out of commission...

330
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,760
you'll probably be the one
forced to pick up the slack.

331
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,196
Bad idea.

332
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,495
Do you mind? We're
having a conversation here.

333
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,367
- I don't mind.
- Well, I do. I mind.

334
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,304
I mind your insinuations and
your smart-ass comments.

335
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,503
This is an ER. People come
here because it's an emergency.

336
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,807
Guess what. Some of
these people are gonna die.

337
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,472
I've saved hundreds of lives.

338
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,930
Dr. Lewis. LEWIS: Yeah.

339
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,384
You know that drunk you
intubated this morning?

340
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,523
- He asked to take his tube out.
- He can't talk if he's intubated.

341
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,717
I think you better come.
He's gonna vomit and aspirate.

342
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,730
Twenty bucks says
she kills this guy too.

343
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,560
- Frank, did my brother call?
- Nope.

344
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,862
- Are you sure?
- Let me double-check. Nope.

345
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,630
Hey, Abby.

346
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,637
Tell Abby what you just told me.

347
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,174
An unauthorized absence
can be a serious offense.

348
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,905
But if it's a first offense and you can
prove extenuating circumstances...

349
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,082
you can get off with
minimum punishment.

350
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,774
That's good to know. Thanks.

351
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,044
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

352
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,243
Thanks.

353
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,357
Your girlfriend, Harkins,
was looking for you.

354
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,528
Why are you talking about
my brother to med students?

355
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,064
Gallant's in the Army. I'm
trying to get information.

356
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,224
You didn't have to
say it was my brother.

357
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,370
Excuse me, Carter.

358
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,203
This is Mr. and Mrs. Yeung.
Their child was brought in.

359
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,037
- Which one?
- The 3-year-old with your patient.

360
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,839
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
she was the mother.

361
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,676
No. Tong-yi's our
nanny. I'm Aidan's mother.

362
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,011
- Is our son okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

363
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,552
Chuny, you can take
Mrs. Yeung to see her son.

364
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,987
Sir, if I can just ask you
a couple questions first?

365
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,557
Yeah. Okay.

366
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,629
- Is Tong-yi a drug user?
- No.

367
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,299
- Has she been depressed?
- No.

368
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,027
Can you think of any reason
why she would hurt herself?

369
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,905
She wouldn't do that.

370
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,474
She tested positive for
barbiturates and alcohol.

371
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,306
Well, she's been up all week
with Aidan. He had an earache.

372
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,711
She might've taken some sleeping
pills, maybe a glass of wine...

373
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,408
but she's not suicidal.

374
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,820
Does she have a boyfriend?

375
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,248
I don't think so.

376
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,123
- Why?
- I just... I don't know.

377
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,524
Maybe she's got some
problems in her personal life.

378
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,688
Well, if she did,
we'd probably know.

379
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:09,666
She lives with us, has
been for four years now.

380
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,498
Can I see her?

381
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,540
- You wanted to see me?
- Did you review Zollinger?

382
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,541
- Was I supposed to?
- He's under.

383
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,510
- Thanks, Shirley.
- Are we gonna do a Whipple on him?

384
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,479
- He's a little old.
- Thought you didn't wanna do this.

385
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,016
I didn't, but thanks to you...

386
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,246
he and his family seem to think
the operation is worth the risk.

387
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,186
They may have second thoughts
after we resect his pancreas...

388
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,192
duodenum, gall bladder
and a portion of his stomach.

389
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,296
He's got a daughter
and grandchildren.

390
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,659
Any extra time he gets,
he could spend with them.

391
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,961
- He could get up to a year from this.
- Perhaps.

392
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,865
If it comes with
a small miracle.

393
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,700
Which may be in order...

394
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,809
seeing as you seem to have become
the patron saint of the terminally ill.

395
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,138
You prepared to assist?

396
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,447
- Really?
- You got us into this.

397
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,367
We're still running some tests.

398
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,731
Okay. Sonosite is ready.

399
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,136
I need both trauma rooms. Double
MVA en route. Auto versus motorcycle.

400
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,571
- Can I take these two?
- Yeah.

401
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,405
Grab trauma gowns
and gloves. Come on.

402
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:30,816
- Can we take her home?
- She should stay for observation.

403
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:34,715
In that case, I'd like to have
her moved to a private facility.

404
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,913
Would you ask
her why she did it?

405
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,230
She's not depressed.
It was an accident.

406
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,862
She took a couple of sleeping pills
with a glass of wine to help her sleep.

407
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,836
And she's sorry to have
caused you any trouble.

408
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,739
- She said all that?
- Yes.

409
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,573
Suction here so I
can see the field.

410
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,417
Are you okay?

411
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,388
I've been up for 24 hours.
It throws off my meds.

412
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,560
- Does it usually bleed this much?
- There are numerous branches...

413
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,196
off the superior mesenteric
artery. Hemostat.

414
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,290
Do we tie off or bovie?

415
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,560
Pressure's down to 90/60.

416
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,728
Okay. Bolus a liter
and check a crit.

417
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,635
Like this?

418
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,071
You need to isolate the
source of the bleeding.

419
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,404
Come on, Nathan. I
need better exposure.

420
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:36,211
Stop! Stop! You're up
against the portal vein.

421
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:39,045
Pull out before you
tear the wall and kill him.

422
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,744
- Shirley, take over, please.
- Just tell me what to do.

423
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,289
I'm trying. Shirley, suction.

424
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,722
What was that?

425
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,375
T-tube for the common bile duct.

426
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,410
- Do we have another tray?
- We can autoclave this one.

427
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,354
I don't have 30
minutes to wait for this.

428
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,096
Tell me what you want me to do.

429
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,191
Nothing. Shirley, pick up the
instruments, get them re-sterilized.

430
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,509
This will pass in about an hour.

431
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,111
Carl Vanosh, 32, motorcycle driver
versus stakebed truck. Extracted.

432
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,447
- Unable to breathe for four minutes.
- Violaceous discoloration.

433
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,613
Classic traumatic asphyxia.
Get an ABG and full trauma panel.

434
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,088
I'll meet you inside.

435
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,750
- This the driver of the truck?
- Motorcycle passenger.

436
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,954
Quinn Vanosh, 11. BP
falling after two liters...

437
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,641
Nobody told me they
were bringing in a kid.

438
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,635
He's tachy to the mid-120s.
We were gonna tube him.

439
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,465
Go get one of the
Attendings. Anyone.

440
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,975
Who's that?

441
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:44,442
- I thought you were treating her.
- I am. Dr. Chen is translating for me.

442
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,031
I should be doing that.

443
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:48,644
That's okay. We're
a full-service facility.

444
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,174
- She didn't know she was pregnant.
- Did she say who the father is?

445
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,628
No.

446
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,199
- Ask her if she's sleeping with her boss.
- What?

447
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,735
Ask her if she's
sleeping with him.

448
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,883
CBC and lytes, crit times
three, Chem-7, urine and Foley.

449
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,722
- He's got Tardieu's spots.
- Tardieu?

450
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,990
- Facial petechiae. What fell on him?
- A truck.

451
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,066
Crepitus over left
chest, tender pelvis.

452
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:37,533
- Sats, 93.
- It hurts to breathe.

453
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,537
- Kerry, I need help in here.
- Quinn? What's wrong?

454
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,946
Left breath decreased
with right tracheal shift.

455
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,706
- Sux and Fent are in. Sats are still 90.
- Needs a central line and a chest tube.

456
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,246
You're doing fine, Susan.
Just take a deep breath.

457
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:52,214
Decreased on the right as
well. He's got tension pneumos.

458
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,684
- What's wrong with my son?
- We're working on him. Malik.

459
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,880
- What do you want me to do?
- Bag him up.

460
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:02,391
- Ectopy.
- Don't do this to me, kid.

461
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,865
Your wife seems upset.

462
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,400
She's worrying about
Aidan and Tong-yi, that's all.

463
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,272
Well, our doctor's coming to
move her to another facility.

464
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,609
Hey. What was your
relationship with Tong-yi again?

465
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,915
I told you, she works for us.

466
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,247
Right. She's lived
with you for four years?

467
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:32,983
Have you been sleeping with her?
Have you been having sex with her?

468
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,026
Because she's pregnant
and she says the baby's yours.

469
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:40,431
Even if that were true, doctor,
it's none of your business.

470
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,626
No, it is. It was my business the
minute she became my patient.

471
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,634
She won't be your
patient much longer.

472
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,773
Hey, Carter!

473
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,777
Eric, where have you been?
Everybody's been worried about you.

474
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,938
- Come inside.
- Oh, Jody was driving me nuts!

475
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,607
Nothing like a road trip to
bring out a person's issues.

476
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,616
"Please limit your
baggage to two items."

477
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,483
She must've peed 1000 times
between here and Indianapolis.

478
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,250
She's worse than a beagle.
Probably got a bladder thing.

479
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,623
- Wait. I thought you guys flew.
- We were. Until she got airsick.

480
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,196
Airsick, carsick, homesick.
The girl gets sick a lot.

481
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,801
Which supposedly runs in her family.
Don't get me started on her parents.

482
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,267
If she turns out to be
anything like her mother...

483
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:21,202
she's gonna be too much
woman for me to handle. She's big.

484
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,672
Like sumo big,
minus the agility.

485
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,108
- I'll come later to see how you're doing.
- Will you talk to my dad?

486
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,340
I'll do even better. I'll
convince him you're a hero.

487
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,454
- The in-house team could have done this.
- You're the retinal specialist.

488
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,614
According to the CT, the
other eye has a pellet in it too.

489
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,658
I can't promise I'll be able
to save his sight in that eye.

490
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,787
- Perhaps if you'd have come here sooner.
- Ophthalmology isn't emergency medicine.

491
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,128
You know, some guys wait a
week to do this kind of surgery.

492
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,896
You know, all you did was
stop me from shooting an 82.

493
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,504
Tell it to him.

494
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,905
- Luka, Dr. Lewis needs you in Trauma 1.
- Oh, thanks.

495
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,847
So I'm in a position where
I can buy the Cessna...

496
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,314
or two planes that need some
fixing up for the same price.

497
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,313
- I've been calling you.
- So I hear.

498
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,855
I'm sorry Jody dragged you into this.
She's immature. She likes the drama.

499
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,516
It's the <i>Jerry Springer</i>
generation, you know?

500
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,059
You were supposed to be
at your base two weeks ago.

501
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,561
- Did they call here?
- No.

502
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,791
That's the second time this year
somebody's messed up my leave.

503
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,765
I'll have to report
for duty on Monday.

504
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,235
We should do something
crazy! Wanna go somewhere?

505
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,965
How about you, me
and Carter fly to Vegas.

506
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,110
We could do a little gambling,
maybe hit an Elvis wedding chapel.

507
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,371
"You may now kiss the
bride. Thank you very..."

508
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,981
Just come here. Just stop it.

509
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,317
They said you're suffering
from post-traumatic stress?

510
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,977
It was nothing. They cleared me.

511
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,384
Every controller's had a
couple PTSD assessments.

512
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,992
It's our way of working
the system to get time off.

513
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,129
"How do you know an air-traffic
controller suffers from stress?

514
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,425
His tackle box is missing."
You know? He's gone fishing.

515
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,298
But I hate fishing. Remember when
I got that hook stuck in my finger?

516
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,201
- Remember? It was a frog...
- I got your medical records.

517
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,398
What?

518
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,068
You didn't tell them
Maggie was bipolar.

519
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,282
- You did what? What are you, the KGB?
- Sergeant Eric Wyczenski.

520
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,749
You called the MPs? ABBY: No.

521
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,148
- No.
- Why did you do this?

522
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,518
You're under arrest for unauthorized
absence from the U.S. Air Force.

523
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:21,694
Somebody was supposed to cover
for me. He got in a bad accident.

524
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,194
I didn't find out until just now.
I'm headed back to base right now.

525
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,357
I came to tell my sister. They
looked for me and freaked her out.

526
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,195
It's been a huge mix-up.

527
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,964
- Abby, tell them.
- We'll figure that out on the way back.

528
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,801
That is unnecessary. Let
me get my stuff out of my car!

529
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,374
- Stop!
- Let me get my stuff!

530
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,273
- Don't hurt him!
- Listen, let me go.

531
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,677
I can explain everything, okay?
Just... I need to go, seriously.

532
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,182
I can't be arrested. I've got a job!
- Can we talk?

533
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,786
Or let me give him
something to calm him down.

534
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,651
- I'm afraid we can't do that.
- Is this what you wanted?

535
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,849
Are you happy now?
Yeah, that's right.

536
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,723
Lock me up and throw away
the key. Eric's been a bad boy!

537
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,797
Thanks a lot, Abby! Thank you!

538
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,736
- Suction. Oh, damn it. Bag him.
- Was he ever awake?

539
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,672
For a few minutes. He wasn't mentating
well. Stage-four shock, non-responder.

540
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,141
Both lungs are up. Breath
sounds with bagging.

541
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,746
Third unit of O-neg.

542
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,472
- You wanna try this?
- You got it.

543
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,981
Stabilize the
neck. I'll do cricoid.

544
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,789
Damn. Suction! He's so small.

545
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,028
Short chin, anterior too.
Not your lucky day, huh?

546
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,330
- Sats, 88, pulse down to 90.
- You need help in here?

547
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,988
- Nope.
- Yeah. Suction.

548
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,499
We'll need another
central line for pressors.

549
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,837
- What do you see?
- I can't see squat!

550
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,337
- Okay, let's take a break.
- No.

551
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,806
- Tube, now.
- Bradying down to 80.

552
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,339
Cords.

553
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,340
- Got it.
- Bag him.

554
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,116
Good job.

555
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,050
- All right. You got this?
- What?

556
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,516
- Where are you going?
- I have other patients.

557
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,923
- Susan, you're not finished here.
- He's in good hands.

558
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,565
- What's happening?
- He was on a vent, dropped his pressure.

559
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:12,296
- Give me a spinal needle.
- Lost the pulse. Starting compressions.

560
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,030
- Betadine.
- Tamponade?

561
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,040
Could be a tension pneumo.
Breath sounds could be transmitted.

562
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,178
- Sats are dropping. CHEN:
Could be hypovolemic.

563
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,679
Try the other side.

564
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,515
- No. Milligram of epi.
- Good pulse with compressions.

565
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,954
- Thoracotomy tray.
- Holding CPR.

566
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,425
Looks like PEA.
Betadine the chest.

567
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:40,532
- Trendelenburg and roll him left side up.
- Blunt force trauma, Luka. It's over.

568
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,760
Mediastinal air after
intubation. Blade.

569
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,369
No pressure, no pulse.

570
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,139
What is he doing?

571
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,434
- Watch.
- Spreader.

572
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,771
Opening the chest cavity.

573
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,939
Pericardium looks clear. Quiet.

574
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,617
Okay, bag him a
couple of times fast.

575
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,955
- You hear it?
- Hilar leak.

576
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,286
Clamp. Bag.

577
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,961
- How long?
- Almost a minute.

578
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,463
Again.

579
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,194
Got it. Cross clamp.

580
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,567
Get me a 50cc syringe
with an 18-gauge needle.

581
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,711
Okay, pressure's
going up. Fifties.

582
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,316
Evacuating the air.

583
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,720
That's why he
couldn't pump blood.

584
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,857
Weak pulse.

585
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,159
Got a pulse.

586
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,254
Wow.

587
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:50,768
So you can stay here.
You can be safe here.

588
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,164
Can you explain the
concept of a women's shelter?

589
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,346
What is she so afraid of?

590
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,542
Living in poverty,
deportation. Take your pick.

591
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,549
It's called "trafficking
in persons."

592
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,279
Young women are brought
over from some foreign country.

593
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,790
They get offered jobs and
wind up as indentured servants.

594
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,521
I can't leave my baby.

595
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,630
You don't have to. This is your
baby. Nobody's gonna take your baby.

596
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,306
Not this baby.

597
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,534
Aidan.

598
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,645
The 3-year-old?

599
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,541
Is Aidan your son too?

600
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,017
Yes.

601
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:51,055
Okay, Kit, let's
try a t-piece trial.

602
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,197
Normally, we would have
extubated in the OR, right?

603
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,891
Normally.

604
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,564
No chest-wall excursions.

605
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,900
Sats are going down to 89.

606
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,847
Why isn't he
breathing on his own?

607
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,079
AC of 14.

608
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,195
- I'll go talk with the family.
- No. I'm afraid I get to do that.

609
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,204
I knew something was
wrong. I knew it. I told you.

610
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,438
- It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not.

611
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,277
Don't say that. He's sick.

612
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,614
I don't know where they took
him. It's not like the police.

613
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,780
I can't go there and bail him
out. I don't even know who to call.

614
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:57,224
- What if they put him in a VA loony bin?
- That's not gonna happen.

615
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,297
- How do you know?
- Because we'll get him a good lawyer.

616
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,730
And we'll help him through this.

617
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:08,069
Go home. I'll get
someone to cover your shift.

618
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,401
- I can't.
- Go home.

619
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,477
Get some rest. Call
me if you need me.

620
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,178
- Hey. I thought you'd left.
- How's that kid?

621
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,017
He had a hilar leak. Kovac
had to crack his chest.

622
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:29,650
Pedes surg is with him now. It
looks like he's gonna pull through.

623
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,992
- You would have done the same.
- Kerry, I killed three patients today.

624
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,030
It would have been
four if I'd stayed.

625
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:40,001
No. You were unable to save
three patients. You didn't kill them.

626
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:44,506
I mean, I've seen you save twice
that many without breaking a sweat.

627
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,643
Go home. Have a
drink, maybe two.

628
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,304
Tomorrow's another day.

629
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:53,548
But if you lose more than
one patient, you're fired.

630
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,815
- Thanks.
- Hey.

631
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,321
- Hello. How are you?
- Good.

632
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,357
- Did you?
- No.

633
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,156
- Are you going to?
- No. You can.

634
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,322
No. You should.

635
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,832
- Come on.
- Okay.

636
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,629
Susan, we're gonna have a baby.

637
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,673
- What? You're pregnant?
- No!

638
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,500
I am.

639
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,376
Oh, my God! Kerry,
congratulations!

640
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,174
Thank you.

641
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,319
Thank you so much.

642
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,386
- Where are you going?
- She's going home.

643
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,251
I'm not talking to you. This is
between me and my patient.

644
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,984
- She signed out against medical advice.
- Call the police.

645
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,890
Don't bother. She
won't press charges.

646
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,088
We have laws against
slavery in this country.

647
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,641
Tong-yi, you don't
have to do this.

648
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,665
I'll bring the car around.

649
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,400
All right, don't do this,
Tong-yi. It's wrong. It's wrong.

650
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,509
I need my job. I have family in
China and they need my money.

651
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:55,044
- We can help you find another job.
- I can't leave my babies.

652
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,843
If you go back there, they're gonna
take your baby, just like with Aidan.

653
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:02,510
I spend more time with him than they do.
- You should. He's your son.

654
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,088
Does he even know
that you're his mother?

655
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,118
He doesn't.

656
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,088
But I do.

657
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:21,605
- How's Mr. Seaton?
- He's still on a vent.

658
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,606
When you first came to me...

659
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:28,042
you requested I treat you like
any medical student on my rotation.

660
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,114
And I appreciate it.

661
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,244
Your disease presents you
with innumerable challenges.

662
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:37,048
And the fact that you're standing
here is testimony to your character.

663
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:41,455
But the truth is, I would fail any other
student with a similar performance.

664
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,721
I have to make certain adjustments
to accommodate my disease.

665
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:49,994
No. No. Political correctness aside,
you are physically handicapped...

666
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,603
and I would be doing a
disservice to your future patients.

667
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,265
So that's it?

668
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,210
What's the appeal process?

669
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,510
A promise.

670
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:08,346
I will pass you if you do
not practice clinical medicine.

671
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,819
You can do
Radiology, Psychiatry...

672
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:14,118
but you must give me your word
that you will never treat patients.

673
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,658
No.

674
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:20,162
- I can't do that.
- Then you will fail, Mr. Nathan.

675
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:03,403
- Is someone sitting here?
- No, no.

676
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:14,147
- You look like you had one of those days.
- Yeah, you could say that.

677
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,749
What do you do?

678
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,949
- I'm a jockey.
- Ah. He has a sense of humor.

679
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,419
Not really.

680
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,302
- It's pretty dead in here tonight.
- That's the way I like it.

681
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,705
I don't believe
that for a second.

682
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,905
You look like you
know how to have fun.

683
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,977
- Think so?
- Yeah.

684
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,205
Excuse me.

685
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,784
- Hello? HEATHER:
<i>Luka, I have to talk to you.</i>

686
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:53,288
I can't talk to you right now.
Yes, he came to see me.

687
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,986
I think you need to
stop calling me, okay?

688
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,758
Sorry about that.

689
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:17,438
Why don't we get out of here and
see what kind of trouble we can get into?

690
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,208
Where would we go?

691
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:23,983
I'll leave that up to you.

692
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,581
Okay. I think I know a place.

693
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,987
It's 300 an hour,
2000 for the night.

694
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,014
You coming?

695
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,995
Hey.

696
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,728
- I've been calling you.
- I was on the phone.

697
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,873
Did you reach him?

698
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,473
You might have
to wait till morning.

699
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,078
But I got some fish and
chips from Brennan's.

700
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,272
I'm not hungry.

701
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,384
I bought it on the
way home from work.

702
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,257
It took an hour to get it out of the bag
and 45 minutes to put it in the glass...

703
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,057
and I still haven't had a sip.

704
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,861
I just wanted everything
to stop, you know?

705
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:47,062
- I just wanted to stop thinking about...
- Hey, hey, hey.

706
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,244
I'm so glad you're home.

707
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,282
I'm sorry.

708
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,419
I'm so sorry.

709
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:06,257
I wanted you to be
wrong. For both of you.

710
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,621
My family's so screwed up.

711
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,031
If I were you, I would run for
my life and never look back.

712
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,198
You don't hold the monopoly
on screwed-up families.

713
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,341
You met my mother.

714
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,441
She's not certifiable.

715
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:29,604
I have an idea. We should get
them all together for the holidays.

716
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,774
Gamma, my parents, your mother.

717
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:39,652
- I'm really scared for him, Carter.
- I know.

718
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,287
And it's so unfair.

719
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,656
Because he was such a good kid.

720
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:54,000
We went through so much growing
up, and I really thought I got him through.

721
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,902
I thought...

722
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,806
he was safe.

723
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:03,506
He'll get all the help that he needs
now. We're gonna make sure that he does.

724
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:07,813
And nothing that you did or
didn't do would have prevented this.

725
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:19,256
It's just that Eric...

726
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:24,534
he was the only constant
thing in my life, you know?

727
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,431
He was the only thing I
could ever really count on.

728
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,675
That's not true anymore.

729
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,050
Promise?

730
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,361
Because I really need
something to hang onto right now.

731
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,200
I'm not going anywhere.
