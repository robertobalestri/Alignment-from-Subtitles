1
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,867
He tried climbing a giant
ficus in our living room.

2
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,409
- Sit back.
- Aah!

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,740
- Ooh.
- No biting. Bad monkey.

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,846
His psychiatrist says letting
Zavery act out his impulses...

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,852
- allows him to express himself.
- Is he on any medication?

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,458
He has an asthma inhaler he hasn't
been using in the last couple of days...

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,890
since he entered his
simian role-playing phase.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,189
Could you help me? Six-foot
fall, possible corneal abrasion.

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,027
Yeah, put him in Exam
2. I'll be there in a minute.

10
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:37,602
How are you doing, Aidan? You know
that opening goes in the back, right?

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,239
Right.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,567
- Oh, you're a wrestler.
- Yeah.

13
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:46,043
- Seems to be working for you.
- Thanks.

14
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,546
- What do you do?
- I'm a doctor.

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,776
Heh. No, I mean
to stay in shape.

16
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,217
Oh, I... I do these:

17
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,880
- Bicep curls? How much?
- Mm-hm.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,458
Sometimes I can lift a
whole pitcher of margaritas.

19
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,562
Bastards. From the
cigarettes, isn't it?

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,061
Probably.

21
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,928
The biopsy reveals
small-cell carcinoma.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,298
The x-rays show
metastatic spread.

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,564
I need you to write me
up a full disclosure...

24
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,732
so I can file a lawsuit
against tobacco companies.

25
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,437
Mr. Carmichael, you've been smoking
cigarettes since you were a teenager.

26
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:20,842
So?

27
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:23,608
So you need to take
some responsibility for that.

28
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,776
Instead of looking for
someone to blame...

29
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,184
you should be concentrating
on managing your disease.

30
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,855
- Make the most of the time you have.
- I get it.

31
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,587
This is just the HMOs and big
business covering each other's asses.

32
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,527
Well, screw you, pal.
I'll see you in court.

33
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:39,779
- No, you won't.
- Oh, yeah?

34
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,969
- You don't think I won't sue you too?
- You're not gonna live that long.

35
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,170
- What's that all about?
- Stupidity.

36
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,369
- On whose part? His or yours?
- What is it with this country?

37
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:55,310
Nobody takes responsibility for anything.
Always looking for someone to blame...

38
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,816
- someone to sue.
- You don't like it, go back to Croatia.

39
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,445
Not near as many lawyers.
Lot more landmines though.

40
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,855
Twenty-two-year-old female,
hand injury. BP, 90/60, pulse, 110.

41
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,494
- What's her name?
- Brenda Walton.

42
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,822
Weaver!

43
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,397
Hey, don't start,
Robert. I got a full...

44
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,896
Mmm-ah!

45
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,535
Who knew you were such a conniving,
manipulative seductress? Well, I did.

46
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,138
- You outdid yourself.
- What are you talking about?

47
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,640
We were just allotted
$2.4 million in new funding.

48
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,300
- What?
- Remember Alderman Bright?

49
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,346
He was here a couple of weeks
ago. Somehow your team managed...

50
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,676
to not kill him. I'm as
surprised as you are.

51
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,648
He must have been
impressed with County.

52
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,982
Either that or the prostate massage.
He's coming by this afternoon...

53
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,384
This afternoon?

54
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,253
For a photo op. So make sure
you groom these degenerates...

55
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,395
- before he gets here.
- These patients...

56
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,656
- are why we're getting this funding.
- Don't ruin this for me.

57
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,637
Open up, G! Open up!

58
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,333
Use your key.

59
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,702
I don't have it! Come
on, it's an emergency!

60
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,480
All right, all right.
Stop pounding! Stop!

61
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:58,504
G!

62
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,582
- What?
- Get your doctor's stuff. Biz hurt.

63
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,684
- He's hurt bad.
- What happened to him?

64
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,944
I got shot, man.

65
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,021
- Who shot him?
- I don't know. It happened so fast.

66
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,717
- Fix him up, G. Like you fixed me.
- I can't. He has a chest wound.

67
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,192
I have to get him to
the hospital and call 911.

68
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,559
- Yo, no hospitals. They'll be looking.
- Who, the police?

69
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,133
- What the hell happened, Leon?
- It was an accident.

70
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,930
We were gonna take beer
and stuff from the liquor store.

71
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,938
- This was a robbery?
- But the security guard showed up...

72
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:30,100
- and people just started shooting.
- Go inside, close the door.

73
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,939
Don't come out. Don't
look out the window.

74
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,715
Anybody comes by, don't answer the
door. Do you understand me? Leon?!

75
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,335
I like to see med
students hitting the books.

76
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:35,465
- What are you reading?
- Tintinalli. Acute abdominal pain.

77
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,373
Tintinalli? Read Zachary Cope's
<i>Early Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen.</i>

78
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,913
He wrote it 80 years ago,
and nothing has changed.

79
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,818
Damn it.

80
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,513
You...? You okay, sir?

81
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,021
I'm fine. No, I
got it. I got it.

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,358
All right, I'll... I'll get
Housekeeping to mop it up.

83
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:08,036
- Please, just get it off.
- We will. Just try and relax, Brenda.

84
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:12,236
Okay, let's start with 10 of
morphine and a gram of Ancef.

85
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,843
She was demonstrating the cruelty
of fur trapping at the university.

86
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,781
- Good thing you didn't try to chew it off.
- Was that a joke?

87
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,752
Do you know how many animals suffer
needless, painful deaths every year...

88
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,755
in the name of the fur trade?

89
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,550
- Will you help me open this?
- Sure.

90
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,524
So, what's it gonna be?
Huh? Chechnya or the Congo?

91
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,395
Oh, um...

92
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,930
Still thinking about it.

93
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,936
- Thinking about what?
- Carter's going away...

94
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,735
with the <i>Alliance de
MÃ©decine Internationale.</i>

95
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,474
- Really?
- Uh...

96
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,114
S... Something I'm thinking
of doing it for the spring.

97
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,305
No, he's going.

98
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,112
I've done it three times. It
makes what we do here look like...

99
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,879
- I don't know...
- Got this?

100
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,289
Yeah, thanks.

101
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,623
I'll be right back.

102
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,961
I've been doing P.T. every
day since I came out of surgery.

103
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,624
Recovery ebbs and flows.

104
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,795
Patience and attitude can be
just as important during rehab...

105
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,635
Don't give me that crap.
I'm losing the strength I had.

106
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,676
- And sensory function is non-existent.
- What do you want?

107
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,472
Your limb was severed.

108
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,445
I'm not some schmuck worried
about how to hold his beer...

109
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,313
while he whacks away
watching TV. I want my arm back.

110
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,614
It's a miracle of modern medicine
that you have what you do.

111
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,119
Chechnya?

112
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,989
Yeah, we talked about this.

113
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,661
- No, we didn't.
- Remember when I said I thought...

114
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,993
- I'd like to practice medicine abroad?
- Yeah.

115
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,431
- Well...
- I thought you meant Paris or something.

116
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,094
- Well they desperately need doctors.
- So do we.

117
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,968
What's that stink?

118
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,837
Dr. Lewis got hit
with flying feces.

119
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,469
You know, I find a clipboard is a
good shield for projectile body fluid.

120
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,207
Thanks for the tip
and for the sweater.

121
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,552
Abby, can you set up a Wood's lamp
for my monkey boy's corneal abrasion?

122
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,553
- He's still armed and dangerous?
- I think he's out of ammo.

123
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,258
Dr. Carter, your
doctor friend's in triage.

124
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:05,851
McNulty?

125
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,019
Must have wandered in. Seems altered.
- Doreen Brant, 32...

126
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,061
took a header down
a flight of stairs.

127
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,700
Abby, can you give this
to Luka? I have to change.

128
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,031
- Sure. Curtain 3.
- BP, 124/72, pulse, 96.

129
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,365
- Is he here?
- Who?

130
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,304
Sutter, one of our guys. Was
shot during a robbery attempt.

131
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,535
- They said they'd bring him here.
- Frank?

132
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:28,148
Got a shooting victim en
route. Nobody said he was a cop.

133
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,045
Maybe they brought
him in a squad car.

134
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,878
- Can you check Dispatch?
- I'm on it.

135
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,884
Who summoned a surgical consult?

136
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,317
You're here for a consult?

137
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,856
No, I heard Weaver was teaching a
Jazzercise class in the ambulance bay.

138
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,860
I didn't know you were doing this
again. You don't have to jump all over me.

139
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,989
- Wouldn't think of it.
- Aidan Fenwick, this is Dr. Romano.

140
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,363
Aidan developed a gluteal
abscess on his right buttock.

141
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,936
Uh-huh.

142
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,568
Whoa! I'll say.
Been using steroids?

143
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,540
- I was.
- He stopped.

144
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,769
Not soon enough.

145
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,846
If you like having testicles
bigger than raisins, don't restart.

146
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,075
I was going to drain it, but I
felt a deep perirectal component.

147
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,685
We know what a pain in
the ass that is. Good call.

148
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,254
Your infection has spread
up along your rectum...

149
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,721
so we're gonna be
taking you up to the O.R.

150
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,224
- I need surgery?
- We gotta clean out the infection.

151
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,418
We can't do it here.

152
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,723
- Do you want me to get Corday?
- No, I got this.

153
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,561
- Who's gonna do the actual surgery?
- I will supervise one of my Residents.

154
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,975
- Give me a hand.
- Yeah, that's why I was worried.

155
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,140
Officer Jason Sutter, 39. BP's
holding at 100/74 after two liters.

156
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,606
- How many times was he hit?
- Two that I can see.

157
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,611
I heard four shots, felt
two hits, .22.25 caliber.

158
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,239
- Hurts all the way down my leg.
- Pulse is 106. Gave him eight of MS.

159
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,149
- Any pain in your chest or head?
- No. Hey, somebody call Jenny.

160
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,756
You can call in a few
minutes. Hang in there, Hoss.

161
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,222
Hey, Susan, page Corday.

162
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,624
- He's oriented times two.
- Dr. McNulty?

163
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:53,324
- Hey, Mac, do you know where you are?
- I got patients.

164
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,934
He might be in DKA.

165
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,663
Let's bolus a liter of saline. CBC,
Chem-7, serum ketones and UA.

166
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,831
- He's got a pulse, 130, BP, 90/60.
- Mac, have you been vomiting?

167
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,670
- Do you have a fever?
- Just a cold.

168
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,074
- Another hot GSW rolling in.
- Be right there.

169
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,340
- Accu-Chek is over 400.
- Damn it.

170
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,246
Okay, you have to stop jumping
around, Zavery. Zavery. Za...

171
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,187
- Where's Mom?
- She had to make a phone call.

172
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,120
Yeah, to the adoption
agency if she's smart.

173
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,990
Proparacaine
drops are in. Zavery?

174
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,593
Would you please come out now?

175
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,358
Forget it. I can't use the
"gorilla-scope" if he won't come out.

176
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,197
Oh, right.

177
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,737
We'll have to bring
it back to the zoo.

178
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,042
Zavery, can you lie still
while we look in your eye?

179
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,534
Okay.

180
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,543
Okay.

181
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,377
I'm going to put some yellow
banana medicine in your eye...

182
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:49,521
- and see if you scratched it.
- Okay, now blink your eye.

183
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,889
All right.

184
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,662
No corneal abrasions.

185
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,627
No signs of scratching.

186
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,356
- Susan?
- What?

187
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,330
Your sweater.

188
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,002
Oh, my God.

189
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,699
- Is that semen?
- This isn't my sweater.

190
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,476
Oh, gross.

191
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,403
Twenty-two-year-old
African-American male...

192
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,572
gunshot wound to the left chest.

193
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,676
Parasternal GSW to the third left
intercostal space. Tubed for resps.

194
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,050
- What are you doing with this?
- I found him.

195
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,682
I'm being a Good Samaritan.
You got a problem with that?

196
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,888
Pulse is up to 110 with two
liters. He needs a chest tube.

197
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,701
- This guy a friend of yours?
- We're not all related.

198
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:39,397
He's tachy at 120. Let's type and cross
4 units and get two units of O-neg going.

199
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,669
All right, sterile gloves, prep
the left side. I need a Thora-Seal.

200
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,334
Pulse ox, 95 on 100 percent.

201
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,448
Pupils are four millimeters
and reactive. What's his name?

202
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,175
- I don't know. Cop's got his wallet.
- Biz Cummins.

203
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,013
Biz, can you hear me?

204
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,586
What's with all the boys in blue?
- Cop got shot.

205
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,246
Might have been
this guy right here.

206
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,949
Neck veins flat. No
signs of tamponade.

207
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,994
I'll do the lines.
Seven and a half.

208
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,499
I've two criticals coming.

209
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,364
I'll need someone
from vascular surgery.

210
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,506
Did you get a look at
the guy who shot you?

211
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,164
There were three. I don't
know who pulled the trigger.

212
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,901
How long is that gonna take?
No. No, that's unacceptable.

213
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,240
- Someone take this bloody phone.
- What about the guy next door?

214
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,179
- Doc, can you move for a second?
- Can't you see I'm busy...

215
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,081
- trying to save the guy? SUTTER:
He may have shot this officer.

216
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,712
- He's not going anywhere. Dori?
- But his two buddies are on the loose.

217
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,689
Blood in the paracolic gutters
and Morison's. Pack him up.

218
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,385
No DP pulse.

219
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,691
- Does your leg tingle?
- Yeah, like it's asleep.

220
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,858
- Liter up. First HemoCue, 12.
- What's this?

221
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,504
- Metal fragments.
- He's embolized a bullet fragment...

222
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,698
or the hematoma's compressing
the artery. The clock's ticking.

223
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,002
Okay, line's in. Let's
hook up the blood.

224
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,441
Let's run the O-neg
through the central line.

225
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,114
There's only one O.R. free
and one anesthesiologist.

226
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,115
My policeman's borderline
hypotensive. I need to take him up.

227
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,582
What's the output like?

228
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,221
Pretty brisk. Five
hundred cc's and counting.

229
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,414
He could have a
hemothorax. He needs surgery.

230
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,789
- We're not there yet.
- What indicates immediate thoracotomy?

231
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,659
Twelve hundred cc's immediate
output. He's at 900, but he's slowing down.

232
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,060
You're not taking this
lowlife first, are you?

233
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,294
It's about who's in the
worst medical shape.

234
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,767
The guy in there's a cop.

235
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,270
It'll be 30 minutes before
another O.R.'s ready.

236
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,569
Well, can you keep transfusing
and just give me five minutes?

237
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,541
You've got three.

238
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,977
- O silk and OpSite.
- First unit in.

239
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,877
Five hundred hanging
from the cell saver.

240
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,108
It's slowing down.

241
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,049
- How much?
- A little above 920.

242
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,382
Pressure's up to 110, systolic.

243
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,821
Good. We clotted off the
bleeder. Send up the cop.

244
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,052
- Hold on.
- Nine hundred fifty cc's...

245
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,459
- and that's it for now.
- Watch pressure and chest tube output.

246
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:49,501
- BP's 118/78. Heart rate's 92.
- This guy is rock stable.

247
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,137
Another 1000 cc's in the
next two hours, he goes up.

248
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,796
Pressure's dropping, 96/74.

249
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,441
Our guy's good.
Take this one up.

250
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,067
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.
You heard him. Let's roll.

251
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,281
- When will he be able to answer?
- I'll let you know.

252
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,763
- I keep feeling like I'm gonna puke.
- Any chance you could be pregnant?

253
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,594
I don't even talk to
guys unless I have to.

254
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,333
Helen is complaining of
intermittent right-side abdominal pain.

255
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,667
- She has no fever and a loss of appetite.
- Okay.

256
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,240
I think it's a tumor.

257
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,534
I doubt it.

258
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,014
You gonna say anything?

259
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,778
What am I supposed to say?
It's gotta be something else.

260
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,786
Really? What else do you know of
that luminesces under a Wood's lamp?

261
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,989
It's just so wrong.

262
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,860
Okay. Take a deep breath.

263
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,052
Ow.

264
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,531
Do you have any
history of gallstones?

265
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,032
- Parents, aunts, uncles?
- No.

266
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,396
- Can I die from gallstones?
- Heh. No.

267
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:04,909
Okay. Let's get LFTs and a right
upper quadrant ultrasound for gallstones.

268
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,477
You know, the
real question is...

269
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,550
- who does it belong to? Pratt?
- Oh.

270
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,913
- Frank?
- Ew!

271
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,715
- Jerry?
- Stop it, you're creeping me out.

272
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,416
- This guy reeks.
- The copper and Clorox aroma...

273
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,585
of a vigorous mixed-bacterial
infection. Smells like surgery.

274
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,162
Come on. Get in there and
break up those loculations.

275
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,732
If you didn't have to dig,
I'd let the ER guys do it.

276
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,425
Irrigation.

277
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,762
- A little bleeder there. Bovie.
- Where?

278
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,373
Just at the inferior
edge of the piriformis.

279
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,031
Up on the Bovie. More suction.

280
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,489
No! Not up on the Bovie.

281
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,405
- Vascular clamp and 3-O silk.
- Pressure, 110/70.

282
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:45,018
Alcock's canal? Inferior gluteal
artery? Ever heard of those?

283
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,288
- I'm having a hard...
- Stick-tie that before he bleeds to death.

284
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,888
All right, give me that.

285
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,714
Turn that thing off.

286
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,915
Hold that up.

287
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,927
All right, no, more
that... Back this way.

288
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,430
Ow! Oh.

289
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,896
Stop.

290
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,128
- Do you want me to get Corday?
- No.

291
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,737
- Dr. Romano...
- No!

292
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,773
- Did you page Vascular?
- Twice. Dr. Dorset is on his way.

293
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,739
- Who?
- The new guy.

294
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,401
Laps. Pack around the mesentery.

295
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,647
Oh, damn.

296
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,250
- Tachy at 110.
- Another vascular clamp.

297
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,355
SMA repair looks good.

298
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,114
It's nice of you to
finally join us, Dr. Dorset.

299
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,159
This gentleman has a bullet
fragment in the femoral artery.

300
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:32,230
He's gonna need a graft or a
bypass. You're in for a long night.

301
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,459
Really? You know they call
me Fast Eddie for a reason?

302
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,933
Several, in fact.

303
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,372
Ten blade, please.

304
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,543
Stand by with a number
four French catheter.

305
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,339
- Have a three-cc heparinized saline ready.
- You're doing a Fogarty embolectomy?

306
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,537
Clamp.

307
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,014
Well, I prefer to call it
the "Dorset Bulletectomy."

308
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,882
Heparin flush.

309
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,789
- There's no backflow. Totally occluded.
- Yep. Fogarty.

310
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,193
- Okay, give me a hand here.
- Excuse me?

311
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,024
- Remove the wire.
- Oh.

312
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,828
Got it.

313
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,068
Hey, somebody's glad to see me.

314
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,180
Clamp off.

315
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,583
Feeding the catheter.

316
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,586
- Pressure and pulse are steady.
- Give me your hand.

317
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,883
- Excuse me?
- Your hand.

318
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,890
He's got healthy arterial walls. Any
resistance you feel against that balloon...

319
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:42,229
is the wall itself. Do
you feel that right...?

320
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,035
Right there?

321
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,242
Okay, remember it. Any
harder, you can rupture the wall.

322
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,345
It'll feel hard. Suddenly the
balloon will inflate too easily...

323
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,414
meaning you blew
through the wall.

324
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,779
- All right.
- Okay.

325
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,579
Bowel's fine. He's a lucky man.

326
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,117
Nothing in my hand,
nothing up my sleeve, and...

327
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,722
Good popliteal pulse.

328
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,796
- His leg's pinking up.
- Thank you very much.

329
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:19,063
I'll be here all week, and
don't forget to tip your waitress.

330
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,999
Driver.

331
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,538
I still have a little physio left,
but there's no permanent damage.

332
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,205
- You look good.
- I feel better.

333
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,217
- Okay, it's official.
- Thanks.

334
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,584
Gallant, could you help Dr. Chen
with the thoracentesis on Mr. Adkins?

335
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,554
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

336
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,284
- Thoracentesis, huh?
- Shaw's, 8:00?

337
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,655
- I'll be there.
- All right.

338
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,262
Thanks.

339
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,030
Hey.

340
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,567
Hey.

341
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,069
Feeling better?

342
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,803
Compared to the last
time you saw me, yeah.

343
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,442
- I was gonna...
- Actually, I need your signature.

344
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,977
- Resident review.
- Yeah, sure.

345
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,145
So, what's next?

346
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,779
I mean your next rotation.

347
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,820
Um... Pediatrics.

348
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,092
- Okay, thanks.
- Hey, Erin?

349
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,819
- You know, I really have to get going.
- I know. I just...

350
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,988
- I never got to talk to you.
- I was in the hospital three weeks.

351
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,066
I'm sorry.

352
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:27,262
I was having a bad time.
I never meant to hurt you.

353
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,303
Then you should've slowed down.

354
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:39,216
Leon, pick up the phone, I need
to talk to you. It's me. Don't wor...

355
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,382
I'll call you back.

356
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,453
What's the word
on Officer Sutter?

357
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,717
Last I heard he
was still in surgery.

358
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,554
- The guy you brought in, he have a gun?
- I don't know.

359
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,562
- You just found this guy on the street?
- Yeah.

360
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,461
- You see anybody else with him?
- No.

361
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,068
- Did you hear gunshots?
- No.

362
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,636
Hey, Pratt. Your boy's
losing his pressure, man.

363
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,364
- What's in the Thora-Seal?
- Nine-fifty cc's, like it was.

364
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,634
He's bleeding somewhere.
Maybe it's the belly.

365
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,402
Can't get pressure
through the dynamap.

366
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,874
I'll go get Carter.

367
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,571
Get two more
units on the infuser.

368
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,221
- So when are you leaving me?
- What?

369
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:23,193
When are you planning
on running off to the jungle?

370
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,386
Oh.

371
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,431
Well, I haven't really decided if
that's something I'm gonna do yet.

372
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,829
Really? Luka made
it sound like you had.

373
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,267
Luka's a big advocate
of the program.

374
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:36,398
- You thought it was cool when he went.
- Luka went home to his own country.

375
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,669
He didn't have a
girlfriend asking him not to.

376
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,678
- Come with me.
- I have enough drama in my life.

377
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,875
Well, well, if it ain't the Ken
and Barbie of the medical world.

378
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,283
- You look better.
- I am better.

379
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,286
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hello.

380
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:54,286
His blood sugar level was over 600,
but his serum ketone levels are negative.

381
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,454
I could have told you that. Type-two
diabetics don't get ketoacidosis.

382
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:02,260
No, it was a hyperosmolar coma.
You needed insulin and IV fluids.

383
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:06,270
Both of which could have been avoided
if you'd take your medication as directed.

384
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,898
I gave it to a patient of mine.
He couldn't afford his own.

385
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,977
Carter. Pratt needs you.

386
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,898
- Should've paged me.
- Get ultrasound.

387
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,481
- When did he crash?
- Just now. Nothing out the chest.

388
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,792
I guess the bullet
tracked to the belly.

389
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:21,052
From the third
intercostal space? Milk it.

390
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,451
- What? MALIK:
Pressure's only 50 palp.

391
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,920
Clots.

392
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,424
When there's no drainage,
you milk the chest tube.

393
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,755
- Okay, he's in V-tach.
- Starting compressions.

394
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,297
- Charge to 200.
- At least another liter in there.

395
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,557
And clear.

396
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,801
- V-fib.
- Thoracotomy tray. Go.

397
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,632
- Splash the chest.
- Pratt.

398
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,003
Get that rib spreader ready.
All right, come on, Pratt.

399
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,802
What are you doing here, Leon?

400
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,640
I wanted to see you.
What are you doing to him?

401
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,977
He got shot. Satinsky. Get
those internal paddles ready.

402
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,142
You shouldn't be here.
Get him out of here.

403
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,346
- I need to talk to you, G.
- Could you put him in the Suture Room?

404
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,486
- What for?
- He's here for a wound check.

405
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,320
- Make sure you put him in a gown.
- Is he gonna die, G?

406
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,622
Just shut the hell up
and get out of here! Go!

407
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,425
Okay, we are clamped. Start
pumping. He needs more blood.

408
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,433
- How many units?
- Four units. His heart is empty.

409
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,104
Charge to 30. Clear.

410
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,438
- Still in V-fib.
- Another amp of epi.

411
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,310
- Thirty again. How long's he been down?
- Thirty-five minutes.

412
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,178
Clear.

413
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,542
Asystole.

414
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,289
You ready to call this?

415
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,187
- We could try more epi.
- I don't think so.

416
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,620
- He's young.
- He's been down too long.

417
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,860
Call it.

418
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,062
Time of death, 1445.

419
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,035
- Is his family here?
- I don't know.

420
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:56,007
No, no...

421
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,246
Move any slower, Jensen, this guy's
gonna heal before we can sew him up.

422
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,256
- One of your inspirational speeches?
- Elizabeth.

423
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,452
I thought you were doing an atrial
caval shunt. Another lap to me?

424
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,295
I take it he died?

425
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,262
On the contrary, I'm finished.
The patient's in Recovery.

426
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,561
I heard you were having
some difficulty though.

427
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,500
- You were misinformed.
- Apparently.

428
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,435
I didn't realize you
were on surgical rotation.

429
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,572
Just assisting Jensen.

430
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,938
Oh.

431
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:29,343
So how are we doing, Jensen?

432
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,417
Fine, thank you. Good
hemostasis. No leak.

433
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,746
The posterior cutaneous nerve runs
next to the artery. It's easy to cut both.

434
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,024
And the head bone's
connected to the what again?

435
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,420
Would you like me
to scrub in to check?

436
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,963
No.

437
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,257
It would be a shame for
him to come for an abscess...

438
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,064
and have a dropped foot
from a severed sciatic nerve.

439
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,572
You're right. Look, I just figured
out a way you can help me. Leave.

440
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,445
Labs are back. This is
Sydney's friend Fiona.

441
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,416
What did she take?

442
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,524
- She didn't.
- Tox screen's negative for everything.

443
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,853
- Did you find any pill fragments?
- No.

444
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,566
Looks like nuts
and cherries, maybe.

445
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,696
I smell chocolate.

446
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,338
Her boyfriend cheated on her.
She went on a banana-split spree.

447
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,433
So you called 911?

448
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,703
I didn't. She did. She wanted
to get her stomach pumped.

449
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,904
She must have ate,
like, 50,000 calories.

450
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,914
- Sometimes she binges and purges.
- Sometimes?

451
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,781
She's lost her gag reflex from sticking
a finger down her throat so many times.

452
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,948
- Obviously she has an eating disorder.
- I'll tell you what an eating disorder is.

453
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,024
When a mother hasn't
eaten in six days...

454
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,129
because she's giving what
food she has to her three children.

455
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,459
She just cost the hospital
$3000, and for what?

456
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,931
So she doesn't put on a pound?

457
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,399
Luka...

458
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,567
It's cheaper than liposuction.

459
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,607
Did you know him?
Was he a friend of yours?

460
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,248
- What are you doing in here?
- Came to check in on Leon.

461
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,441
- Couldn't find his chart.
- I'm working on it.

462
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,051
- Need any help?
- No.

463
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,915
I don't mind. He seems
kind of shaken up about Biz.

464
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,991
That was your friend's
name, right? Biz?

465
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,320
Could you excuse us, please?
This is between me and my patient.

466
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,487
Yeah. Why don't you come
find me when you're done?

467
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,437
Did you tell him you knew Biz?

468
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,232
No.

469
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,899
- If I did, it was an accident.
- An accident?

470
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,308
It's always an accident
with you, isn't it, Leon?

471
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,811
I'm telling you the truth, G.

472
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,075
You told me a
security guard shot him.

473
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,718
It wasn't a security
guard. It was a cop.

474
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,155
- I didn't look. It happened really fast.
- Did you have a gun?

475
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,621
- It was Biz's idea.
- Did you shoot at the police?

476
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:57,161
I don't know! I don't...
Maybe. I don't remember, G.

477
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,321
Everybody just started shooting.

478
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,928
I'm sorry, G. Please, I
don't wanna go to jail!

479
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:08,799
Don't let them put me in jail, G.
I'm sorry, G. I don't wanna go to jail.

480
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:13,201
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and guess that you're having a bad day?

481
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:17,180
I'm tired of treating patients who
think ice cream is an emergency.

482
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,045
I'm just tired of it.

483
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,381
I think maybe you should talk to
him. He seems a little depressed.

484
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,684
He's European.
That's his baseline.

485
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,226
I'm still mad at him...

486
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,229
for putting that "adventure
doctor" idea into Carter's head.

487
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:36,529
- Mr. Hennesey in Exam 1 can go home.
- Oh, thanks. How's the cop?

488
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,568
Good. He's gonna be fine.

489
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:42,836
So this is where you hide
out. Hi. Dr. Corday, right?

490
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,840
- Dr. Dorset?
- Yes.

491
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,176
Is something wrong
with Mr. Sutter?

492
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:52,148
He's fine. I was wondering if you
wanted to grab some coffee or something.

493
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,479
Um...

494
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:01,092
I appreciate the offer. To
be honest, I'm swamped...

495
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,921
- at the moment, so...
- Right.

496
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,326
Perhaps some other time.

497
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,689
I'm gonna hold you to that.

498
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,496
I like coffee.

499
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,568
He's cute.

500
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,541
Was I rude?

501
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,371
No.

502
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,374
Look, the problem is that...

503
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:27,851
I go home half expecting Mark to
be playing with Ella in the backyard.

504
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:35,720
It's been a long time since I,
you know, talked to another man.

505
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:43,430
I think I overreacted.
It was only coffee.

506
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,436
I think Mark would want
you to get on with your life.

507
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,640
I also think if a good-looking
guy is interested in you...

508
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,642
and you're not
interested in him...

509
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,145
the least you can
do is introduce me.

510
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,843
Thank you.

511
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,579
I'm not kidding.

512
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,920
Mrs. Hughes? Where
you going? Huh?

513
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,500
Let's get you back
this way, okay?

514
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:20,628
- Now, you're supposed to be...
- Looks like you've got your hands full.

515
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:25,107
- Hi.
- Hello. John Bright.

516
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:28,179
- She has Alzheimer's.
- Oh, poor thing.

517
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,508
Mrs. Hughes, let's get
you back in bed, okay?

518
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,584
Your daughter will be here in
a minute. Could you please...?

519
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,756
I guess I owe you a
very big thank-you.

520
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:42,326
You provide an invaluable
service. It's the least I could do.

521
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,864
I just hope that we earned the allocation
based on merit as a healthcare provider...

522
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,330
for the community.

523
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,526
Had I not been brought
here, Dr. Weaver...

524
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:54,605
I probably would not have pushed
for County to get the additional funding.

525
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,305
Did you give me
special treatment?

526
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,604
- Well, I...
- Of course, you did.

527
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,949
From what I've seen, you
give everyone special treatment.

528
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:07,814
And that kind of dedication
deserves to be rewarded.

529
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,220
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Gotta go.

530
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,562
Somebody dropped this off, made
me promise to give it to you personally.

531
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,723
- I'm thinking nude blackmail photos.
- Not again.

532
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,068
- Is this because of McNulty?
- What?

533
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:30,067
You leaving, going to a foreign
land to bring medicine to the natives.

534
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,404
Because he lives in
the back of a free clinic...

535
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,571
- you don't do enough?
- Maybe it's got something to do with it.

536
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,579
Why didn't you talk
to me about this?

537
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,309
- I'm not going right now.
- You talked to Luka about it.

538
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:44,081
- Even if I was, it's for two weeks.
- Some of these places are dangerous.

539
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,987
- I thought you forgot me.
- You need to go back on insulin.

540
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,593
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

541
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,924
Thirty NPH in the morning, 15
in the evening, same as before.

542
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,998
You need to check your
sugars four times a day.

543
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,360
I'd be lucky to find four times
during the week to do that.

544
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,974
Maybe you can hire an assistant.
Or find the time to remind yourself.

545
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,705
- What's this?
- Check.

546
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:10,406
- I can see that. But I can't take it.
- Why not?

547
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,916
Well, for one thing,
it's got too many zeros.

548
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,056
Get some new
equipment. Hire a nurse.

549
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:21,057
- Hire a physician's assistant.
- I don't have to name the place...

550
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,354
- after you, do I?
- No.

551
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,021
Although "The Carter Family Clinic"
does have kind of a nice ring to it.

552
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,795
- Thank you, John.
- You're welcome.

553
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,966
How'd you like to come
work for me, beautiful?

554
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,367
Do you have a dental plan?

555
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,134
- No, I'm not giving you any time off.
- I have sick days.

556
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,972
Are you kidding? You're
lucky you still have a job.

557
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,636
I need time to sort things out.

558
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,874
Yeah, I agree, and you
need to do it on your own time.

559
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,747
Wait. Hey. Where you going?

560
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,388
- Dr. Kovac, can I get some help?
- No.

561
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,650
Steven Rafferty, 65, with chest
pain, partially relieved by nitro.

562
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,987
Get a 12-lead titrate,
10 of morphine. Go.

563
00:29:56,161 --> 00:30:00,030
Sir, can you tell me on a scale
of 1 to 10 what your pain level is?

564
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,836
Luka.

565
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,532
He seems pissed.

566
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,941
Been here almost two hours.

567
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,843
I figured you couldn't go
that long without a cigarette.

568
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,916
What are you doing here?

569
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,824
Thank you.

570
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,187
- Sure you don't want something to eat?
- I'm fine, thanks.

571
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,923
Good, I need the gas money.

572
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,272
- How's Carter?
- He's good.

573
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,932
- I like him.
- Me too.

574
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,652
It was the disease.

575
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,454
I was scared.

576
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,725
I was afraid that I was
gonna end up like Mom.

577
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,592
I didn't want you to see
me like that. Like Maggie.

578
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:15,263
I never meant to hurt you. If it wasn't
for you, I don't know where I'd be.

579
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,568
It wasn't your fault.
You couldn't help it.

580
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,038
It's just...

581
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:27,084
You protected me for so
long. I felt like I'd let you down.

582
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,214
That's not true.

583
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:32,924
That could never be true.

584
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,225
I just wish sometimes I
was 8 years old again.

585
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,895
Because even
when things got bad...

586
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:46,464
and they got bad, I knew
you'd always be there.

587
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,276
And I always will be.

588
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,913
Yeah, but no one's
ever there for you.

589
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:59,346
And I turned my back on you...

590
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,477
after everything
that you did for me...

591
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,284
and for Mom.

592
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,124
It was a really
crappy thing to do.

593
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,295
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize.

594
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:16,435
I do. I want to.

595
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,304
I love you, Abby.

596
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,774
You deserve a better family.

597
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:40,691
And I just wanted
you to know that...

598
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,757
I'm okay.

599
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,061
Unfortunately...

600
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:52,460
I had to get bad
before I got better.

601
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,271
It's not over, you know.

602
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,541
Yeah, I know.

603
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,414
Wanna see a picture
of my new girlfriend?

604
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,824
Sure.

605
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,595
What do you think?

606
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,061
It's a plane.

607
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:27,570
Yeah, I bought it. Sold my car,
my bike, just about everything.

608
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,508
I'm gonna run hunting and
fishing charters in Wisconsin.

609
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,842
You're going to be a bush pilot?

610
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,245
Pretty cool, huh?

611
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:40,647
It's probably just a mild
virus that'll go away on its own.

612
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,749
I'm going to send off
some more blood work...

613
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:47,256
so you'll need to follow up
with your family doctor, okay?

614
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,291
Hey, Susan, you up for dinner?

615
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,522
No, I am going home, and I'm
going to take a three-hour bath.

616
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,495
Come on, you can
do that after dinner.

617
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,103
- I know this great new Thai place.
- Hmm. Oh, Jing-Mei, thank you.

618
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,670
Oh, sure. So?

619
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,434
Um...

620
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,544
- I was using the Wood's lamp today...
- Mm-hm.

621
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:11,979
When I was wearing your sweater.
And some stuff showed up on it.

622
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,146
Like what?

623
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,047
Stains on your sweater. It's none of
my business. I thought you might...

624
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:21,158
- just want to get it dry-cleaned.
- It was club soda.

625
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,988
- What?
- Yeah, Susan.

626
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,825
I opened up a can this morning,
and it sprayed all over me.

627
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,968
That's why I had to take
off the sweater, to let it dry.

628
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:31,800
- Oh.
- Oh.

629
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,666
- Club soda.
- Yeah.

630
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,831
Soda water glows under
black lights, remember?

631
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:40,703
Good. I just thought...
I don't know...

632
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,840
What, you thought that I'm this ER
slut with spunk all over her sweater?

633
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,885
No, no. Jing-Mei...

634
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,935
Somebody claim that body?

635
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,569
No.

636
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,040
I heard the cop's gonna be okay.

637
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,744
- Good.
- Pratt.

638
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,542
What do you want from me?

639
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,311
I just wanna help
you. Or at least...

640
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,018
prevent you from getting
yourself into trouble.

641
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,747
I'm not in trouble.

642
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,416
What about Leon?

643
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:33,190
- I don't know.
- Well, he seemed pretty scared today.

644
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,097
Yeah. He's a scared little kid.

645
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,862
Except he's not a little kid.

646
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,406
He's 27, and he was probably involved
in a robbery that left a cop shot...

647
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,239
and somebody else dead.

648
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,918
I think the cops are probably
gonna blame this on Biz.

649
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,949
If Leon went away for a while...

650
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,251
I doubt anybody would
go looking for him.

651
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:10,725
You know what? I try to
keep him out of trouble.

652
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,669
But he wants to have his own
friends. He wants to be cool.

653
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,741
And they talk him
into doing stuff.

654
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:22,074
I can't watch him every
minute of the day. I can't.

655
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,075
You gotta learn to let go.

656
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,284
Stop blaming yourself.

657
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:36,094
Tell Leon I said goodbye.

658
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,004
Gallant. I need you
to do me a favor.

659
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,809
What do you say we
go to dinner tonight?

660
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,817
Someplace nice,
someplace romantic.

661
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:06,648
I can't. Eric's picking me up.

662
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,353
- Eric, your brother?
- Mm-hm.

663
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,661
- He's here. And he's on his meds.
- He's picking you up to do what?

664
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,666
Um... He's taking
me to see his airplane.

665
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,031
- He bought an airplane?
- Yes.

666
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,672
- You want me to go with you?
- No.

667
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,503
I think it'll be okay. He
seems really, really good.

668
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,478
- Are you gonna go flying with him?
- No.

669
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,738
I'm supportive, not stupid.

670
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,848
I have to go by
McNulty's clinic anyway.

671
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,416
He forgot his prescription.
I'll call you after that.

672
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,644
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

673
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:35,843
Don't go flying with him.

674
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,191
Don't go to Chechnya.

675
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,692
- What are you doing?
- Your Resident asked for a curbside.

676
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:48,761
And?

677
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,096
There's an area of sensory loss
on the posterior aspect of the thigh.

678
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,269
Jensen bagged the
posterior femoral cutaneous.

679
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,414
But there's no foot drop. Sciatic, tibial,
and peroneal are completely intact...

680
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:07,382
although he'll probably be left
with some numbness in his thigh.

681
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,544
Well, I guess he got lucky then.

682
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,786
Yes, he did.

683
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,762
- Where's Jensen?
- He said he was going up to the roof.

684
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,423
- To get a patient?
- To jump.

685
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,200
<i>Final boarding call for...</i>

686
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,899
There you go. Got some
snacks for you for the trip.

687
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,070
- How far is Baltimore?
- You should get there tomorrow night.

688
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,643
- Really?
- Yeah.

689
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,115
That's cool.

690
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,386
So you got the phone
number for Greg's Aunt Rose?

691
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,982
- Yep.
- Let's get you on the bus then.

692
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,421
But what about Greg?

693
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,426
- Well, he's gonna call you in a few days.
- He's not coming?

694
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:58,129
No. Listen to me, you're supposed to
go visit his Aunt Rose for a while, okay?

695
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,535
Yeah, right, but is he
gonna at least say goodbye?

696
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,900
Look. He's working
at the hospital.

697
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,077
He's mad at me.

698
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:12,615
No, no. Leon, look, he's
just... He's just really busy, man.

699
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,618
- He's just really busy.
- He sent me away because I messed up.

700
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,621
- I'm so stupid!
- No. Leon... Leon, that is not true.

701
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,786
I need to talk to him.

702
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,923
Leon, you gotta get on that bus.

703
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,188
- I don't want to do this.
- Leon, listen to me.

704
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,355
You have to get on that bus.

705
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,128
All right, come
on, then. Come on.

706
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,771
Come on.

707
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,573
You have a good trip, okay?

708
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,010
Be safe.

709
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,530
Don't do it, Jensen.
My car's down there.

710
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,835
Your patient's going to be fine.
The leg should be fully functional.

711
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:12,671
There was nerve damage.

712
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,642
Yeah. But it was minimal.

713
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,309
Hey, you'll do better next time.

714
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,517
You're right. Because I
won't go into surgery with you.

715
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,667
Hey, Dr. McNulty!

716
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,476
You in there?

717
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,603
Hey.

718
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,812
Dr. McNulty?

719
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,921
<i>One-David-twenty...</i>

720
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,320
Mac, you in there? It's John.

721
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,959
Is there a problem there, sir?

722
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:40,394
No, no, I'm an ER doc from County,
and one of my patients lives here.

723
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,899
- I think he might be in a bit of trouble.
- Did you try calling him?

724
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,401
Yeah, nobody's answering.
He's a stubborn old guy.

725
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,138
I treated him with insulin. I'm
worried that if he didn't eat dinner...

726
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,334
he might be in a coma
from low blood sugar.

727
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,105
- Okay, you want an ambulance?
- I just need to get inside.

728
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:57,844
Hey, Mac.

729
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,987
Doesn't look
like he's here, sir.

730
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,095
This is his clinic. This is...

731
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,790
This has been his clinic for
20 years. He lives back there.

732
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,358
I've been working
this beat since '95, sir.

733
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,769
This clinic was only here a few weeks.
It used to be a Christian bookstore.

734
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,603
And a tanning
parlor before that so...

735
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,507
I was here three days ago.

736
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:32,548
You know, these clinics, they come
and go. Some are legit, but lots aren't.

737
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,516
Was that guy even a real doctor?

738
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,886
I don't know.
