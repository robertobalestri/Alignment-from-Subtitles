1
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,569
Okay, cough for me. MAN: Unh.

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,039
How much longer?

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,701
- Can you call Psych?
- I did.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,711
A moth flew in my
ear. I'm luring it out.

5
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,721
- Is Dr. Kovac here?
- What would you do?

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,681
Try Trauma 1.

7
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,147
V-fib. Charge again.

8
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,116
Charged.

9
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,066
Three sixty again.

10
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,704
- Charged.
- Clear.

11
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,821
Time of death, 9:37.

12
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,930
- Sorry to trouble you with this.
- That's all right. I understand.

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,764
These are complicated issues.
- They certainly are.

14
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:14,375
I want to give you time to think
about things and go over the papers...

15
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,442
before the will
is officially read.

16
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,977
Mm-hm, I'll make sure to. - Kel.

17
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,775
Oh, I didn't realize
you were here, Jack.

18
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,850
I flew in three days ago.

19
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,885
I telephoned you in New
York. Did you get my message?

20
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,216
That's Eleanor's apartment now.

21
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:34,794
Oh. I just wanted to
express my condolences.

22
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,363
Well, I'll, uh, see you
both at the service.

23
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,726
Appreciate the visit.

24
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,333
- Bye.
- Thank you.

25
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,974
- Is red not somber enough?
- You look fine.

26
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,634
She liked men to wear red ties.

27
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,838
That's very Republican of her.

28
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,983
I think that's blue now.

29
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,381
I didn't realize, uh, estate
lawyers made house calls.

30
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,751
The foundation board has called
an emergency meeting for next week.

31
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,654
- He just wanted me to be prepared.
- Prepared for what?

32
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,323
Gamma stipulated it in her
will that I be put in charge.

33
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,159
She appointed me president.

34
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,097
I see.

35
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,275
Well, I think that
would be a good thing.

36
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,675
- Ha, for me or the foundation?
- Both.

37
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,811
It should be you, Dad.

38
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,347
I guess that's not
what she wanted.

39
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:37,218
Well, I think she figured I'm in
Chicago. It'd be easier for me.

40
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,918
She put you in charge
of the family fortune...

41
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,359
and left me with a little
bachelor's trust fund.

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,522
I don't think it was a
question of geography.

43
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,066
I've also tried to stay
as involved as I could.

44
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,761
- Who are you kidding?
- Want me to tell you the truth?

45
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,131
She was disappointed in
you as a son, as a father.

46
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,537
She didn't think
you were up to it.

47
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,142
You could sugarcoat it a little.

48
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,551
It's an opportunity for you.

49
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,449
Not one that I wanted.

50
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:11,388
Now I'm stuck having to run
the damn thing or walk away.

51
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,720
Looks like she managed
to screw us both.

52
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,090
Almost time. Are
we waiting on Abby?

53
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,858
She's meeting us
at the cemetery.

54
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,648
That's good.

55
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,511
You look like a hooker.

56
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,477
Damn it!

57
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,923
Anybody home?

58
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,920
Eric?

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,126
- What are you doing?
- I broke in.

60
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,200
- I'm home.
- I can see that now.

61
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,131
What happened to you?

62
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,933
I got in a fight with a guy in the
lunchroom. He took the last Jell-O cup.

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,268
God.

64
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,933
What? He cut the line!

65
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,104
- You're a mess.
- I jumped through a window...

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,442
and scooted through some bushes.

67
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,279
It's a voluntary program. You
can leave whenever you want.

68
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,648
Where's the fun in that?

69
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,352
You're not taking your meds.

70
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,290
I have, I swear.

71
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,987
I just lowered
the dosages a bit.

72
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,230
- How?
- By cheeking them.

73
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,835
They had me on too
much. It was a real downer.

74
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,997
So a few hours after our talk,
you pick a fight with another patient.

75
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,803
- They call us clients.
- Then skip out on the whole thing.

76
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:41,540
Yeah, I think we could find a better
situation, you know? Like, in Maui.

77
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,976
- You should've called me.
- Ha.

78
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,678
Give me that.

79
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,255
- Why didn't you call me?
- I don't know.

80
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,156
I really don't.

81
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,497
- Maybe I should just go.
- No. Sit down, sit down.

82
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,827
I could use a drink anyway.

83
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,735
Is your apartment spinning?

84
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,719
You feel that? <i>Le duele?</i>

85
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,732
I'm working for <i>la Migra.</i>

86
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,734
She says you're a bad man and
she doesn't want you touching her son.

87
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,636
Oh. Get an abdominal
scan to rule out appendicitis.

88
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,970
And tell Evita here I can
prescribe a good ESL class.

89
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,538
Twenty-three-year-old minor leaguer.
Syncopal episode after wind sprints.

90
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,377
- She says you're a jerk.
- Got it.

91
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,916
Parietal hematoma on the left.

92
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,314
BP, 104/58. Pulse, 120.

93
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,820
He got dizzy. So I
walk him to the dugout.

94
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,982
He must've hit his head
when he passed out.

95
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,254
CBC, chem panel, UA, EKG,
lateral C-spine and head CT.

96
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,660
No Battle's. Has he
had incidents before?

97
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,061
No, this guy's a stallion.

98
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,828
He went from instruction
league to Triple-A in a season.

99
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,370
- That's impressive. Chest is clear.
- Belly's benign.

100
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,666
He was on his way to
be called up to the Show.

101
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,673
- What show?
- Ignore him. He's foreign.

102
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,402
Shoot the neck film
and get him to CT.

103
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,274
- Uh, you good here?
- Yeah, sure.

104
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,574
I'll use my foot to
put on the BP cuff.

105
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,684
- That boy has gotten worse.
- What boy?

106
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,285
Ante. The Croatian kid.

107
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,047
- I thought it was all set up.
- It needs to happen sooner.

108
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,192
No, no. We have enough trouble
taking care of our own uninsured.

109
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,884
He's dying, Kerry. His mother
smuggled him onto a plane.

110
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,962
I need you to try again, please.

111
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,860
Look, even if they donate
medical supplies and facilities...

112
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,899
The rest would be
for me to take care of.

113
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,869
- Cardiothoracic team, nurses, transport...
- I'll do it.

114
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,035
Don't count on anything.

115
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,816
Jacy said she'd do it on one condition.
She needs two weeks off in June...

116
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,714
that the surgical NM denied her.

117
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,879
- I can't control vacation schedules.
- Everything's a negotiation.

118
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,991
Nurses are supposed
to be angels of mercy.

119
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,386
Even mercy has a price.

120
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,289
Jerry, can you track
this flight for me?

121
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,625
- Mm-hm. "Air Flugelros"?
- Yeah. It has a sick kid on it.

122
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,064
- They don't have hospitals in Germany?
- Get Dr. Deford on the phone.

123
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,931
Checking out of the losers'
lounge. Try not to kill anyone.

124
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,333
We'll do our best.

125
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,441
CT's back on the ball player.
Negative. Looks like a concussion.

126
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,976
Except his 12-lead EKG shows
a corrected QT interval of 0.49.

127
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,081
Long QT syndrome? He's just
an athlete who's training too hard.

128
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,412
"Baseball been good to him." Let's
check a family history to be sure.

129
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,145
- Okay.
- You know what. I'll do it myself.

130
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,156
- I thought you were going home.
- Well, you know me. I live for this place.

131
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,930
She used to tell me how much
it meant to have you in her life.

132
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,191
She was lucky to have
you looking after her.

133
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,165
I was the lucky one. This is
Gamma's good friend, Vivian.

134
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,167
- Hello.
- Are you a relation?

135
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,135
I'm her son.

136
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,333
- I'm so pleased to meet you.
- Thanks for coming. This way, please.

137
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,944
They're almost ready
to start, Dr. Carter.

138
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,138
- Let's wait five minutes.
- Abby not here yet?

139
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,340
Yeah. I sent a car for her...

140
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,212
but I guess she's running late.

141
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,685
- So, what do you do for that?
- Well, the surgeons can insert an ICD.

142
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,951
An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
That can shock your heart into rhythm.

143
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,686
He doesn't drink enough
water. He was just dehydrated.

144
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,799
If I get one of those
things, an ICD, what then?

145
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,901
You'll be on beta-blockers
for six months.

146
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,402
After which, we can gradually
increase your level of strenuous activity.

147
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,733
- We can't stop playing for that long.
- Lucia, please.

148
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,677
A guy with a heart condition
dropped out for a whole season?

149
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,676
What team will take
a chance on you then?

150
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,509
With Long QT, there's a risk
of cardiac arrest and death.

151
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,014
You don't understand.
I'm about to get my shot.

152
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:17,419
- Tuesday night at Wrigley Field.
- Our whole life has been waiting for this.

153
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,424
All right. We can treat
this less aggressively.

154
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,190
But just for the moment.
Dr. Lewis, you have a minute?

155
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,663
- Yeah. LUCIA:
Thank you, doctor.

156
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,926
I'm expecting box seats.

157
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,093
You want a cards
consult for the ICD?

158
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,431
No. Just give IV fluids
and a stress test later.

159
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,369
I thought you were
recommending ICD.

160
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,442
I had an ER overreaction.
I worked through it.

161
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,907
All right.

162
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,684
I have paperwork for us to look over.
- What paperwork?

163
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,348
You know. The end of the affair.

164
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,720
Oh, right. KOVAC: Jerry...

165
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,453
get me that surgical nurse
manager back on the phone.

166
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,723
Ever think about getting
a personal assistant?

167
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,367
Susan, drunk in 3 is
waiting on his banana bag.

168
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,264
And, you. I need to talk to you.

169
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,031
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Okay.

170
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,640
What are you doing tonight?

171
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,374
Take it easy, cowboy.
I'm a married man.

172
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,936
Thanks.

173
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,520
O God, whose mercies
cannot be numbered...

174
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,818
accept our prayers on behalf
of your servant, Millicent.

175
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,860
And grant her an entrance
into the land of light and joy...

176
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,022
in the fellowship
of your saints.

177
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:11,168
Tears have been my
meat, day and night.

178
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,502
While they daily say to me,
"Where now is your God?"

179
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,847
Now, when I think about these
things, I pour out my heart by myself.

180
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,012
For I went with the multitude...

181
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,449
and brought them
into the house of God.

182
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,283
Why are you so full of
heaviness, O my soul...

183
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,517
and why are you so
disquieted within me?

184
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,561
Just as the deer longs
for the water brooks...

185
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,324
so longs my soul
after you, O Lord.

186
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,032
- What are you doing?
- There's a bar. Vodka goes through me.

187
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,695
- Get in the car. ERIC:
I'm trying to make this work.

188
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,738
- Give me room.
- I swear, if you do not...

189
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,809
get back in this car, I will get a
gun and I will shoot you dead!

190
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,969
Wow! Did you learn
that in nursing school?

191
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,047
Which is the help of my
countenance and my God.

192
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,510
I went with the multitude and
brought them into the house of God.

193
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,382
Eric.

194
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,817
Hey, John. What's up?

195
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,392
- Sit! Sit! God.
- Put your trust in God.

196
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,028
- You need to calm down.
- Sorry about your grandmother.

197
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,663
Why don't you come sit with us.

198
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,595
- It's tough to lose somebody.
- Yes, it is. Why don't we talk?

199
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,168
It's quite a sendoff. She
must've been very loved.

200
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,067
Or very rich, ha-ha.

201
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,073
- Eric. ERIC: Oh,
oh, oh. Uh-oh. Sorry.

202
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,607
I don't feel so good.

203
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,986
You brought your brother.

204
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,850
It's not exactly my bowl of rice,
Kovac. Besides, I got a date.

205
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:43,155
- Hot little brunette in Radiology.
- Oh, you'll be disappointed.

206
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,663
Hey, listen. All you'd have to do
is be there as a support surgeon.

207
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,802
Ah, some dying kid's
desperate mom...

208
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,460
snuck him aboard a plane, huh?

209
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,971
That's almost enough to
pluck at my heartstrings...

210
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,371
which are notoriously
unpluckable.

211
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,174
I'll really be disappointed?

212
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,241
Trust me.

213
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,785
Will Corday be scrubbing in?

214
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,823
The Illinois Marital
Dissolution Act says:

215
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,959
"A marriage can be invalidated
for one of the following reasons."

216
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,392
- Okay. Keep going.
- Uh, "Fraud." Did you ever fake anything?

217
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,623
- No. You?
- No. I'm just a screamer.

218
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,201
- Uh, "unacknowledged prior marriage."
- Right. Like either of us is a bigamist.

219
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,031
I have an uncle who's a Mormon.

220
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,502
Next.

221
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,541
- Uh, "under the age of legal consent."
- Don't I wish.

222
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,007
Don't I wish.

223
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,737
"Lacked capacity to acquiesce
due to the use of drugs...

224
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,815
alcohol or some mind-altering
controlled substance."

225
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,315
I think we have a winner.

226
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,010
- Which one of us was trashed?
- Split the difference.

227
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,089
Okay, you know, let me be
the gentleman this one last time.

228
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,316
Oh, I don't recall
any precedent for that.

229
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,088
Okay. You're gonna have to sign
these and I'll take them into family court.

230
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,492
All right. Don't kick my ass.

231
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,601
Just, uh, initial paragraph
two and sign page three.

232
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,862
Done and done.

233
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,938
There we go, unknotting
the bonds of love.

234
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,507
- Yeah, something like that.
- An impetuous lust?

235
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,042
- Maybe something in between.
- See you later?

236
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,112
Yeah. Call me
when we're divorced.

237
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,511
Picked her up at home. She was at
a neighbor's Botox party last night.

238
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,584
- Botox party?
- Your day will come.

239
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,516
She's having trouble swallowing.

240
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,053
I'm sorry, Luka. I can't.

241
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,054
I'm getting Deford's
team from Rush...

242
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,625
to do the tet repair. But I
need a County support team.

243
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,797
It's just too far afield for me.
- Come on. I'll do anything.

244
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,262
I'll mow your lawn.
I'll baby-sit Ella.

245
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,559
Over my dead body.

246
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,761
And this guy's too, if you
don't tie off that bleeder.

247
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,769
Suction from above.

248
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,899
Three-0 Prolene
on a needle driver.

249
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,136
Look, Luka, I appreciate
your commitment. I really do.

250
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,838
But don't you think this
is all just a little bit rash?

251
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,276
It's the only
chance this boy has.

252
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,786
Is Dr. Dorset part of this team?

253
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,756
Um... Is that a problem?

254
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,657
Yes.

255
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,129
Okay. No, no. Fine.

256
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,637
Fine, I'll do it.

257
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,169
He's calmer now. I
gave him some Depakote.

258
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,904
How much?

259
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,879
The whole bottle.

260
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,621
I was stuck. I...

261
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,491
He couldn't be left alone
and I wanted to be here.

262
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,595
And I thought he would just wait in
the car, and I'm really sorry, John.

263
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,664
I'm gonna drop him off at the hospital
and then I'll come by the house, okay?

264
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,100
What for?

265
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,936
Because he agreed to be evaluated,
maybe go into a locked ward.

266
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,669
No, I mean, why
come by the house?

267
00:15:55,922 --> 00:16:00,553
I know what
happened was terrible.

268
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,795
Unforgivable, really.

269
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,997
But my brother is sick and struggling.
I'm just trying to help him survive.

270
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,637
I know.

271
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,931
So go do that.

272
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,762
Didn't your doctor tell you that Botox
is not FDA-approved for neck wrinkles?

273
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,057
- They say botulism is beautiful.
- Ha-ha.

274
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,031
- Until you need an NG feeding tube.
- A what?

275
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,000
It's an internal catheter which
goes from your nose to your stomach.

276
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,865
Now, you'll have to use that to feed
yourself four cans of solution a day.

277
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,271
Will I lose weight?

278
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,447
- GSW times three en route.
- That's not the point.

279
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,083
- How long till they get here?
- Now.

280
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,583
Forty-five-year-old in a
drive-by shooting at home.

281
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,221
Let's take her in Suture.
Pratt, two kids coming in.

282
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,118
GSW to the right
hand, chest and arm.

283
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,725
My babies! Where are my babies?

284
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,795
- They're right behind us.
- Turner Mitchell, GSW to the abdomen.

285
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,124
- Where does it hurt?
- Where the bullet went in.

286
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,735
Nine-year-old girl. Multiple abrasions
to the head and neck. Denies LOC.

287
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,894
I'm okay. Help my kids first.

288
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,030
- They're taken care of, Mrs. Mitchell.
- BP's 100/74 after two liters.

289
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,234
- 108/64.
- But he's tachy at 120.

290
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,402
Hold him steady.

291
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,707
- I can't find any GSW.
- Me either.

292
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,215
- My back hurts. My neck.
- What's your name, pretty girl?

293
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,479
- Noelle.
- Well, Merry Christmas, Noelle.

294
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,624
We're gonna fix you right up.
- One, two, three.

295
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,053
BP's 90 systolic.

296
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,717
Single small-caliber wound
in the right lateral chest.

297
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,125
We were watching Bugs
Bunny. The window...

298
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,960
- Exit wound.
- Okay, hang another liter.

299
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,328
Betadine the right chest.

300
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,265
- Nothing. LEWIS: Good,
Gallant. Keep going.

301
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,974
Must have come around
for a second time...

302
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,901
- Is there a husband?
- No, he's gone.

303
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,342
It's just me now. LEWIS: Okay.

304
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,173
- Ma'am, we're gonna numb you up.
- What about my kids?

305
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,647
I'll go check. Prep and anesthetize.
I'll be back for the chest tube.

306
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,342
Down to 64/48.

307
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,351
Sterile gloves and a
7 French triple-lumen.

308
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,421
Gallant needs the SonoSite.
- Take it.

309
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,083
Dr. Kovac, there's a
telephone call. It's important.

310
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,321
Take a message. Let's prep
a 6.0 ET tube and a 2-Mac.

311
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,158
Eighty of sux and
10 of etomidate.

312
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,962
- It's that airplane you asked me to track.
- Okay, ask them what the problem is.

313
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,967
Uh, hey, uh, what's the problem?

314
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,803
Okay, wire's in.

315
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,203
Needle back.

316
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,844
- Is this the unifoc kid?
- Sounds like a tet spell.

317
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,573
- He's saying "bad breathing" and "<i>blau."</i>
- Okay, hold out the phone.

318
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,786
Okay, catheter is in.
Hook up the infuser.

319
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,392
- Pressure's holding up at 70.
- Go ahead. I got it.

320
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,221
Okay. I'll take it outside.

321
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,863
- DPL kit for Pratt?
- Over there.

322
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,999
- What?
- Says he's doing a DPL on the girl.

323
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,827
- My pager's going mad.
- Start up here.

324
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,731
I gotta see what
the hell he is up to.

325
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,235
NG tube and a Foley.
What's his first HemoCue?

326
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,083
- Twelve-point-eight.
- Talk to me, Pratt.

327
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,076
She's persistently
hypotensive and bradycardic...

328
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,973
with warm dry skin
and good cap refill.

329
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,376
- Spinal shock.
- Or complete transection.

330
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,914
Hi, sweetie. Can you
squeeze my hand?

331
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,348
Shrug your shoulders.

332
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,147
I can't feel anything.

333
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,519
- Don't worry. We'll take care of you.
- She has no motor or sensory below C-5.

334
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,424
- Where's the GSW?
- There isn't any.

335
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,927
Her mom pulled a
bookcase down to protect her.

336
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,032
It must've caused
a spinal-cord injury.

337
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,827
Like I said, she needs a DPL.

338
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,663
Do a SonoSite
and wait for Corday.

339
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,031
Start the steroids?

340
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:37,102
Uh, yeah. Nine hundred milligrams
of Solu-Medrol, then 5.4 per hour.

341
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,874
<i>I'd assume you would, uh...</i>

342
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,452
<i>save a human over
an endangered species.</i>

343
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,088
<i>Yes, I would.</i> MAN 1: <i>I
mean, do you understand that...</i>

344
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:54,023
<i>I'm curious. Who do you love
most in the world? Can I ask you?</i>

345
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,187
<i>You know, and it's not a trick
question. Who do you love the most?</i>

346
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,799
<i>I mean, a mother, a father,
a brother, a wife, a kid?</i>

347
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,699
<i>- Yeah. I do...</i>
- Oh! God! Son of a...

348
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:08,466
It is an unfortunate situation. But if
Mercy is committed to doing surgery...

349
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,575
- they should do it.
- That won't happen.

350
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,145
And our facilities provide the best,
perhaps, the only last-minute option.

351
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,408
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need an answer.

352
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,747
It's hard enough to keep pace
with our own problems, Dr. Kovac.

353
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,981
If it were a wealthy businessman
in need of an artificial heart...

354
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,624
we'll find a reason to do it.

355
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,660
Artificial heart implantation
is a cutting-edge surgery...

356
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,993
that has benefits to medical
science as well as the patient.

357
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,462
I know all that.

358
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,297
Unifoc and tet repair, while
important, are more prosaic.

359
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,134
We have the ability to
save but not the will to do it!

360
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,280
After all the talk, we won't
save this boy for only one reason.

361
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,110
Because we don't want to.

362
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,511
It's more complicated
than that, Luka.

363
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,278
Yeah, you're right.
There's also the money.

364
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,041
I didn't know Gamma had <i>The
Collected Oscar Wilde</i> first edition.

365
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,075
Oh.

366
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:26,845
There was a story
about him late in his life...

367
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,317
she loved to tell. I
can't quite remember.

368
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,624
He was on his deathbed,
drinking champagne.

369
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,455
And a friend of his asked
him what he was doing.

370
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,597
And he said: "Isn't it obvious?

371
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,823
I'm dying beyond my means."

372
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,630
She was a society lady with
the heart of Stonewall Jackson.

373
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,944
I didn't mean
what I said before.

374
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,811
Oh, it is what it is, John. We
can't pretend it was anything else.

375
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,383
Not much of a party, huh?

376
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,586
Not much of a funeral.

377
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,719
It was certainly memorable.

378
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,693
More like embarrassing.

379
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,196
Is that why Abby's not here?

380
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,071
I was just having a
hard time mingling.

381
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:23,801
Sharing duck canapés and cosmos
with a bunch of people I don't really know.

382
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,242
You don't need to stay if
you don't want. It's all right.

383
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,212
I'm sorry, Dad.

384
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,018
I'm really sorry.

385
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,819
I feel like I blew it.

386
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,485
Well, you didn't.
Neither did Abby.

387
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,425
Let it go, son.

388
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,396
Just let it go.

389
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,669
They're ready for her up in CT.

390
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,836
So you're on Harper. I live on
Williams, about six blocks east.

391
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,949
I don't know any doctors
in our neighborhood.

392
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,943
- So, what do you wanna be?
- A fashion designer.

393
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,350
That's good. But with a smile like
that, think about becoming a model.

394
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,549
- Stuff like that never happens.
- Sure it does. I've seen it happen.

395
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,194
I'll come find you later, okay?

396
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,455
We'll bring you back as
soon as the CT's done.

397
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,633
I still can't move anything.
Why can't I move?

398
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,529
We're gonna figure that out.

399
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,260
Ahem, Dr. Romano,
you forget something?

400
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,873
Yeah, I did. Denzel, I need
my, uh, Ancef. Exam 2. Pronto.

401
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,906
- I.M. or IV? ROMANO:
What's it matter to you?

402
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,874
- Nurses give antibiotics.
- I gotta push this girl through CT.

403
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:37,107
Well, let her do that. You come with
me now. Come on. I haven't got all day.

404
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,610
Romano's got a new bitch, huh?

405
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,385
Get me a portable
defibrillator and a drug box.

406
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,289
- Is somebody going on a run?
- Something like that.

407
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,771
I'm not sure why you'd want an
affirmative-action imbecile fixing you.

408
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,574
- But if you're trying to humiliate me...
- Zip it. You've demonstrated integrity.

409
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,773
It won't last long, but
for the time being...

410
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,580
it suits my purposes. I'd
prefer to keep this between us.

411
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,685
- How did that happen?
- It's not important.

412
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,451
There's some tissue that's
devitalized. It'll need débridement.

413
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:24,586
Ha, I don't know much about burns,
but you'll need more than débridement.

414
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,755
Just do it.

415
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,128
Just do it? Some of
this is circumferential.

416
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,792
The vessels look charred.

417
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,236
I don't know if I can take
care of an injury that severe.

418
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,340
All right then.

419
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,778
- I'll get Corday.
- Get Lewis. She's the least annoying...

420
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,177
of the bunch down here.

421
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,047
Dr. Romano, you need a
surgeon to examine that.

422
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,845
I am a surgeon.

423
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,461
Jerry, have you seen Abby?

424
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,824
She's off today. I
thought you were too.

425
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:03,629
Jerry, tell Malik to let me know when
the postictal postal worker in 4 wakes up.

426
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,237
"Postical"... I don't
think I can even say that.

427
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,340
Carter, thought you
went to the funeral.

428
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,634
If you can call it that.

429
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,300
Excuse me. Curtis Mitchell.
They say my family's here.

430
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:15,414
Uh, yeah. I'll take you to them.
You gonna be here a while?

431
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,812
- Did they tell you what happened?
- They told me.

432
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,418
Your mom was lucky. A
bullet went through her chest...

433
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:22,578
but we were able
to re-inflate her lung.

434
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:26,020
- What about Turner?
- Shot to the abdomen. But he's stable.

435
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,352
And my little sister?

436
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,588
Uh, no bullet wounds. That's
good. But a bookcase fell on her...

437
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:35,097
so there's some paralysis,
which we're hoping is temporary.

438
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,498
But we won't know more
until we get back her CT.

439
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,544
Hey, Mama.

440
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,343
How are the kids?
Did you see them?

441
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,511
No, not yet. Are you all right?

442
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,817
I was trying to protect her.

443
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:02,325
- It's not your fault.
- I pulled the bookcase down on her.

444
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,221
Did you see who did this?

445
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,961
Mama, did you see who did this?

446
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,764
Don't do anything, Curtis.

447
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,964
You hear me?

448
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,372
Let's go. We need
to get him upstairs.

449
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:21,241
Don't you do anything.

450
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,239
Don't you do anything!

451
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,408
Have them send
type-specific to the O.R..

452
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,611
- That's my brother.
- Cefoxitin's on board.

453
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,983
- Turner. GALLANT:
Second unit's in.

454
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,557
- What's going on? CORDAY:
We're taking him to the O.R..

455
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,388
He needs exploratory
surgery. He's bleeding internally.

456
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,122
- Can you make it stop?
- A bullet ripped into his spleen.

457
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,767
- We may need to remove it.
- Turner, you all right?

458
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,769
- We gotta get him upstairs.
- You stay strong, little man, okay?

459
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,099
Stay strong, man.

460
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,175
The standard of care
really does suck here.

461
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,927
Mrs. Perez?

462
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,762
He's got a swing like
a young Ted Williams.

463
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,798
That's what everybody
says, anyway.

464
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,527
Sounds like a natural.

465
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:21,196
I just... We can't
give up on that.

466
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,272
You don't have
to explain it to me.

467
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,207
Robert. Shall we step inside?

468
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,141
Gallant told me what happened.

469
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,282
So much for his integrity.

470
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,509
He was concerned.

471
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,051
Dr. Lewis was busy. May I?

472
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,851
It may be a little worse
than I thought initially.

473
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,492
Normally, in order
to determine...

474
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,326
full assessment
for escharotomy...

475
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,525
We need to determine
pain and paresthesias...

476
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,695
which we can't do because I'm the guy
with driftwood hanging off his shoulder.

477
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,209
There are other ways to determine
if the procedure is called for.

478
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,242
No. No escharotomy.

479
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:06,551
These are full-thickness burns. If blood
supply to the hand is compromised...

480
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:10,951
I can feel a pulse. I am not gonna let
the surgical B-team hack away at me.

481
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,653
It's possible your arm
could become ischemic.

482
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,990
In which case, it's
already too late to save it.

483
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,191
I know. I get it. I
understand. <i>Capisce.</i>

484
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,537
- You should see Corday.
- I don't want to.

485
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,606
At least get a
Plastics assessment.

486
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,107
Will you do that, Robert?

487
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:35,946
<i>Hi, it's Abby.</i>

488
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,743
<i>Leave a message after
the beep. Thank you.</i>

489
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,885
Hey, I thought you were
gonna be here with Eric.

490
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,918
- Dr. Carter.
- I was trying to catch you.

491
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,087
- Dr. Carter.
- I guess there was a change of plan.

492
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,392
And I'm gonna hang up now because
you're standing right in front of me.

493
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,756
- Hi.
- Where's Eric?

494
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,592
Upstairs with
Meyers. Are you okay?

495
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,358
I'm really sorry. I feel
like such a terrible person.

496
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,300
Yeah, well, it's been
a bad time all around.

497
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,234
I'm gonna see them dead!

498
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,430
I'm gonna wipe them out!

499
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:05,043
Look, I swear I will kill
them! I'm gonna do them all!

500
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,441
And I'll take this whole
damn world with me, man!

501
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,707
- I'll take them with me!
- You wanna be cool?

502
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,076
Or you wanna be in custody?

503
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,243
I'm cool, all right?
I'm cool, man.

504
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,047
- Okay, I'll get a suture kit.
- Sit.

505
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,218
I'm gonna come back later.

506
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,594
Good.

507
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,139
Picked a fight with an IV stand?
- You a doctor?

508
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,563
Just a hobby, really.

509
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,957
Nice tattoo. What is
that, Black Pharaohs?

510
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,103
No, man. Righteous Lords.

511
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,564
How long you been into that?

512
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,469
I'm not anymore.

513
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,803
I used to run with them a
while before I stopped, man.

514
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,002
- Unh.
- Outgrew it?

515
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,409
My mama begged me. I
got a job bagging groceries.

516
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,073
Okay. This'll sting a little.

517
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,849
They were after me.

518
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:52,752
- Who was?
- The Discip... Ah! The Disciples, man.

519
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,984
They think they own my 'hood!

520
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,096
Probably figured I was an easy
target ever since I left my crew.

521
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,596
Now Turner, Noelle and
Mama, they paying for it?

522
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,199
Punk-ass hoods, man.

523
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,438
Luka, the board's answer was no.

524
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,042
Oh, this is for something else.

525
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,542
However, I convinced
them to agree...

526
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:17,308
that if a boy with no other options
shows up at County General's doors...

527
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,815
in need of an emergency
unifoc and tet repair...

528
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,647
well, he wouldn't
be turned away.

529
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,516
Hypothetically?

530
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:25,817
And completely off the record.

531
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,550
Kerry, thank you.

532
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,955
<i>Welcome to Chicago.</i>

533
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,897
<i>Please remain seated. We have medical
personnel arriving to escort a passenger.</i>

534
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,837
<i>Thank you for your cooperation,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

535
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,206
- You are Dr. Kovac?
- Yeah.

536
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,974
Baseline cyanosis.
Non-rebreather at six liters.

537
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,326
All right. MEDIC:
Can I get a pulse ox?

538
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,689
Wait until we're
in the helicopter.

539
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,494
That the x-ray the lady
doc was talking about?

540
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,999
Come on. Talk to me, man.

541
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,530
She has no return
of her reflexes.

542
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,368
She's having
difficulty breathing.

543
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,409
- That could indicate paralysis.
- Will she walk?

544
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,080
If the swelling goes down, we
can put her on physical therapy.

545
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,841
Will she walk?

546
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,516
I don't know.

547
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,361
- Hey there, baby girl.
- Curtis.

548
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,590
- Mom's okay.
- Yeah, I know.

549
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,598
We didn't do anything.

550
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,732
Why'd they shoot at us?

551
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,463
I'm gonna go home and
I'm gonna get things fixed up.

552
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,231
You stay here and
get better, okay?

553
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,240
Neuro ICU's ready to take her.

554
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,970
- When can I visit?
- It's open 24 hours.

555
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,273
Am I going to have to stay here?

556
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,043
- For a while, yeah.
- I can't go home with you tonight?

557
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,312
No, not tonight,
baby girl. Not tonight.

558
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:06,390
These folks are gonna take care of
you. You try to get some sleep, all right?

559
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,556
- Car's outside.
- You back?

560
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,323
Too bad it's like
this though, man.

561
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,967
- Where you going, Curtis?
- Like I said, fix things.

562
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,262
- Yo, they shot up Jamal's crib too, son.
- Yeah?

563
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,406
- Not the way to do it.
- What do you know?

564
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:24,339
- You did a good thing. Don't undo it.
- Disciples undid it. They shot my family.

565
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,569
- Your family needs you.
- Yo, doc.

566
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,077
Hey, Curtis.

567
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:33,082
- Hey, Curtis.
- You just didn't do that, right?

568
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,150
What am I supposed to tell that
girl upstairs when you don't show up?

569
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,660
You tell her I'm a warrior.

570
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,493
You tell her that.

571
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,115
- Sats are falling!
- Can't get a good angle!

572
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,353
- PVCs. We've gotta bag him!
- No, maybe we'll have to wait!

573
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,828
He's gonna go into
arrest! Let me give it a shot!

574
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,968
- I don't think it's possible!
- We do it all the time!

575
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,597
Here. Bag for me!

576
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,440
Get low like you're having
sex in a Volkswagen.

577
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:36,275
- You know what I mean?
- He's going into V-tach! Don't miss!

578
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,746
You're a motivator.
Anyone ever tell you that?

579
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,446
Bypass tech and machine ready?

580
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,368
- On their way.
- Where can I plug in?

581
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,872
- Uh, you are?
- The echocardiologist.

582
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,723
Kovac promised me Cubs tickets.

583
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,330
Dr. Corday.

584
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,127
- What a pleasant surprise.
- I didn't realize Kovac had recruited you.

585
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:59,396
- He's a persuasive man.
- They're three minutes out.

586
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,153
- Are they ready?
- Standing by in the O.R.

587
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,982
Okay!

588
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,684
Let's roll!

589
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,585
Easy! Don't pull the tube!

590
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,695
He's bradying
down! Looks like 65!

591
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:27,526
- Half mg of atropine!
- Let's get moving!

592
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,168
- No. He might arrest.
- Eagle Scout, doc!

593
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,930
- Sats are off-the-chart low.
- No pulse.

594
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,266
Okay. Starting CPR.

595
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,874
You want epi?

596
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:40,240
- Point-five escalating doses.
- Pushing down!

597
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,040
High-dose epi doesn't work.

598
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,876
Nothing works. I just
want his heart to beat.

599
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,112
- I got a pulse! Let's go!
- Okay! Go, go, go!

600
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:53,387
Pressure's only 60 on maximum
dopamine. He needs suctioning.

601
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,398
- Where's the CT team?
- On their way in.

602
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,029
- You intubated?
- Yeah. He's in pulmonary edema.

603
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,236
Let's get started.

604
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,366
He stable enough for
general anesthesia?

605
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,297
- I'll scrub in. KOVAC:
Let's prep the chest.

606
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,828
It's all right. We have it.

607
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:07,099
Porcine pulmonary valve
with Dacron conduits.

608
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,036
Let's look at his
coronary anatomy.

609
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,470
All set.

610
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,918
It's been a good gig being married
to you, all in all. No complaints.

611
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,082
If you ever need a letter
of recommendation...

612
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,228
- My résumé speaks for itself.
- Is that split move you do...

613
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:31,886
is that a special skill?

614
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,159
Ah, so...

615
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,061
I guess we'll be
running into each other.

616
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:45,677
You know, just because we're splitting
up doesn't mean we have to end it.

617
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,607
That makes sense to me.

618
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,577
I hear divorcées
have the best sex.

619
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,308
- We're technically annulled, not divorced.
- Work with me.

620
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,113
I will. I got a roommate.

621
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,778
That's okay. I know a
bench in Lincoln Park.

622
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,940
There'll be some outrage at
the top, but we'll handle that.

623
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,478
- So he's doing well?
- Yeah. Stable on bypass.

624
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,639
Harvesting pericardium.

625
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:36,720
I thought if I could save
him, it would make me feel...

626
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,691
I don't know, like, uh...

627
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,924
maybe I was a doctor again.

628
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:49,505
Hey, does this look like a
pubic ramus fracture to you?

629
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,542
No. Avulsion of the
ischial tuberosity.

630
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,543
Abby's on her way down.

631
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,341
Dr. Romano, how's it going?

632
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,710
- How's what going?
- Nothing.

633
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,182
Back to work. - Gallant.

634
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,686
- I'm putting Mrs. Mitchell in 1.
- I'll be back from Ortho in a minute.

635
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:08,258
- What's the chest-tube output?
- Less than 50 cc's an hour. Normal sats.

636
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,055
Mrs. Mitchell, how
are you feeling?

637
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,027
Curtis. Is Curtis here?

638
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:17,898
He had to go out for a little while.
He said he'd come back later for a visit.

639
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,265
You a doctor? You dress so nice.

640
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,202
Yeah. I had a funeral.

641
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,842
Oh. Somebody close to you?

642
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,209
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

643
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,781
- Must be hard.
- Uh, Turner's better. He's out of surgery.

644
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:36,045
And Noelle is up in the Neuro
ICU. You can see her tomorrow.

645
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:39,623
Will you wake me up
when Curtis comes back?

646
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,018
I'll make sure that
the doctor knows.

647
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,288
He's a good boy, my Curtis.

648
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,224
How did Kovac get you on board?

649
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,496
- Well, he asked.
- Huh.

650
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,401
That was easy.

651
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,971
So, what do you wanna do now?

652
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:04,583
Because normally tonight, I would just
be sitting at home watching <i>Trading Places.</i>

653
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,948
But fortunately for
you, it's ladies' night.

654
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,888
Yeah, you're right.
My daughter's waiting.

655
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:18,086
I see. Well, have I mentioned
how much I love kids?

656
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:22,894
My car's up the
street. You want a ride?

657
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,767
Which way are you going?

658
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,973
Um. Whichever way
you point me towards.

659
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,696
I'm really sorry. Uh...

660
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,628
I just can't tonight.

661
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,701
Um, can I take a rain check?

662
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,132
Nice evening for a stroll.

663
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,813
Lizzie.

664
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,479
How'd it go with Plastics?

665
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,619
What'd Gallant do, post
it on the bulletin board?

666
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,289
No. Plastics consulted me.

667
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,992
They knew that I'd
examined your other infection.

668
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,991
He wants to admit
me for wound care...

669
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,694
daily débridements,
uh, pulse monitoring...

670
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,103
in about a week, do skin grafts
on the dorsum and the volar aspect.

671
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,741
Well, that seems reasonable.

672
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,207
Does it?

673
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,873
I was making tea.

674
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:47,143
I put the pot on. I,
uh, got distracted.

675
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,386
My sling got caught
on the burner, uh...

676
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,015
and my arm was on fire.

677
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:59,019
And I didn't realize it until I
saw the flame. It's ridiculous.

678
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,025
Unfortunately, things like that can
happen during sensory recovery.

679
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:06,535
Yeah, but I'm not recovering.
I'll never get the feeling back.

680
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,843
Listen. Just because you're discouraged,
don't do anything that may cause delay.

681
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,741
- It's gonna keep going.
- You can't afford another infection.

682
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,040
It's over.

683
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,206
Compartment syndrome,
vascular insufficiency.

684
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,648
Lizzie, you're not
hearing me. It's over.

685
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,014
It's time for me
to cut my losses.

686
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,683
- Robert.
- We both know I'm better off without it.

687
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,421
- You as much as said so.
- No. I said that amputation...

688
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,759
was always a possibility,
but I don't think...

689
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,698
I'm very, very glad
we had this chat.

690
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,073
Will you, uh, check the
O.R. schedule and set it up?

691
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,079
As soon as possible.

692
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,613
I just wanna be rid
of the damn thing.

693
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,548
- Hey.
- Hey.

694
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:04,253
- Have you seen Carter?
- Uh, he was here before.

695
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,092
Everything okay?

696
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,263
Hey, I heard about the
boy. Congratulations.

697
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,440
Thanks.

698
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,612
Okay, see you tomorrow.

699
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,946
Actually, uh, you won't
see me for a while.

700
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,621
I'm going to the Congo.

701
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,852
What?

702
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:37,518
The Alliance de
Médecine Internationale.

703
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:41,289
I'm off tomorrow and then
I'm going for West Africa.

704
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,458
I didn't realize
that was so soon.

705
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,878
Take care of yourself.

706
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,485
- I mean it.
- Yeah.

707
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,288
Hold down the fort.

708
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,567
- She's in the lounge.
- Who?

709
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:23,241
You're not gonna play that?
- GSW to the chest.

710
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,400
- No LOC, but he's altered.
- Who's Attending?

711
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,408
Uh, Chen's in 3 with a hot MI.

712
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,740
Who's gonna take this?
Pratt needs an Attending.

713
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,349
- You're an Attending.
- BP, 90/66 after a liter.

714
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:33,883
Hey.

715
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,578
- Hey, where's Curtis?
- I don't know, man. I don't know.

716
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,348
- Was anybody with him?
- A couple pronounced on the scene.

717
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:41,652
- Tachy at 130.
- I can't breathe!

718
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:42,850
Lost the pulse.

719
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,996
All right, start
compressions. Let's go.

720
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,823
- No pressure, no pulse.
- All right, stop CPR.

721
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,993
I'm in. You bag.
Thoracotomy tray.

722
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,332
- Carter, I'm here.
- Betadine and 10 blade next.

723
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,872
- Jing-Mei's got it.
- Pratt, don't just stand there.

724
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,203
- Do a central line.
- He's my patient. I got it.

725
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:02,006
- Still no pulse.
- It's okay. You don't have to do this.

726
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,376
- Give me the 10 blade.
- John, let them take it.

727
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:15,556
Fifth intercostal space all
the way to the midaxillary line.

728
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,794
Okay, why don't
we get out of here?

729
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,867
You know I came
in to find you, right?

730
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,932
I shouldn't have come in
here. I shouldn't have come.

731
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,540
- Things are gonna get better.
- Can you do me a favor?

732
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,073
- Yeah.
- Can you leave me alone?

733
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,102
- What?
- I need some time. Can you just go?

734
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,774
Okay.
