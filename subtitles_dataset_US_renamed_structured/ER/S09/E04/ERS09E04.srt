1
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,659
Time of death, 7:36 a.m.

2
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,024
- Your fish coded?
- Yep. Third time this week.

3
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,390
Every afternoon, I
restock the little pond.

4
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,058
Every morning it's like the
<i>Exxon Valdez</i> blew through.

5
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,430
Get somebody to do this.

6
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,835
- No. I'm committed now.
- Committed fish-killer.

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,008
Don't, don't, don't. Thank you. I've
been meaning to cut down on my caffeine.

8
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,545
How come I have
to wait out here now?

9
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,239
So you won't kill us.

10
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,180
I never even touched you.

11
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,614
Whose idea was this anyway?

12
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,618
Hospital beautification
committee.

13
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,622
Years for a decent security
system. Two weeks for an aquarium.

14
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:34,922
Yeah, metal detectors. Bulletproof
glass. We'll all be much safer.

15
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,463
- The gang go out again last night?
- It's not a gang. It's a club.

16
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,295
Not another stage-diving
incident, I hope?

17
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,596
First rule of girls' club is
we don't talk about girls' club.

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,865
- You won't tell me what you did?
- The usual.

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,942
Crank calls, pillow fights,
lesbian experimentation.

20
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,139
They're live in a minute.

21
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,057
- We need your outlet.
- What channel?

22
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,607
Four. You'll keep it down
once we're rolling, right?

23
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,063
Nothing new on the board?

24
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,610
It's three hours since we had a
patient, five since the last ambulance.

25
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,812
What's that about?

26
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,084
- Mission General reopened.
- Oh, don't sound so depressed.

27
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,786
- I'm waiting on some action.
- In school, we ate dried eel and almonds.

28
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,895
I think I'll live
with the headache.

29
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,863
- Eel?
- Yeah. For Susan's hangover.

30
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,401
- Kudzu.
- What?

31
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,062
Asian root. You
make a tea with it.

32
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,309
- Hair of the dog that bit you.
- It feels like a pack of dogs...

33
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,638
and they all had a Mexican tag.

34
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,679
Thank you for getting me home.
I'm so sorry about your shoes.

35
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,548
Sounds like some party.

36
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,109
- They're starting. PRODUCER:
Okay, folks, a little quiet.

37
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,845
<i>We're coming to you from
County General Hospital...</i>

38
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,755
- Fixing her hair.
<i>- With its Chief of Emergency Medicine.</i>

39
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,918
<i>We've asked her to demonstrate
how easy it is to get a flu shot.</i>

40
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,428
<i>Tell us, Dr. Kerry. Any
risks associated with this?</i>

41
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:50,094
<i>You may experience some mild
flu-like symptoms, muscle ache, low fever.</i>

42
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,240
<i>But it's really a very safe
prophylactic measure.</i>

43
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:57,037
<i>Now, a week or more of misery is
worse than one little shot, isn't it?</i>

44
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,543
<i>Yes. And that's why we
recommend flu shots...</i>

45
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,182
<i>for the elderly, those
with chronic illnesses...</i>

46
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,944
<i>and anyone taking care of
or exposed to sick people.</i>

47
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,781
<i>Wow, that was like butter.</i>

48
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,790
<i>So, what's the other one for?</i>

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,792
Tell me she didn't
forget to switch needles.

50
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,030
She forgot to switch needles.

51
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,882
- Nice setup you got here.
- It ought to keep the riffraff out.

52
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,825
So how did you manage to
score opening-day triage duty?

53
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,325
I'm thinking a nice
doctor put in a good word.

54
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,557
I hate triage.

55
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,827
- Nothing to do, Pratt?
- I'm orienting Lola.

56
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,970
- Mona.
- Melanie Shepherd?

57
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,265
Yes.

58
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,136
- Take you in now.
- Yeah, sure. Right.

59
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,571
- Hey.
- Mommy, Mommy...

60
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,769
- I'll be back soon.
- He can come if you want.

61
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,345
- Really...?
- No. We'll wait here.

62
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,311
Bobby, come over here. Come on.

63
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,112
- Where's Mommy going?
- Stop whining and sit down.

64
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,283
When can we go
home? I wanna go home.

65
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,856
What? Are you a baby?

66
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,355
Is this what big boys do?

67
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,960
Hey, shut up.

68
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,698
Mommy is not gonna get any
better if you don't knock it off.

69
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,801
- Excuse me, sir. Do you need anything?
- No. Not anymore. Thanks.

70
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,630
I want Mommy. I want Mommy.

71
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,002
Hey. Hey, if you
do not shut up...

72
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,109
Sir, I don't mean to
interrupt you, but...

73
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,201
Then don't. Okay, pal?

74
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,711
You're real helpful now. Where were
you three hours ago when we got here?

75
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,043
Stop it.

76
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,736
- Hey, doc. SHEPHERD:
Will you stop it?

77
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,929
- I'll take a look.
- I have my own internist.

78
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,218
- You almost found yourself a badge.
- Excuse me?

79
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm guessing Eagle Scout.

80
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,855
- I didn't wanna make it worse.
- Did you make it any better?

81
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,620
- I tried. CHEN: I
wanna take karate.

82
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,627
- Karate? Really?
- I was thinking judo.

83
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,493
But I want something
more aggressive.

84
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,066
So you like it rough?

85
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,567
A gun to the head brings
out the fighter in a girl.

86
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,965
Now you're showing off.

87
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,698
- Your girlfriend's asking for you.
- Girlfriend?

88
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,570
Stella Willits, 45...

89
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,179
frequent flyer, going on 60,
with a borderline personality.

90
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,475
- Yes. That sounds about right.
- Asking for Michael Gallant, M.D.

91
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,743
I've seen her four
times in the last week.

92
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,683
You're doing an excellent
job. Get her exam. I'll be there.

93
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,187
The tests are a precaution.

94
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,758
- They should take about an hour.
- Then I'll know if she infected me.

95
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,258
Don't be such a jerk.

96
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,262
- She used to date a bisexual.
- He wasn't a bisexual.

97
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,332
He was just open-minded.

98
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,593
Right. I'll be back
when the results are in.

99
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,566
You wanted to do
the medical spot.

100
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,365
- Shut up, Leland.
- You shut up.

101
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,734
- No, you shut up.
- Shut up.

102
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,605
Is anyone aware that, according to
this, there aren't enough nurses on duty...

103
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,110
to reach the maximum
patient-to-nurse ratios?

104
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,047
- I'll take a look at it.
- Not even an MICN scheduled Friday.

105
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,186
- Randi, get Haleh on the phone.
- She's off.

106
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:30,347
- I don't care. She's the nurse manager.
- Nope. She resigned in September.

107
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,220
- Have they appointed a replacement?
- Yep.

108
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,794
- She resigned last week.
- Why wasn't I informed?

109
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,590
You haven't been
around that much.

110
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,293
Dr. Weaver... your
makeup looked great.

111
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,635
Abby... could you
come by my office later?

112
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,296
Sure. Dr. Romano's office?

113
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,399
- 1:30?
- Why?

114
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,169
Let's make it 2.

115
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,880
Breathe in deep.

116
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,414
Good. Again.

117
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,720
I gave up cholesterol,
Michael, after our little talk.

118
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,982
- You'll thank me later.
- I'd thank you now.

119
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,422
- Find anything?
- Chest pain, reproducible by palpation.

120
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,257
Hey, you know Howdy Doody?
You look like Howdy Doody.

121
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,058
- Thanks.
- I hate Howdy Doody.

122
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,667
- Sorry to hear that, Miss Willits.
- Call me Stella.

123
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,700
It means "star," you know.

124
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,297
I'm concerned about
her dyspnea on exertion.

125
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,496
My what?

126
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,266
- Your shortness of breath.
- Congestive heart failure?

127
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,845
Her lungs are dry. It could
be symptomatic ischemia.

128
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,579
Flat T waves in
her lateral leads.

129
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,082
Yeah. But I'd still recommend O2,
aspirin, nitro paste, and a card's consult.

130
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,816
- She should go upstairs for monitoring.
- I think that might be premature.

131
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,516
Why don't we send
some enzymes...

132
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,786
get her old chart, take a
look at her previous 12-lead?

133
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,822
If the changes are acute?

134
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,928
Have Cardiology come down.

135
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,170
So are you gonna
run some tests now?

136
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,805
- Yes, ma'am.
- Can I go out and grab a smoke first?

137
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,609
Dr. Corday will take care of your
wife. How long have you been retired?

138
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,975
I ain't retired. I'm not.

139
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,117
A nurse's work is never done.

140
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,980
Thank you.

141
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,649
How's the hangover?

142
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,717
I'm going with aspirin and caffeine.
- Ow!

143
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,153
Sorry.

144
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,556
Yeah. Abby said
it was a good time.

145
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:20,029
Don't worry. She hasn't cheated on
you since that stripper named Thor.

146
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,796
I can be concerned, right?

147
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,369
Don't be. He was wearing
an American flag thong.

148
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,732
No. I mean her drinking.

149
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,397
- Did I bring my lunch?
- We'll get you something.

150
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,341
I'm the one who barfed.

151
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,206
Yeah. But she's the alcoholic.

152
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,816
It's not easy to stay on the
program when you're out bar-hopping.

153
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,781
The program?

154
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,914
I thought you knew.

155
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,180
Would you take
Mr. Evans upstairs to CT?

156
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,487
She doesn't drink that much.
I never even thought about it.

157
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,729
- What's not that much?
- If you're worried, talk to her.

158
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,562
Carter, films are back
on your patellar fracture.

159
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,870
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

160
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,438
Exam 1?

161
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:03,407
What's the best way to rule out
PE? A spiral CT or a V/Q scan?

162
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,671
Okay, I'm only gonna say this
once. I hate surprise parties.

163
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,712
Carter assumed
I was in the loop.

164
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,111
What loop?

165
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,376
The drinking loop?

166
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,219
Oh.

167
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,914
He's concerned.

168
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,619
Which I think is very sweet.

169
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,071
I didn't want you to
feel weird about it...

170
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:28,734
It's none of my business.

171
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,603
- I just wanted us to have a good time.
- I understand.

172
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,969
- You've seen me. It's not like...
- It's between you and Carter.

173
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,937
I'm sorry he got you into it.

174
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,082
No. It was an accident.
He thought I knew.

175
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,548
Yeah. Well, it's not like
it's a big secret either. It's...

176
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,929
Kerry.

177
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,895
Susan.

178
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,494
Abby.

179
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,946
- You don't think she could be...?
- No chance.

180
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,341
- That's how it looked.
- The straightest gay woman...

181
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,240
since Janet Reno?
I don't think so.

182
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,280
You're right. She was probably
just practicing her flu shots.

183
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,508
She could use practice.

184
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,812
- My turn now?
- Not yet.

185
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,251
- When is my turn?
- Later.

186
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,688
- I was here before.
- Go back to your seat, Phil.

187
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,191
Where's the nearest bar?

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,192
We should have
left him in triage.

189
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,024
The other patients
were complaining.

190
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,656
Abby. The junkie in 4 fell
out of bed and lost his IV.

191
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,133
Okay. I'll be right there.

192
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,565
Listen...

193
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,537
It's just not something
I talk about much.

194
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,615
We're friends, Abby.
If you wanna talk...

195
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,979
you know where I am.
And if not, that's okay too.

196
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,347
Thank you.

197
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,546
Did you get meat loaf
this trip, Miss Willits?

198
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,850
- No, I'm a vegan now.
- Good for you.

199
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,822
It's a simple case
of costochondritis.

200
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,894
I think the DOE is
her anginal equivalent.

201
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,554
Or it could simply be that the
only exercise the old bird gets...

202
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,327
is lighting her cigarettes.
Send her home on Naprosyn.

203
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,367
- Do you still work here?
- Last I checked.

204
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,904
Shouldn't we be concerned
about progressive dyspnea?

205
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,405
When you become an
actual doctor, Mr. Gallant...

206
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,100
then you can make the diagnosis.

207
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,240
Just thought you might want
to monitor her in Cardiology.

208
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,510
Don't know why your student calls me
in for a consult, then refuses my advice.

209
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,712
- Just trying to be thorough?
- She had 10 unnecessary admissions...

210
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,188
for rule-out MI in two years.
She always had flat T waves.

211
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,156
- Next time, check the records.
- I did.

212
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,421
Then you know I
already cath'd her.

213
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,257
So much for thoroughness.

214
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,269
- Did you check the chart?
- There's no record of a cath in there.

215
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,598
I looked in volumes
8 and 9, since 2000.

216
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,298
- Maybe he cath'd her before.
- A lot could have changed.

217
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,272
If he won't admit
her, we can't do much.

218
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,743
- Can we keep her for observation?
- We cannot. We don't have any beds.

219
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,439
- We got 10 patients waiting.
- She needs a monitor.

220
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,049
You have a minute?

221
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,686
Yeah. I can give you two.

222
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,014
We can park her in the
hall till a bed opens up.

223
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,453
Until her troponin
comes back from the lab.

224
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,285
I talked to Susan.

225
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,021
- Abby? Eleven-year-old with possible UTI.
- Okay, I'm coming.

226
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,028
- Me too. HARMS:
A little help, folks?

227
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,863
Unidentified Latino found seizing in
a phone booth. Gave two of Ativan.

228
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,039
- Head atraumatic.
- Pulse ox, 99. Glucose 110...

229
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,469
GCS five on scene.

230
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,643
Looks post-ictal, but
he's got a good DBI.

231
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,449
DBI?

232
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:26,905
- Dirt-ball index. Big
dog, lots of tattoos.

233
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,208
He's gonna be all right
because he has tattoos?

234
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:33,444
Good guys die, bad dogs walk. This
one looks like he's gonna be okay.

235
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,282
He has a little
abrasion to his chin.

236
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,447
No prison tats. Too
bad. They count double.

237
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:41,322
- He's military.
- Sats, 98. BP, 110/76.

238
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,326
I don't know if I'm supposed to.

239
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,930
- Slow down.
- Sorry about that.

240
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,591
- It's all right. How about that signature?
- Margaret usually signs.

241
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,499
Well, she can't right now.
That's why I need you to do it.

242
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,299
Dr. Corday, she's waking up.

243
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,241
Thomas, I want you to stay
right here for a moment, okay?

244
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,645
- Third unit going in.
- Hold the FFP until we're upstairs.

245
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:03,839
Margaret...

246
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,249
Margaret, I'm Dr. Corday.
You were in an accident.

247
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,082
Is Thomas okay?

248
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,986
Yes. He's fine. But you've
suffered a splenic laceration.

249
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,185
And your husband feels unable to
sign the consent for your surgery.

250
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,421
Operation? I can't.

251
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,027
There is some risk involved,
but it needs to be done.

252
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,501
I can't stay in bed so long.
He couldn't cope without me.

253
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,005
I'm sure he'll make do.

254
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,376
He has Alzheimer.

255
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,677
Well, you shouldn't be
incapacitated very long.

256
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,679
But you need to sign
so we can help you.

257
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,044
Please...

258
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,046
can't we just wait and see?

259
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:45,321
Margaret, splenic fractures can
form clots that may hold for a while.

260
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,758
But if the clot breaks, you might
bleed to death before we can fix it.

261
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,728
Meds are in.

262
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,063
P-E-R-R.

263
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,069
- What?
- Pupils equal, round and reactive.

264
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,708
- Airway's good. WARD:
Gato, you okay, man?

265
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,242
We've given him some
medication to prevent seizures.

266
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,004
Has he been sick recently?

267
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,479
We were out late, going
hard. He seemed fine.

268
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,209
He just got back on leave.
He hasn't even seen his girl.

269
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,183
Nothing besides alcohol, right?

270
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,783
- Coke, ecstasy?
- Just beer and bourbon.

271
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,422
- No liberty stunts, right?
- How's that?

272
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,495
He shows signs of toxicity.
You guys didn't play any pranks?

273
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,996
- Roofies, quaaludes?
- He's our buddy, all right?

274
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,532
Easy, sergeant. We
just need to be sure.

275
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,864
- We wouldn't do that.
- Okay.

276
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,403
You guys can wait in the hall.

277
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,871
Gallant, send up a
Dilantin level in 15 minutes.

278
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,270
Got it.

279
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,104
Malik, let's go.

280
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,042
- Keep him on two liters, pulse ox...
- You guys are Rangers?

281
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,342
Seventy-fifth Regiment,
Special Forces Group.

282
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,609
Where they taking him?

283
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,515
He needs a CT to check for any
sign of a tumor or intracranial bleeding.

284
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,850
- You guys see action?
- Nothing to talk about.

285
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,788
I did a summer duty down at
Fort Houston a few months back.

286
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,952
- You Army?
- Yeah. Medical Corps.

287
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,325
- Why are you here?
- Finishing med school.

288
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,261
Must be rough.

289
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,097
We spent the last three months
jumping out of Black Hawks...

290
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,139
on the Pakistani border. Let
us know when our buddy's back.

291
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,873
It burns when she pees. She's
achy and sick to her stomach.

292
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,483
- Low-grade fever.
- I think it's from the trip.

293
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,916
- On vacation? JANET:
No. Just a weekend away.

294
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,817
We're supposed to
go to Shedd Aquarium.

295
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,321
Has she had any UTIs before?

296
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,652
A bunch. It usually
clears up with antibiotics.

297
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,953
Her doctor gave us
some Bactrim, but...

298
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,653
I left it in Milwaukee.

299
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,298
Okay. Let's dip a urine.

300
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,934
I don't want a catheter, okay?

301
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,899
You're the boss.

302
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,200
So, what kind of accent is that?

303
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,309
- What accent?
- Come on. Where are you from?

304
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,379
I don't think you've heard
of it. A place called Idaho.

305
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,348
Well, that explains it.

306
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,982
- You like potatoes?
- Who doesn't?

307
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:58,887
- Mom. I'm hungry.
- Okay. Let me go get you a sandwich.

308
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,583
Here you go, Abby.

309
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,492
- Why are you giving me this?
- Next Friday. I need it off.

310
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,189
I'd like a month in the Bahamas.

311
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,925
I'll settle for a long
weekend at my cousin's.

312
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,462
Jerry, are the labs
back on my UTI girl?

313
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,198
No. But look. I made origami.

314
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,377
- It's a swan.
- No, it's not.

315
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,875
I think it is.

316
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,776
You should hang it on the
refrigerator by your report card.

317
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,110
Thanks, Mom. You're the best.

318
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,682
Hello. We are
waiting for your labs.

319
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,018
I got bored in there.
There's too many sick people.

320
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,519
- Where's your mom?
- She went to the cafeteria.

321
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,292
To get food?

322
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,555
It's not a good idea.

323
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,400
We're supposed to
do all this fun stuff.

324
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,228
I wanted to see the aquarium.

325
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,234
The aquarium? Really?

326
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,669
- You should have said so.
- Hey, Abby. Open room?

327
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,070
Try Exam 2.

328
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,508
- How's his CT?
- It was all clear.

329
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,976
What's going on, Stella?

330
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,739
Nicotine fits are a bitch.

331
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:59,009
- We're checking on a bed for you, okay?
- How about a decent coffee?

332
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,710
How's he doing?

333
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,016
- No sign of a tumor. That's good.
- What's up with his mouth?

334
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,585
We gave him a charcoal slurry
to soak up drugs in his GI tract.

335
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,353
Look, I already told you guys.

336
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,998
There's something toxic in
your buddy's system, okay?

337
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,894
We're just trying to fix him up.

338
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:23,065
Hey... how are you feeling, bro?

339
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,539
- Perk?
- Hey, man.

340
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,206
- Who's that?
- It's Sammo.

341
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,842
Hey, is Elena here?

342
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,740
We called her. She wasn't home.

343
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,148
- Where are we?
- I'm Dr. Gallant, Felix.

344
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,617
You're in County Hospital.

345
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,688
My eyes. Are my eyes open?

346
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,882
- Shut up, fool.
- I can't see you.

347
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,686
- Cut it out.
- I can't see anything.

348
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,852
Okay, okay. Hold still.

349
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:50,561
Okay, bring me a scope,
page Ophtho, find Carter.

350
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,138
Not quite the Shedd Aquarium.
But it's the best we got.

351
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,037
You could be over-feeding them.

352
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,938
Do you think the
water smells weird?

353
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,942
Or someone else could be.

354
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,607
Or maybe it's our funny way of warning
people they're entering a house of death.

355
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,611
Are you really a good nurse?

356
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,354
I'm technically proficient,
despite certain attitude issues.

357
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,161
Well, then maybe I should
have stayed in Milwaukee.

358
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,389
Is that where your dad is?

359
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,260
He moved away.

360
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,800
My parents are getting divorced.

361
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,361
Sorry.

362
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,731
It sucks big-time.

363
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,107
Well, you know? Now you get
to double up on presents, right?

364
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,372
- Christmas and your birthday.
- I guess.

365
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,943
There's always the fun of
playing one against the other.

366
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,212
Actually, I did that before anyway.
Now I just live with my mom.

367
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,788
You know, moms can be cool.

368
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,716
I grew up with just a mom.

369
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,656
And it was good?

370
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,088
Yes.

371
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,459
- Have you seen Phil?
- No.

372
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,095
- Her labs aren't back?
- Not yet.

373
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,737
Whatever she says
about pet care, disregard.

374
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,603
- Yeah, I kind of got that idea.
- Thanks.

375
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,175
Hey, Ken. Where do you
keep the oral contrast?

376
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,073
Why? Did you lose a drunk again?

377
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,907
Try the hall.

378
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,152
Oh.

379
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,449
Excuse me.

380
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,295
I misplaced an x-ray.

381
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,093
Did you find it?

382
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,596
I've checked everywhere.

383
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,171
I keep walking into
the wrong doors today.

384
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,442
Luka and UTI Mom?

385
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,177
Yeah. Is this kind of
thing normal in Croatia?

386
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,289
Yeah. They call it
"alternative medicine."

387
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,789
I'm not supposed to
laugh. It's a patient's mother.

388
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,621
- Where did you find them?
- In the closet in Radiology.

389
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,661
That's so strange.

390
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,525
Neuro's so much more cozy.

391
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,533
- Is that what you two were like?
- No. We stuck to beds mostly.

392
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,898
Too bad. I think you
should talk to him.

393
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,504
- Me?
- You know him better.

394
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,732
- You walked in on him.
- I'm not the sex police.

395
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,901
- We get the labs on Hernandez?
- Ophtho can't give an assessment...

396
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:15,047
- till we ID the cause of his vision loss.
- Here you go.

397
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,477
- What's his blood-alcohol level?
- None detected.

398
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,143
I'm going for coffee. Does
anybody want anything?

399
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,317
No, I'm good. Thanks.

400
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,890
No methanol or
ethanol in his system.

401
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,219
What about tricyclics?

402
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,919
- Tox screen's negative.
- I did think of something else.

403
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,689
- An anti-malarial is used in the service.
- Quinine.

404
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,502
Something he might have access to
that isn't detectable in the tox screen.

405
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,003
You'd have to take a lot
of quinine to get that sick.

406
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,738
I know.

407
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,700
Want me to talk to him?

408
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,244
No. Why don't you
let Gallant handle it?

409
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,406
Give it your best shot, Mikey.

410
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,284
You should come see
Milwaukee sometime.

411
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,890
Yeah. I hear they
have good beer.

412
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,688
You're very informed about
U.S. regional consumables.

413
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,093
Excuse me, Dr. Kovac.

414
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,928
- Yeah. I'll be back when the labs are in.
- Yeah, okay.

415
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,234
Can we discharge this patient?
They've been here four hours.

416
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,398
- Yeah. We're still waiting on Chem-7.
- I saw the chart. Looks like a simple UTI.

417
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,703
I'm concerned about
vesicoureteral reflux.

418
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,178
- Luka, come on.
- What?

419
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,980
Well, let's clear this
patient as soon as possible.

420
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,413
Her workup is not finished.

421
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,814
Well, her mother's is.

422
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,822
And unless you have unusual stamina,
there's no further reason to keep them.

423
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,426
The girl's at risk for
renal insufficiency.

424
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:40,733
What I'm trying to say is that when
you're waiting on a patient's results...

425
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,962
it's not necessary for you to boff that
patient's mother in the storage closet.

426
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,503
Oh.

427
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,436
Get the labs back, write
a scrip, dispo the girl.

428
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,480
Chemistries on your little girl.

429
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,817
Is she a renal patient?

430
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,556
She is now.

431
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,294
Did my girl call back?

432
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,990
- Not yet.
- I guess she won't then.

433
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,499
How's your vision?

434
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,606
Starting to see shapes. You
get my peepers going, I'll be fine.

435
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,532
- You were in the Philippines?
- Before Pakistan, yeah.

436
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,074
You ever hear of quinine?

437
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,377
- What about it?
- Service gives it out to prevent malaria.

438
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,040
- So?
- It also induces blindness...

439
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:35,847
- when ingested in large quantities.
- Maybe they gave me too much overseas.

440
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,753
This would have been something
you ingested in the last 12 hours, Felix.

441
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,527
Maybe you found out
something when you got home.

442
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,865
- Like about your girl?
- You don't know me.

443
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,198
I know that in combat, home is
the only thing that keeps you going.

444
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,738
You want things to be the
same when you get back...

445
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:59,038
- Are you a shrink or a doctor?
- Only it's not. Like, "What's the point?"

446
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,814
To make you better, I gotta
know what made you sick.

447
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,381
When you're in country...

448
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,849
it's easy to forget that life keeps
going. Sometimes without you.

449
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,519
Elena?

450
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,487
She waited for me a long time.

451
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,853
I guess she got
tired of waiting.

452
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,524
Just fix me up, okay?

453
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,994
Just fix it.

454
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,292
All right.

455
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:26,729
We'll get you some bicarbonate
to eliminate the toxins.

456
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,102
And I'll get somebody
down here to talk to you.

457
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,936
I'm Special Forces.

458
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,738
This gets out, I'm through.

459
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,814
Look, Felix, I'm concerned
about getting you healthy.

460
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,916
It was a split second.

461
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,944
Please.

462
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,721
Okay.

463
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,057
- If I put you in touch with a clinic...
- I'll do counseling, I promise.

464
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,631
- Look, I'll follow it up, Felix.
- You won't have to.

465
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,100
I'll be okay this time.

466
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,406
Hey, have they
croaked yet? Your fish?

467
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,910
- Honey.
- I'm much better with human patients.

468
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,742
You must not be a Pisces.

469
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,383
Okay, just for that...

470
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,781
you're getting meat
loaf for lunch today.

471
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,445
We were wondering
where you went.

472
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,955
Marlene's blood tests are back.

473
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:23,084
They show a high creatinine level
consistent with chronic renal failure.

474
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:26,755
- We have to send for an ultrasound.
- You said it didn't look like anything.

475
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,425
It's still not clear. That's why we
need to image the kidneys and bladder.

476
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,630
A renal ultrasound is fast, very easy,
and it'll help us figure out the problem.

477
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:38,801
- But I thought it was just an infection.
- That's what we were hoping for.

478
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,469
And...

479
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,911
it's painless, so you
don't have to be afraid.

480
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,813
Well, that's as long as I'm not a fish.
- That's right.

481
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,647
Ready to go for a spin?

482
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,449
- It's okay, we'll just take pictures.
- Okay.

483
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,018
You better call Dad.

484
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,660
Can you pop a wheelie again?
- Sure, hold on tight.

485
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,793
- Okay.
- Should I be scared?

486
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,288
Won't make it any easier.

487
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,796
It's gonna be
like a ride, right?

488
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,498
Kind of.

489
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,042
I bet you say
that to all the kids.

490
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,972
- I need some Brevital for 2.
- Sure.

491
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,140
- Dislocated elbow?
- Mm-hm.

492
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,209
How long you on for?

493
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,980
I have to stick around
for the shift change.

494
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,818
I can hang around.

495
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,391
How does...

496
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,293
a couple of burgers, some shakes
and maybe see if you get lucky sound?

497
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,127
I haven't had an offer that
good since the eighth grade.

498
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,734
Yeah, but I'm treating.

499
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,996
- Thirteen-year-old girls never treat.
- In boarding school, they do.

500
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,697
Well, make me a counteroffer.

501
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:46,702
Are you... out of Brevital?

502
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,746
Only Versed.

503
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,745
Plus 200 of fent.

504
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,716
We gonna talk
about this... Carter?

505
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,680
- I got a patient waiting.
- Okay.

506
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,691
Is this backing off? Because if I
get to choose, I prefer butting in.

507
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,091
- I took care of that this morning.
- I know.

508
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,822
- I blew your cover.
- I don't care.

509
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,899
- Then what?
- I want us to be clear is all.

510
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,059
- I think it's pretty clear.
- My time sheet.

511
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,262
- Why are you giving me that? No.
- You're the nurse manager, right?

512
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,600
Guess again. Memo from Weaver.

513
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,333
What?

514
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,044
Weren't you supposed
to see her today?

515
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,907
Yeah. I kind of dodged that.

516
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,344
Funny how that happens.

517
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,416
I had rounds.

518
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,576
- You kids fighting?
- Shut up, Jerry.

519
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,517
You should talk to her.

520
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,224
- What?
- I'm just trying to help navigate...

521
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,088
love's wavy water...

522
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,396
What do you people
have against paper?

523
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,259
Jerry, what's the
guard there for?

524
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,457
- Psych hold.
- What? Why?

525
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:45,035
Guy's suicidal. They're
moving him up to a locked ward.

526
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:48,235
- Do you have his chart?
- Yeah, it's right here.

527
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,779
- Where's Pratt?
- Try Curtain 2.

528
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:57,107
I'll be right back, Mr. Geary.
Don't throw up just yet.

529
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,243
- Do you know where Dr. Pratt is?
- Exam 1, with a Valium OD.

530
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,432
- ABG results?
- It's on the clipboard.

531
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,789
You re-did the Hernandez chart?

532
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:11,388
Get RT to drop to 80 percent,
and check her gas in an hour.

533
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,559
- Because you marked it "accidental."
- So what?

534
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,931
So? Nobody takes that many pills
without meaning to off themselves.

535
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,595
That was not your call to make.

536
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,469
What's your problem, brother?
I'm trying to watch your back.

537
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,339
I have a lot of brothers.
I don't need another.

538
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,777
- Don't need a malpractice suit either.
- Why are you always riding me?

539
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,384
You need to learn to
stick up for yourself.

540
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,845
I told Kayson what I thought.

541
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,319
You didn't make him hear you.

542
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,819
Look, okay, you know what?

543
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,087
I do things the way I do things.
Okay? You and me? We're different.

544
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:46,164
No. We're not that different.
We're both trying to fit in.

545
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,324
The only difference is that
I'm doing it by being a man.

546
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,973
- Hey, Gallant. Stella's crashing.
- Come on, Stella.

547
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,109
- Watch it. Watch it.
- Help me get her up.

548
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,642
One, two, three.

549
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,836
- Stella, wake up.
- Gal looks a little white.

550
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,313
- Get a crash cart.
- Should I move her to a room?

551
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:07,942
- Get a cart. Start compressions.
- Come on, Stella. Wake up. Wake up.

552
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,146
- What was her diagnosis?
- Unstable angina.

553
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:13,520
- Shouldn't she have been on a monitor?
- Gallant, take the paddles.

554
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,854
Folks, back off. Watch
it. Pardon me. Excuse me.

555
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,497
- V-fib.
- Charging to 200. Clear.

556
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,101
- No change.
- Three hundred. Clear.

557
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,031
Jerry, page Kayson.

558
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,868
Okay, should we push epi?

559
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,242
- You really wanna do this here?
Carter! CARTER: Start a line.

560
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,977
All right. Yeah, let's
move her. Go, go, go.

561
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:39,516
Come on. Come on, we
gotta roll, man. Come on.

562
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:41,984
- Out of the way, everybody.
- Watch it. Watch it.

563
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,518
Lidocaine's onboard.

564
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,752
- Second bolus of 50 going in.
- Still V-fib.

565
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,395
- Three-sixty again.
- Charged.

566
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,894
Clear.

567
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,759
Resume compressions.

568
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,999
Hang a gram of Pronestyl?

569
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,106
- You should push it.
- He's right.

570
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,605
Decreased breath sounds.

571
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,243
- You put the tube in too far.
- Twenty-two centimeters.

572
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,050
- It's in the right stem.
- Must've put the balloon past the cords.

573
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,173
Pull it back to 20.

574
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,249
- That might pull it out.
- Just do it.

575
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,679
The girl that cried wolf.

576
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,910
- V-fib arrest.
- How long has she been down?

577
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,515
- Twelve minutes.
- Charge to 360.

578
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,969
- Charged and ready.
- Clear.

579
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,556
Dermabond looks good.

580
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,596
- That's nice.
- CT?

581
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,233
- Negative.
- Negative?

582
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,733
- Is that okay?
- You're fine, Thomas.

583
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,894
But we had to remove
Margaret's spleen.

584
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,199
She has some liver
damage. It caused bleeding.

585
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,866
And for a while, her blood
pressure was very low.

586
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,939
That's not good.

587
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,480
No. We had to put her on a
breathing machine, a ventilator.

588
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:47,585
- We're not sure when she'll come off it.
- Oh, dear.

589
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,320
Would you like to go and
see her? I can take you up.

590
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,582
See who?

591
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,959
- Margaret, your wife.
- My wife couldn't come today.

592
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:59,263
Yes, Thomas. She's upstairs.

593
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:02,094
- Margaret.
- Margaret? Margaret who?

594
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,596
Thomas, do you
remember why you're here?

595
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,503
I remember.

596
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,539
I remember everything.

597
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,241
Charge to 360. ABBY: Good to go.

598
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,906
Clear.

599
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,914
Asystole.

600
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,145
It's been 39 minutes.

601
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,651
Three-sixty again.

602
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,758
- Three-sixty!
- It's done.

603
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,760
Call it.

604
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,230
Time of death, 16:57.

605
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,670
Is there any family
we need to talk to?

606
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,176
Nobody.

607
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,778
She didn't have nobody.

608
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,174
A frequent flier with
atypical presentation.

609
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,648
Ninety-nine times out of 100,
nothing happens. You go with the odds.

610
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,081
If you like to gamble.

611
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,755
Sometimes there's nothing else you
can do. You'll learn that soon enough.

612
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:02,390
Progressive symptoms of dyspnea,
suggesting cardiac ischemia.

613
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,859
Gallant.

614
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,688
I let you miss the signs.

615
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,130
She was a batty,
self-medicating hypochondriac.

616
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,133
Who you did not
feel like dealing with.

617
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,635
Let it go now.

618
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,539
If she was admitted, we
could've picked up the V-tach.

619
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,267
We could have gotten her
back with early cardioversion.

620
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,412
If you felt strongly, you
should have spoken.

621
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,445
- He tried.
- Is anyone talking to you?

622
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:26,381
With all due respect, you're Chief of
Cardiology. He's a medical student.

623
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,111
Exactly. And I offered him
my expertise and guidance.

624
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,187
And where did it get me?

625
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,724
Where did it get her?

626
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,589
Nothing. She is dead.

627
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,263
Easy, son.

628
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,492
I am not your son.

629
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,895
Pratt, take him for a walk.

630
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,559
Come on, let's go. All right.

631
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,275
- Are you training doctors or pit bulls?
- He's upset we lost her.

632
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,343
You should have
put her on a monitor.

633
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,241
You should have
paid more attention.

634
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,882
Patient care is all about
taking calculated risks.

635
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,412
I thought it was taking
care of the patient.

636
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,582
Wow.

637
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,514
You know, it's really something, the
way you all stick together down here.

638
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,757
Mikey, listen. What you
did in there, that was a man.

639
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,192
That's what being a man is.

640
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:13,764
Come here. Listen to me.

641
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,992
- Guys. Come on, guys.
- Hey, calm down.

642
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,002
Do not call me Mikey.

643
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:34,250
- Lucky I know how to take a punch.
- So that's why you were on the floor.

644
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,648
Hey, how's that feel?

645
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,414
You should see the other guy.

646
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,423
- Maybe I should go talk to him.
- You might wait a bit on that.

647
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:44,085
Susan, can you get the nursing
schedules together for Abby to work on?

648
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,141
I was hall monitor
for a day in fifth

649
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,427
grade, fired for selling
passes to the kids.

650
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,092
- I'm sure you've matured since.
- Not that much, really.

651
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,932
It's my understanding the
position comes with a raise.

652
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,371
It's not the money. If it was about
money, why would I be working here?

653
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,011
The Director of Nursing
agrees with my recommendation.

654
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,272
The job is yours,
like it or not.

655
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,110
- Like it or not?
- I don't care to argue about it.

656
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,674
Okay, how much?

657
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,154
- Excuse me?
- How much is the raise?

658
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,446
I'll get back to you.

659
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,118
Kerry?

660
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,948
Romano sent this.

661
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,355
What did it say?

662
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,460
"Your 15 minutes is up."

663
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:39,245
Hey, Pratt wants you to hit him on the
other side of the face, even things out.

664
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,311
She had a daughter
who died in a car crash.

665
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,919
She's been alone since then.

666
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,722
You know, Kayson knows
what happened in here today.

667
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,330
He was right. I backed down.

668
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,762
That's not how I saw it.

669
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,028
No, I always back down.

670
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,032
We're supposed
to be saving lives.

671
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,539
And sometimes it just seems
like we end up fighting each other.

672
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,874
I mean, I should...

673
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,343
I should have fought for her.

674
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,582
I could have tried
harder with Kayson too.

675
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,282
She was my patient.

676
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,085
She trusted me.

677
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,352
She would be alive now if I
wasn't so scared of being wrong.

678
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:29,530
- Everybody gets scared.
- Not Pratt.

679
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,463
Sure he does.

680
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,297
Why do you think he
acts so cocky all the time?

681
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,405
Everybody that
comes in here does.

682
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,170
But you learn to
work through it.

683
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,247
When does that happen?

684
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,808
As soon as you've
killed a patient.

685
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,749
I just did.

686
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,818
No, you didn't.

687
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,060
Maybe you won't have to.

688
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,202
Don't stay in here for too long.

689
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:21,515
Marlene's ultrasound came back
positive for bilateral renal scarring.

690
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,745
- Are her kidneys shot?
- I don't know.

691
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,515
She definitely needs surgery.

692
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:29,024
All those UTIs in Milwaukee,
and no one ever caught it.

693
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,459
Yeah, somebody should have.

694
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,864
- VCUG first?
- Yeah. Start her on gentamicin.

695
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,930
And the moral
of the story is...?

696
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:40,834
Never sleep with
a patient's mother.

697
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,069
At least not until
the labs are back.

698
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,976
A little girl's sick. Next to
that, nothing much matters.

699
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,548
Yeah.

700
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,822
Janet, can I speak to you?

701
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,686
Chuny, can you mix
me a bag of gent?

702
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,830
- What room?
- I'll take it, get me started.

703
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,897
- All right.
- Thanks.

704
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,301
Hey.

705
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,765
- Hey.
- I thought you were on till 7.

706
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,342
Deb's covering the shift change.

707
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,671
I'll call you later.

708
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,578
Okay. Hey.

709
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,254
I'm not really sure what
we're not talking about.

710
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,016
- Can't this wait until we're off?
- Who's angry with who?

711
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,489
- I'm not angry.
- Okay. And I never lied to you.

712
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,561
Well, I guess I must have
talked myself into something.

713
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:38,958
Well, let's figure it out.

714
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,897
No. I agreed not to rescue
you, or help you, or fix you, so...

715
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:46,300
I'm just gonna shut up
and wait for the car wreck.

716
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,265
Wait. What is that
supposed to mean?

717
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,034
We both know
where this is going.

718
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,438
No, I don't.

719
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,072
You know, everything
would have been fine...

720
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,909
if you had just come
to me in the first place.

721
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,847
Then I'm the
overprotective boyfriend.

722
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,419
You know, I'm not
drinking to get drunk.

723
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,182
I'm hardly drinking at all.

724
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,957
- Good night.
- Okay, wait.

725
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:10,220
Do you wanna know how much I
drank? Last night, I had two beers.

726
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,193
Wednesday, I had a Cosmo.

727
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,763
Last week, I had nothing.

728
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:17,562
The week before that, I had a beer
and a pink drink. I don't know what it was.

729
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,433
- You're keeping close track.
- Because it's under control.

730
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,303
Well, I just don't understand
why you'd wanna go back to that.

731
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:27,776
- I drank last year. You knew that.
- It was a little different then.

732
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,973
Yeah. Now, it's not about
being scared and alone.

733
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:33,709
- It's still drinking.
- Look. Look, wait.

734
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,286
I used to drink because
I was miserable.

735
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,721
I was in a lousy marriage. I had a
life I didn't want. And now I'm happy.

736
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,726
With you, things are good.

737
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:48,056
Having a casual drink with my friends
makes me feel I'm past the bad part.

738
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,565
Okay.

739
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:55,105
You know, maybe... Maybe I just have
a little bit more faith in me than you do.

740
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,674
Is that how you translate
my concerns? No faith?

741
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,401
I don't know.

742
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,875
Yeah.

743
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,072
Carter?

744
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,684
Forget it. Let's not do this.

745
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:13,086
Look. I'm a pro at walking away.
I've done it one million times.

746
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:17,753
And I'm asking you, please, don't
do this. Stay here and talk to me.

747
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,592
Please. Please.

748
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:44,720
- What about the girl in 1?
- Alisha Murphy. She's off the vent.

749
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,722
- And the guy in 2?
- He's still puking up his shrimp platter.

750
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,290
A transplant would
only be a last resort.

751
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,632
I should... I should
call my husband.

752
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,229
There's a phone right here.

753
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,479
I'm sorry.

754
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,444
Could I have some
privacy, please?

755
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,218
Yeah. Sure.

756
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,420
Hello there.

757
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,083
If you wanna know what I want for
my last meal, the answer is pizza.

758
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,561
Well, your kidney is sick.

759
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,096
I'll give you medicine to
help stop the infection...

760
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:30,497
then the doctors are gonna figure
out what to do to make it better.

761
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,660
How did I get like this?

762
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,936
It's a genetic
condition, probably.

763
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,369
From my parents?

764
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,407
The combination of their DNA.

765
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,039
Maybe that's why.

766
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,578
They had a fight one
night, and my dad left.

767
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,513
They never told me
why. They just gave up.

768
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,244
I'm sure it seemed that way.

769
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,057
I think they made a mistake.

770
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,124
Maybe the reason I'm sick is so
I can bring them back together.

771
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,032
I'm gonna give you
some medicine...

772
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,135
in your vein.

773
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,796
It might sting a little bit.

774
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,532
I'm not scared.

775
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,644
I really think this
could fix everything.

776
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,611
Glad to see Romano hasn't
lost his sense of humor.

777
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,484
I've made Abby the
new nurse manager.

778
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:26,716
Yeah, I heard.

779
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,122
Let me know if
she's not satisfying...

780
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,889
- the responsibilities of the position.
- Okay.

781
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:38,128
I'd also like at least two MICNs and no
more than three LVNs on any given shift.

782
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,304
- Kerry, is everything okay?
- I made a small mistake on a TV program.

783
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,169
I wish everyone
would get over it.

784
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:47,540
That's not what I meant.
In the ladies' room?

785
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:50,271
Yeah?

786
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,915
You dropped a syringe.

787
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,884
What? No.

788
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,482
Kerry, I know what I saw.

789
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,493
I'm taking hormones.

790
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,860
- Good night.
- Good night.

791
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,332
- Pratt, Jing-Mei.
- Night.

792
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,769
Watch out for the
paparazzi, Dr. K.

793
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:20,608
Hey, Gallant. I understand you
were involved in an altercation today.

794
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,509
- Yes, ma'am.
- You hit another doctor?

795
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,616
Yeah. Dr. Pratt.

796
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:29,584
In that case, I'll overlook it.

797
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:34,784
- Good night, Dr. Chen.
- Take it easy, Iron Mike.

798
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,655
Hey. Gallant.

799
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:38,857
Hey.

800
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:43,467
- Hey, look, I'm sorry about Hernandez.
- You should have stayed out of it.

801
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,035
I respect you for going
from the gut, but for once...

802
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,173
I was the one thinking clearly.

803
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,637
So he went up to Psych?

804
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,333
I'll check on him
before I leave.

805
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,643
- How's your face?
- Don't even sweat it.

806
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,009
I know it wasn't me. You
were punching Kayson.

807
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,344
Actually, no. It was you.

808
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,820
Hey.

809
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,483
Next time I hit back.

810
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:07,920
Yeah.

811
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,152
Tell Leon I said hey.

812
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,156
All right.

813
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,064
Daddy's back and it's chow time.

814
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,665
Come on. Come on.

815
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,202
Come on. Come get some.

816
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,915
You should have
your keys already out.

817
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,923
You never know
who might be lurking.

818
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:54,565
Look, the drinking...

819
00:42:57,475 --> 00:43:00,536
The drinking is the drinking.
You know where I stand on that.

820
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,349
It's just, how far are we gonna go
if we keep hiding from each other?

821
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,756
I won't hide anymore.

822
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,304
I didn't mean to
leave like that.

823
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,302
It just seemed
kind of complicated.

824
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,380
And I wanted a little time...

825
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,578
to figure out... where we were.

826
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,658
Here we are.
