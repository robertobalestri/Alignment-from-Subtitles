1
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:16,180
Duroziez's sign is a murmur when the
stethoscope is over the femoral artery.

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,479
- What's another sign? No.
- Weak pulse.

3
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,417
- Poor cap refill?
- No.

4
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,719
Those are both signs of
shock. It begins with Q. Anyone?

5
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,055
- De Quervain's?
- No. That begins with a D.

6
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,857
However, there is a Q in
it, so you're getting warmer.

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,024
Does Quincke's
sign ring any bells?

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,996
And it manifests itself how?

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,002
With a visible...

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,367
P...
- Pulsation.
- Correct. Where?

11
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:48,872
On the n...
- Neck.
- Navel?

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,382
Nail bed.

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,947
Good night. Go home.
Rounds start at 7 a.m.

14
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,560
Be sure to read Sabiston's
chapter on the acute abdomen.

15
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,592
So much for the
future of medicine.

16
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,560
Jacy, be sure
to ring Mr. Ingles.

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,892
Remind him not to eat
anything after midnight.

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,729
I don't want to have to
reschedule his hernia yet again.

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,632
- Mm-hm.
- I'm going trick-or-treating.

20
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,635
- Oh, what's Ella this year?
- A cow.

21
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,308
- Wasn't she a cow last year?
- No, she was Dorothy.

22
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:20,914
I was the Cowardly Lion, and
Mark... Mark was the Scarecrow.

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,913
Right.

24
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,042
I get to be a farmer this year.

25
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,911
Happy Halloween.

26
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,920
- Dr. Corday.
- Yeah?

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,924
Your med student called. Nathan.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,256
The one who didn't
show up today?

29
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,058
- He said he'd be here in a few minutes.
- Too late.

30
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,894
Dr. Romano would like to
talk with you before you leave.

31
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:45,130
- Tell him you couldn't find me.
<i>- I heard that.</i>

32
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,671
Check this guy out.

33
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,640
What the hell are
you supposed to be?

34
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,579
- Want a candy, fellow? FRANK:
Put some meat on those bones.

35
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,920
Hi. I thought everyone
was dressing up.

36
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,851
We were supposed
to. There was a memo.

37
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,514
- I didn't bring anything to change into.
- Neither did I.

38
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,785
You're still a nurse.
You should've called.

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,156
Then I would be the
only one. I don't think so.

40
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,356
- Frank, where's your costume?
- I don't observe pagan holidays...

41
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,492
- that celebrate devil worship.
- Well, this is only for Satanists.

42
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,176
- What? Shut up.
- It's kind of working for you.

43
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,541
You give me an order I think is
wrong, I'm gonna ask you to clarify.

44
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,308
- Not in front of patients.
- I only questioned the dosage.

45
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,543
- You made mistakes in the past.
- I have not.

46
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,812
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, you got no guts.

47
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,615
- I'm not working with him.
- Why?

48
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,123
Because he treats nurses like idiots.
- If your boots fit...

49
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,693
- Shoes.
- Whatever.

50
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,657
You're wearing
that for your shift?

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,358
Yes. It's Halloween. You
know, Jerry sent out a memo.

52
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,026
- Ooh, naughty nurse.
- I'm not a naughty nurse.

53
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,139
- I like it.
- No, I'm a... It's an old-fashioned nurse.

54
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,868
- Looks naughty to me.
- So you're what, like, a <i>kurva</i> nurse?

55
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,672
- What's that?
- How do you say...?

56
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,508
- A slut? You know, like a tramp, whore.
- Yeah, I got it.

57
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:07,212
You know, maybe I should've worn
that schoolgirl outfit you bought me.

58
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,957
She's making a joke.

59
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,522
Cautery.

60
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,263
Robert, what are you doing?

61
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,330
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

62
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,592
But you can't be.

63
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,100
I had no choice. Poor
swine's full of stones.

64
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,865
Oh, for heaven's
sake. It's a pig.

65
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,031
I hope you're not
expecting me to scrub in.

66
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,700
No, giving my hand a
workout. It's been five months.

67
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,709
I gotta keep my
skills up. Stapler.

68
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,441
Even with one arm, I'm a better
surgeon than the hacks in this hospital.

69
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,882
Robert, you're not cleared to
do surgery, even on barn animals.

70
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,387
Were you aware that Weaver
put through a proposal to hire PAs...

71
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,527
to cover afternoon rounds
for post-call surgical residents?

72
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,127
Yes. It was a very good idea.

73
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,890
Not the point. The point is
nobody talked to me about it.

74
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,125
Last time I checked, I was head
of both surgery and this hospital.

75
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,270
The Residency
Review Committee...

76
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:00,066
Oh, sweet Mary and Joseph! Would
you look at the size of that gallbladder.

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,904
Jeez, you could feed a small Amish
family for a week with that thing.

78
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,878
I know Weaver's formed alliances with
the tribal elders while I was recuperating.

79
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,574
- I expected more loyalty from you.
- Robert...

80
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,585
Rewrite the proposal as if it
came from us. Keep me abreast...

81
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,194
of other covert
Weaver ops. Okay?

82
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,462
The last thing I need is Mata
Hari leading a palace coup.

83
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,787
- What the hell?
- He's extubated.

84
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:24,762
Get him back under. Hundred of Peridol.
Hold him down! Lizzie, hold him down!

85
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,799
- Bloody hell. ROMANO:
He's a pig. Grab a loin, Lizzie!

86
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:24,191
Flex. Flex. Keep going.
Ninety degrees. That's good.

87
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,418
Not my elbow I'm worried about.
What's going on down there? Brenda!

88
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,120
All right, the wrist.

89
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,833
Flex.

90
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,971
Keep going. A little bit more.

91
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,101
- Ten degrees.
- Wrong. Check it again.

92
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,747
Ten.

93
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,681
- It was 15 last week.
- Fluctuations are normal, Robert.

94
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,813
With this type of injury, you gotta
give yourself at least nine months.

95
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,126
How does this affect my odds?

96
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,626
- You've still got a long way to go.
- Yeah, I know. The odds.

97
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:07,632
For full flexion, extension and
opposition of the digits, 20 percent.

98
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,794
But even then, without radial
and ulnar deviation of the thumb...

99
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,202
I'm not sure you'll
be able to operate.

100
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,207
But you can still
be Chief of Staff.

101
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,578
Most of your job's
administrative anyway.

102
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,671
Thanks for the pep
talk there, Marty.

103
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,651
Excuse me. I'm
looking for Dr. Corday.

104
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,522
Yeah, aren't we all. Are
you a bill collector or a suitor?

105
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,993
- Med student.
- Must be a slow learner.

106
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,428
- Career change.
- Cowboy and fireman didn't work?

107
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,535
I'm supposed to start my
surgical rotation. I'm Paul Nathan.

108
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,864
Dr. Romano.

109
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,938
- What happened?
- Tennis elbow.

110
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,341
Fire at a Halloween
party. At least 30 victims.

111
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,775
Gave 10 of morphine IM.

112
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,007
- How you doing?
- Not good.

113
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,514
- What's your name?
- Amy.

114
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:58,947
Last name?

115
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,951
There was fire at
the party downstairs.

116
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,384
Your last name?

117
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,034
Anybody with her? EMT: Hard
to say. The building's burning.

118
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,028
- A lot of confusion. ABBY:
Soot in nostrils, intra-oral burns.

119
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,028
I need an intubation tray. Get
Corday on the crushed pelvis.

120
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,392
- Excuse me.
- Not now.

121
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,592
Ed Jemena, 35. Full-thickness
burns to the hands and forearms.

122
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,638
Guy was on fire. I tried to put him
out. I didn't have anything but my hands.

123
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,865
Luka, can you get this? - Yeah.

124
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,442
- What's open?
- Curtain 2.

125
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,374
- A trauma room.
- Lucky to get a bed.

126
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,036
- Okay, yes?
- Oh, Paul Nathan.

127
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,943
- Radiology?
- No. Um, surgery.

128
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,378
- Resident?
- Med student.

129
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,543
Good enough. Cellulitis to the
leg after a bug bite to the ankle.

130
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,383
- What do I do?
- Mark the leading edge with a marker.

131
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,892
Nice catch. Whoa,
we're full in here.

132
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,051
- What do you have?
- Doctor, excuse me...

133
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,287
You all need to stay
in your assigned spots.

134
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,729
If a doctor or nurse can't find
you, it'll delay your treatment.

135
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,302
Doctor, doctor, can you tell me
what's happened to my things?

136
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,803
- My apartment's on the fourth floor.
- I'll see.

137
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,135
- The fire was on two.
- Will they let us go home?

138
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,244
- Ask the fire department.
- How did it start? Was it a gas leak?

139
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,744
- I'm sorry, I don't know.
- Carter, we need you.

140
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:05,614
- Fruits upstairs were smoking dope.
- No one was smoking anything, all right?

141
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,455
- What's that for?
- To keep an eye on the infection.

142
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,957
- What are they giving him to stop it?
- Uh, excuse me. Unasyn.

143
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,154
- That'll get rid of the infection?
- It should. It's an antibiotic.

144
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,958
- Hey, you a doctor?
- Med student.

145
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,260
I need that Mayo stand.

146
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,701
Put it under his arm.

147
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,337
- Got this?
- I'm supposed to be...

148
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,440
Good. I need a cutdown tray.

149
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,303
What are you going to do?

150
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,305
- We're gonna make you better.
- Why can't I feel my hands?

151
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,847
Uh, the burns have
damaged your nerves.

152
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,984
Is it permanent?

153
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,513
I don't know.

154
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,314
- Where's Terry?
- Who's Terry?

155
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,287
My partner. He's
dressed like a jungle girl.

156
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,449
- Etomidate's on board.
- I need to see Terry.

157
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,562
Trauma panel, carboxyhemoglobin,
and ABG. Prime a line of ringers.

158
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,788
What is this?

159
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,559
Rubber mask melted to the face.

160
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,862
- I can barely open the mouth.
- Try fiberoptic. I got the subclavian.

161
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,337
- I thought you left, Lizzie.
- Supposed to be trick-or-treating.

162
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,341
- Little old, don't you think?
- Open a crike tray in case.

163
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,810
- Guide wire's passing well.
- Pre-load an 8-0 tube on a scope.

164
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,858
- Pulse ox down to 85.
- Fifteen blade.

165
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,976
Ten-cc syringe. Let's
check the balloon.

166
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,643
I need a different light source.

167
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,314
Don't open the tray unless
the intubation fails. Don't want...

168
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,988
Sorry. Sorry.

169
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,255
Got the line, run the
first liter wide open.

170
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,556
Robert, you okay?

171
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,166
- 0-silk, Neosporin, and OpSite.
- Robert?

172
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,331
I'm okay.

173
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,070
Keep bagging on 15
liters. Get sats above 90.

174
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,676
If you got this, Lizzie, I'm gonna
go check on the rest of the kids.

175
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,842
Take slow deep breaths.
- I'm trying.

176
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,005
Have you ever had asthma? - No.

177
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,283
- What's this?
- Smoke inhalation with wheezing.

178
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,852
- Decreased breath sounds?
- Possible pneumothorax.

179
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,512
May need a chest tube.

180
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,022
- Vitals?
- I've got it.

181
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:56,061
Yeah, I'm sure you do. Get a
chest x-ray and show it to me.

182
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,955
Digital escarotomy.

183
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,625
Yeah. He needs
the same on the left.

184
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,035
I agree.

185
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,273
How old do you think she is?

186
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,607
I don't know.

187
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,412
Young.

188
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:27,118
- Hey, Dr. Corday.
- Yeah? What have you got?

189
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,256
Urine's 60 an
hour. But it's bloody.

190
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,628
Eighty percent burns. She'll need
12 liters in the first eight hours.

191
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,793
Send out for CT abdomen and
pelvis. I still need to do an airway.

192
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,632
- Dr. Corday?
- Yes?

193
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,598
Oh, I'm Paul Nathan. I was supposed
to begin my surgical rotation today.

194
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,243
Yes, you were.

195
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,479
She's got a critical
patient next door.

196
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,948
- Where should I put these?
- Here. Put them there.

197
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,245
No free fluid.

198
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,911
- Liver and spleen look okay.
- Scope is prepped.

199
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,921
Standing by with a
number-five Shiley.

200
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,491
Rounds started at 7 a.m.

201
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,254
- No, I know. I was at my...
- Not interested in excuses, thanks.

202
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,108
- Get my letter?
- Let's take a look.

203
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,793
- Dr. Corday, your nanny's on the phone.
- For God's sake. Take a look around.

204
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,266
- Take a message.
- I did. She said to remind you...

205
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,463
- she has a flight to catch at 10:30.
- I can't leave now, can I?

206
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,109
- What do you want me to tell her?
- To bring Ella here.

207
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,835
Daycare's closed, you know.

208
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,776
I know. NURSE: Pulse ox, 81.

209
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,473
- He's throwing PVCs. Crike him.
- Anything I can do?

210
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,642
Yes. Be quiet.

211
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,450
Okay, bag him.

212
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,614
You wanna make up for it? Go
out there and work up some patients.

213
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,369
- Yeah, but...? CORDAY:
Wanna be a doctor?

214
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,793
- That's why you're here?
- Yes...

215
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,863
Grab a patient, do an H & P.
Present the case to an Attending.

216
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,659
I told Martin 100 times.

217
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,131
You need to put new
batteries in the smoke detector.

218
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:47,002
But, oh, no. God forbid he
should spend $3 on a 9-volt.

219
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,836
The whole building
could've burned down.

220
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,309
- Um, his x-rays are back.
- Oh, okay. Good.

221
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,914
- How's he doing?
- Better than most.

222
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,311
- Yeah.
- Okay. Next time I go hiking...

223
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,613
- I'm wearing long pants.
- And bug repellent.

224
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,648
Your infection's spreading.

225
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,759
- Uh, is everything okay?
- I'll be right back.

226
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,326
- Excuse me. You're a surgeon?
- That's the rumor.

227
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,365
- Think there's something you should see.
- You're a student.

228
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:16,663
- You haven't learned to think yet.
- I've got a rapidly spreading cellulitis.

229
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,265
- Excuse me. How rapid?
- Well, I just drew this 20 minutes ago.

230
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,673
And look. This looks like sub-Q
air consistent with neck fash.

231
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,211
Yeah, nice catch.
Let's roll. Get that side.

232
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,178
- We gotta move him upstairs.
- Upstairs?

233
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,630
- To Surgery. What's he on?
- Three grams of Unasyn.

234
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,220
Switch him to 6 million units
of pen G and 900 of clinda.

235
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,515
- Where's he going?
- Newbie caught a neck fash.

236
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,089
- What?
- What's that mean?

237
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,252
Your boyfriend may have necrotizing
fasciitis, a virulent skin infection.

238
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,921
- They gave him antibiotics to help.
- The infection's spreading fast.

239
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,397
Wait, what are you gonna do?

240
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,729
Take you to O.R. and
remove the infected tissue.

241
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,303
- What?
- Everybody off. Off the elevator.

242
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,566
Take the stairs next
time. You'll live longer.

243
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,740
If we don't stop this, it'll move
along and you'll develop...

244
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,744
an infection, which will
lower your blood pressure.

245
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,041
You could die.

246
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,381
Oh, my God.

247
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,889
- Think we caught that in time?
- I hope so. Thank you. I'm Susan Lewis.

248
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,493
Paul Nathan.

249
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,391
- You coming?
- In a minute, yeah.

250
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,072
You okay?

251
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,226
Yeah. It's just... It
takes me a moment...

252
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,735
to get going sometimes. Uh,
I have Parkinson's disease.

253
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,911
<i>- Get up here.</i>
- I'll be up in five minutes, Robert.

254
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,342
<i>Said that 10 minutes ago.</i>

255
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,678
- I'm with a critical patient.
<i>- Find somebody else now, Lizzie!</i>

256
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,012
Good ET placement.
No infiltrates.

257
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,054
Check ABG, repeat CBC
and work on a burn-unit bed.

258
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,485
- What about him?
- Who?

259
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,684
- Him.
- Yeah. What about him?

260
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,721
Pardon me.

261
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,968
I found your CPK,
lytes and UA results.

262
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,395
You headed up to
surgery on the neck fash?

263
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,540
Yes, as a matter of fact.

264
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:05,702
- Okay. Well, I guess we're done here.
- I am. You still owe eight hours.

265
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,881
- I'm on rounds at 6 a.m.
- Welcome to Surgery.

266
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,355
Excuse me. Uh, where can I find
somebody who was brought in?

267
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,050
Admit.

268
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,853
Come here. Follow me.
Who are you looking for?

269
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,124
Wynn Mathison. He's
in a tiger costume.

270
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,599
- There was a fire in our building.
- Could you direct me to the victims?

271
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,397
- Keep your habit on, man.
- Excuse me?

272
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,437
You'll soon see your
drag queen friends.

273
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,599
I have food and housing
vouchers for the displaced.

274
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,473
- Oh, I'm sorry, sister.
- Please tell me what room he's in.

275
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,774
- What?
- He's with the guy in the tiger mask.

276
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,882
Get some oil of wintergreen.

277
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,079
I hate the smell of rotting flesh,
especially when it's increasing.

278
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,917
Bacteria's moving
faster than you.

279
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,252
- Bovie.
- Systolic's down to 95.

280
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:56,260
Bolus 500. Lap pad.

281
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,823
Still not bleeding. Myonecrosis.

282
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,624
- It's in the muscle.
- Ten blade.

283
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,400
If it's vascularized, don't cut it.
- That's my plan.

284
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,770
Start there and carry the
incision four centimeters inferior.

285
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,431
- No. That's eight. Goddamn it!
- We need clean borders.

286
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,737
- Where the hell is Corday?
- In the scrub room.

287
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,904
If I don't remove tissue, the
infection could be left to smolder.

288
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,449
Get her. Maybe she can débride this
guy's wound without using a chain saw.

289
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,746
- Hey! CORDAY:
Kris, it's me. Elizabeth.

290
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,082
Don't come. I shouldn't
be longer than an hour.

291
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,953
- Dr. Corday, he's asking for you.
- Be right there.

292
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,627
Okay, but could you take Ella
to your house to finish packing?

293
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,990
Yeah, I could pick
you both up after work.

294
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,624
I could drive you to the airport,
save you the cost of cab fare. Yeah.

295
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,297
Okay. Thank you. Thank you
so much. Yeah. I'll see you soon.

296
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,499
Corazon, would you
mind taking the phone?

297
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,200
Not at all.

298
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,983
Damn.

299
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,348
Was that your wedding ring?

300
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,817
Yep. Yeah.

301
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,355
I can't see it. Can
you call Engineering?

302
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,016
They're closed till
morning. I'm sorry.

303
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:05,529
- No, it's not your fault.
- Don't hate me. He wants to talk.

304
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,827
<i>- Lizzie, get your ass in here.</i>
- I've lost my wedding ring.

305
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,129
<i>Oh, boohoo. This
guy's about to lose a leg.</i>

306
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,899
I'd say chop-chop, but that'd
be in extremely bad taste.

307
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,474
Call someone, get them
to tape this off for me...

308
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,976
- make sure no water's run down it.
- Sure.

309
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,911
<i>Would somebody please call
Tiffany's search-and-rescue team?</i>

310
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,311
I'm coming!

311
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,148
He's got 20 percent surface-area
burns, mainly upper body.

312
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,984
- Oh, God. PRATT:
Decent prognosis.

313
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,184
We provide ventilatory support
until lungs heal, then extubate him.

314
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,056
Might take a week, maybe less.

315
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,925
What...? What about his face?

316
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,192
He'll need skin grafts. There'll
definitely be some scarring.

317
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,707
Wynn? Wynn, it's me,
Terry. I'm right here.

318
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,208
He can't hear you. He's sedated.

319
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,784
You should have your eye looked at.
- Later, okay?

320
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,010
Can I touch him?

321
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,950
I wouldn't.

322
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,249
Yo, newbie. Come on.

323
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,961
Check jungle perv's eye with the
slit lamp. May have a corneal burn.

324
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,861
- Where's that?
- You still here?

325
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,367
Yeah. Uh, slit lamp. Where
is it? How does it work?

326
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,268
Exam 3. Try the on-off switch.

327
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,675
Hey, hey.

328
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,575
- You changed.
- I just put on scrub pants.

329
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:31,082
Oh, come on. You know, Carter, my
outfit is really starting to bug me too.

330
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,378
- We agreed to stay in costume all shift.
- I am.

331
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,613
No, you're not.
It's half a costume.

332
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,656
- It's 50 percent commitment.
- Are you serious or kidding?

333
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,589
- Do you know what I'm dealing with?
- Me too, in pumps.

334
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,286
- Wanna see the whole costume?
- No.

335
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,829
- That's all right. Forget it.
- I'm a skeleton. Look at me.

336
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,962
Carter really likes
Halloween, huh?

337
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,228
Perpetual erection.

338
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,430
Drank his daughter's mandrake
smoothie. Police found him chasing women.

339
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,075
- Where do you want him?
- In a cold shower.

340
00:17:56,242 --> 00:18:01,408
- Get a line in and push four of Ativan.
- Are you open, baby? Ha-ha-ha!

341
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,810
Perfect.

342
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,251
First-day labs, charcoal,
and a Foley for the tox screen.

343
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,912
Release me. I am
the Marquis de Sade.

344
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,354
How am I supposed to
pass a catheter through that?

345
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,289
- Inject phenylephrine.
- Into the shaft?

346
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,792
I'm Rod Stewart.

347
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,830
Won't hold still for a blood draw
much less let me touch his penis.

348
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,296
Oh, she can touch it.

349
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,266
Or wait for the
mandrake to metabolize.

350
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,267
Why not give him
Haldol? Make it easier.

351
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,769
Might make him worse.

352
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,267
- Hey, hey.
- Hey. He just grabbed my ass.

353
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,933
- I couldn't reach hers.
- I said four of Ativan.

354
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,045
Ask Abby. I'm done.

355
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,114
Okay. You could be a
little bit more sensitive.

356
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,774
To what?

357
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,784
Amazing how
quickly this spreads.

358
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,186
Any idea how he got it?

359
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,692
A cut, a scratch,
some other trivial injury.

360
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,389
Dopamine's at 10 mics.
- More suction.

361
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,199
Scalpel. ROMANO: Easy, Lizzie.

362
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,031
Is it just me or is this constant
commentary distracting?

363
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,366
- It's not you.
- Just remove the infected tissue.

364
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,804
Let antibiotics and
hyperbaric oxygen do the rest.

365
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,910
- You're not serious.
- Hell, yes. I am.

366
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,637
I'm in posterior compartment.
It's still necrotic soup.

367
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,510
Six hours in a chamber will
increase oxygen saturation...

368
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,311
create a bacteriocidal effect.

369
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,320
Give this guy a chance of a functioning
leg. You two have a problem with that?

370
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,322
How's a guy with Parkinson's
get into med school?

371
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,826
Probably some disability
quota they have to fill.

372
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,861
Med school? How's
he expect to practice?

373
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,490
- Don't want him taking out my appendix.
- He seems to have it under control.

374
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,160
It's a progressive disease.
What about in 10 years?

375
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,329
- Could be dead.
- Or wanna be.

376
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,998
Happy, Abby. Always
looking on the bright side.

377
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,609
I thought you were out sick.

378
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,245
I was until an apartment
fire set us back 30 patients.

379
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,348
Thirty-five, counting
bad popcorn balls.

380
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,539
Wonderful.

381
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,861
- Thanks for coming in.
- Shouldn't have answered.

382
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,363
- Want your messages?
- No. I want the air conditioning on.

383
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,515
- I'm sweating like a pig.
- It's freezing.

384
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,057
That's what you get bringing
Weaver in on Halloween.

385
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,922
- It's the biggest holiday for her kind.
- Lesbians?

386
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,462
Wiccans. Probably riding
that crutch like a broom.

387
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:01,863
Frank, all women get like that when
they're going through the change.

388
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,400
- Yeah, right.
- Pratt.

389
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,038
What? She's having
hot flashes. She's moody.

390
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,538
- That is so sexist. ABBY:
And stupid. She's too young.

391
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,234
- Early onset.
- You've got early onset.

392
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,073
Whatever you say, Nasty Ratched.

393
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:19,749
It's nurse, okay? Not nasty, not naughty,
not wet, certainly not had. Just nurse.

394
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:23,552
- Abby, you're gonna talk to Kovac, right?
- Yes.

395
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,749
County General on Bravo One.
- <i>Rescue One...</i>

396
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,087
Finished the slit lamp,
numbed him with Alcaine.

397
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,489
Who are you?

398
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,359
Meet Nathan, our
newest, oldest med student.

399
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:36,261
- I'm on surgical rotation with Dr. Corday.
- We have to clear Trauma.

400
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,599
- BOA with newborn hypoxia.
- She asked that I stay and assist in...

401
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,764
Good. Follow me.

402
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,772
Don't worry. She
doesn't bite. Much.

403
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:51,076
Simone Phillip, 42. Had a home
birth. Newborn in respiratory distress.

404
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,184
Did you have a
complicated labor?

405
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,978
No, it went well.
I didn't even tear.

406
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,419
One minute Apgar was
seven. But he had a little...

407
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,819
- Who are you?
- The midwife.

408
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,189
- What's wrong with him?
- We'll find out. Take him to Trauma 1.

409
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,953
- Where is that?
- I'll take him.

410
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,759
- No, I... It's okay.
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

411
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,033
- Simone, you've lost a lot of blood.
- Something's wrong with my baby.

412
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,035
Lily, stirrups. Gallant, labs.

413
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,539
- Maybe I should've had him in a hospital.
- You did everything right.

414
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:21,545
- CBC, PT, PTT, DIC screen for four units.
- We're taking care of your baby.

415
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,377
- Let's help you now.
- BP's 80/60.

416
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,815
- Squeeze in another two liters.
- What's happening?

417
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,716
Blood loss from a
retained placenta.

418
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,150
No, I mean with my baby.

419
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,291
Dr. Kovac is taking
care of your son.

420
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,452
I'm gonna pull gently on
the umbilical cord. Simone?

421
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,961
I need you to stay with me.

422
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,500
Pulse ox is 82. He's retracting.

423
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,037
Pedes intubation tray,
number three ET, uncuffed.

424
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,804
What do you hear?

425
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,701
Wet crackles throughout.

426
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,241
Fluid in the alveoli.
Okay, let's go look.

427
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,983
Unhook the bag from the mask.
You can bag the ET once I'm in.

428
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,885
- I've never done that.
- Squeeze the bag every two seconds...

429
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,992
just like he was doing.

430
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,058
Never pass the tube
till you see the cords.

431
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,862
Okay. I'm in.

432
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,507
Call for a Pedes vent. And
set me up for an umbilical line.

433
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,472
Relax, relax. The
hard part's over.

434
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,714
Good.

435
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,685
Notify the NICU team.

436
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:40,023
- What do I tell them's wrong?
- I have no idea.

437
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,057
It's no good. We're
into the cords.

438
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,288
Have to do an AKA.

439
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,007
Keep débriding.
We're not there yet.

440
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,863
We treat this conservatively
and it spreads...

441
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,434
then it's hip disarticulation
to stay ahead of bacteria.

442
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,902
- Worth the risk. CORDAY:
Of his being non-ambulatory?

443
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,405
Above-the-knee amputation,
he can use a prosthetic.

444
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,942
If it gets to his hip, it'll spread to
the abdominal wall. He'll get septic.

445
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,103
I'm trying to save this
man's leg. Dry the field.

446
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,579
- What about his life?
- He's young. Same thing.

447
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,513
Oh, come on, Robert.
Of course it's not.

448
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,313
Look. This Kelly slices
through sub-Q fat like butter.

449
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,616
Fine. Keep cutting until
you hit viable muscle.

450
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,387
It's above the distal third of
the thigh. It's a hopeless wound.

451
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,497
Fine, take it. CORDAY: Robert.

452
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,605
I said, take the leg.

453
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,037
Bovie, pickups.

454
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,652
Tommy, how are you feeling?

455
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,787
He seems... He seems
a lot better, thanks.

456
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,788
Good. Well...

457
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:50,896
just keep him on clear fluids tonight
and I'll have a nurse sign you out.

458
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,395
Okay.

459
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,912
What's wrong with him?

460
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:57,628
Shh. We'll, uh...
We'll talk about it later.

461
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:17,284
- How are you holding up?
- Good. I think the robot can go home.

462
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,789
- Okay. I'll get Carter to dispo him.
- Okay.

463
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:26,195
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

464
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,033
Uh, I like your outfit.

465
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,567
It's very retro.

466
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,735
Thank you.

467
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,769
Um, listen, if... If you
ever need anything, like a...

468
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,744
Like a straitjacket?

469
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,886
Is your dyskinesia
usually this bad?

470
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,250
I don't wanna freeze up on them
at work so I upped the medication.

471
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,826
And this is what you get.

472
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,027
At least it helps
to dispel the myth.

473
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,324
You know, we don't
all have rhythm.

474
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:08,704
If it happened to me, I'd probably jump
on a world cruise, not go to med school.

475
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,467
I already saw the world.

476
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,409
In fact, I was in Italy when I
first realized I had a problem.

477
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:19,210
Sipping wine in this café in Florence,
and I noticed my little finger shaking.

478
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:23,049
I just figured it was from
living on espresso and martinis.

479
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,884
When did you find out it wasn't?

480
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,926
Well, I used to hate doctors so it
took a while for me to check it out.

481
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:32,963
But once I did, it really
put things in perspective.

482
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,394
Yeah, I guess
being sick does that.

483
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,061
- Her baby's not doing well, huh?
- No.

484
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,675
- How are you doing, Simone?
- Good.

485
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,242
He seems better, huh?

486
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:48,313
Maintenance fluids are at
five cc's per kilo per hour.

487
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,611
My mother had me at home. I
thought it would be good for him.

488
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,817
Uh, his tests came back.

489
00:25:55,988 --> 00:26:00,688
I'm afraid your baby has
a disease called sialidosis.

490
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,759
What's that?

491
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,432
His body lacks an enzyme that breaks
down the waste proteins inside the cells.

492
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:19,169
And there is already extensive damage
to the liver, bones and nervous system.

493
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:30,954
I've been staring at him
for over an hour now.

494
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:36,289
And I still can't figure
out what I wanna call him.

495
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,961
Would you excuse us, please?

496
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,462
Yeah. Sure.

497
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:59,483
Children with sialidosis are
mentally retarded, often blind.

498
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,485
He'll never speak or walk.

499
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,681
His life expectancy
is less than two years.

500
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,529
Dr. Kovac, NICU is on line one.

501
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:13,063
Thanks.

502
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,167
Excuse me.

503
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,876
Is there anyone
you'd like me to call?

504
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,719
No.

505
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,917
There's just us.

506
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,297
I don't think it'll be
necessary. Thank you.

507
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,761
- You having a bad night?
- No worse than usual.

508
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,872
That was a little
bit insensitive.

509
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,474
I had to tell a mother
her baby was gonna die.

510
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,703
- I didn't need an audience? Okay?
- Okay.

511
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,041
I'm starting to get some
complaints about you.

512
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,650
- From patients?
- Nurses.

513
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:09,312
Don't look so
concerned about it.

514
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,117
First you accused Chuny of being an
idiot. When she's sexually harassed...

515
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,887
- you practically laughed.
- The guy grabbed her butt.

516
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,724
- Yeah, that's sexual harassment.
- Come on. You were there.

517
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,457
The guy's intoxicated with
mandrake. He's harmless.

518
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,568
- This one's all yours.
- What patient?

519
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,170
Mr. Hard-On. Checking his
vitals and he grabbed my boob.

520
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,569
- What's his status?
- Gonna die if he tries again.

521
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,969
- That's his status.
- See?

522
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,134
Every time there's a
problem, she complains.

523
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,075
Everyone complains.
It's part of the job.

524
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:37,239
Yes. And it's part of my job as
nurse manager to counsel you.

525
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,611
What?

526
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,083
You can give nurses
orders, but cannot critique.

527
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,916
If you have a problem
with a nurse, come to me.

528
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,082
Okay. What about you? Who do I
complain to if I have a problem...?

529
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,252
Here's an idea. Maybe you
should try fighting for the nurses...

530
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,831
- instead of fighting with them.
- Maybe you should sew swastikas...

531
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,436
on that costume. You could
be a naughty Nazi nurse, huh?

532
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:04,003
- You totally suck, you know that?
- Creating a hostile work environment.

533
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,202
- Where's Dr. Kovac?
- I don't know. Page him.

534
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,779
The baby with
sialidosis is febrile to 102.

535
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:12,509
- Chuny, where's Kovac?
- Don't know, don't care.

536
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,347
- Feels like he's on fire.
- Why hasn't he gone to the NICU?

537
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,149
- You'd have to ask Dr. Kovac.
- Can you do something?

538
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,792
He needs to be pan-cultured.
How much does he weigh?

539
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:24,555
- Three kilos.
- A hundred and fifty milligrams IV...

540
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,134
piggyback of Cefotaxime and
amp. Set up for a spinal tap.

541
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,298
- He has sialidosis.
- Yeah. And he also has an infection.

542
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,666
Sixty mgs of Tylenol.

543
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,003
I'll arrange for your baby to
be sent up to the neonatal unit.

544
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,906
- We'll do everything we can for you.
- Thank you.

545
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,648
Why are you still here?

546
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,322
Uh, my piano
recital was canceled.

547
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:57,156
Hey, it's me, Elizabeth. I'm on my
way home now. See you soon. Bye.

548
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,768
We did the right thing.

549
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,336
You trying to
convince me or you?

550
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,903
I went through a
period of adjustment...

551
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,035
when I became a mother,
every time I treated a child.

552
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,440
You get over it.

553
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,582
Oh, please spare me the
$2 psychoanalysis, Lizzie.

554
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,219
- Fine.
- Hey, look, look.

555
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:29,588
I know most people don't like me. I
don't care. I don't like most people.

556
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,356
But I'm good at what I do.

557
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:40,671
I save people's lives every day.

558
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,309
People who no one else can help.

559
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,043
If I can't do that...

560
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,130
Robert...

561
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,303
I know you're frustrated.

562
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:20,941
You're an excellent surgeon, and you
will be again. I promise you. You will be.

563
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,655
- I'm being paged.
- Elizabeth.

564
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,252
Uh, I'm being paged.

565
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,262
Elizabeth. CORDAY:
I just tried calling you.

566
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,965
I'm sorry. I have to
leave for the airport now.

567
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,270
- What about the later flight?
- This is it.

568
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,312
I threw her pajamas, some
crackers, a couple toys in here...

569
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,779
in case she had to stay
for a while. I'm sorry.

570
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,214
No. It's all right. It's my
fault. We got slammed.

571
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,944
I'll see you Monday morning.

572
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,487
- Yeah, yeah. Have a safe flight.
- Okay. Bye, Ella.

573
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,818
Hey, did Kris take
you trick-or-treating?

574
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,628
- What is it?
- Dropped her pressure to 60 palp.

575
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,858
Dopamine is up. We got two
liters. I'm working on an art line.

576
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,003
- Any word from her family?
- No. We don't have her last name.

577
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,139
- Lily, could you?
- Oh, sure.

578
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,035
- There, it's okay.
- Hello, little cow...

579
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:25,143
- girl.
- I'll be with you soon, all right?

580
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,740
- Could it be hemorrhagic?
- The CT was negative.

581
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,643
I'm thinking hypoxia.

582
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,375
If we don't find her family,
they'll be ID'ing the body.

583
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,679
Pulse ox is only
82 on 100 percent.

584
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:38,017
She needs suctioning, Abby. Set up
ultrasound. She may have blown a clot.

585
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,386
I don't know. Second
crit was only 32.

586
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,824
- What happened to Mom?
- In the washroom.

587
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:46,158
- Where are the suction catheters?
- Try the cabinet.

588
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,165
- What are you doing?
- Weaver ordered antibiotics.

589
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,600
- No. Who did the LP?
- She wanted a full septic workup.

590
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,501
- This is my patient. NATHAN:
The baby spiked a fever.

591
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,166
This baby is in a
chronic vegetative state.

592
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,710
You're prolonging his
and the mother's suffering.

593
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,348
- We treat kids like this.
- You should've asked me.

594
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:04,542
We couldn't find you.

595
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,576
I told you to leave.
This isn't your case.

596
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,344
Luka. CORDAY: Abby?

597
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,751
Check with me before you
push meds on my patient.

598
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,255
- I have to do a cutdown here.
- Morison's pouch looks dry.

599
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,793
It could be retroperitoneal.
What the hell was all that about?

600
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,864
- You want PEEP on the vent?
- Not until we get her pressure up.

601
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,694
Nathan, why do you
think she's hypotensive?

602
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,769
- Blood loss? CARTER:
Not in this case.

603
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,701
Hypoxia can cause
myocardial dysfunction.

604
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,466
I'm filing a grievance
against him.

605
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,270
Not now, Chuny. IV's
dry. She needs a fresh one.

606
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,809
- I'll get it. HALEH: Panic
value. Potassium is 8.2.

607
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:39,748
Damn. Rhabdo from the crush
injury. Ten cc's of calcium gluconate.

608
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,580
PVCs. CARTER: Let's push bicarb.

609
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,915
Ten units of regular
insulin and an amp of D50.

610
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:47,856
Get me Kayexalate and call
Renal. She may need dialysis.

611
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,896
- What the hell are you doing?
- Uh. I accidentally...

612
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,463
It's okay.

613
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,128
Go see if Frank's
found the girl's family.

614
00:33:56,152 --> 00:33:57,152
I'll start another.

615
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,295
- Transducer ready?
- Where's the saline?

616
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,997
I said, go find the girl's family.
- Run of five.

617
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,733
- Hundred of lidocaine. Prep the groin.
- Pressure falling, 79.

618
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,243
Pressure's down to 50.

619
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,281
- Being a little hard on him, you think?
- V-tach. Charge to 200.

620
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,817
- What are you talking about?
- He's doing a good job, considering.

621
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,615
- Considering what?
- He has Parkinson's.

622
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,382
Excuse me?

623
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:23,990
Clear.

624
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,955
Still V-tach.

625
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:31,126
- Procainamide's onboard.
- Stand by with amiodarone. Clear.

626
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,798
- No change.
- How long?

627
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,342
- How long?
- Uh, twelve minutes.

628
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,377
Clear.

629
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,144
- Sinus tach.
- All right.

630
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,946
Way to go.

631
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,250
- Good femoral pulse.
- Set up a Pronestyl drip then a repeat K.

632
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,325
Labs on your baby.

633
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,688
- Thank you.
- Glad to see you two have made up.

634
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:03,096
Hey, I'm being professional
and she's the one having trouble.

635
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,432
- I warned her.
- Warned her about what?

636
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:08,667
Nothing.

637
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,436
Oh, my God.

638
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:16,113
- You're such a jerk.
- What?

639
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,341
You slept with her?

640
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,679
That's what this is all
about. What's your problem?

641
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,047
- Hey, one time.
- One time. One time with Chuny.

642
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,350
One time with a patient's
mother in Radiology.

643
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,686
Hey, you never complained.

644
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:33,063
I never let it affect my work.
You two need to figure this out.

645
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,824
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Tell her you're sorry.

646
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,971
- Tell her it was wrong. Just fix it.
- I'm not gonna kiss her ass.

647
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,571
That's how this problem started.

648
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,541
- Have them check a gas on 50 percent.
- I'm gonna wait right here for you.

649
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,837
Don't worry about anything.

650
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,079
I love you.

651
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,378
I should've told them
I was his brother.

652
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,884
ICU has strict rules.

653
00:35:56,221 --> 00:36:00,386
He'll need round-the-clock attention
tonight, but his lungs are rebounding.

654
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:06,031
You know what? You should go home.
They'll let you see him in the morning.

655
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,597
Home?

656
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,495
Our whole lives were
in that apartment.

657
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,594
This dress is all I have.

658
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,372
I've been watching
his heart rate.

659
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:28,611
It goes down when I touch
him, when he knows I'm here.

660
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:35,022
- Has his fever gone down?
- A little.

661
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,088
I waited so long for him.

662
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,693
Five years.

663
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,928
Two miscarriages, in vitro.

664
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:51,441
I lost two boyfriends because I
was so determined to have a child.

665
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,942
I was about to give up.

666
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,714
And then suddenly...

667
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,516
he was here.

668
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,586
- He's here.
- We'll keep treating the infection...

669
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,451
but he will start going
into organ failure soon.

670
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,320
His systems will shut down.

671
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,132
You're so beautiful.

672
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,131
You're my baby.

673
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,398
His heart could stop beating.

674
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,043
I need to know what you wanna
do if something like that happens.

675
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,039
I don't know.

676
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:35,319
To keep him alive, I may have to
open his chest, maybe even shock him.

677
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:40,314
And I'm not sure you want
me to do something like that.

678
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,923
No.

679
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,056
I don't know.

680
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,659
I don't know.

681
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,802
Tell the unit I
flushed the Quinton.

682
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,634
He's tenacious.
Gotta give him that.

683
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,207
I wish he'd told me.

684
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,469
Not an easy thing to lead with.

685
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,148
There's Mommy.

686
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,012
There's Mommy.

687
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,853
Hi, Lily had to run
Wynn's ABG up to the lab.

688
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,150
- Thank you.
- Did you reverse her hyperkalemia?

689
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,453
Yeah. Enough to get her to dialysis.
She still has the burns, though.

690
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,290
- Yeah. But you got her back.
- May I?

691
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,694
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hey.

692
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,798
Thank you. So did
we reach the parents?

693
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,234
No. The girl was actually
babysitting. It wasn't even her building.

694
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,536
You might've told me sooner, saved
me embarrassment about your condition.

695
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,175
Well, I certainly didn't
mean to embarrass you.

696
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,211
- How long has it been?
- Eight years.

697
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,213
I was misdiagnosed
for the first two.

698
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:42,650
- And you were late today because?
- My neurologist wanted an MRI.

699
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,680
I'm sorry.

700
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,025
I wouldn't have made you stay.

701
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,227
What the hell? Fresh start.

702
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:55,697
Try to make as many rounds as you
can, complete the required reading...

703
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,199
take the exam.

704
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,998
I've been reading and taking tests for
two years. This is my hands-on training.

705
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,232
- It's a surgical rotation.
- I understand that.

706
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,343
Probably the most
physically demanding...

707
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,072
emotionally exhausting,
stressful six weeks...

708
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,375
any would-be physician
ever experiences.

709
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,075
Part of becoming a doctor.

710
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:17,654
I'm offering you a pass, Mr. Nathan.
Trust me. You should take it.

711
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,752
I'm here to treat patients.

712
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,392
You have a degenerative disease.

713
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,586
I know what I have. It
doesn't mean I need a pass.

714
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,756
ER.

715
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,426
I don't want special treatment. I
just want to learn like other students.

716
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,204
- Yeah, she's here.
- You're not like other students.

717
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,739
No, I'm older and smarter.

718
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,275
Okay. Dr. Corday,
burn unit needs you.

719
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:43,609
- I'm on my way up, Frank.
- It's your melted-mask guy.

720
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,278
Okay. Be right there.

721
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:51,446
- She's on her way.
- Look, go home, think about it...

722
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,092
report back day after
tomorrow. Use the rest.

723
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:57,286
- I'm fine.
- It's just not very practical.

724
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,122
Okay, let's go.

725
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:10,131
- Dr. Weaver?
- What?

726
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,301
- What time is it?
- Are you okay?

727
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,776
Yeah. Yeah, I was...

728
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,916
- I was gonna lay down for a second.
- Can you pronounce a patient?

729
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,347
Did we ever hear
back from the NICU?

730
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,120
- Uh, no. There was no need.
- Oh, come on. It's been three hours.

731
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,155
We can't board their patients.

732
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,919
They have to call in a nurse
from home. If they won't...

733
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,257
- I'll speak to their medical director.
- Dr. Weaver...

734
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,828
Cardiac arrest a half-hour ago.

735
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,335
Excuse us.

736
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:44,268
You should've come to get me.
How long did Dr. Kovac work on him?

737
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,001
He didn't. She signed a DNR.

738
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,440
Where is he?

739
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,841
- Who?
- Kovac.

740
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,675
He's home. His
shift ended at 10.

741
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,976
All right, I'm gonna
move her to a quiet room.

742
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:56,280
Call the social worker and get
her referrals for grief counseling.

743
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,389
Are you leaving soon?

744
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,321
I'm just finishing
up with Woody here.

745
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,961
You're the most beautiful
nurse in this hospital.

746
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,121
- Well, thank you.
- You've got class.

747
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,191
- May I play with your breasts?
- Hey.

748
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:12,234
Excuse me? WOODY: Please.

749
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,838
Last request of a
man on his deathbed.

750
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,736
You're not dying,
Woody. You're drunk.

751
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,878
I wanna go to heaven on the
bosom of a beautiful woman.

752
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,707
I don't think your
HMO covers that.

753
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:24,849
How long you have that outfit?

754
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,884
- Tomorrow at noon. Why?
- Maybe I could talk you into...

755
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,886
- giving me a sponge bath.
- What's in it for me, bony boy?

756
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,388
I'll give you a bone,
nasty, naughty little nurse.

757
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,054
Elizabeth.

758
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:40,230
Uh, Robert, can we talk
tomorrow? I have to get Ella home.

759
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,890
I thought you might
want this before you left.

760
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,062
It's my ring.

761
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,834
Amazing what you can do with a
laparoscopic camera and a snare.

762
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,739
Thank you.

763
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,608
- Uh, look, about today...
- Uh, let's not.

764
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:03,948
It was a momentary weakness
on my part. It won't happen again.

765
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,084
You'll work
through this, Robert.

766
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,752
Of course I will.

767
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,522
- Good night.
- Night.

768
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:36,341
The patient has gastroenteritis,
vomits to excess...

769
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:41,009
has hematemesis, no history
of PUD. What are you thinking?

770
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,019
Well?

771
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,656
Mallory-Weiss tear.

772
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,626
Laceration of the distal esophagus
results in an upper GI bleed.

773
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,191
You're both correct and tardy.

774
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:57,197
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Be punctual.

775
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,803
What if that patient vomits
and develops chest pain?

776
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,030
Boerhaave's syndrome.

777
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,539
Spontaneous rupture of the
esophagus associated with retching.

778
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,701
Usually tears into
the left pleural space...
