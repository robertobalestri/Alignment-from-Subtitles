1
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,118
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.

2
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,965
English?

3
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,334
Long journey.

4
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,169
Yeah, I started
yesterday, ahem. Chicago.

5
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,606
Chicago. Michael Jordan, right?

6
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:49,180
Yeah. You going to
the Congo on business?

7
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,911
I'm a doctor.

8
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,649
Where will you
stay in the capital?

9
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,883
Not staying in Kinshasa.

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,153
Going on to Kisangani.

11
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,490
Kisangani. It's in the east.

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,329
A doctor in Kisangani.

13
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,732
You will be busy.

14
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,437
Very busy.

15
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,577
Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,838
Taxi for Mr. Fitzgerald.

17
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,345
Dr. Carter?

18
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,416
Mr. Joseph Solomon.
- Dr. Carter?

19
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,177
Dr. Carter.

20
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,684
Dr. Carter. CARTER: Hi. John.

21
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,385
Charles Baruani. You
doing good, Dr. John?

22
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,930
- I could use a shower.
- Next plane is only three hours.

23
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,534
Not so much nice as last one.

24
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,964
Many amputees.

25
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,041
- Landmines.
- Machetes.

26
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,770
Is Dr. Kovac still here?

27
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,352
Uh, he's tall. Croatian.

28
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,217
- Lots of black hair.
- Ah, Luka. No.

29
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,984
All the ladies like
Luka very much.

30
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,024
He's still at the
clinic in Matenda.

31
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,563
Very dangerous place.
The Mai Mai fight there.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,593
<i>So...</i> ...we get mostly trauma...

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,899
- disease, malnutrition?
- Yes.

34
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,899
Any one thing
more than the other?

35
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,704
Depends.

36
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,042
- On what?
- The day.

37
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,611
Welcome to Kisangani, doctor.

38
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,266
You must be Dr. Carter.

39
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:33,031
Angelique Chada. I was coming to
wake you. I'm the on-site NGO physician.

40
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,868
You're a medium?

41
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,037
- You volunteered for an NGO before?
- Um...

42
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,341
- No. Is Dr. Kovac here?
- Still in Matenda.

43
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:46,009
Charles tells me you don't speak
French, so I'll get someone to translate.

44
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,848
- Need a coffee?
- Yeah.

45
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,891
Now, it's pretty simple here.

46
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,086
Fever and a cough is
pneumonia. Use cotrimoxazole.

47
00:04:56,263 --> 00:05:00,860
Fever and watery diarrhea is
cholera. Rehydrate and use doxy.

48
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,868
If the patient has a fever
without sores, assume malaria...

49
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,403
and treat it with Fansidar.

50
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,905
If they have recurrent infections
and are wasting away, it's AIDS.

51
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,239
- So prepare the family for death.
- What drugs do you have on hand?

52
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,075
Amoxicillin,
doxycycline, Fansidar...

53
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,741
- metronidazole, chloramphenicol.
- You still use chloramphenicol?

54
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,388
- It's cheap.
- What about the aplastic anemia?

55
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,423
Seventy-five percent of the
children don't make it to age 2.

56
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,617
Aplastic anemia's the
least of their worries.

57
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,922
For IV antibiotics, we have
amp, gent and penicillin.

58
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,429
- Cefoxitin, unasyn, Cipro?
- No.

59
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,932
- What do you do for resistant bugs?
- Pray.

60
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,765
Take your meds, you should be
okay. If you get a fever, take Fansidar.

61
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,907
Gillian?

62
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,833
Gillian Ronin, meet Dr. Carter.

63
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,777
John. Hi.

64
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,655
Gillian's an old hand.
She'll start you in Admitting.

65
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,601
- She seems great.
- She is.

66
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,604
- Where's she from?
- Bombay, I think. Been here six years.

67
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,470
- How many doctors are there?
- Counting you, four.

68
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,272
Peter's our Congolese
internist. Deni is from Paris.

69
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,847
Angelique is our surgeon.
You already met Charles.

70
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,813
He handles logistic
and supplies.

71
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,318
We have 200 patients on six
wards and two surgical suites.

72
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,227
- How many nurses?
- Uh, five.

73
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,551
But the patient's family
members do most of the work.

74
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,954
- Hmm.
- What?

75
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,824
Nurses back home always complain about
patient loads. It's usually about eight.

76
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:40,832
Yeah, but I wouldn't use the conditions
here as a positive example of anything.

77
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,028
- What ward is this?
- This? This is Admitting.

78
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,014
Temp's 104.

79
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,250
Mom says she's got a headache.
No diarrhea or coughing.

80
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,581
Yeah. She's a
little jaundiced too.

81
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,223
Malaria it is. GILLIAN: Mm-hm.

82
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,052
So Fansidar?

83
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,883
Yeah, two tablets.

84
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,627
This is gonna fix you right up.

85
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,209
- She doesn't get a bed?
- For simple malaria, no.

86
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,591
Trouble with urination, fever
and a cough. His name's Saidi.

87
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:41,717
He's about 60 years too
young for an enlarged prostate.

88
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,528
- Bladder's huge.
- Yeah.

89
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,896
- Foley?
- No, manual compression.

90
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,068
Mild fever, 101.5.

91
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,866
Any, uh, urinary-tract
infections that local kids get?

92
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,565
No.

93
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,691
Okay, tripod sign.

94
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,326
Okay.

95
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,231
Okay.

96
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,171
Okay.

97
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,777
Bladder paresis, tripod
and head-drop signs.

98
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,948
- I'm sorry?
- Poliomyelitis.

99
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,349
Without a spinal tap, we use
the tripod and head-drop sign...

100
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,182
as diagnostic tools.

101
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,290
- He has polio?
- Yes.

102
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,502
How's the jet lag?

103
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,334
It's terrible.

104
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,041
- That all you're having?
- Ha.

105
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,702
I've had the food before.

106
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,011
Yeah, it lacks a
little something.

107
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,844
Taste.

108
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,011
Anyway, I'm on a liquid diet
consumed entirely after dark.

109
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,657
Where are you from?
Your English is excellent.

110
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,990
MontrÃ©al. We speak a
little English up there.

111
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,389
How long have you been here?

112
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,567
Ten days.

113
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,529
I'm a volunteer like you.

114
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,032
Come back for a
month every year.

115
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,334
My penance, I suppose.

116
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,178
Penance for what?

117
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,941
My wanton ways
back in the world.

118
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,887
Hello.

119
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,248
Am I interrupting, or
can anyone drop in?

120
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,825
You're not interrupting
anything yet.

121
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,938
You two do know that
I'm sitting right here, right?

122
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,405
She asked how you're
doing, and I said great.

123
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,704
And that you'll be just fine
on your own this afternoon.

124
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,781
- So where are you from?
- Uh, Chicago.

125
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,750
I work with Dr. Kovac. He called
me when you got short-handed.

126
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,911
And I'd been thinking
about volunteering.

127
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,913
Luka?

128
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,058
What's he like at home?

129
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,892
- Um...
- I should get back to work.

130
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,567
Luka...

131
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:20,112
took an immunization team
out to Matenda three days ago.

132
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,678
We don't get vaccines often. When
we do, refrigeration is a challenge.

133
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,408
So he grabbed a team and went.

134
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,951
When do you expect him back?

135
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,679
Yesterday.

136
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,113
It happens.

137
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,528
He's had fever for a week.

138
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,167
Rhonchi and retractions.

139
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:54,840
Tell her that he has pneumonia and
that we'll make him better. IV ampicillin.

140
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,156
You're welcome.

141
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,525
Hi. Who's sick? You or...?

142
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,508
- Basinake.
- Yes, doctor.

143
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,316
This woman is dead.

144
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,981
I know.

145
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,322
She has been very ill.

146
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,724
Why didn't you tell us she
was so sick when you came in?

147
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,696
She has had AIDS
for many months.

148
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,231
I did not know where else to go.

149
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,232
How is Fazila today?

150
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,674
She's in pain, doctor.

151
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:34,445
Oh. Tell her that I'm
sorry that it's so painful...

152
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,675
but I need her to be brave
like I know that she is.

153
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,653
Okay.

154
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,458
<i>Bonjour</i>, Ntam.

155
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,697
Oh, great.

156
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,042
Power out everywhere?

157
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,010
There's only one line from
the turbine in the river to town.

158
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,276
Mai Mai cut it every
couple of weeks.

159
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,350
- How are you finding it here?
- Busy.

160
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,014
No insurance forms, no
triple-charting. I love that.

161
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,956
No healthcare system.

162
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,054
I wouldn't mind filling out
a few insurance forms...

163
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,994
if it meant I could
have an ultrasound.

164
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,500
Charles!

165
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:40,302
Boy up front has a gunshot
wound to the left upper quadrant.

166
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,349
This one is a machete wound to
the right thigh. Lots of blood loss.

167
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,315
Charles, start the generator!

168
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,822
Where are Peter and Deni?

169
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,720
Send someone to find them.
Small-caliber wound to the belly.

170
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,329
- Pulse is 120. BP, 80/60.
- This water's cold.

171
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,556
You want to wait for
someone to boil it?

172
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,166
Luka, take the hack
wound. I'll explore the neck.

173
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,998
Dr. Carter, see if you can discover
what's wrong with this last one.

174
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,197
Where are the gloves?
- In the basin.

175
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,932
Right over there.

176
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,915
Got a weak carotid,
and he's tachy.

177
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,351
- How do you stabilize the neck?
- Sandbags.

178
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,215
- Who's he?
- Says that he's the brother.

179
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,087
He wouldn't let us
leave without him.

180
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,526
- Give me a 7.5 ET tube.
- We don't have ET tubes. I can bag him.

181
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,597
Great. Ask him what happened.

182
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,631
I don't see any blood.

183
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,532
He's bleeding somewhere.
Belly's hard. Is he Mai Mai?

184
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,298
- Yeah.
- I got a foreign body under the skin.

185
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,136
He says a bee flew into
his brother. His brother fell.

186
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,437
Femur deformity,
closed fracture.

187
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,477
- What?
- A bee flew into him.

188
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,971
A bee?

189
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,578
Entrance wound to the right
axilla. Bag him on 15 liters.

190
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,883
Make it two liters, or
we'll run out of oxygen.

191
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,727
- GSW to right axilla, bullet in the thigh.
- An hour isn't enough time.

192
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,957
Unplug every light. How
much time will that get us?

193
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,829
Four hours, maybe.

194
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,266
BP's 90/60. Pulse
130. Pulseless foot.

195
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,235
Get his pressure
up with two liters.

196
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,932
Got a transthoracic GSW.
Bullet entered the armpit...

197
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,078
dropped a lung, traversed the
belly, ended up in the thigh...

198
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,770
and broke the femur.

199
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,917
- Abdomen's stiff. Betadine.
- Gonna need a chest tube, maybe two.

200
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,348
Got peritoneal signs.

201
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,783
Positive DPL.
Where's the bullet?

202
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,983
Left anterior thigh. You don't
need a DPL. He meets criteria.

203
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,128
- He needs an e-lap.
- Knife.

204
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,294
He's Red Cross category four.
Waste of resources. Hand me that.

205
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,476
There. Least of his
problems are solved.

206
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,844
Full-jacketed 7.62 mm with full
rifling grooves. A Dragunov rifle.

207
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,980
His pressure's holding.

208
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,815
Dragunov's muzzle velocity
is 830 meters per second.

209
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:07,154
It can kill from over half a mile away.
Closer, it does more internal damage.

210
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,352
So we're just gonna let him die?

211
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,688
If I take him, he'll need
five hours to stabilize.

212
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,733
He'll probably die anyway. I
have four hours of generator fuel...

213
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,031
and three injured boys I can't
fix before the power goes out.

214
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:24,041
Keep him stabilized. If the lights are
still on when I'm finished, I'll come back.

215
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,557
Have you ever done an
end-to-end anastomosis?

216
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,751
No.

217
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,263
Well, now is as good a time as any
to train you as a vascular surgeon.

218
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,560
Anchor with an overhand
hitch, give gentle traction.

219
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,727
- How much longer?
- Unh, I don't know.

220
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,169
Still working on the last one.

221
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,066
We need more blood.
That's the second unit.

222
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,407
I'm O-negative. I could donate.

223
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,208
- You can't save the world.
- Is that why you're here...

224
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,942
- working at the Ritz?
- Me?

225
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,586
I'm in it for the money.

226
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,720
Charles? CARTER: I
thought we had another hour.

227
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,016
It's the roll.

228
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,522
What? GILLIAN: The roll.

229
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,956
They roll the
generator fuel tank...

230
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,759
when it gets near the bottom so
they can squeeze out every last drop.

231
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,265
Makes the lights flicker.

232
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,430
Last of the 6.0 Prolene.

233
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,041
Unclamping the femoral artery.

234
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,214
Got a pulse in the foot.

235
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,546
Good. Pack it and leave it open.

236
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,113
Still alive?

237
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,624
Barely. Prolonged
hypotension. Could be ischemic.

238
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,455
How much time do we have left?

239
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,723
- Uh, half an hour or so.
- Charles?

240
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,399
Okay, let's see what we can do.

241
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,135
Release pressure.

242
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,304
No bleeding. Let's pack in there
with some more lap pads. Come on.

243
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,811
We're out of lap pads. I've got
another five minutes in the sterilizer.

244
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,880
Here.

245
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,816
I'm losing track. What else?

246
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,822
Uh, liver, spleen, removed a wedge
of lung. Repaired the renal vein.

247
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,324
The diaphragmatic
repair, then run the bowel.

248
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,157
Run a V-tach. CARTER: A
hundred lidocaine, start a drip.

249
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,491
Two mgs per minute.

250
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,134
Duodenal hematoma. Stapler.

251
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,996
You're gonna staple a duodenum?

252
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,660
Faster than sutures.

253
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,306
Okay, drip is 100 and
500 at 10 drops per minute.

254
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,103
Okay, I'm gonna run the bowel
while you do the diaphragm.

255
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,178
Aw! That's it?

256
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,108
Leave him open.

257
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,980
If he survives the night, we can
repair the bowel in the morning.

258
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,816
There's fecal matter in here.
- It'll have to do.

259
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,821
Pack it. Then
tape. Lots of tape.

260
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,625
He's oozing from his fingertips.

261
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,686
Is it DIC?

262
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,231
- Blood around the gums too.
- Are those clean lap pads done?

263
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,328
I can't get a pulse.
Irregular. CARTER: Come on.

264
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,505
Lost it. CARTER: All
right, I'm pulling the tape.

265
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,074
Dr. Carter.

266
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,679
I can't find the heart.

267
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,881
All right. There it is. I got it, I
got it. Starting compressions.

268
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,991
No pulse, no pressure, no resps.

269
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,096
He just needs more volume.

270
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,764
Leave him be.

271
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,062
Let him be, doctor.

272
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,352
Tell him I'm sorry.

273
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,291
He knows.

274
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,253
- I didn't know you smoked.
- Oh.

275
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,616
I don't.

276
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,919
When'd you get here?

277
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,254
Six days ago.

278
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,923
How much longer are you staying?

279
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:41,158
I don't know. I'm going
back to the clinic tomorrow.

280
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,464
I have patients who can't be
moved. I came back for some supplies.

281
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,654
Welcome back.

282
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,819
Thank you.

283
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,305
I thought you might be upset...

284
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,014
about that boy.

285
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,646
I'm okay.

286
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,116
I'm exhausted.

287
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,897
I'm going to bed...

288
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,692
and, um, I hope
someone will join me.

289
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,906
How's Abby?

290
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,643
I didn't do anything
with Gillian, I swear.

291
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,089
So you won't mind if I...?

292
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,022
No.

293
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,894
Knock yourself out.

294
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,597
See you in the morning.

295
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,103
She took the pills, but
the fever came back.

296
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,770
The Fansidar isn't working.
Her malaria has advanced.

297
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,809
IV quinine, 10 per
kilo every eight hours.

298
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:21,925
John? Meet Drs. Thorpe and
O'Brien. Americans fresh off the plane.

299
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,257
- Damn, it's hot.
- Actually, we got a breeze today.

300
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,763
- Gillian?
- Yes.

301
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,094
Finish the tour, start
them down in Triage.

302
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,827
Sure. Welcome.

303
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,329
What are you doing tomorrow?

304
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,172
Is that a trick question?

305
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,833
Charles brought vaccine
on the plane from Kinshasa.

306
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,911
Road is open, but who
knows for how long.

307
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,947
Thought you might assemble an
immunization team, see the country.

308
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,947
Yeah. Where would we go?
- Matenda.

309
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:48,315
But you'll have to find a nurse
who's willing to go with you.

310
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,690
And work in Admitting.

311
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,856
- Who are they?
- Interahamwe, Hunde, Banyarwanda.

312
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,030
Hard to tell anymore.

313
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,864
Everyone fights
everyone else now.

314
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,309
FAC.

315
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,483
Government's army.

316
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,818
I grew up near here.

317
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:26,049
Everyone was very
happy. It was beautiful.

318
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,552
I wish you could
have seen it then.

319
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,276
- Good trip?
- Slow.

320
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,742
What'd you bring?

321
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,683
Polio, DPT, MMR, supplies.

322
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,221
What are all those
people waiting for?

323
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,824
You.

324
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,533
How do you say,
"Don't be afraid"?

325
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,809
Well, something like that.

326
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,320
- She's laughing at me.
- Your French is terrible.

327
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,383
See? Didn't even hurt.

328
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:47,801
Gillian, ask him how long
his son has had this cough.

329
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,043
About two weeks.

330
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,746
Do we have any erythromycin?

331
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,082
Only amoxicillin and ampicillin.

332
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,147
Pertussis?

333
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,555
Yeah.

334
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,750
Tell him that his son is sick...

335
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,225
and we're gonna give him
medicine, try to make him feel better.

336
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,287
Sounds close.

337
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,194
Yeah. A mile, maybe two.

338
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,533
Pertussis...

339
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,639
They don't have anything
stronger than amoxicillin.

340
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,976
Did you tell that boy's
father we could save him?

341
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,869
We can.

342
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,606
Whooping cough's gonna
eat that amoxicillin for lunch.

343
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,210
He's gonna die.

344
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,482
Die from a disease we could wipe
out with a $10 course of erythromycin.

345
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,560
We vaccinated
200 children today.

346
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:24,294
When was the last time you saved
200 lives in one afternoon, huh?

347
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,507
Would you like a drink?

348
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,074
Willie Nelson?

349
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,713
Charles went to
college in Texas.

350
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,797
Dr. John, get down! Get down!

351
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,324
Luka!

352
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,086
Foot's missing above the ankle.

353
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,330
Get a BP cuff.

354
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,435
Foot's gone. We have to
operate below the knee.

355
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,101
- Do we have any surgical equipment here?
- No.

356
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,077
- What about anesthesia?
Ketamine? KOVAC: Only lidocaine.

357
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:19,514
Okay. We need to do a
Bier Block with lido. Gillian.

358
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:22,154
Yes. CARTER: Start
an IV in the popliteal.

359
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,015
Somebody please get this
poor girl's mother away from here.

360
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,355
Charles, get a suture kit and the
biggest knife you can. And a saw.

361
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,689
We're gonna need to
sterilize some sort of saw.

362
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,695
What's her name? - Chance.

363
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,327
Chance... KOVAC:

364
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,707
She's unconscious.

365
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:53,580
Okay, skin's good below
the knee. Tie off the bleeders.

366
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,082
I need the flashlight closer.

367
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,715
They are fighting! They
are coming this way!

368
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,053
- We need to evacuate the patients.
- Where?

369
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,128
- Into the old plantation.
- Go! Go!

370
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,066
There's another bleeder.

371
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,724
- I got it.
- Got that one?

372
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,563
- We should go.
- Not yet.

373
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,228
They're getting too close.

374
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,396
Got that one?

375
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,543
- Luka, we have to leave her.
- No!

376
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,211
Saw. What do we have for a saw?
- Betadine.

377
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,608
Okay, hold it steady.

378
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,759
Okay, I'm through.
Moist dressing.

379
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,630
Okay, let's go.

380
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,427
How's her pulse?

381
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,763
Strong.

382
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,461
Regular.

383
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:59,100
If there's no infection in four days,
I'll revise it and clean up the flap.

384
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,436
The skin looked good.

385
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,283
Should make a nice
seat for a prosthetic.

386
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,441
Ah, that was impressive.

387
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,950
Looked like you did it before.

388
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,779
I have.

389
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:17,191
In the beginning, there's a lot of talk of
national pride and patriotic speeches...

390
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,331
but after a few
weeks, it becomes this.

391
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,793
Nothing but death and sadness.

392
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,002
These people just want
what everyone else wants.

393
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:30,074
Their kids to have something to eat,
to see them grow up laughing, happy.

394
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,073
They don't care
where the border is...

395
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,508
or who gets to call
themselves president.

396
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,147
Just want this to stop.

397
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,311
I don't even begin to try to
understand the politics here.

398
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,647
You're an American,
Carter. You...

399
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,985
believe if people are given the
chance to convert to democracy...

400
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:50,060
- the world would be a better place.
- What's the alternative?

401
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,353
Military dictatorships?

402
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,729
You fight wars from the
sky with bombs and missiles.

403
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,893
Then your planes land
back on the aircraft carrier...

404
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,665
and the pilots watch
<i>Drew Carey</i> on satellite TV.

405
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,570
Hey, American
soldiers died in Iraq.

406
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:07,679
Yeah, but your children don't
starve to death while your men fight.

407
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,405
Your women aren't raped.

408
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,749
I remember...

409
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:24,454
watching the television,
reading the newspapers...

410
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,064
certain that we had to fight.

411
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,569
And then my family was gone.

412
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,539
I couldn't remember why
it was all so important.

413
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,279
What difference did it all make?

414
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,252
My children were dead.

415
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,843
Yeah.

416
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,318
One is still alive.

417
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,423
Bring him in.

418
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,755
The food's gone. Some supplies.

419
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,398
Where do you want him?
- Right here.

420
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,645
Gillian, need another IV ampicillin
and whatever we have for pain.

421
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,682
- Okay.
- FAC. A government soldier.

422
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:56,681
Carter? Small-caliber
GSW to the right upper thigh.

423
00:35:56,855 --> 00:36:00,121
He is pale and diaphoretic.
Lost a lot of blood.

424
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,171
He's not really improving.
You wanna try penicillin?

425
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,937
No. Stay with the amp.

426
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,974
No sign of infection.

427
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,551
Yeah, that looks good.

428
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:47,403
- What's his problem?
- Wants to get back. He's afraid to stay.

429
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,001
Does he know where the army is?

430
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,442
- I don't think so.
- Dr. Luka.

431
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,744
Tell him, uh...

432
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,852
as soon as he can
walk, he's free to go.

433
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,855
- I have patients who can't be transported.
- The fighting's heading back here.

434
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,858
Angelique wants to abandon
the clinic until it's safer.

435
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,393
Roads open again?

436
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,861
We think so. A UN food
truck got through today.

437
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,294
We move them, they'll die.

438
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,933
- How many?
- At least three.

439
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,731
Listen, take everyone else, leave
supplies and come for me in a few days.

440
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,703
- No, I can't.
- I won't leave my patients.

441
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,109
I'll try to reach
Angelique on the radio.

442
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,269
- I can stay.
- You want me to stay too?

443
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,880
- No. No, please.
- I will.

444
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,540
Take Gillian. Make
sure she gets back safe.

445
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,952
What was that all about?

446
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,258
Road's open.

447
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,590
- You'll need help.
- Patrique is staying.

448
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,925
He has no medical training.

449
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,897
You cannot take care of
three critical ill patients alone.

450
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,730
Of course I can. - Oh, yeah?

451
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:55,499
How are you supposed to do a Bier
Block on that amputation without a nurse?

452
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,733
- You're not staying.
- It's not your decision.

453
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,743
- You're getting into that truck and going.
- No, I'm not.

454
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,973
It's only for a couple of days,
then you'll come back and get us.

455
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,649
- Is it Mai Mai?
- Yes.

456
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,842
What's he saying?

457
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,846
That you tried to
save his brother.

458
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:47,417
That you tried for a long time.

459
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,522
Hello.

460
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,221
Hi.

461
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:27,783
You're welcome.

462
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,332
So, what should I tell Weaver?

463
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,633
Whatever you want.

464
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,133
Can I tell her
you're coming back?

465
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,879
I don't know.

466
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,682
Don't do anything stupid.

467
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:05,180
- Like what?
- Like get yourself killed.
