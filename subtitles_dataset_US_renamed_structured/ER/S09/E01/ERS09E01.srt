1
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,025
Standard urban
immunizations don't apply.

2
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,863
- No ring vaccination works.
- Homeland wants us to consider citywide.

3
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,506
- Take a look at this.
- Ten people died unnecessarily.

4
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,539
- It's debatable.
- I don't want to debate.

5
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,007
- Look at this!
- It's a public-health decision.

6
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,807
We got this from a missionary
hospital 300 miles east of Mbandaka.

7
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,974
Present in the simian
population as well as 18 children.

8
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,881
- When? WOMAN:
Thirty-six hours ago.

9
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,919
Same mutation? - Yes.

10
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,786
Jody...

11
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,621
get me Chicago.

12
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,227
You think we can get
them to move a TV in here?

13
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,564
I think you should
catch up on your reading.

14
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,967
I don't read after midnight.

15
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,305
There.

16
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,877
That's a wolf.

17
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,911
That looks like
a wolf, doesn't it?

18
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,040
A wolf with leprosy maybe.

19
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,985
I don't think that you're
appreciating the degree of difficulty.

20
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,055
Even without this rash.

21
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,555
- What?
- Kidding. Just kidding.

22
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,318
This... This doesn't look good.

23
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,394
Maybe we're
getting early parole.

24
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,873
- You feeling okay?
- What is it?

25
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,173
- We need to evacuate.
- The ER?

26
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,117
The entire hospital.
Everyone but you.

27
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,509
<i>Mr. Harold Drummond was in
his usual state of good health...</i>

28
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,514
until Tuesday evening when he began
to experience pinching in his chest.

29
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,948
The pain seemed to
intensify throughout the day...

30
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,553
as Mr. Drummond
worked in his pet shop.

31
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,954
After an early dinner of pork cutlets,
mashed potatoes and a couple of pints...

32
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,890
he retired to his living room to
do some reading, when the pain...

33
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,861
- We have to guess what
book? MAN 2: Yes, Dr. Corday?

34
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,625
Did you treat Mr. Drummond?

35
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,327
- No.
- Are you certain?

36
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,495
Because I distinctly
heard your voice.

37
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,232
- I'm sorry.
- Indeed.

38
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,536
Why don't we jump ahead
to your presentation...

39
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,839
since you seem unable
to contain yourself?

40
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,881
Uh, I'm... That's
not necessary. No.

41
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,645
Right.

42
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,819
Mr. McKay came into
the ER complaining...

43
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,552
We don't have ER's
in England, Dr. Corday.

44
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,528
Excuse me. He presented
to Casualty complaining of...

45
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,064
Is Mr. McKay the
African bushman?

46
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,065
- I beg your pardon?
- Your patient.

47
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,205
He's the young black
Pygmy, is he? About this high?

48
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,568
He's an accountant
from Manchester.

49
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,405
Specifics, Ms. Corday.
God is in the details.

50
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,110
Mr. McKay is a 63-year-old
Caucasian male who was...

51
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,650
- Man.
- What?

52
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,854
I believe the noun for which
you are searching is "man."

53
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,651
"Male" is an adjective. I
have a male springer spaniel.

54
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,954
His name is Barkley.
Though I love him dearly...

55
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,655
I would never think of
bringing him to a hospital.

56
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:16,132
But please continue. Most of us
speak a smattering of American.

57
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,809
Where are you taking me?
- Mercy Hospital.

58
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,039
Why?

59
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,980
Because we're
closing this facility.

60
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,587
Damn those HMOs! WEAVER:
How many more can you take?

61
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,588
- We're full.
- Then get it out of here. Call Mercy.

62
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:41,990
Let them know transport's on the way.
And I need another dozen rigs for OB.

63
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,825
- Is Colin on there?
- No. Only ambulatory patients.

64
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,500
- Where is he?
- I don't think they brought him out yet.

65
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,069
- They said everybody's being evacuated.
- They will be. Be patient.

66
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,224
Lily, can you help
her find her boyfriend?

67
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:53,934
Do I have to?

68
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,737
MVA, broken pelvis. I thought we
were getting rid of these news helicopters.

69
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,311
They are!

70
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,744
Wait, wait, wait. Stella's
one of the last ones.

71
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,077
- Zadro, you going to Mercy?
- No, no. Lakeshore.

72
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,310
- Got one more.
- Do I put her on my lap?

73
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,921
- Sounds good to me!
- How are you doing out here?

74
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:13,117
Good. Third and fourth floors are
empty. ICU and O.R. should be cleared...

75
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,524
- in 10 minutes.
- You did a good job today.

76
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,028
Given the situation, it
could have been a disaster.

77
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,862
- Everyone did really well.
- You kicked ass.

78
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,202
- Hold still.
- How come you keep doing that?

79
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,866
- It's the way the vaccine is administered.
- You learned it 10 minutes ago?

80
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,704
- What are you doing?
- No wristband!

81
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,211
- They won't let me go!
- You need to be vaccinated.

82
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,679
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

83
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,374
I'll come back tomorrow for it.

84
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,678
Everyone has to be
vaccinated before they go.

85
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,049
I'm not getting stabbed
by a smallpox needle...

86
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,056
- if it ain't even smallpox!
- It's 15 little pricks.

87
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,194
So shut up, get the
damn shot, and go home!

88
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,386
Tell me what it is,
I'll get a shot for that!

89
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,894
Are you deaf? We don't know!

90
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,895
But this vaccine is
the best we've got.

91
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,068
If you don't want
Dr. Gallant to help you...

92
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,864
I can arrange for the
Army sergeant to come in.

93
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,650
Make sure you don't touch that.

94
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:15,482
- Where are they taking them?
- Upstairs, respiratory isolation.

95
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,988
And why do we have
to stay in this Petri dish?

96
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,250
"Prolonged exposure,"
whatever that means.

97
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,260
Did you find out for how long?

98
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,559
- The virus is an unknown player.
- You said monkeypox.

99
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,725
A variant of monkeypox.
That's the problem.

100
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,564
How long?

101
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,262
Two weeks.

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,342
No. No, no, no. No.

103
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,445
They promised a public-health
nurse on duty around the clock.

104
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,672
Why two weeks? What
aren't they telling us?

105
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:45,012
I don't know. I think they're
just being extra cautious.

106
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,720
I'm sorry about all this.

107
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,450
Me too.

108
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,219
Thank you.

109
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,641
Could you make any
more noise, Stan?

110
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,605
I can't help it.

111
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,109
At least cover your mouth.

112
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,476
Better knock it off, Stan,
before you cough up a lung.

113
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,750
Agh. It's too late.

114
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,788
Have you ever been
tested for TB, Stan?

115
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,896
- DUI, PCP and HIV, but never TB.
- Great.

116
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,556
Pneumococcal pneumonia can give
you bloody sputum, fever and sweats.

117
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,599
Have you lost any
weight lately, Stan?

118
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,600
I've always been pretty svelte.

119
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,433
But I have had to tighten
my belt a few notches lately.

120
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,303
- Here, put this on.
- No. No, thanks.

121
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,070
- Do it!
- Well, you don't have to be so cranky.

122
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,679
I'm the one with the D.T.'s.

123
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,338
- What are you doing?
- We might have to get him tested.

124
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,985
No, no. Slow down.
They're tripping out enough.

125
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,417
- I don't need double quarantine.
- He may have TB.

126
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,283
And he might not.

127
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,585
Let's take a sputum sample to the
lab, do a Gram's stain and a AFB?

128
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,421
Because we're not
supposed to leave.

129
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,893
- It's not contagious unless we get a rash.
- No.

130
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,158
- What's he still doing here?
- I told you. He can't go by ambulance.

131
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,030
- That's why there's a chopper.
- Why didn't someone tell me?

132
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,034
It landed. We
have to get up top.

133
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,141
Colin, we're gonna take you to the roof
so we can put you on a helicopter, okay?

134
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,278
- I don't like to fly.
- It's a short trip.

135
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,675
You don't understand.
I really don't like to fly.

136
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,906
You don't have a choice.

137
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,550
I'm serious. You take
me up there, I'll freak out!

138
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,118
It's not a plane. It's an
air-rescue helicopter.

139
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,121
That's even worse. A helicopter
can't glide. Just take me back.

140
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,724
I have a bad feeling about this.

141
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:36,056
Take me back! Please!
Just take me back!

142
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,736
My son doesn't know I'm leaving.

143
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,897
We'll make sure to
tell him. Hold the doors!

144
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,044
Dr. Romano, Saint Rafe says
they can take one critical, not two.

145
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,043
That's too bad,
because I'm sending four.

146
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,682
Dr. Romano needs to send
at least four patients over.

147
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,146
Thank you! NURSE: No...

148
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,218
I've never been in
a Catholic hospital.

149
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,048
Well, you'll like the
nuns. Nice calves.

150
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,691
They said they'll
only accept one.

151
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,985
We're clear. Sign out the
Demerol and morphine.

152
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,254
- To who?
- You, me, my Uncle Bernie. What line?

153
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,159
- Two.
- Get the hell out of here.

154
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,011
- Who's this? WOMAN
1: <i>The admitting nurse.</i>

155
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,900
You like your job? Wanna
keep it? Tell your chief of staff...

156
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,662
- You know who that is?
<i>- Dr. Jones.</i>

157
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,932
Good for you. You tell Jonesy that
Robert Romano is sending over...

158
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,107
- four critical patients...
- Dr. Romano.

159
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,041
To be treated like
his own mother...

160
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,874
without the
inappropriate touching.

161
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,392
Tidal volume's down.

162
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,963
Probably just the morphine.

163
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,431
- Take a deep breath, Colin.
- Hey! Don't even think about it!

164
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,934
- That's my chopper!
- They were sending a chopper...

165
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,936
- for two patients.
- Well, they lied.

166
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,041
I don't want to go
on this helicopter!

167
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,143
- Fine. Fair enough.
- He needs an ICU bed.

168
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,438
- So get him one.
- He has bilateral pulmonary contusions...

169
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,876
and they're blooming.

170
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,880
Marty here's a
70-year-old diabetic...

171
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,281
with Gram-negative
sepsis from cholecystitis.

172
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,318
I'm only 68!

173
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:14,590
Damn parasites! Hey, get that
news chopper out of our airspace.

174
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:18,220
- He's gonna lose his airway.
- Intubate him and take him in your Viper.

175
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,766
- He's not safe to transfer.
- Arguing like this isn't helping them.

176
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,701
You're right. I'll tell you what, you
can take the chopper next. Let's go.

177
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,101
- Temp's 101.
- All right.

178
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:31,005
Give him 10 grams of Tylenol
and piggyback the gentamicin.

179
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,552
A sheet, BP cuff,
anything! Come on!

180
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:50,686
No vascular clamps, but we have
two Kellys and a needle driver. Oh, God.

181
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,356
- Where's the arm? Do we have the arm?
- I can't see anything.

182
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,766
- Shut this thing down!
- Not with you under it!

183
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,838
He's vomiting.

184
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:09,172
Twenty-centimeter lac over
the fifth rib, but no sub-Q air.

185
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,681
- Clamp.
- Which one first?

186
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,148
The biggest one.

187
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,512
- Okay, one, two, three.
- Tighter! Tighter.

188
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,359
Get your gurney out!

189
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,556
- I can't see anything.
- No, don't clamp it.

190
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,859
- What?
- Just do it! He's lost half his volume.

191
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,996
- Try for a BP on the good arm.
- Okay, I got it!

192
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,566
- Cold.
- Do we have blood on the rig?

193
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:41,306
- Six units, type A.
- We need a line. No O-neg?

194
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,609
You asked for type-specific.

195
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,651
Dr. Romano, what
blood type are you?

196
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,053
What blood type are you?

197
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,487
No red snappers?

198
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,422
Mm. Could be an
inadequate sample.

199
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:58,224
Sputum is loaded with
Gram-positive diplococci.

200
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,333
Pneumococcus. I
told you not to sweat it.

201
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,402
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

202
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,733
It's old-fashioned pneumonia.
I'm hungry. You hungry?

203
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,772
We're quarantined.
Put your mask back on.

204
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,775
You can't eat with a mask
on. Let's raid the cafeteria.

205
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,574
- Put your mask back on.
- Starve a cold, feed a fever.

206
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,444
Pratt? Pratt!

207
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,018
- That's my watch!
- I need the bag.

208
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,678
Cycle the dynamap.
How's he satting?

209
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,755
Nothing on the
monitor. Lungs are wet.

210
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,256
- Damn it.
- We're loading him.

211
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,918
I ain't taking off till I
check out that tail rotor.

212
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,030
- He's looking shock-y.
- He needs an O.R.

213
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,826
I don't know if she flies at
all, much less flies safely!

214
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,332
Call for ground transport.

215
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,027
- No, call another chopper.
- Where you gonna land it?

216
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,867
Luka, he needs to get there
by ambulance. We need ice.

217
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,941
Belly's hard as a
rock. Labored resps.

218
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,704
Okay. Send our guy
downstairs. Radio Dispatch.

219
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,279
Get an orthopedic and a
trauma surgeon up here.

220
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,821
You awake?

221
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,619
Yeah.

222
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,429
Monkeypox sounds
like a video game.

223
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,670
Or voodoo.

224
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,806
Or VD.

225
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,804
Lovely.

226
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,671
Does your back itch?

227
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,439
No.

228
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,848
- You're scratching it.
- It's probably just psychosomatic.

229
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,081
- You want me to take a look?
- No, I'm fine.

230
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,055
Might be a rash.

231
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,858
Turn over.

232
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,860
Do you think someone
did this on purpose?

233
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,524
- Does it matter?
- What do you mean?

234
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,001
I mean, viruses mutate.
That's what they do.

235
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:49,267
We're more likely to control
bioterrorism than Mother Nature.

236
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,035
Thanks, that makes
me feel a lot better.

237
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,072
No rash.

238
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,707
Nice tattoo, though.

239
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,217
College. I was drunk.

240
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,116
Is that what I think it is?

241
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,885
Yeah, I was going
through a religious phase.

242
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,767
My chest hurts. I can't breathe.

243
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,563
Crank him to 15 liters. Don't
worry, we'll get you down.

244
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,707
- What's wrong with this?
- Tachy at 115.

245
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,865
Where's the helicopter?
- He's first.

246
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,034
- You're next.
- Pressure's dropping...

247
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,203
- on twenty mics of dopamine.
- Over 100?

248
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,508
- Eighty-five.
- Susan, we have to get him down.

249
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,947
Don't hyperventilate.
Assist. Which is dopamine?

250
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:33,347
On the syringe pump.

251
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,546
Tell Weaver ultrasound was
clear, but he could have a slow leak.

252
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,350
Take everybody to
the ambulance bay.

253
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,517
- Pulse ox is 91.
- Got it. She might need help tubing him.

254
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,357
- Health Department refused reentry.
- Romano authorized it.

255
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,431
Who's Romano?

256
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,063
They coming back?

257
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:54,503
Uh, don't worry, Mr. Hersch.
I'm right here with you.

258
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:59,442
I hope they remembered to
call my son. He'll worry about me.

259
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:00,875
What's his name?

260
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,708
Alan.

261
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,117
His mother wanted
him to become a doctor.

262
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,892
I'm beginning to wish he had.

263
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,423
What's he do?

264
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,234
So how often does
this happen here?

265
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,682
Only since you came along.

266
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,563
Oh, right. The yin and the yang.

267
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,333
Excuse me?

268
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,239
The yin and the yang. You
know, something good happens...

269
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,404
so something bad has to
happen. You are Chinese, right?

270
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,982
Yeah, I'm just trying to
figure out the good part.

271
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,517
Just say the word,
and I'll show it to you.

272
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,246
- Hey, no, no. Pick that up.
- I made it.

273
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,914
It's bad enough that you're
not wearing your mask.

274
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:50,120
The hospital is abandoned!
Who are we gonna contaminate?

275
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,597
Central line kit. Two liters,
wide open. Where's the O-neg?

276
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,830
- We don't keep it here.
- He's not perfusing. Set up the level one.

277
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,941
- Oh, my God. KOVAC:
I need a lot of blood.

278
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,009
O-neg, packed cells
and platelets. Now.

279
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,735
- Blood bank is closed.
- Open it!

280
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,848
- What happened? KOVAC:
Chen, ice. I need ice. Lots of it.

281
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,283
Mr. Hersch? Mr. Hersch?

282
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,468
Where's the bag?
Where's the bag?

283
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,635
Uh!

284
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,237
Okay, Mr. Hersch,
I'll be right back.

285
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,825
Somebody! I need help!

286
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,515
Oh, son of a bitch!

287
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,201
Come on.

288
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,433
Come on.

289
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,480
Damn it.

290
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,498
- You can't open the O.R.
- They're already in there.

291
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,673
Mercy and Lakeshore
are full. That's it.

292
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,775
- Yeah? Maxed out is relative.
- I can't allow anyone else in!

293
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,343
He's our chief of staff.
You're gonna need to stop...

294
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,414
- the replantation team by force.
- Dispatch says to remove...

295
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,641
- the rest to Riverview.
- Where is that?

296
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,115
- Indiana.
- No, no.

297
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,618
- Need a hand here.
- What took you so long?

298
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,757
Elevator doesn't
open on the first floor.

299
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,324
Sats are 89, but not
correlating. Abdomen's tense.

300
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,984
- Hey, over here!
- Colin? Colin, can you hear me?

301
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:39,394
- Can I ride with him? I'm his fiancée.
- Get her the hell away from me.

302
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,325
Sir, I'm gonna need
you to calm down.

303
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,595
She's not my fiancée.
She's a freaking psycho!

304
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,328
- Gallant.
- We're soul mates!

305
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:49,168
- She ran me off the road into a bus!
- I was upset! But I'm not now!

306
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,901
I'll... I'll take care of you!

307
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,809
Hey. How bad is he? Romano?

308
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,506
Bad.

309
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,382
Retracting the deltoid.
There's the median nerve.

310
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,045
- Clean cut. That's good, right?
- Where do you want it?

311
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,190
Squeeze in four units
and get a HemoCue.

312
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,019
Bradying down to 50.

313
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:11,062
One liter of atropine. Break out the
cart. We're gonna have to tube him soon.

314
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,062
- I think I lost the pulse.
- Either you did or you didn't.

315
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,258
- I can't feel it.
- Okay, CPR now.

316
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,666
- Get that blood in. PRATT:
First two units are up.

317
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,637
One milligram epi, IV
push, and FFP to follow.

318
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:28,411
Is anybody out there? I need
help in here. He's crashing.

319
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,948
Somebody! Ugh.

320
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,606
Somebody!

321
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,917
Come on.

322
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,491
Pick up. Pick up.

323
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:17,061
Out of the way! Out of the way!
- Donald, get in there.

324
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,824
Kerry Weaver, Dr. Joe Gunn.
- Nice to meet you.

325
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,298
He walked into the tail
rotor? What happened?

326
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,733
- He barely has a pressure.
- Is he in arrest?

327
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,669
- Not yet.
- This way. Wear your mask at all times.

328
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,274
Dr. Weaver. Dispatch
relayed a call from Elevator 4.

329
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,570
Dr. Lewis needs help
with a crashing patient.

330
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,714
Well, who's with her? - No one!

331
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,782
- Normal sinus.
- Good pulse. How many units?

332
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,112
- Fourth almost in.
- Where are we?

333
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,943
Amputation at
the distal humerus.

334
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,113
Dropped his crit to
18 prior to transfusion.

335
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,953
- Arm's on ice.
- Everybody put a mask on!

336
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:50,790
Hemorrhagic shock resolved
with blood and epi. Pressure's 90.

337
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,228
I need to paralyze and intubate.

338
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,459
- He's coming around.
- What do you think?

339
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,798
- I don't know. Above the elbow's tough.
- Yes or no?

340
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,304
- Maybe.
- Oh, God.

341
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,300
Robert, can you hear me?

342
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,378
Oh, I'm at County.

343
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,782
I don't think I can
take another week.

344
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,482
Uh. Yeah.

345
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,991
All right, up.

346
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,561
Feels like we're the
last people on the planet.

347
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,292
Well, if we were I'd move into
the best suite in the Ritz-Carlton.

348
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,901
- You?
- Um...

349
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,834
- Shopping spree.
- Hm.

350
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,573
How's that look?

351
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,210
- Ooh, hot.
- Really?

352
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,082
- Toe or finger?
- Toe.

353
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,842
- Even the big one?
- Yep.

354
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,418
Arm or leg?

355
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:24,250
Uh... Leg. You?

356
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,722
- Definitely leg.
- Deaf or blind?

357
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:28,656
Deaf.

358
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,691
Ha, hah! Six-five.

359
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:36,393
Okay. Would you rather lose
both your arms or your penis?

360
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,696
- I don't know.
- Could still do it with your equipment.

361
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,433
It would be tough to get
chicks without arms, though.

362
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,975
To tell you the truth, I couldn't
date a chick that was missing pieces.

363
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,146
What if she had a
great personality?

364
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,880
What? And really big tits?

365
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:09,358
What the hell's going
on in here, Stan?

366
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,596
Hey, nice 'do. Frames
your face better.

367
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,335
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

368
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,284
Dr. Weaver.

369
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,789
- How's he doing?
- Could be better.

370
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,757
The ring and long
fingers are a little dusky.

371
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,228
Is it normal post-op erythema?
- It better be.

372
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,732
With the poor perfusion, I'm worried
the antibiotics aren't penetrating.

373
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,802
He's not getting enough
blood to the hand.

374
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,098
Can up his dextran. If
I go back to the O.R...

375
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,934
we decrease meaningful recovery.

376
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,704
- If not, he could lose the whole hand.
- I'm thirsty.

377
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:01,545
- Does he have a family?
- I don't know.

378
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,418
Has anyone else visited?

379
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,149
No.

380
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,692
You know him.
What would he want?

381
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:12,525
Robert's aggressive. He'll
want to save the arm at all costs.

382
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,859
So I should operate?

383
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,367
Let him wake up from
the narcotics and ask him.

384
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,200
That could be tomorrow
morning. By then it'll be too late.

385
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,274
Then you wait.

386
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,037
It's his decision, not mine.

387
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,144
Do you think they know?

388
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,114
Pratt's clueless.

389
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,481
Chen knows.

390
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,148
I don't think so.

391
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,814
Oh, no. She knows.

392
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,857
- Did you tell her?
- Where do you think I got the condoms?

393
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,399
And, you know,
you were a little...

394
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,365
loud.

395
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,069
Well, uh...

396
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,012
- You're about a three.
- I always thought I was at least a four.

397
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,843
- That's a nice pustule.
- It's gonna be a big scar. I know it.

398
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,885
You can get another tattoo.

399
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:13,185
That's true. I could
get "Carter... Yeah.

400
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,658
- Sucks."
- Ehh. Ha-ha.

401
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,295
<i>When I was in Chicago...</i>

402
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,694
I'd often get homesick for London,
think about the things I missed.

403
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,268
- Now you don't have to.
- And now I think about Chicago.

404
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,998
Yes, I heard you had a run-in with
the staff. This time with a cardiologist?

405
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,699
He took one of my
patients hostage.

406
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,277
Wanted to wait for an echo.
That's not unreasonable, is it?

407
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,779
- Ooh, someone groused on me.
- It's a small hospital.

408
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,885
- Small-minded, it's more like.
- And it's not America.

409
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,419
You may have to adjust
your approach somewhat.

410
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,956
My approach is to do what's best
for the patient with a minimum...

411
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,889
- amount of ass-licking.
- Oh, there's my cue.

412
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,791
What? You're not
gonna say hello?

413
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,659
Hello.

414
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,767
I'm really glad you're
back, Elizabeth.

415
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,572
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. I had a bowel resection.

416
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,869
Before lunch? Lovely.

417
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,511
I washed my hands.

418
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,712
Do you think it's possible
to die from boredom?

419
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,084
I don't think so.

420
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,382
What if your mind
wandered off in a daydream...

421
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:20,048
and you forgot to
eat or drink for days?

422
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:24,060
Then you'd die of
starvation and dehydration.

423
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,858
- Caused by boredom.
- Hm.

424
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:30,992
You smell something?

425
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,005
That smells like heaven.

426
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,837
- Where did this come from?
- A friend of mine slipped it...

427
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,173
- through the window.
- It's contraband pizza.

428
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,440
- Yeah. Why? You want some?
- Hell, yes.

429
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,777
Ten bucks a slice.

430
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,247
- Help yourself. STAN: You
didn't get any beer, did you?

431
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:50,548
I got some sodas.

432
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,151
I take back everything
I said about you, Pratt.

433
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,816
- Really?
- No.

434
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,188
But thanks for the pizza.

435
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,931
No, but seriously, since you
guys make five times what I do...

436
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,966
- all donations are greatly appreciated.
- Hey, I got good news.

437
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,464
Adam's fever broke.
He's out of the woods.

438
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,077
Ah, lovely. How about a toast?

439
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,640
- To young Adam.
- To young Adam.

440
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,776
- Yes.
- And to us, for surviving the plague.

441
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,741
Unless somebody develops
a rash in the next 48 hours.

442
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,073
Pestis Puerorum.

443
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,615
- What?
- The Black Death.

444
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,183
It started in China.

445
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:23,982
Infected Italian sailors brought
the disease back to Sicily in 1347.

446
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,887
In the end, 25
million people died.

447
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,496
- How do you know that, Stan?
- Renaissance Philosophy, 1-D-7.

448
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,359
- You studied philosophy?
- Taught it.

449
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,561
- Yeah, right.
- You're a teacher?

450
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,067
Yeah.

451
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,670
What happened?

452
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,501
Things. Things happened.

453
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,501
Things always happen.

454
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,575
Well, you're sober now.
- Not by choice.

455
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,776
You know, you've been
through the hard part.

456
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,649
We can get you into a program,
get you some counseling.

457
00:30:56,822 --> 00:31:01,760
I killed my daughter in a DUI. There's no
counseling for that. Thanks for the pizza.

458
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,094
Oh.

459
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,594
Well, I'm gonna eat this in bed.

460
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,200
- Hm. Sounds good to me.
- Alone.

461
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,102
- Good night.
- Good night.

462
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,936
- So you guys wanna watch some TV?
- No, thanks.

463
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,875
All right. Pizza
will be in the fridge.

464
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,446
Kind of sad, huh?

465
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,587
- What's that?
- The guy was a teacher.

466
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,121
- And he killed his daughter.
- Because of alcohol.

467
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,757
It happens.

468
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,953
- Doesn't have to.
- What are you trying to say?

469
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,428
I just think it's sad.

470
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,794
Tell me what you're
trying to say. Talk to me.

471
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,730
- You want me to talk to you?
- Yeah.

472
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,461
I wanna help you.

473
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,803
But not because I'm a nice guy
or because I'm worried about you.

474
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,402
- But because I wanna be with you.
- You wanna fix me.

475
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,775
- Help you.
- Fix me so I'm good enough.

476
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,349
- No, I want it to work.
- Yeah, well, I'm not broken.

477
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:12,760
Ms. Corday. I see you
ordered that CT on Mr. McKay.

478
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,129
Yes. After 20 minutes of chatting,
I came to the same conclusion.

479
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,964
CT confirmed dissection.

480
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,732
So you're carrying on
all right then, are you?

481
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,138
- Carrying on?
- Of course.

482
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,642
Well, I suppose you can
still grieve on the inside.

483
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,906
While I'm sure that's
some kind of criticism...

484
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,515
I'm afraid I haven't
got time to decipher it.

485
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,518
You're not in black dress. Matter
of fact, you're not in a dress at all.

486
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,179
Perhaps America has confused
you in more ways than one.

487
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,621
- Interesting.
- Yes.

488
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,762
I thought I might suggest
you reconsider that tie...

489
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:47,923
as it makes you look like
a boorish, virulent ponce.

490
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,194
But now I realize that's simply
your general disposition...

491
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,362
so it would be out of
place for me to comment.

492
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,974
Out of place indeed.

493
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,542
Tragic, really.

494
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,670
A woman out of place
on two continents.

495
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,081
Congratulations.

496
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,781
- Excuse me?
- They sold your house.

497
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,791
Ten thousand more
than the asking.

498
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,491
If you sign it, I'll
fax it back for you.

499
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,296
Thank you.

500
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:37,346
I would like to read
it myself, thank you.

501
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,276
What's wrong with your
lunch today, Dr. Romano?

502
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,441
Your body needs
nourishment to heal itself.

503
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,254
That's brilliant. They teach
you that in nursing school?

504
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,092
If you don't eat, I'm
gonna tell Dr. Gunn.

505
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,627
Oh, go ahead, tell
Gunn. I've seen his work.

506
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,288
You might as well have
your prosthetics department...

507
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,694
come fit me for a hook.

508
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:32,420
I'll see if I can find
you something else.

509
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:33,444
Whatever.

510
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:38,705
Kerry, I was wondering when
you were gonna come and visit me.

511
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,745
I was here yesterday
and the day before.

512
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,212
You were a little out of it.

513
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,908
Re-carpeting my office?

514
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,646
How are you feeling?

515
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,316
I've been better.

516
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,822
The surgery went well.

517
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:56,154
Yeah. So they say.

518
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,194
But you know how surgeons lie.

519
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,193
You were lucky.

520
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,399
Lucky?

521
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,503
Look, your people rallied around
to save you in a deserted hospital.

522
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,176
- If it wasn't for Dr. Kovac...
- I'd still have my arm.

523
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,743
- You do have your arm.
- Do I?

524
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,176
Yes. It was a clean cut above...

525
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,509
I signed the third-quarter
income projections.

526
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,016
We should evacuate the hospital
once a year for the money we're saving.

527
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,518
- Robert...
- Going to sleep now.

528
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,522
Apparently, I need my rest.

529
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,765
Identified the
terminal ileum. Bovie.

530
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,271
We call it
electrocautery, Elizabeth.

531
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,806
Can I help you?

532
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,534
A solo hemicolectomy?

533
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,942
Not by design. Your Professor
Whitehead decided to be tardy.

534
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:52,551
Yes, I know. He's apparently
saving a motorist on the M1.

535
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:56,654
Asked me if I'd fill in. But it
seems you've already started.

536
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,791
Transverse incision. Splendid.

537
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:04,623
- Allows for a more localized approach.
- Yes, and a bloody one. Suction.

538
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,230
The field is clear.

539
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,867
Let's just take
a look, shall we?

540
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,628
- Elizabeth?
- Be my guest.

541
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:20,372
Well, good separation
around the taut.

542
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:24,416
The areolar tissue could use better
division, couldn't it? Metzenbaum.

543
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:29,953
- May I continue now, please?
- The more I see, the better he'll do.

544
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,053
If you merely wish to peer
around this gentleman's anatomy...

545
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,318
why don't you crack
open his skull too?

546
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,760
No, I'm interested in completely excising
this gentleman's cancer, thank you.

547
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,732
- Vascular clips.
- Okay, then, he's all yours.

548
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,632
Retract the cecum medially.

549
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,937
Retraction.

550
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,245
Well, you heard him. Retraction.

551
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,938
Watch the pericolic gutter.
He's had some adhesions...

552
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,913
from an appendectomy.

553
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:12,222
- Morning, Frank.
- Ah. Welcome back, Dr. Weaver.

554
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,559
- Waxed the floors.
- Nice, huh?

555
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,293
Takes smallpox for them
to finally sanitize the place.

556
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:21,201
- Wasn't smallpox, Frank.
- Mutated monkey scabs. Whatever.

557
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,704
Other departments online?

558
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,469
ICU and Surgery have
been up since midnight.

559
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:29,205
Pedes, PICU, Labor and Delivery open
with us. Everybody else starts at noon.

560
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,973
- Dr. Pratt?
- See you.

561
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:33,380
- Disease Control clear you?
- One hundred percent.

562
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,077
- Probed every which way.
- I don't need to hear details.

563
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,813
Did we get all our
monitors back?

564
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,357
IMEDs, pro-packs and portable vents.
Crash carts are stocked and ready.

565
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,790
Ah. I don't get it. We're
closed for two weeks...

566
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:46,090
and they make us
come back at 6 a.m.?

567
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,495
It could have been midnight.

568
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,101
- I'll catch you quacks later.
- Oh, I see you're better.

569
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,704
I was never that bad. I
told you guys not to sweat it.

570
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:58,140
Dr. Pratt, Dr. Gallant called in sick.
I need you to cover for him until 3.

571
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,403
- What?
- Well, you just said you felt good.

572
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,074
- Yeah, I know. But, come on, man...
- Eh.

573
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,110
Kidding, Pratt.
See you next week.

574
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,947
- Can you sign this?
- What is it?

575
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,090
My timecard. Two
straight weeks of overtime.

576
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,520
Do you think I'm kidding?

577
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,752
Dermatologically clear.

578
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,988
- Afebrile.
- Okay, you're free to go.

579
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,325
What, no psych consult?

580
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,592
We try not to inflict
any long-term damage.

581
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,259
- She's borderline.
- Thank you for your understanding...

582
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,598
- and cooperation.
- Hey, can you tell us?

583
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,606
- What?
- If the virus was engineered or natural?

584
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:34,268
The system worked. Everyone did
their jobs, especially at the local level.

585
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,380
You're not gonna
tell us. See you, Deb.

586
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:39,279
- Yeah, it was fun, Carter.
- Let's get these beds made up...

587
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,181
so we're not setting up as
we go. Chuny, you triage?

588
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,346
- Yes. On my way.
- Hey, you survived.

589
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,617
Hi. You look tan.

590
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,385
I went to Barbados.

591
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,655
- Sorry.
- Barbados!

592
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,061
I had two weeks. What
else was I supposed to do?

593
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,997
- Frank, what time is it?
- 5:59.

594
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,831
Okay. We're open.

595
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,221
ER.

596
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,445
They just get out, themselves?

597
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:47,052
He has to leave the trach in for
a few days, but he's off the vent.

598
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,119
They look better, the parents.

599
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,847
Well, maybe they stopped
blaming each other.

600
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,385
- Weird.
- What?

601
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,292
Stuck here two weeks,
I don't wanna go home.

602
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,698
- Wanna get some breakfast?
- No.

603
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,999
You're not thinking of jumping?

604
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,967
No. Not quite that desperate.

605
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,942
- Can I join you?
- It's your hospital.

606
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,775
Yes, it is, isn't it?

607
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,777
So, what's wrong with
the surgical lounge?

608
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,889
Habit, I suppose.

609
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:29,460
At County, we often go up on the roof
when the place gets too much for us.

610
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,892
I'm glad everything
there isn't perfect.

611
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,464
I was beginning to develop
an inferiority complex.

612
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,396
Far from it.

613
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,271
Homesick then?

614
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,240
Yes, you do.

615
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,707
What?

616
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,739
Have a home.

617
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:51,239
Can't bring yourself
to sell it, I understand.

618
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:58,248
I assume Mr. Cummins survived his
hemicolectomy without further incident.

619
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,892
We do seem to manage
here from time to time.

620
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,362
You hadn't developed
vertigo yet as a teen.

621
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,230
Reminds me of your
tree-climbing days.

622
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,635
The headmistress couldn't
get you out of that sycamore.

623
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,938
I had to drive all the way
down to Tunbridge Wells.

624
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,909
A counselor was brought in...

625
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,608
suggested some kind of
rebellion, separation anxiety...

626
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:29,948
cry for attention, what have you.
Turned out you just liked climbing trees.

627
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:34,456
I knew that. You were an
unbridled spirit from the womb.

628
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,096
I don't know what to do.

629
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,895
I know, darling. I know.

630
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,648
- Here, let me.
- Thank you.

631
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,891
- This is the right train for Heathrow?
- I hope so.

632
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,125
- Thank you.
- You off on holiday?

633
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,664
No, we're going home.

634
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,736
- Thanks. MAN: <i>Stand
clear of the doors, please.</i>

635
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,498
<i>- The train is about to depart.</i>
- What have you got there?

636
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,441
- What have you got there?
<i>- The 7:59 train...</i>

637
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:31,275
<i>from Ealing Broadway and Reading
West is now departing for Heathrow.</i>

638
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,189
- Chaos theory?
- Yeah.

639
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:43,192
A virus mutates in the Congo,
we evacuate an ER in Chicago...

640
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:47,059
- Romano gets his arm cut off.
- You lost me.

641
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,599
Seemingly random events,
all part of a larger equation.

642
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,101
- I'm hot.
- You know, a butterfly flaps its wings...

643
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,264
in China and creates a tornado
halfway around the world.

644
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,909
- Are you hot?
- I'm just saying...

645
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,477
that there's an unpredictability
about everything.

646
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:05,480
Evolution, life,
love, relationships...

647
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,680
So, what am I? The
butterfly or tornado?

648
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,713
- No, you're chaos in general.
- Oh. Thanks.

649
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,123
No, I'm just saying you're chaos to
me. The unknown. I'm chaos to you.

650
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,992
You are hardly chaos, Carter.

651
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,497
I'm saying that there's
a risk in anything you do.

652
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,102
But don't you wanna stack
the odds in your favor?

653
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,705
I mean, I'm drawn to you.

654
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,635
It's kind of that simple. I've
been drawn to you for two years.

655
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,542
But chaos always seems to
rule. And I don't want it to rule.

656
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,247
I wanna know
where it's taking me.

657
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:44,084
- Know what I mean?
- Nope.

658
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:50,328
The tornado.
Definitely the tornado.

659
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,762
Are you coming in?
