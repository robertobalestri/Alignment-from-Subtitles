1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>Q-101 time is 8:30
under partly cloudy skies.</i>

2
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:13,637
<i>We'll be back with the news on the
hour after this 30-minute music mix.</i>

3
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,587
You realize you've been
in there for 20 minutes?

4
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,191
You miss me or
am I wasting water?

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,923
Both.

6
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,690
How much longer
are you gonna be?

7
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,596
Your shift doesn't
start for two hours.

8
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,765
Yeah. There's an
8:00 meeting near here.

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,137
You gonna go?

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,571
I was thinking about it.

11
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,613
Hello?

12
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,612
Something wrong?

13
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,721
Carter? What are you doing?

14
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,504
We really can't help
you anymore, sir.

15
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,698
I'm not a junkie. The stuff
just finds me, you know?

16
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,035
How convenient.

17
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,836
I need another
room for Mr. Hudlin.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,172
He says Exam 3
is full of ectoplasm.

19
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,042
- Did you cut yourself shaving?
- What?

20
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,308
Ooh. Never mind. Lipstick.

21
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,090
- Dr. Carter...
- Mrs. Breeland, you need to stay in bed.

22
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,159
Otherwise, we might be
tempted to put somebody else in it.

23
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,228
Okay, I think
we're getting there.

24
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,627
Hardly. Board number two
is for the patients in the halls.

25
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,834
We have heat exhaustion...

26
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,403
barbecue-smoke inhalation,
and boils. All up for grabs.

27
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,767
- I love my job.
- No, you don't.

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,910
Why are you dressed like that
if you can't prescribe nothing?

29
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,603
Ah, the smell of fresh med
students in the morning.

30
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,907
God, what is it about
them? They all seem so...

31
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:58,951
- Gullible? Immature? Vapid?
- I was going to say sweet.

32
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,745
Bee sting in 1
is asking for you.

33
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,914
Have them start the orientation
manuals. I'll be with them soon.

34
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,720
- Carter, MVA, two minutes.
- But not to hold their breath.

35
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,727
Dr. Carter, so there's
a trauma coming in.

36
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,424
Yeah. Why don't you take the bee
sting in 1, the wrist fracture in 4...

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,195
and the burning rash in
2? Care to give me a hand?

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,394
- Help me!
- Why not?

39
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,700
- Help me!
- Hey! That's just been mopped, damn it!

40
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,036
You don't talk if you're
having a real seizure.

41
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,543
Remember that for next time.
- Ah, come on, man!

42
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,739
- Think it's always this crazy here?
- Probably.

43
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,441
They need to bring you
back to the VA hospital, sir.

44
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,951
- I don't understand.
- Your driver will explain.

45
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,249
You guys suck, you know that?

46
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,723
- Don't bother. We don't have any beds.
- So, what else is new?

47
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,958
- No, I'm serious. Try Mercy.
- They're refusing patients too.

48
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,123
- Then try Rush. We're filled.
- I've been bounced all over town...

49
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,427
with this guy. I'm out
of gas and so is he.

50
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,936
If I don't get him into a bed
his UTI's turning into urosepsis.

51
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,403
I got to make water!

52
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,303
Yo, doc!

53
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,664
- You are one sadistic bitch.
- Now give me your middle finger.

54
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,561
I would if I could. Any emergency
meetings get scheduled?

55
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,000
Just one, about this spate
of ER closures in the area.

56
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,005
I've advised the board that
preliminary figures show an increase...

57
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,973
in our patient
load by 34 percent.

58
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,640
- Who'd you take to La Scala's?
- Sorry?

59
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,476
Which board member's
ass are you kissing?

60
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,312
- Now the ring finger.
- Robert, I simply compiled a report.

61
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,456
- Nerve regeneration's a millimeter a week.
- I'm not kissing ass.

62
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,817
It's not my dominant hand.

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,427
In fact, I only agreed to take on
your responsibilities out of necessity.

64
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,256
I'll be in my office
in two weeks...

65
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,160
- and back in the OR in two months.
- I hope you are.

66
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,127
Thought about
upping your Vicodin?

67
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,932
Ibuprofen. I want
to stay clear-headed.

68
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,007
- That's enough for today.
- No, keep going.

69
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,007
Sorry, have another patient.

70
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,669
Don't get comfortable, Kerry.

71
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,647
- Is there anything else?
- Just your continued support.

72
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,987
Lizzy.

73
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,347
- Elizabeth, how are you doing?
- Fine.

74
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,052
Good. Well, uh, we'll
catch up downstairs.

75
00:04:56,563 --> 00:05:00,056
- I heard rumors.
- All true, I'm afraid.

76
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,562
The one face I missed
seeing in Recovery.

77
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,536
I'm so sorry, Robert.

78
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:11,175
What, about my arm or
about not being there?

79
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,078
- How are you healing?
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.

80
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,653
You?

81
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,186
Any sensory function yet?

82
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,351
Nope.

83
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,393
It's a motorcycle accident.
I have to go. I'm sorry.

84
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,725
- Dr. Corday. How was London?
- Good.

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,563
Timed your trip right.
Missed the pox scare we had.

86
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,728
- So I hear.
- How's Ella?

87
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,204
- Fine.
- Is it nice to be back?

88
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,343
I'm off to the ER.
I'll let you know.

89
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,411
Okay. Well, good luck.

90
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,213
Bite me, panty smellers!

91
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,717
Ma'am, you need to calm down!

92
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,034
Die, you sucking pervert!

93
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,539
Dr. Corday, hi. We
need some Haldol here!

94
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,907
- You think that's necessary?
- Yes!

95
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,274
Doctor C, looking good.

96
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,440
Thanks, Malik. So, what's the
GCS on this motorcycle trauma?

97
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,610
- Sorry, I didn't do the ride.
- Oh. Well, have the X-ray tech...

98
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,721
come down for portables.
- You got it.

99
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,757
Hold the CT till we eyeball the patient.
- Hey, welcome back.

100
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,793
Thanks. So do you
know any of the specifics?

101
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,454
Sixteen-year-old girl, motorcycle
versus utility pole, no helmet.

102
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,793
Carter's bringing her in.

103
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,630
- What's a chick doing on a motorcycle?
- What's anyone doing on a motorcycle?

104
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,137
Have the rapid infuser primed
and ready, draw her up 100 of fent...

105
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,971
four of Ativan. Make sure the
airway drugs are out of the box.

106
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,913
- It's like you never left.
- Yeah.

107
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,485
Vital sign.

108
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,095
- We need some O-neg.
- She got a rhythm?

109
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,991
- P.E.A. to agonal before arrival.
- Decreased breath sounds.

110
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,629
Intubated for agonal resps.
Didn't know you were back.

111
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,822
When did she lose her pulse?
- Never had one.

112
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,991
- Everybody. On my count. One...
- Hold transfer and compressions!

113
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,832
- Asystole!
- Abdomen's distended. Pelvic instability.

114
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,839
Uh, suction on high.
I need a Yankauer.

115
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,476
That's easily two liters.

116
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,202
All right, amp of epi.

117
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,809
Don't bother.

118
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,807
Obvious C-spine fracture.

119
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,850
She's not even a
good organ donor now.

120
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,378
- Is her family here?
- Trying to locate them.

121
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,181
- We can talk to them...
- It's fine.

122
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,349
Just let me know
when they arrive.

123
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,461
If it'd be easier for you.

124
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,568
I could pull the trigger right now if I
wanted to. Because it's all right here.

125
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,500
Welcome back, Elizabeth.
Do you have time for a consult?

126
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,470
As it turns out, yes.
What's he have? Belly pain?

127
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,042
Only because he swallowed
a handful of nitroglycerin.

128
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,202
No sudden moves unless
you want me to blow!

129
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,349
Milo has right upper quadrant
tenderness with rebound.

130
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,539
I'm a human time bomb.

131
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,050
He needs to be cleared
before we move him upstairs.

132
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,245
- I could go off.
- He could get hypotensive.

133
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,912
Are you scared? I'd be scared.

134
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,819
No! Give him two
liters of saline...

135
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,223
- and monitor him for a few hours.
- Thank you.

136
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,488
Gallant hasn't turfed a
case to Psych all day.

137
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,393
- You wanted the consult.
- Dr. Lewis.

138
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,897
- Yeah?
- We're to capacity?

139
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,433
Every bed, every day since
Mission Hospital closed.

140
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,228
I thought it was
just St. Paul's.

141
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,532
No. It doesn't help
Weaver's been gone so much.

142
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,266
- She's gunning for Romano's job.
- It keeps her very busy.

143
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,344
- Dr. Lewis.
- Mr. Sprooner. Guess you're still itchy?

144
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,673
Yeah. But there's...

145
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,612
You need to give drugs a
chance to work and quit scratching.

146
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,943
I think the guy next to
me stopped breathing.

147
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,547
- Great!
- Got a gang shootout here.

148
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,556
Couple DOA's at the scene.
Another rig's coming behind me.

149
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,193
- Where was she hit?
- In the neck.

150
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,125
- BP's 100/76, pulse stable at 100.
- Through and through?

151
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,959
Saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
- You need a hand?

152
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,759
- Possible SCI.
- Where is he? Ricky?

153
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,425
- What's her name?
- Alma.

154
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,300
Hang in there, Alma. We're
gonna try to find him for you.

155
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,771
Set up a cross-table lateral of the neck.
- Carter.

156
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,570
Still got med students waiting.
Want me to jump on that?

157
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,474
Better idea. You talk to them.

158
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,777
So. Newbies, huh?

159
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,816
You don't wanna work here.

160
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,886
- Haleh, get that dead body out of here.
- And take it where?

161
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,322
- Someplace else.
- How much O2?

162
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,052
- Five liters by nasal cannula.
- You hurt anywhere else?

163
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,731
They shot him! Oh, please,
God, don't let him be hurt!

164
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,299
We're gonna find out for
you, but you gotta help us.

165
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,801
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
- I don't know. I can't tell.

166
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,634
- How about your legs?
- No. I can't feel them.

167
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,123
Gallant, need a hand here.

168
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,908
We're talking smithereens here!
Have you ever seen smithereens?

169
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm on Psych rotation. I
really shouldn't be helping you.

170
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,451
- Haleh, this is a dead body.
- You ought to go to med school.

171
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,284
Can't take her to the morgue
yet. We're waiting on family.

172
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,757
Why am I not exploding?

173
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,363
No movement below the umbilicus.

174
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,795
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I feel anything?

175
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,992
You might have bruising
to your spinal cord.

176
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,694
I need 30 mgs per kilo of
methylprednisolone, IV bolus.

177
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,000
- Where the hell's X-ray?
- Behind you. Start with the chest.

178
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:12,111
- Please. I need Ricky.
- Stay with us, Alma.

179
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,680
Entry wound, left mid-sternocleidomastoid
with a large hematoma.

180
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,681
There's blood
behind the ear as well.

181
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,615
Be nice to hear
about that ultrasound.

182
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,847
Morrison's is dry. The
pericolic gutters look good.

183
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,150
- Bladder is...
- Shooting.

184
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,954
Wait! Wait. She's pregnant.

185
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,188
- What?
- Looks like about 11 weeks.

186
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,299
Fetal heart rate is 140. Baby
appears healthy and intact.

187
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,695
I need Ricky.

188
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,298
It's my arm, man.
It hurts like a...

189
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,531
Do something already!

190
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,370
BP's steady at 120. But he's
been like this the whole time.

191
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,068
Ricky, you need to calm down.

192
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,305
- Did you give him anything?
- Wouldn't hold still long enough.

193
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,918
Good breath sounds. Full
trauma panel, chest and AP pelvis.

194
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,144
He's a regular customer.

195
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,585
Through and through to the
right triceps. You were lucky.

196
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,782
Yeah? You should
see the other guys.

197
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,439
No fracture or deformity.

198
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,662
So, what? Just
go back and forth...

199
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,821
shooting each other
till all of you are dead?

200
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,934
- An eye for an eye, man.
- Yeah. Meanwhile his girl gets shot.

201
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,229
- They got Alma too?
- She was hit in the neck...

202
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,735
and it's pretty serious.

203
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,566
- Where you going, dog?
- Let me go!

204
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,870
- Calm down!
- I'm gonna kill those bitches!

205
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,342
You already did!

206
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,081
Repeat hemogram
and update tetanus.

207
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,348
Keep your hand there and don't
take it off until you get upstairs.

208
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,924
- Dr. Corday, when you have a chance?
- Be right there.

209
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,187
Make sure the blood bank sends
type-specific straight to the OR.

210
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,797
Have the anesthesiologist
call me with any questions.

211
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,400
- Are you the one...?
- A neurosurgeon will perform it.

212
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,934
He'll talk with you shortly.

213
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,934
- I'm sorry?
- Don't let me die.

214
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,199
You're one cold-hearted
bitch, you know that?

215
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,572
I don't have any damn
pity for you, whore!

216
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,373
I'm talking to you, pissface!

217
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,780
Don't you dare turn your back on
me, you stuck-up little ass-shaker!

218
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,421
Where the hell do
you think you're going?!

219
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,850
Pardon me. Coming through.
Watch your back, sweetie. Excuse me.

220
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,494
- Doc, I'm gonna miss the season...
- Keep your cup on.

221
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,062
I should have been off two
hours ago. You still here?

222
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,826
Can't leave till my patient
gets a bed. Them's the rules.

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,026
- Don't sound upset about it.
- Up to level 12.

224
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,932
Turn that off,
disturbs the patients.

225
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,664
- Frank, what'd I miss?
- County HHS needs to talk to you.

226
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,173
- Ditto, Human Resources.
- Anything from Dr. Romano?

227
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,505
He called half an hour
ago, an hour before that.

228
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,876
Somebody from Dr. Rydell's office
called to confirm your appointment...

229
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,539
Frank, 2 needs a janitor.

230
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,687
What the hell is this? Why is
Stella Willits still on the board?

231
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,049
I called to have her
admitted to Psych hours ago.

232
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,681
- I haven't evaluated her yet.
- Save yourself the trouble. She's nuts.

233
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,920
She's a frequent flyer with a
history of bogus medical complaints.

234
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,691
With all due respect, I'd
like to determine that myself.

235
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,801
The ER doesn't have time or
manpower to deal with hypochondriacs.

236
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,130
That's what you're for.
Get her off my board.

237
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,966
- It's part...
- I said, get rid of her.

238
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,402
Stubborn. Gotta give you that.

239
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,406
How are those medical
students coming?

240
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,477
Fine. I gave them
three volumes of Rosen.

241
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,443
ER. Carter, Urology on two.

242
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,549
Think you can come up with
something a bit more interactive?

243
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:08,381
Yeah. Sam Polivy's back with
a ureteral stone. P-O-L-I-V-Y.

244
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,420
Abby? Those labs
back on Melinda Harrell?

245
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,821
- Let me check.
- Hi, I'm Erin Harkins.

246
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,052
- I'm on the phone.
- You're busy. We get it.

247
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,959
Can we get an approximate
time orientation will begin? Doctor?

248
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,396
Don't tell me you're keeping
med students waiting.

249
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,592
- Check with Pratt.
- I'm checking with you.

250
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,413
Intractable pain
and hydronephrosis.

251
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,461
Dr. Carter?

252
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,800
I cannot admit him to Eight
West. There are no beds.

253
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,741
I'm Dr. Weaver, Chief of Emergency
Medicine. I will give you a brief tour...

254
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,905
of the ambulance bay, after which our
Chief Resident will give you his attention.

255
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,985
Because, as you'll learn, it's his
primary responsibility. Come on.

256
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,983
- Sorry. What was that?
- Demolition-site accident downtown.

257
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,657
- At least a dozen injuries.
- ETA?

258
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,486
- Now.
- I gotta call you back.

259
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,288
Paramedics can transport
using standing field protocols...

260
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,090
- We've got multiples.
- Wait here.

261
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,264
- Who's on first?
- Sick one. Frank Chambers.

262
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,928
Forty years old, severe chest
trauma when a walkway fell.

263
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,468
Wrecking-ball crane collapsed.

264
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,630
BP, 80 systolic, but headed the
wrong way. Tachy 120, denies LOC.

265
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,537
Crepitus on right
side. Page Surgery.

266
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,701
- Mr. Chambers, can you talk?
- Hurts too much.

267
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,436
He thought his ribs were broken.

268
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,705
- You are?
- His secretary.

269
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,645
Sustained a facial lac and
chest pain but refused treatment.

270
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,479
- You need to be examined.
- After.

271
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,052
He's decreased on the left.

272
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,279
Let's hear it.

273
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,832
I've heard it since
Michigan Avenue.

274
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,121
Ken Ambrose, 34, tib-fib
fracture with dislocation.

275
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,227
F.D. had to lift a
flower shop off his leg.

276
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,623
Not a shop. It's a kiosk!

277
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,127
Abdomen's soft, non-tender.

278
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,323
Vitals normal, tachy
at 120 with a liter in.

279
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,365
- Gave him ten of MS.
- Don't touch! It hurts!

280
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,963
Okay, uh, bear with us.
We'll give you something.

281
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,073
- Oh, God! I see a light.
- You're not dying. It's just your ankle.

282
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,106
Oh, God!

283
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,756
You're supposed to help me!
- Watch where you're going!

284
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,154
- You ran into me!
- Haleh? Where's the trauma?

285
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,159
Throw a rock, honey.
Blunt chest in 2.

286
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,763
You look wonderful, by the way.

287
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,092
- Eighty-five pounds and counting.
- Good for you.

288
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,859
- You cut your hair?
- Mm-hm.

289
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,270
- BP's falling, 70 systolic.
- Keep squeezing that bag.

290
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,737
- Where are we? CARTER:
Flail and crepitus. Needs a tube.

291
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,274
- Who has an angio cath?
- Right here. How can I help?

292
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,935
Given there's only one,
I don't see how you can.

293
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,275
- What is that? What are you doing?
- It's a tube to help him breathe.

294
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,680
He has a collapsed
lung, this will re-inflate it.

295
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,285
I need a thoracostomy tray.

296
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,355
All right, let's see how
much air he's got in here.

297
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,925
Oh, God!

298
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,523
That any better, Mr. Chambers?

299
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,886
Sats 88.

300
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,758
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?

301
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,461
Because he can't. Let's Betadine
the whole chest just in case.

302
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,066
- You need any help?
- Yes. With his wife. She's bleeding.

303
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,352
- I'm not his wife. CORDAY:
Then you shouldn't be here.

304
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,641
Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.

305
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,812
We need that blood.

306
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,780
Let's get her on a monitor. She refused
treatment for chest pain at the scene.

307
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,282
I'm Dr. Kovac. Come with me.

308
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,921
- No. Somebody needs to be with him.
- Okay, I'm in.

309
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,953
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him...

310
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,921
and Dr. Kovac will
take care of you.

311
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,252
Please.

312
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,631
What are you doing down there?

313
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,770
Lewis, what are you doing up
there? This guy's got no DP pulse.

314
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:15,466
It's called a trauma assessment.
Lungs clear, chest tones normal.

315
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,633
- Got the Doppler.
- Give it to me.

316
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,439
- Sweet Jesus!
- Explains no pulse.

317
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:24,641
Okay, let's get a CBC, chem seven,
dip a urine, chest and pelvis x-rays.

318
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,479
Chen, give me your hands.

319
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,314
- What are you doing?
- Hold tight.

320
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,921
Ken! Have you ever
been to Hawaii before?

321
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,931
- Uh-uh.
- Well, pretend that you're there now.

322
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,186
Pratt, wait!

323
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,191
I can't believe you!

324
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,632
I feel better. I
feel totally better!

325
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,465
I feel totally sick.

326
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,031
Why would you reduce an
ankle with no pain meds?

327
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,042
No pulse is no
blood is dead tissue.

328
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,180
In other words, I
just saved your foot.

329
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,680
Thank you. You're wonderful.

330
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,552
- Subclavian's in. Is that the film?
- Five hundred cc's are out the chest tube.

331
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,091
- He's holding his pressure.
- No pneumothorax.

332
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,991
Looks like a widened mediastinum
and loss of the AP window.

333
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,665
Hard to tell. The pulmonary
contusion is impressive.

334
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,512
One of us should
go with him to CT.

335
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,569
Not unless you're
ready to crack the chest.

336
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,399
Flail chest, pulmonary
contusions, and labile hypotension.

337
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,336
Could also be from
a splenic fracture.

338
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,772
Carter, I'd like an
aortagram. Better yet, a TEE.

339
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,469
The fact he's still alive
argues against aortic injury.

340
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,221
Page me with the result, okay?

341
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,139
- Elizabeth, I think
there's more to discuss.

342
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:34,083
Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon. The last
time I checked, you weren't chief of staff.

343
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,490
Keep me apprised
of his condition.

344
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,784
- Okay, the last one.
- Can I go see him now?

345
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,419
No. We have to make sure you didn't
bruise your heart or damage your lungs.

346
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,897
They're not doing anything.

347
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,931
Probably just waiting
to go up to surgery.

348
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,758
I'm sure he's stable.

349
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,098
I told Mr. Chambers
we were 10 minutes late.

350
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,707
It's a trick I use to get
him to meetings on time.

351
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,539
- You don't call him by his first name?
- He's kind of formal.

352
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,211
How long have you
been working for him?

353
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,148
Two years. Six days a
week, 10 hours a day.

354
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,050
Probably spend more time
with him than his wife does.

355
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,215
They're really happy, though. I
mean, she's lucky to have him.

356
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,883
- He's a good man.
- Luka...

357
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,223
no fragments in the
x-ray. Ready to irrigate?

358
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,060
Yeah. Uh, put Polysporin on the wound.
- Mm-hm.

359
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,897
Where'd you get that one?

360
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,633
A lowlife stuck me in the
back with a switchblade.

361
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,779
An inch to the left and you
would have lost a kidney.

362
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,950
Guy that did it to me got
snuffed with a sawed-off.

363
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,149
Dude was bite-size.

364
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,480
That's funny?

365
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,086
- Whatever, bitch.
- Hey, watch your mouth.

366
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,287
Are you almost done, man?

367
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,556
Why? You in a
hurry to go to jail?

368
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,591
We can check on Alma. She's
probably in Recovery by now.

369
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,965
- That means she's okay, then?
- No. She could wind up paralyzed.

370
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,767
- Like, all over or just her legs?
- They're not sure yet.

371
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,043
Well, better if they just
killed her, you know?

372
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,280
An hour ago you
were ready for revenge.

373
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,818
Yeah, that was personal. It
was about my name, honor.

374
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,254
- But paralyzed? That blows.
- Just dress the wound with Adaptic.

375
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,553
- Hey, Luka.
- Huh?

376
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,461
- Piece of work, huh?
- Yeah.

377
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,092
And she's pregnant.

378
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,739
- Who?
- The girl. Says it's his baby.

379
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,739
You want to tell him?

380
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,012
No. Do you?

381
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,509
Not really.

382
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,983
Hi. I'm Michael
Gallant from Psychiatry.

383
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,124
Stella Willits from
Ohio. Nice shiner.

384
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,317
I understand you have quite
a few medical complaints.

385
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,691
- I'll need to ask you a few questions.
- Knock yourself out, hon.

386
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,456
Had any recent weight gain?

387
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,828
I've been thinking
about going on the Zone.

388
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,971
- How about dry skin?
- Like the Sahara. Here. Give me this.

389
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,307
"Intolerance to cold." Yes.

390
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:13,207
"Arthritis, sore muscles,
constipation." Yes, yes, and yes.

391
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,406
"Fatigue." Well, I have been
kind of low-energy lately.

392
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:23,015
You have some delayed relaxation
from the deep-tendon reflexes.

393
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,458
What about depression?

394
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,552
- Me?
- Yeah.

395
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:33,098
No, I'm glass-half-full, I'm
silver-lining girl. I'm an optimist.

396
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,228
Listen, I'll be back to finish.

397
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,198
Um...

398
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,102
I guess I do get a
little blue sometimes.

399
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,741
Get this gurney out of the way.

400
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,404
If you haven't talked to anyone, you
need to go back to the nurse in Triage.

401
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,313
Your food poisoning in Exam
4's been here for 11 hours...

402
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,512
- Waiting on a consult.
- From the Naked Chef? He ate bad shrimp.

403
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,350
- Can I get something for my skin?
- Yeah, sun block.

404
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,992
Can I talk about Stella Willits?

405
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,924
- If you're admitting her to Psych.
- She may have a reason...

406
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,326
Just got word on
Mr. Chambers. Aortic dissection.

407
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,091
I'm taking him up
to Surgery now...

408
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,906
- unless you have objections.
- Uh, no.

409
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,833
Would it be possible for
us to speak in private first?

410
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,768
- Of course.
- Dr. Weaver?

411
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,204
- Later.
- Yeah, but I need...

412
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:20,104
I wanted to talk to you
about what happened earlier.

413
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,611
Oh, for God's sake! Who
left a cadaver in here?

414
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,115
Sasha's a bit of a bad penny.

415
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,277
She keeps being moved while
they try to locate her family.

416
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,479
I don't mind if you don't mind.

417
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,029
I'm concerned that you might
be taking on too much too soon...

418
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,596
particularly in the
area of trauma.

419
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,860
Based on?

420
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,971
What I saw earlier. A pronounced
inability to work with others.

421
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,835
A lack of professional respect.

422
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,271
You're joking, right?

423
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,977
Look, it's stressful,
no question.

424
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,512
Copping an attitude
with me and my staff...

425
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,378
is not gonna make a
trauma go any easier.

426
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,144
Kerry, I saw a dissected aorta.

427
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,552
In fact, it only adds to the intense
pressure that we're all feeling.

428
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,955
Given my position, I didn't think it
necessary to seek your approval.

429
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,823
We all have our sensitivities.

430
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,159
Quite frankly, if anyone
has an attitude here, it's you.

431
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,460
- But we can't let them interfere...
- No!

432
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:21,266
It's you, with your insistence on being
kowtowed to at every bloody opportunity!

433
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,114
Oh, my God!

434
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,282
Excuse me.

435
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,819
I want some milk, I'm thirsty.

436
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,965
His landlord found him in his
apartment crying, hyperventilating.

437
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,101
- Apparently, his girlfriend left him.
- The term would be "mommy."

438
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,793
- What?
- Mommy.

439
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,563
Well, he appears to be an Aby.

440
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,967
You know, an adult baby?

441
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,472
It's a fetish in which the
baby is taken care of...

442
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,838
in every way by a
"mommy" or a "daddy."

443
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,673
You're familiar
with this condition?

444
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,941
It's not really a condition. It's
more like a form of relaxation.

445
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,142
- Are you kidding me?
- No, it says right here:

446
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,755
"Abies like to relinquish control,
get away from their stressful lives."

447
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,983
- Mr. Dwyer, what do you do for a living?
- Shoe sales.

448
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,526
A foot fetish too. This is an issue
for the Psych Department. No offense.

449
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,163
I am not so sure about that.

450
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,925
Mr. Dwyer, when's the last
time someone changed you?

451
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,966
This morning.

452
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,596
More than likely, he suffers from a
diaper rash, which is a medical ailment...

453
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,139
to be treated by the ER.

454
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,539
- When are you done with this rotation?
- Next week.

455
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,009
Remind me to give you
some serious scut work.

456
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:38,879
"To Dr. Pratt, thanks from a
grateful patient. Ken, the kiosk man."

457
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,110
Amazing.

458
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,380
Too bad this guy didn't
run a hot-dog stand.

459
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,547
I'm here for allergies. These
things are pushing me over the edge.

460
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,851
Can you get rid of them?

461
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,995
Or give them to someone
a little more deserving.

462
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,789
Hey, hey. Who saved
flower boy's foot...

463
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,330
and moved more patients
than anybody today?

464
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,560
Me, that's who. You're gonna
miss me too, because I'm out of here.

465
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,261
- Banker's hours, Pratt?
- Only if they work doubles.

466
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,568
Hey, Carter. What's
up with your boss?

467
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,005
Is it true she was,
uh, crying earlier?

468
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,202
- Weaver?
- Yeah. Bad breakup or something?

469
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,870
- Been pretty moody lately.
- Lately?

470
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,028
I'm sorry! I think this man
needs immediate attention!

471
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,064
- You gotta help my pops!
- What happened?

472
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,848
They came in the
ambulance entrance.

473
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,990
- I saw he was diaphoretic.
- Not asking you.

474
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,092
We were playing ball.
He grabbed his chest.

475
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,089
- When did the pain start?
- An hour ago.

476
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,854
- Thought it would go away!
- You have pain anywhere else?

477
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,828
- Scale of 1-10, how's your pain?
- Forty.

478
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,230
- How you feel?
- Talk to the elephant on my chest.

479
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,926
- It could...
- Excuse me. You mind?

480
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,231
- What are your names?
- I'm Pete and he's Derek.

481
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,931
Can you take Pete and Derek
to the TV room. One, Pratt!

482
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,235
Okay, here. Come on.

483
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,844
Is there any way that we can
wait in the doctors' lounge?

484
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,447
As soon as you're a doctor.

485
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,778
- Tombstones in two, three and F.
- Better with the spray under your tongue?

486
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,715
No. What do you
mean by "tombstones?"

487
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,448
It's a non-medical way of describing
the line tracings on an EKG.

488
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:55,116
It's not good news, Mr. Royston. It
looks like you're having a heart attack.

489
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,625
- Aspirin?
- Already gave him 80.

490
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,197
Push five of Metoprolol, titrate
morphine, start heparin and nitro drips.

491
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:03,268
- Call Cards and cath lab.
- What's going on? What's he gonna do?

492
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,596
There's a blocked vessel.

493
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,966
We open it with a
balloon to stop your attack.

494
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,404
We need your permission.
It's called angioplasty.

495
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:13,068
- Sign for me.
- Cath lab will be ready in 30 minutes.

496
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,214
- He's a hot MI.
- They're finishing a pacer.

497
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,907
While they're messing
around, he's killing heart cells.

498
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,949
It'll give us time to medicate.
- V-tach.

499
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,247
Like I said. CARTER:
Charge paddles to 200.

500
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:26,290
- No pulse. Starting compressions.
- Abby, open an intubation tray.

501
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,792
Let's get Cardiology
in here! And, clear.

502
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,256
The doctors there
will give you antibiotics.

503
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,401
Make sure to get that
wound checked in two days.

504
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,433
- Right.
- So he's good to go?

505
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,731
- Later, I guess.
- She's pregnant.

506
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,498
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

507
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,335
I told you, man,
she's not my girlfriend!

508
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:48,009
Well, whoever she is to
you, she's carrying your baby.

509
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,174
- Why don't you care?
- Why do you?

510
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,291
Three-sixty again. Clear.

511
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,859
- Still fib.
- Resuming compressions.

512
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,592
- Is this my consult?
- Acute inferior MI.

513
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,203
Refractory V-fib despite
lidocaine and procainamide.

514
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,838
Want to go TNK?

515
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,668
Isn't gonna make
it to the cath lab.

516
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,709
I've been pounding on him.
He'll bleed out with thrombolytics.

517
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,880
- Who's talking?
- Pratt, first-year Resident.

518
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,947
Then shut up.

519
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,293
CPR as a contra-indication
to thrombolytics...

520
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,842
has been debunked. It's a myth.

521
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,923
- Forty of Tenecteplase, IV push.
- Charging to 360, and clear.

522
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,224
A boatload from Lake Michigan
just came with alcohol poisoning.

523
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,860
- Kids?
- Worse. Parents.

524
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,554
The 10-year-old was the
only one sober enough to dock.

525
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,290
Do you think it's too late
to go into Dermatology?

526
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,901
- Excuse me, doctor?
- Yes?

527
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,368
I had a message that said my
daughter was in a motorcycle accident.

528
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,439
Her name is Sasha,
Sasha Huffner.

529
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,632
Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'll
check on her for you.

530
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,744
- Thanks.
- Wait right there.

531
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,328
Susan, did you order
a urine tox screen...?

532
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:57,352
Check my orders.

533
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,849
Elizabeth?

534
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,747
This guy with the
ringworm, he's...

535
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,013
Can you hang on a
second? Elizabeth.

536
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,920
And an abdominal CT with
contrast and two grams of cefotetan.

537
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,084
- Can we talk?
- I'm on my way to the OR...

538
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,059
with a bowel
obstruction, if it can wait.

539
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,199
Sasha Huffner's father's here.

540
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,699
- Your first patient, the DOA.
- Right, right.

541
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,031
Look, if you want, I
can tell him for you.

542
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,934
Why would I want that?

543
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,572
You're on your way to surgery.

544
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,334
- It's depressing.
- What's his name?

545
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,536
- Paul. He's standing over...
- I'll find him.

546
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,539
Hold compressions.

547
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,619
- Fine V-fib. PRATT:
Resuming compressions.

548
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,254
How long has it been?

549
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,684
Forty-two minutes.

550
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:41,887
Okay, that's it. Call
it. You can stop now.

551
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,488
Time of death is 7:11.

552
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,693
- Wife here?
- She's on her way.

553
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,636
- You should still wait.
- Can't lie to them now.

554
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,281
Want to turn off that monitor?

555
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,086
- Whoa! He's in V-tach.
- What?

556
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,949
I can shock that.

557
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,283
They pronounced him.

558
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,824
Yeah, well, now he's got a
good rhythm. Two hundred. Clear.

559
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,723
Yeah. Still V-tach.
That's enough, Pratt.

560
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,330
- Bag him. Do it!
- No! He's dead!

561
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,932
Three hundred. Clear.

562
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:24,668
Oh, my God.

563
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,540
Sinus tach. I said, bag him.

564
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,613
We did everything that we could.

565
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,182
We had three doctors
working on him for over an hour.

566
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:42,753
We gave him medicine and we shocked
his heart, but it didn't do any good.

567
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,490
- Why not?
- Because his heart was very, very sick.

568
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,525
And it was too sick to save.

569
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,823
I shouldn't have
made him play ball.

570
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:56,029
- I mean, he said he was tired.
- No, no. It's not your fault.

571
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,103
It's not your fault. Your dad had
a problem nobody knew about.

572
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:02,833
Not you, not your
mom, and not even him.

573
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:07,271
You gave him the best possible chance
he had by getting him to the hospital.

574
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,074
He can't be dead.

575
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,013
I'm sorry, Pete, he is dead.

576
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,586
And it's very sad. And
it's very unexpected.

577
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:20,789
And it's okay to cry. It's just a sign
of how much you loved your dad.

578
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,623
Do you guys want to see him?

579
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,898
You can say goodbye?

580
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,103
Yeah.

581
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,740
Okay.

582
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,409
You need to know your dad's gonna
have a lot of tubes attached to him.

583
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,742
And it might be a little scary.

584
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,742
- It's okay.
- Ready?

585
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,896
Keep the lidocaine at
two milligrams per minute...

586
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,183
and page the CCU team.

587
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,324
- What are you doing?
- I got him back.

588
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,818
What the hell's going on?

589
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,928
BP's 90 palp. He's back.

590
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,564
- He's alive?
- He's not dead.

591
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,025
Daddy's alive!

592
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,203
- Mr. Huffner?
- Yes.

593
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,539
I'm Dr. Corday. I'm a
surgeon here at County...

594
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,703
and I was your daughter's
physician this morning.

595
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,214
Did you operate on
her? Is she all right?

596
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:21,153
I mean, where is she?

597
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,846
Can I see her?

598
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,521
I'm afraid your daughter
died this morning.

599
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,862
She came in essentially DOA
with massive internal injuries...

600
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,295
from a motorcycle accident.

601
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,595
My God.

602
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,902
Someone can take
you to see the body.

603
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,475
We've kept it in the
department for your benefit.

604
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,109
And afterwards you can make
arrangements with the morgue.

605
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,679
A nurse can give you
information about grief counseling.

606
00:30:56,822 --> 00:31:01,192
She's my little
baby. Is she gone?

607
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,590
I'm sorry.

608
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,938
Nobody walks out of a
hospital after 40 minutes of CPR.

609
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:23,981
There was improvement.
From V-fib to V-tach.

610
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:25,829
He's either dead
or should be dead.

611
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,318
Which means your Resident
is cruel, stupid, or both!

612
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,150
He saw a shockable rhythm
in the setting of thrombolytics.

613
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,191
It could take 30 minutes for
TNK to open the coronary artery.

614
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,022
- Are you defending this?
- He made a split-second decision.

615
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,198
He was acting in the
interest of his patient.

616
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,926
Well, he was wrong. And now we have
a vegetable with a pulse on our hands.

617
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,602
Well, our names are
on the chart, not yours.

618
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:50,536
Dr. Pratt and I will take full
responsibility for any negative outcome.

619
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,439
Oh, you bet your ass you will.

620
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:06,892
Hey, I just want to say thanks
for backing me up like that.

621
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,862
A Chief Resident...

622
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,227
and a cardiologist with more
than 25 years of experience...

623
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,799
pronounce a man dead.

624
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,863
And you decide to resurrect him.

625
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:21,571
- Yes. But just like you said...
- Think I defended you because I like you?

626
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,969
Or I approve of the way
you practice medicine?

627
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,373
You are my responsibility.
You are my job.

628
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,343
And I'm doing mine.

629
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,812
If you wanted to shock,
you could have paged me.

630
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,419
I could have been here in a second
and we could have discussed it.

631
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:36,646
Instead, you go off!

632
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:39,917
Without regard for authority or
the best interest of your patient.

633
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,252
Now, that's not true.

634
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,225
The guy's got kids. He's got a
wife. I was trying to save him...

635
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,230
You brought the man back,
Pratt, because you felt like it!

636
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,060
Because you wanted
to see if you could.

637
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,850
Why's he still sleeping?

638
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,024
He didn't get enough
oxygen to the brain.

639
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,320
So we have to wait
and see if he wakes up.

640
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,824
You know, there's a
chance he might not.

641
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,290
Why's that?

642
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,695
He's just taking a nap is all.

643
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,698
Pete, your dad's
still pretty sick.

644
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,499
Yeah.

645
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,970
But you saved his life.

646
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,377
Hey, you guys hungry?

647
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,714
Come on. Let's go down to the cafeteria.
I'll get you something to eat. All right?

648
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,223
I'll take you where
the doctors eat.

649
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:51,091
My daddy doesn't like
doctors, but I bet he'd like you.

650
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:58,229
You tired?

651
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:03,137
There's gotta be a better word
for it. Enervated, asthenic, atonic?

652
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,140
- Pooped?
- Bingo.

653
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,404
Does that mean you
want to stay home tonight?

654
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,137
Not necessarily.

655
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,374
Anything particular
come to mind?

656
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,384
You keep working that spot,
I'll do whatever you want.

657
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,920
You know, I do need my
sock drawer organized.

658
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,183
Can you help me? They told
me my husband was back here.

659
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,986
He had a heart attack.

660
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,794
Mrs. Royston?

661
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,133
Even though we got
his heart beating again...

662
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:34,237
the neurologic tests showed that
there's a lack of basic brain function.

663
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:38,938
- What that means is that...
- I know what it means.

664
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,409
How long can he last like this?

665
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,784
Indefinitely.

666
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,757
Did your husband
leave any instructions?

667
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,292
Did he ever
express his wishes...

668
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,363
about what should be
done in a situation like this?

669
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,457
He's 42 years old.

670
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:08,237
Then I need to ask you, if
his heart stops beating again...

671
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,808
do you want heroic measures
taken to save his life?

672
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,542
Or do you want to sign a
Do Not Resuscitate order?

673
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:24,079
Is that the right thing to do?

674
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,490
I can't make that
decision for you.

675
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,267
Is it the right thing to do?

676
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,899
Yes.

677
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,805
I want to thank
you, Dr. Gallant.

678
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,909
There's no need,
Mrs. Teasley. No need.

679
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:49,172
I just get, I don't know,
panicky in public places.

680
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,112
You know, that's why you need
to keep taking your Klonopin.

681
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:56,220
- Well, I hope I wasn't too much trouble.
- Oh, not at all. Not at all.

682
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,516
Gallant.

683
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,692
You want to explain
why Stella's still here?

684
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:03,829
- I'm waiting on some lab work.
- Who said you could order labs?

685
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,588
- No one. I thought...
- You're here...

686
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,529
to assess psychiatric problems,
not do a medical workup.

687
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,759
I realize that. I think
she is really sick.

688
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,529
You looking for these? - What?

689
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,866
- Her TSH level is over a hundred.
- Stella?

690
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:20,308
Well, she's hypothyroid, which explains
all of her symptoms. Depression, fatigue...

691
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,380
But not the fact that she's a
con artist and a hypochondriac.

692
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,382
Until your rotation is over, you
are not a member of this ER.

693
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,715
Stop doing our work, start doing
the work of your current department.

694
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,880
- Yes, ma'am.
- But good catch. You off soon?

695
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,116
In a few minutes, yeah.

696
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:37,752
Do me a favor. Discharge Stella before you
leave. I feel like crap. I'm going home.

697
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:41,127
Yeah. We sent the
labs out this morning.

698
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,264
- She's been here for 24 hours...
- Something's wrong with my dad!

699
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,635
Hey, Pratt! Can you get in here?

700
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,534
Mama, what's wrong?

701
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,736
Mrs. Royston, did
you sign the DNR?

702
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,141
You gotta help my dad.

703
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,138
He's in arrest.

704
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,150
Mrs. Royston, did
you sign the DNR?

705
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,317
What's a DNR?

706
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,926
It means that your dad is too
sick for us to try to help him.

707
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:13,088
- Why can't she?
- Because he's already gone, baby.

708
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:17,929
No, he's not! No, he's
not. He saved him.

709
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,097
- He said he was gonna be okay.
- Derek, we tried.

710
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:26,602
- Why are you letting him die?
- Baby, please...

711
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,980
You gotta help. Mama, tell
them to do something, please.

712
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,447
Why are you doing this?

713
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,216
Asystole.

714
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,915
Why?

715
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,562
Daddy?

716
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,771
Rominger's not an appy.

717
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,967
Twenty-five, male, periumbilical to the
lower right quadrant. He's a poster boy.

718
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,806
You can bring him
back in 12 hours.

719
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:04,711
Oh, Dr. Lewis asked that you
take a look at the cholecystitis.

720
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,142
Page the next shift.

721
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,877
- Do you want to take a call from Neuro?
- If it's urgent.

722
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,544
- You forgot to sign off.
- Oh.

723
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,418
So, uh, how are you feeling?

724
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,992
It's about the GSW you
handled earlier. Alma Salazar.

725
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,629
I'm fine.

726
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:23,360
- You wanted to know her status.
- What is it? You gonna tell me?

727
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,401
She's a quad.

728
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,647
Hey.

729
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,188
Hi.

730
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,561
Oh. You're not
gonna wake him up?

731
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:03,224
- No.
- Didn't you two come in together?

732
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,403
Yeah. I'm sure he can find
his way home without me.

733
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,370
- You need a lift then?
- No, thanks.

734
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:11,834
Have a good night.

735
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,586
Oh, man.

736
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,988
Oh, man! I don't know.
This is the craziest movie!

737
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,894
Hey, yo. What's all this?

738
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,860
Pay-per-view. Want some pizza?

739
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:36,433
Yo, Biz. Let me talk to you for a minute.
- Yo, I'm watching a movie, man.

740
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,002
If I gotta come there, I'm
gonna smack fire at you.

741
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,571
Come here, man! Let
me talk to you for a minute.

742
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,038
Come on, man! Hurry
up! Come here, man.

743
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,403
What's your problem?

744
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:49,006
I thought I told you, man,
don't come here again!

745
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:53,415
Stay away from him!
You understand that?

746
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,980
- Yo, I'm saying, now you his mama, yo?
- What?

747
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:58,848
Yo, man, chill out!

748
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,015
- You hear what I'm saying?
- Why you tripping?

749
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,319
Don't play with me, man.

750
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,790
All right, that's it! The
party's over! Everybody out!

751
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,796
Come on, man, get up!
You too, get up! All y'all!

752
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,227
Get up and get out!

753
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,931
Yo, my man, are you stupid?

754
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,131
- Come on. Come on.
- What you doing, G?

755
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,935
Get out. Close the
door behind you.

756
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,271
What's wrong, G? Yo,
I'll holler at y'all later?

757
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:21,811
All right.

758
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:25,641
- Those are my friends, G!
- Yeah? Well, this is my house.

759
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,421
It's mine too.

760
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,122
Oh, yeah? Oh, what? You pay
rent? Come on. Watch out, man.

761
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,818
No. Does that mean I
can't have no friends?

762
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,661
Just be quiet. I'm tired.

763
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,959
Yeah. You tired, all
right. Grouchy too.

764
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,962
Yo.

765
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,067
You know those guys are
just using you, right? Hm?

766
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,667
Yo, dog.

767
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,577
How they blow up a whole town
like that without killing anybody?

768
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,648
They don't.

769
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,550
And if you shot the gun that close,
he'd blow his eardrums out too.

770
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,921
Yo, G. It's just a movie, man.
You ain't got to take it so seriously.

771
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,686
Yeah, whatever.

772
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,497
But she's hot, though.

773
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:20,070
Most definitely. You right about
that, G. Yo, you still want some pizza?

774
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,883
Uh.

775
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,988
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

776
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,601
- How long have I been in there?
- Since before my shift started.

777
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:51,499
Is Abby here?

778
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,865
Nope. But she
left you a Post-it.

779
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,800
And you still have a med
student waiting for you.

780
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,148
Hey.

781
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,382
Look, I'm sorry. The day
just kind of got away from me.

782
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:12,820
- Why don't we try again tomorrow?
- No. No, I don't think so. No.

783
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,189
I have been here for 16
hours. I have been ignored...

784
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,765
and yelled at, and called "honey,"
and "sweetie," and "bitch" twice.

785
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,426
I don't smell good. And all I've had
to eat is gummi bears and Diet Coke.

786
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,231
I'm not leaving until
I get what I came for.

787
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:35,069
This is the Admit area.

788
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,944
This is the center of the ER universe,
where you pick up your patients' charts...

789
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,746
order labs, spend the bulk of
your life for the next three months.

790
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,515
- How do you know who's next?
- You check that chart rack.

791
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,591
We see people in
the order they arrive...

792
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,091
unless the nurse feels
they're of high acuity.

793
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:52,457
- Then they're moved ahead.
- Do you get to suture?

794
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,689
If you're supervised
by an Attending...
