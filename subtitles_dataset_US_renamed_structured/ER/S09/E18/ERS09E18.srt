1
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,448
That was a gift.

2
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,679
From a grateful patient?

3
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,180
Grateful girlfriend.

4
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,953
I have meetings with department heads
later. Otherwise, I would have waited.

5
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,857
Oh, yeah. Of course.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,723
I'll have all this sent to
your home by week's end.

7
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:33,992
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah?

8
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,159
- Maintenance is here.
- Send him in.

9
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,002
What happened to Brenda?

10
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,368
I had to let her go.

11
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:45,343
She seemed unwilling
to make the transition.

12
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:49,210
Centered, right above the backs
of the chairs and at museum level.

13
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,650
Oh, museum level.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,413
Always hated the impressionists.

15
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,581
Look, it's a lateral
move, Robert.

16
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,522
All that sugarcoating
of the truth.

17
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,423
Believe me, it wasn't my idea.

18
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,327
Dr. Anspaugh thought it
might be a good interim step.

19
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:09,163
That's strange, because this power
play smacks of a certain estrogen-based...

20
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:12,773
- malice I've grown all too familiar with.
- You know...

21
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:17,770
I wish you'd try to appreciate the fact
that we're trying to do you a favor here.

22
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,742
What you're doing
is bending me over...

23
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,712
and driving it up the chocolate
highway. Let's be honest.

24
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,853
You're a one-handed
surgeon, Robert.

25
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,511
Not to mention a Human
Resources nightmare...

26
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:33,627
and a lousy administrator who's burned
more bridges than you've ever built.

27
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,723
You're lucky to
have options at all.

28
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,731
- Oh, you're suggesting I have some.
- Yes, you do. You have three. It's this...

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,892
it's teaching or it's out.

30
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:50,806
- Dr. Romano, can I get your address...?
- Bite me, Nancy.

31
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,741
I have some billing givebacks...

32
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,745
- that need to be signed.
- Not my job.

33
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,907
- Cardio admin's on line one.
- Take a message.

34
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,814
What do I tell them?

35
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,821
That I don't work here anymore.

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,830
Check the line. NURSE: BP's
dropping. Pulse ox is down.

37
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,164
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking her to X-ray.

38
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,570
That's what orderlies are for. Go
help someone drain an abscess.

39
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,576
- Yeah, but I got...
- You're a med student.

40
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,681
Hey, green card, I want all your
performance evals by day's end.

41
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,578
- Why?
- Something to read on the can.

42
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,616
Why do you think?
You're on my hit list.

43
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,583
- Who supplies the scrubs?
- Allied.

44
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,189
Switch to Lindeman's.
They hug booty better.

45
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,154
The hell are you looking at?

46
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,850
Oh, hey, everybody. Great
news, piñata out in the parking lot.

47
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,922
- They're here for their kid.
- They need to stop having kids.

48
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,828
- Clear them out or you're fired.
- What?

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,765
- Let me rephrase that. You're fired.
- You can't fire nurses.

50
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,098
- I just did. Hey, pituitary boy.
- Talking to me?

51
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:56,266
I lost my arm, not my olfactory nerve. Sic
Security on the bum taking a crap there...

52
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,436
and get a list of every staff
member's salary, including yours.

53
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,139
- What was that all about?
- Meet the new boss.

54
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,946
Get rid of this coffee machine in here!
You losers can pay for your own java.

55
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,470
Oooh, times like this, I
wish I practiced in Florida.

56
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,510
Nah. It's too humid.
Plus, you'd miss me.

57
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,207
- Ha. Well, I wouldn't miss the wind chill.
- Dr. Chen. How many candles?

58
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,715
Hey, I said no cake.

59
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,411
- Happy birthday, Jing-Mei.
- Ha. Like you even knew.

60
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,919
- Yes, I did.
- Uh-huh.

61
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,716
And I got you something.

62
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,257
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

63
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,488
I figured if you aren't busy later, I
would take you over to The Grotto.

64
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,894
- Maybe get some champagne afterwards.
- Ooh.

65
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,059
- You thought this through, didn't you?
- Yes. Why wouldn't I?

66
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:33,697
How you doing? Jewelry and personal
accessories, all at discount rates.

67
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,035
Uh, no, thanks.

68
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,870
Ladies love stuffed animals.

69
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,069
- Five bucks.
- Don't make me hurt you.

70
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:42,705
This is America. If you can't
sell crap, we're not a free society.

71
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,215
Come on, get out of my way.

72
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,446
I should be back by 6. She woke up
early, so make sure she takes a nap, okay?

73
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,147
Hey, you like the sign I put up?

74
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,889
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, sweet.

75
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,962
Okay, my darling. Bye-bye.

76
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,894
Hey, kids love stuffed animals.

77
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,364
- Five bucks for this little cutie.
- No, thank you.

78
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:05,302
- It comes in pink. I got dolls too.
- Just go. Go, go.

79
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,979
My foot! My foot!

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,082
Told Haleh she was fired,
said it was a management tool.

81
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,083
Always fire someone the first
day. Lets them know who's boss.

82
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,744
He can call himself king
as long as I get severance.

83
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,653
Hey, Abby. Can you park
Mrs. Strohm here in Exam 1?

84
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,158
Uh, no. We lost
another exam room.

85
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,757
We'll park her in the hall.

86
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,275
Weaver never had an office.

87
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:33,423
He'll take the lounge
if we're not careful.

88
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,626
And put our lockers where?
- Triage?

89
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,829
Oh, that's great. So now our
personal stuff can get stolen too.

90
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,442
Too late. Brand-new leather
gloves, right out of my locker.

91
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,736
Real leather?

92
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,074
- Yeah, why?
- Animals died to make them.

93
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,113
Right. And we should
all wear canvas shoes.

94
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,085
- Oh, God!
- Could use a little help here.

95
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,654
- What happened?
- Corday's nanny ran over his foot.

96
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,315
- With her freaking minivan. I'm crippled.
- How did this become your problem?

97
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,518
Elizabeth decided
it was an ER case.

98
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,128
It's typical. We
got any open beds?

99
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,992
Yeah, if he's a paying customer.

100
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,760
Otherwise, the hall. For anyone late...
- Park him here.

101
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:12,099
I'm now in charge. Say goodbye to
the warm fuzzies of the Weaver era...

102
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:16,539
hello to the age of efficiency and cost
effectiveness. Tardiness will result...

103
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,475
in a docked paycheck and/or letter
to file. Once get to work on time...

104
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:24,482
you will treat, street and do so
quickly. Any questions? Didn't think so.

105
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,950
Medevac, two minutes
out. Auto versus ped.

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,487
Kovac and Carter. Keep
dispositions under 20 minutes.

107
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,818
Doctors Lewis, Chen
and Pratt, clear the board.

108
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,826
You get me a breakfast burrito,
extra cheese, hold the salsa.

109
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,328
- "Please"?
- Get your love at home.

110
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,997
Should be interesting.

111
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,071
Romano in charge.

112
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,670
Seen any movies lately?

113
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,640
Nope.

114
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,407
Try that sushi place
at Navy Pier yet?

115
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,074
No.

116
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,776
It's good.

117
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,723
Long time now...

118
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,095
that you've been
together. A year?

119
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,429
Almost.

120
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,296
That's nice.

121
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:27,413
Josh Rushing, 37. Found down
along old Route 10 outside of Pembroke.

122
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,550
- Long way from County.
- Busy day. We go where they tell us.

123
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,711
Scalp lac, multiple contusions. Probable
hit-and-run. He's suffering from exposure.

124
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,220
Been down a while. Homeless?

125
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,451
After a couple days out, everybody looks
homeless. Is Susan Lewis working today?

126
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,890
Yeah, why?

127
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:45,726
Jackknifed rig on the Dan Ryan
with an SUV trapped underneath.

128
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,197
Damn it, we gotta go.

129
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,394
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three.

130
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,699
CBC, lytes, BUN and creatin.
Let's get an Accu-Chek.

131
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,705
Wallet says he's from Indiana.

132
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,242
What's he doing walking
the back roads of Illinois?

133
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,243
Got a clavicle
deformity on the left.

134
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,613
Maybe he was exercising.

135
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:06,083
Eighteen in the right AC with
a liter up. Accu-Chek is, uh, 96.

136
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,414
- Not in loafers.
- Pretty isolated out that way.

137
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,750
- Lucky they found him at all.
- What do we got?

138
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,258
We got a possible car versus
pedestrian. Vitals stable but unresponsive.

139
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,261
This is why I went to school,
to practice veterinary medicine.

140
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,331
- On the monitor. Systolic, 96.
- SonoSite.

141
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,991
- He doesn't need a chest tube.
- I'll be the judge.

142
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,932
Dr. Kovac, a call
for you on line one.

143
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,970
- Not during a trauma.
- Who is it?

144
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,301
It's a collect
person-to-person from Zagreb.

145
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,807
No blood in Morrison's.

146
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,672
- Your dad? ROMANO:
No free fluid, no...

147
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,280
- Someone named Gordana.
- Pericardial effusion. Catch. May I?

148
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,275
Hello. Uh, don't ever
call this number again.

149
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,354
- Why did you do that?
- Hey, you wanna talk to folks at home...

150
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,357
- dial 10-10-Call-the-Third-World.
- Okay. C-spine, chest and pelvis to start.

151
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,290
He needs a rectal.

152
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:53,291
Oh, um, I took the liberty of checking
the union manual. You can't fire nurses.

153
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,369
They have their own administration.
You lodge a complaint with their manager.

154
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,268
Fine. Tell Hally, or
whatever, that she can stay.

155
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,033
She already went home.

156
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,111
Uh, then have her come back. Make
sure she deducts for the time she was gone.

157
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,647
And give me bullet points on who I
can pink-slip and for what reasons.

158
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,980
There are six unions on the
floor. That's 12 volumes of material.

159
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,054
Fine. Do yours last.

160
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,283
Dr. Lewis. So,
what's the story here?

161
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,486
Sammy got ahold
of Dad's nail gun.

162
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,723
- Who knew he'd use it as a weapon?
- He's 7, everything's a weapon.

163
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,197
This the nail-gun injury?
- Yeah.

164
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,735
Well, Dr. Corday's got this now.

165
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,031
Apparently, Sammy
didn't think it was loaded.

166
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,175
No. I knew.

167
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:42,678
Well, the puncture appears to
have glanced off the rib. You'll be fine.

168
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,876
- DT and a gram of Ancef?
- Yeah.

169
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:50,387
And, uh, a Psych consult
for the son, perhaps.

170
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,186
- How's it going down here?
- Wanna hear something scary?

171
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,260
I miss Weaver.

172
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,101
Fresh pot. Enjoy
it while you can.

173
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,602
- How you doing?
- Very well, thanks.

174
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,212
New digs, new challenges,
crappy coffee. Interest you in a cup?

175
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,040
I'll pass.

176
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,773
Smart woman.

177
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,717
Look, I think it's awful,
just to let you know.

178
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:25,014
A waste, really, of your...
Of your skills, your talent.

179
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,624
But, um, I'm sure
it'll be temporary.

180
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,720
Yeah.

181
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,629
Anything I can to do help?

182
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,730
You could shoot me now.

183
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,207
BP's stable, 120/78.
And the tox screen's back.

184
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,812
No drugs or alcohol
in his system. Crit's 50.

185
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,916
Hemo concentrated.
Neuro exam looks non-focal.

186
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,748
I don't know. On his own, no
car, out in the middle of nowhere...

187
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,085
- Think he was robbed?
- Still had his wallet with him.

188
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,920
Maybe he got dumped.

189
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,653
- I don't know.
- Maybe his wife knows.

190
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,760
He's wearing a wedding
ring. They're trying to find her.

191
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,595
Hundred of
thiamine, just in case.

192
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,604
- Did you know about it?
- What?

193
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,799
- The Romano coup d'état.
- No idea.

194
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,773
- Does it mean anything?
- We're screwed.

195
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,606
Push the admin meeting to 4...

196
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,772
and tell the alderman
I'm out of the office.

197
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,315
- Dr. Weaver.
- John, I have to turn over a number...

198
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:30,150
of outstanding projects.
Residents time study.

199
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,452
QA of our
portable-ultrasound training.

200
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,653
I'd be really grateful if
you'd see them through.

201
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,798
Sure. WEAVER: Excellent.

202
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,629
So how long is Romano
gonna be down here?

203
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,869
- You think it's not permanent?
- Because whoever runs the department...

204
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,009
needs communication
and clinical skills.

205
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,872
He is, uh...

206
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,671
He's an experienced physician.

207
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,646
His background is entirely surgical.
- John...

208
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,151
you have to be associate professor
before being department head.

209
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:05,588
I don't want his job, Kerry, I just
don't wanna have to do two of them.

210
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:13,198
All right. Which one of you
smartasses stole my crutch?

211
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,903
You have any plans for tonight?

212
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:22,542
Oh, me and this guy named TiVo, we're
gonna curl up in front of the TV. You?

213
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,143
Nah.

214
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,878
Everything okay?

215
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,008
Woman I went to med school with
has a patient who's very sick. Young boy.

216
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,848
Is he terminal?

217
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,923
Post-shunt tetrology
with pulmonary atresia.

218
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,649
- Oh.
- He's outgrowing the shunts.

219
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,920
He needs unifoc
and complete repair.

220
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,690
- That's a pretty specialized procedure.
- Yup. So special it can't be done there.

221
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,429
Nicky Broomer, fell while running.
Shoulder dislocation and rib fractures.

222
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,506
Vitals normal except
for pulse of 120.

223
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,609
- This guy's a runner?
- He's a junkie.

224
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,509
- He gets chased by the cops regularly.
- He fell on the sidewalk. It was wet.

225
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,742
- Are you high now, Nicky?
- No. And he's staying that way.

226
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,681
Mint condition, the entire lot.

227
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:10,017
The sky's the limit, as far as
markup. It's yours for only 30 bucks.

228
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,853
Hey, I thought you said you
couldn't walk, your foot hurt so bad.

229
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,655
I hopped.

230
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,357
- I'm on the phone here.
- Take two Tylenol every four hours...

231
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,556
and get a real job.

232
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,599
- Hey, it's at 3:00.
- What?

233
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,897
- Cake for Chen.
- Oh, right, right.

234
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,974
- What do you think? Flowers or candy?
- It's gotta be something she can wear.

235
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:33,112
Let's see who's losing the
dispo race. Why, that would be...

236
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,375
Dr. Pratt, who will now be punished for
his indolent ways. Lower-back pain in 2...

237
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,748
and an unknown intestinal
disturbance in 4. Chop-chop.

238
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,980
In second-to-last place
we have Dr. Lewis.

239
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,215
That's to be expected
from one who ovulates.

240
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,257
She gets the maggot
infestation in 2.

241
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,728
Of course, we have Mr. Gallant, who's
doing Cadillac workups on Yugo patients.

242
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,992
How are you, hon?
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

243
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,001
It says right here, "My blood
pressure is high." Well, hell, so is mine.

244
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,299
But rather than go to a busy ER, I
stay home and take my medication.

245
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,807
- Have you tried that?
- She's diabetic. Her EKG is...

246
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,606
Is unnecessary. Give her a sublingual
nifedipine and send her to clinic.

247
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,148
- Yeah, but that's not a...
- You filling a special-needs quota here?

248
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,948
Do you need me to say it slowly in your
people's language? Sublingual nifedipine.

249
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:20,423
When you're done with her, pick up
six more. She's your patient, not mother.

250
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,625
They letting anyone with a
check into med school these days?

251
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,631
- Gallant is one of our best students.
- Doesn't bode well for future medicine.

252
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,928
Maybe when he gets
his license, we'll be dead.

253
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,267
Typically, as Chief Resident, I
assign the med students their cases.

254
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,499
Ah, when? Every other Tuesday?

255
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,942
Any patient here over six hours is your
failure, not mine. Treat, turf or dispo.

256
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:45,313
You don't have a background in
emergency medicine. It isn't that simple.

257
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,544
- Feast or famine.
- Hey, you're back.

258
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,190
- Another chopper beat us. Susan around?
- Yeah.

259
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,986
Okay. Your screaming isn't
making our job any easier.

260
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:58,495
This is hard for him.

261
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,327
- Settle down, okay?
- It hurts like a son of a bitch.

262
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,198
It's going to continue to hurt
unless we pull your arm out.

263
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,498
- Please help me.
- Radial pulse is strong.

264
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,834
We should just give
him more Versed or fent.

265
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,876
- Yes, yes!
- We already did. Should be unconscious.

266
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,070
- Why is he still screaming?
- I don't know.

267
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,182
- His ribs are broken.
- That, and he's going through withdrawal.

268
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,512
- I can't take it, baby.
- Hey, Susan.

269
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,709
What?

270
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:24,289
- I got a guy here says he's your husband.
- What's he look like?

271
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,884
Uh, tall, dark
hair, flight nurse.

272
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,299
Yeah, that's him.

273
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,302
- You were in Vegas for, like, two days.
- And three nights.

274
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,414
We met on the plane on the
way over, hung out all weekend.

275
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,550
Were you sober at any point?

276
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,211
Sunday night, we wanted burgers.
So we took a cab to this drive-through.

277
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,290
Turns out to be a mini-chapel.

278
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,223
Ah, so you figured, "What
the hell. Let's get married."

279
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,260
I know. It was impulsive.

280
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,954
Impulsive?

281
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,063
- Okay, it was really, really stupid.
- Susan.

282
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:13,270
I'm getting it annulled, anyway.
Haven't seen him since the wedding night.

283
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,840
My flight left the next
morning. He stayed a week.

284
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,342
- He could have married six other women.
- Do you remember his name, at least?

285
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:24,340
Uh... Chuck... Martin, I think.

286
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,008
Good luck.

287
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,783
Hey, stranger.

288
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,950
- Hey.
- Look, nifedipine is contraindicated.

289
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,686
I'm not bottoming out her
pressure and stroking her out.

290
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,958
I know. He's the one that
needs to be educated about this.

291
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,158
And he wants to hear
that from a med student.

292
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,055
- Obviously, he needs to prove...
- Blah, blah, blah. Go talk to him.

293
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,434
If there's a problem,
I'll take care of it.

294
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,975
- Got a lot of people scared.
- Not you?

295
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,807
- I still need to pay my rent.
- Romano's bark is worse than his bite.

296
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,883
Easy for you to say. You
can walk away if you want to.

297
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,144
- Ah! I can't stand it.
- So Susan got married?

298
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,153
- Can't call her indecisive.
- Can call her crazy.

299
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,791
When are you people
gonna do something?

300
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,450
- So I spoke to an attorney.
- Uh, yeah, me too.

301
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,099
He said annulling it
should be fairly easy.

302
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,565
That's what my guy said.

303
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,703
- I have to admit, I was a little worried.
- Why?

304
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,302
Well, you know...

305
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,637
- it was consummated.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

306
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,540
- A few times, as I remember.
- More than a few times.

307
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,011
- The cabana?
- Right, right.

308
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,482
Right. But since we never lived together,
I figured it shouldn't be a problem.

309
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,646
- Did you tell anyone?
- Like who, my mom? She'd kick my ass...

310
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,485
- if I deprived her of a wedding.
- Same with mine.

311
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,254
- I figured it wasn't anyone's business.
- Exactly.

312
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,660
- And pretty tough to explain too.
- Please, who are you telling?

313
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,927
- You kind of had to have been there.
- Yeah. It made sense at the time.

314
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,101
Guess you have
to get back to work.

315
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,738
Yeah.

316
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,068
- So play hooky.
- Let's go.

317
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,767
Morales, you don't
write, you don't call...

318
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,838
No time to radio.

319
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,541
Twenty-four-year-old female
passed out. No trauma, no seizure.

320
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,879
- What? You were shopping?
- We were registering.

321
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,613
- She's pregnant.
- Don't tell me. You were gonna say that.

322
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,350
- BP's 100/60. Sats are good.
- Do you remember falling, Debra?

323
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,722
I remember feeling weak.
I haven't been eating.

324
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,297
Okay. Start a second line
and put up another liter.

325
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,627
- Morning sickness?
- Oh, bad.

326
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,235
My first wife had three
kids, she never even burped.

327
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,894
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

328
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,273
- What have we got?
- Debra Strickland. Pregnant, syncope.

329
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,434
- Eighteen weeks.
- Hi, Debra.

330
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,409
- Any cramping or spotting?
- No.

331
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,378
Okay. Let's spin a crit, check
her glucose and dip a urine to start.

332
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,541
- Ow.
- That hurts?

333
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,779
Mm-hm. And my belly.
It never did before.

334
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,617
How about when I do this?
- Ah, ow!

335
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,256
- Yeah.
- Abby, can you see if Linda Woo is here?

336
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,622
- I'll check.
- Finally get a surgical candidate?

337
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,788
- Oh, God. I need an operation?
- Not necessarily.

338
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,624
- Stripe in Morrison's.
- Yup.

339
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,761
Probably blood, judging from her
hypotension. Probe over the kidney.

340
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,134
It is.

341
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,673
Doesn't look like it.

342
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,467
It's not.

343
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,841
- Surgery's here.
- What do you have for me?

344
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:12,577
An 18-week IUP with hypotension,
intraperitoneal fluid and renal mass.

345
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,983
Obvious ex-lap for tissue
diagnosis and staging.

346
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,779
Who are you?

347
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:21,450
Dr. Robert Romano, head of surgery
a week ago. Who the hell are you?

348
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,119
This is Dr. Woo.
She started yesterday.

349
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,595
Do you have any medical
problems or allergies?

350
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:27,893
Are you deaf?

351
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,971
- Um, let me page Corday.
- I'll do it.

352
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,198
BP is dropping, 86/62.

353
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,809
Any moron can see she needs
surgical intervention for hemostasis.

354
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,003
I'm sorry, what's
your position here?

355
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,344
Your practical and intellectual superior
with 20 years of surgical experience...

356
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,146
versus the two years of
ass-wiping you call residency.

357
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,515
- Take her up.
- Done.

358
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,485
He was diagnosed at birth. But access to
any kind of care has been limited at best.

359
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,152
- He's been revised?
- Twice.

360
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,825
The last time, five years ago.

361
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:03,561
And the surgical team that performed
it in Croatia has disbanded since then.

362
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,364
And there's nothing
else in Europe?

363
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,836
Nothing they can afford.

364
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:12,035
County's pediatric thoracic group
does unifocalization, free of charge.

365
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,980
Yes. But he's not a citizen.

366
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,742
Neither are we. But we are here.

367
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,310
Even if you get a surgical team to donate
services, who's gonna pick up the tab?

368
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,923
With some PR, charitable
contributions could cover it.

369
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,255
But Kerry would still have to sign off
on it. Are you on good terms with her?

370
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,930
- Uh, not really.
- Well, neither am I.

371
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,329
- Leave it with me. I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

372
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,599
- Where's Dr. Woo?
- She left.

373
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,933
You need to teach
them to have thicker skin.

374
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,877
She cried a little.
Pratt's consoling her.

375
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:44,901
Oh, dear.

376
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,682
Right.

377
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,579
- Uh, intraperitoneal fluid and a mass.
- Pregnant with profound hypotension.

378
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,053
My guess, renal-cell CA.

379
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,193
Necrotic mass obscuring and
deforming the capsule of the kidney.

380
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,852
Bleeding across the peritoneum, more
likely metastases. She'll need surgery.

381
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,931
- Hello.
- I'd like a CT of the abdomen if I can.

382
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,295
And have OB involved
as well. She's stable now.

383
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,868
Why don't we
get a third consult.

384
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,028
Maybe, uh, ask the
janitor what he thinks.

385
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,539
I'm down here less than a day,
already I'm starting to hate surgeons.

386
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,602
Is something
wrong with the baby?

387
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,772
No. The baby's
quite healthy, actually.

388
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,415
- Dr. Romano, you have a minute?
- Less than.

389
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:29,487
It's about my high-blood-pressure patient.
I should've, uh, pointed it out to you.

390
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,717
Use of sublingual nifedipine is no longer
indicated because of case fatalities.

391
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:37,421
I never said nifedipine. I said
metropolol. Works fine for hypertension.

392
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,313
You said nifedipine.
You said it more th...

393
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:42,591
Listen. I'm the
doctor. You're not.

394
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,079
Seems that if it is
your intention to run...

395
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,103
My intention...

396
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,768
is to serve my time without having
affirmative-action imbeciles like you...

397
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,776
make me regret ever having
gone into medicine. Minute's up.

398
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,608
- Hey, where are my bullet points?
- Ah, right.

399
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,750
Well, you can't fire
medical students.

400
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,944
But failing them is bad because
they have to repeat the rotation.

401
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,453
I'd suggest a marginal pass.
- What else?

402
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,956
- You can, however, fire care partners.
- The hell's a care partner?

403
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,754
It's like a non-union orderly.

404
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,422
- Hey, you. What's your name?
- Jim.

405
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,089
Yeah. You pay union dues, Jim?

406
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,546
- No. ROMANO:
Good. You're fired.

407
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,432
- I need something.
- That is putting me on edge.

408
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:22,473
- Was worse when his girlfriend was here.
- Tell Lewis to gag, sedate or kill him.

409
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,475
- She's on break.
- Is there a prerequisite for working here?

410
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,546
You have to be a know-nothing
drag-ass who doesn't wear a watch?

411
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,310
I suspected Weaver would kill her
mother to get out of here. Now I know why.

412
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:36,148
Only the chief of emergency medicine
is concerned with clearing the board.

413
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,655
- You gotta help me.
- Hands off, lowlife.

414
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,690
All right, you. Where
are your parents?

415
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,956
I don't have any. They
died in a car crash last year.

416
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,531
- Bummer. What's your problem?
- I need it bad. I need something real bad.

417
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,966
- Let me guess...
- Could you move him to Exam 4?

418
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,661
My pleasure. Come on. - Jerry.

419
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,605
Wait. Just one more paragraph
in the lab-tech union manual.

420
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,346
Make sure that I see all Romano's
patients before anyone gets dispo'd?

421
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,379
- Sure.
- Thank you.

422
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,519
- Thank you.
- Doesn't mean you don't work with him.

423
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,211
Okay, where were we?

424
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,189
Um, I reached for the soap, down
I went, landed right on my rump.

425
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,420
Well, that's not good.
Any loss of consciousness?

426
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,029
No. Just loss of dignity.

427
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:21,861
- I know, I know. I'm late, I'm late.
- I had to move Nicky.

428
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,196
He was driving everybody crazy.
- Ah, thank you.

429
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,737
I sent up labs on your
hyperemesis patient.

430
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,035
- Dispo'd your no-longer-itchy rash guy.
- Was I gone that long?

431
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:33,373
You take Sandra, we'll call it
even. I gotta check on a patient.

432
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,605
- Done.
- Slip and fall in the shower.

433
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,511
Possible wrist fracture.

434
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:38,912
Congratulations.

435
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,019
- On what?
- Your newlywed status.

436
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,678
- Ha. Ooh, lucky.
- Excuse me?

437
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:47,418
Oh. I've been looking for Mr. Right
for 10 years and still haven't found him.

438
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,155
The last time it
happened, they kept me.

439
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,730
You done?

440
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,396
I think so. What
happened to your arm?

441
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,042
Are you incapable of
keeping your mouth shut?

442
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,112
- Were you born that way or something?
- None of your beeswax. Breathe deep.

443
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:12,746
Hey, what do you do for soft asthma?
A couple of nebs and some prednisone?

444
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,716
You're asking a nurse?

445
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,219
Yeah, what you said.

446
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,254
Only, I take an adult dose now.

447
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,223
What he said, I said. Then
discharge with follow-up. Okay...

448
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:25,888
that took all of eight minutes.
See, people? It can be done.

449
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,759
What can be done?

450
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,131
Oh, BS'ing your way
through a shift, I suppose.

451
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,932
Listen, I didn't mean
to be nosy before.

452
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,268
I was just making little talk.

453
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:41,907
- Small talk.
- Dr. Kovac, exposure guy is coming to.

454
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,105
Any word on his wife?

455
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:45,183
They're still trying
to get ahold of her.

456
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:49,015
Mr. Rushing? Mr. Rushing,
can you understand me?

457
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,453
- Yeah.
- Do you know what happened to you?

458
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:56,857
Car...
- crashed.
- Your car?

459
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,331
Where are they?

460
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,991
Who?

461
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,228
My kids.

462
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,132
We were driving...

463
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:09,867
walked to get help.

464
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,477
- Oh, my God.
- Go get the police.

465
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,045
His kids are still out
there somewhere.

466
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,314
- So how long have you been married?
- Um, two years.

467
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:27,358
Some people think the age difference
is a problem, but I can't keep up with him.

468
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,520
We're gonna minimize the
exposure to protect the baby.

469
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,906
"Our little accident,"
Bill likes to call him.

470
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,191
- Oh, you're having a boy?

471
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,496
Uh, just a guess. Will
you be able to tell?

472
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,163
- No, not with this.
- Oh, good. I wanna be surprised.

473
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:46,403
You have to lie very still. And there's
an intercom in case you wanna talk.

474
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,412
CT abdo-pelvis with...

475
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,788
- and without.
- Fine cuts right through the kidney.

476
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,051
When we shoot the rest of
the dye in, you may continue...

477
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,925
- to feel a warm, tingling sensation.
- Okay.

478
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,429
There it is.

479
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,196
Smaller masses in the
abdominal cavity too.

480
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,067
Hey, I'm just the tech.

481
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,877
Hematoma and fluid from
where the main tumor bled.

482
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,308
- She's gonna need a nephrectomy.
- Yeah, like now.

483
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:26,542
I guess Romano was
right about one thing today.

484
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,710
<i>Is it almost over?</i>

485
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,124
What are their names?

486
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,425
Sally...

487
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,957
and Tim.

488
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,261
Do you know how
badly they were hurt?

489
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,368
It was dark.

490
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,866
I just remember crying.

491
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,742
BP's stable,
128/80. Pulse is 106.

492
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,145
They were so scared.

493
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,483
- Luka?
- Another liter of warm saline.

494
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,648
Do you recall where it happened?

495
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,460
- Do you recall when it happened?
- No.

496
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,762
They're dead, aren't they?

497
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,561
- We're trying to find them.
- I'm gonna start calling some of this in.

498
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:20,172
- He's near the six-hour mark. Stable?
- Just finishing up a Heimlich.

499
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,275
Which is the cheesy ER way
of dealing with a pneumothorax.

500
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,241
I did it so he could stay here
in case his family is found.

501
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,176
Turf him to Medicine, let
them hold hands and sing there.

502
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:33,183
- His kids could be seriously hurt.
- But he's not, get him out of the room.

503
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:37,153
- Look...
- Mandatory therapy making you soft?

504
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,484
Do us both a favor.
Stop seeing your shrink.

505
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,288
I mean, I don't believe in it. And
frankly, if you're that screwed up, quit.

506
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,798
Where the hell have you
been? Get back to work.

507
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,861
Hey, welcome back.

508
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,833
Right. X-ray's backed up and
she's complaining of a headache.

509
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,533
Get her to Curtain 3 and give her
Tylenol. You could use a lunch tray by now.

510
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,974
What I could use is a husband.
Does yours have a brother?

511
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,850
Damn.

512
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,237
Hey, Kippy, my man.
What's happening?

513
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,816
Foot still hurts. I
should sue you clowns.

514
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,107
I'm in a rush. What
you got for ladies?

515
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,908
Stuffed animals.

516
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,014
No, man. I need something
that a lady can wear.

517
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,241
Uh...

518
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:42,980
Got some handmade jewelry,
some perfume, tie-dyed T-shirt.

519
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:46,648
- Uh-uh.
- Wait, I got some new items in.

520
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,932
How much?

521
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,001
What's this doing here?

522
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,233
Uh, we have cake
when there's a birthday.

523
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,037
A woman pops a kid out, what
difference does the day make?

524
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,703
No more official or unofficial
birthday recognitions.

525
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,781
Oh, you can't be serious.

526
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,885
Singing, blowing out candles,
eating. By the time it's done...

527
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,920
- everybody's had a break with pay.
- It fosters community.

528
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,251
And lethargy, by the
looks of it. Sandra Haycox.

529
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,120
- What about her?
- Broken wrist.

530
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:24,752
- Cast her and cast her off. Uh-uh.
- She's complaining of a headache now.

531
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,128
Have her take a number and get
back in line. One complaint per visit.

532
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,962
Hey, who ate my cake?

533
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,094
- Nana, Nana!
- What happened?

534
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:37,471
Eight-year-old, front-seat passenger
in single-car MVA. Airbag deployed.

535
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,805
- Pretty hard, from the looks of it.
- May have a ruptured globe.

536
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,539
- Why was she sitting in the front seat?
- Ask Grandma.

537
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,650
The tumor outgrew
its blood supply.

538
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:49,151
Then part of it died, ruptured and
bled. That's why you passed out.

539
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:53,258
It could rupture again at any moment.
So it's important that we remove it...

540
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,656
and the kidney as
soon as possible.

541
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,989
What kind of a tumor is it?

542
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:02,429
We don't know. And we won't
know until we get a pathology report.

543
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,325
Do you think it's cancer?

544
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,902
Let's take this
one step at a time.

545
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,941
My mother died of cancer.

546
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,432
And if that's what
this is, I should know.

547
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:14,340
Debra... I should know.

548
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:19,446
It appears likely to be
renal-cell carcinoma, yes.

549
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:23,180
And if it's as aggressive
as it seems, it's possible...

550
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:26,917
that you would require chemo and
radiation therapy following surgery.

551
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,764
Unfortunately, chemotherapy
is unadvisable while pregnant.

552
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,425
You said it was aggressive.

553
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:40,304
- Yes, but...
- Take it out.

554
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,132
Take everything.

555
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,243
Are you saying you
wish to terminate as well?

556
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,680
Just... Just do it all at once.

557
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,283
Typically, those procedures
would be done separately.

558
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,981
If you had surgery and
waited until the baby was born...

559
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,388
I want the chemo.

560
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,987
- Honey...
- I want it now.

561
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,334
We're gonna leave
you alone to talk.

562
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,040
I guess she figures she can
try again if she beats the cancer.

563
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:19,144
Three weeks, the fetus is viable
outside the womb. She could fight it then.

564
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:23,078
She doesn't wanna take that
chance. She's young. She's scared.

565
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,715
Yeah.

566
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,548
PH is still over nine. Pilar,
how many fingers do I have?

567
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,757
Think the blindness
is temporary?

568
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:45,199
I've seen alkali keratitis go both
ways, but this doesn't look good.

569
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,165
- How's Grandma?
- She needs an immobilizer for her knee.

570
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,105
Otherwise, she's fine.

571
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,777
What a difference
height makes, huh?

572
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,573
Ugh, why would anyone
put their kid in the front seat?

573
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,343
She begged me to.
She's my only grandchild.

574
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,010
I just wanted to make her happy.

575
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,123
Could you grab a couple of Morgan
Lenses from the eye-exam room?

576
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,952
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, this isn't going down...

577
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,392
- as one of my better days.
- I think that applies to all of us.

578
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:15,091
Wait a minute. Why is
it quiet all of a sudden?

579
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,140
- Unbelievable.
- It was too hard to watch.

580
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,664
So you went out and scored?

581
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:31,908
- You weren't doing anything. I had to.
- You want Narcan?

582
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,877
Put him on a monitor.
At least someone's happy.

583
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:39,356
Of course, it would be pro bono.

584
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:43,627
You looked at our budget? Every
time we open our doors we're pro bono.

585
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,423
We're in a deep
deficit, Elizabeth.

586
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:49,329
I could contact surgeons and specialists,
ask them to donate their services.

587
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:54,303
Which would account for 25 percent
of the total cost. Forget about Medicaid.

588
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,998
The boy's not even a citizen.

589
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,075
That might interest the media.

590
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,304
Look at the separation of the
Guatemalan conjoined twins.

591
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:06,281
I don't think a Croatian kid needing a
tet repair is gonna get the same draw.

592
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:11,088
Kerry, he's 9 years
old. He'll die without it.

593
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:14,590
And we're just not able
to help right now. I'm sorry.

594
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:24,329
Kerry, can I ask you something? Are
you as concerned about Robert as I am?

595
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,167
Uh, more precisely,
his mental health.

596
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,138
He seems...

597
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,541
broken by this assignment.

598
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,703
He's a cockroach.

599
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:38,111
He'll refuse to evolve
and yet survive us all.

600
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,447
- Talk to me about Residents.
- You need documentation.

601
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:48,219
But you have a more
powerful weapon in scheduling.

602
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:52,557
They don't pull 16 shifts a month or
work more than three nights in a row...

603
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:56,395
you can book them for every weekend,
holiday or playoff night you want.

604
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:57,627
- Good stuff.
- Thank you.

605
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,067
How come the delinquent
hasn't been dispo'd yet?

606
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,400
Uh, that was on my
list of things to do.

607
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:05,840
You didn't give Eddie enough
prednisone with his albuterol.

608
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,908
Let me get something straight.
You overrode my orders?

609
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,675
Yeah. Before he can leave,
he needs to be able to walk...

610
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,751
and hold normal
sats, which he can't.

611
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,421
- Uh-oh. You screwed up.
- No, I did not.

612
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,888
- Maybe you haven't been listening.
- There's basic medical treatments...

613
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,018
- There's people here who can help...
- You don't question my judgment.

614
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:28,826
And you sure as hell don't get
too comfortable here, Dr. Carter!

615
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,094
This is my ER now!

616
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,967
That stands for one thing:
Everyone's replaceable!

617
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,970
Even you.

618
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,947
I need to know what
to tell the guy. All right.

619
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,553
- That better be a local call.
- It's a police matter.

620
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,918
- They haven't found the car?
- We checked every road, bridge, river...

621
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,991
- within five miles.
- Why not 10 or 15?

622
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:57,390
- He can't have walked that far.
- He was getting help for his children.

623
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,963
- He could have walked 100 miles.
- What can I say...

624
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,829
- we already covered a lot of territory.
- Search teams? It's 40 degrees there.

625
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,493
Look, we're doing all we can.

626
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:09,106
- Luka, where's Dr. Romano?
- I don't know and I don't care.

627
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,971
- Hey, Chuny. How's it going?
- Don't even.

628
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,142
- John. CARTER: I
thought you were long gone.

629
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:19,978
Yeah. I just wanted to check
and see how Robert was doing.

630
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,916
As expected. He was abysmal.

631
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:27,458
He has no patient rapport, stunted
interpersonal skills and he's hostile.

632
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,960
- Qualities consistent with surgeons.
- He doesn't know what he's doing.

633
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,260
He almost killed a patient by
prescribing antiquated treatment.

634
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,698
But obviously you
stopped him from doing so.

635
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,998
- I can't stay on top of the guy 24/7.
- We're shifting him to administrative.

636
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:45,833
- You gonna chain him to his desk?
- The ER may not be the best fit for him...

637
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:50,472
but it's all the man has. Just make it
work. Or better yet, work around him.

638
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,481
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

639
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,382
I'm Diana Rushing. I got a
message saying my husband's here.

640
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,181
Dr. Kovac. He
treated your husband.

641
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,347
- What is it? CARTER:
It's Rushing's wife.

642
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,320
- I'll take you to him.
- Is he okay? I've been worried sick.

643
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,554
I'm from Indiana.

644
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,858
He's stable, but he's
obviously very upset.

645
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,365
When did you see them last?

646
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,503
He left home four days
ago. Who's "them"?

647
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,229
Your husband and your children.

648
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,566
What children?

649
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,401
He said he was with them
in the car when he crashed.

650
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,071
We don't have children.

651
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,880
Her caretaker says she's
complained of white discharge.

652
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:29,180
- She have her period yet?
- She says she's a real woman.

653
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:33,155
- I'm Dr. Lewis. How are you feeling?
- Good.

654
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,657
We're gonna do a test on
your private parts, okay?

655
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:39,059
Set up for a pelvic. It's probably
a simple yeast infection. Sandra...

656
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,563
how's your headache? Did
the acetaminophen help?

657
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,031
Sandra?

658
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,402
Sandra? I need a crash cart.

659
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,673
She came in with a broken wrist.
- She did.

660
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,070
What happened?

661
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,336
I don't know.
Pulseless and apneic.

662
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,845
V-fib. Charging to 200.

663
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,450
And clear.

664
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,088
Unit number six going up.

665
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,521
Tumor mass has invaded
the renal artery wall...

666
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,183
and sections of the vena cava.

667
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,400
You want me to call?

668
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,394
Won't tell me
anything I don't know.

669
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,398
Stage IVB, by the size and
the spread of it. Take the kidney.

670
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,559
<i>Dr. Corday, call on line one.</i>

671
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,798
If it's Path, put it on speaker.
Pedicle clamp in place.

672
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,272
Metz to divide the vessels.
- <i>Dr. Corday?</i>

673
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,468
Yes, Dr. Meechum.
What are your findings?

674
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,805
<i>Fuhrman grade IV</i>

675
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,609
<i>with a sarcomatoid pattern
and a high mitotic picture. Sorry.</i>

676
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,376
Thank you.

677
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,281
Done. Steel bowl.

678
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,887
It's bad, I take it.

679
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,216
Irresectable.

680
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,483
We'd be doing her a
favor if she bled to death.

681
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,719
Her chance of survival is
less than 2 percent at this point.

682
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,126
Get her husband up here.
I want to speak to him.

683
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,789
Charge again to 360 and clear.

684
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:51,396
Asystole.

685
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:53,569
It's been 20 minutes.

686
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,071
Uh, try another amp of epi.

687
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,733
And clear.

688
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,769
No pressure, no pulse.

689
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:06,747
A headache, a fall, possibly
jogged an aneurysm she already had.

690
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,487
No way you could
have known about it.

691
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,851
No way she could
have known about it.

692
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,017
Yeah, I'm sure she wasn't
planning on dying today.

693
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,992
1827.

694
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,595
He's depressed. That, combined
with aspects of dissociative disorder...

695
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,465
allowed him to create this
weird negative amnesia.

696
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,702
Was it a psychotic break?

697
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:32,275
Not per se. But he definitely
needs inpatient psych care.

698
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,640
When he talked about them,
he made them sound so real.

699
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,973
To him, they are.
Right now, anyway.

700
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,876
But they won't always be.

701
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,783
With the right meds,
it'll all fade away.

702
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,855
Ow!

703
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,995
Cervical motion tenderness.

704
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,288
PID?

705
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:55,058
Yup. Mindy, do you
have a boyfriend?

706
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,700
Uh-huh.

707
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,367
You're pretty young
to be having sex...

708
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:04,498
much less unprotected sex. You
need to tell him to use condoms.

709
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:05,803
What are those?

710
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,042
That's not a good sign.

711
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,309
Can you tell me his name so we
can make sure he gets checked?

712
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,046
He cleans floors.

713
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,648
He says he loves me.

714
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:26,094
Four hundred of cefixime
and a gram of azithro.

715
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:28,665
We're just gonna help
you get dressed, okay?

716
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:33,536
Oh, man. You want
me to call the facility?

717
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:37,335
Call the police first. This has been
one of the worst days of my life.

718
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,672
- Careful, don't jinx yourself.
- Goodnight, everyone.

719
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,677
- Happy birthday, Dr. Chen.
- Oh, thanks.

720
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,747
- Hey, my gloves.
- What?

721
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,181
Camel-colored with
lambskin. Are those mine?

722
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,378
- No.
- No, no. Greg just gave them to me.

723
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,355
- They were in my locker this morning.
- So? I bought those out on the street.

724
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,016
You bought these on the street?

725
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:59,722
- Yeah, from Kippy. But it's a long story.
- Oh, my God!

726
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:00,445
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,561
Listen, I'm sorry. I
mean, what do you...?

728
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:06,296
Ha, I can't believe you bought
my birthday present on the street.

729
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,598
It was a good deal.
They're genuine leather.

730
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,765
If I were you, I'd put
them under a Wood's lamp.

731
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,275
Ha-ha, nice.

732
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:14,772
- Hey.
- Hey.

733
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,383
- What are you doing here?
- We're not supposed to see each other...

734
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:23,044
but I figured if your day was as bad
as mine, you could use some company.

735
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:27,625
Well, 8-year-old blinded by an air
bag, woman keels over of an aneurysm...

736
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,285
junkie shooting up in the ER and a
Down's syndrome girl with the clap.

737
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:36,900
Hmm. Family of four trapped in a burning
vehicle, one kid survived. 18 months old.

738
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,563
You win. What'd you get?

739
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,933
Oh, the burger and
fries we never got.

740
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,304
Knit one, purl two.

741
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,441
If you take much longer,
you're gonna be sewing scabs.

742
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,080
If I go faster, the
edges don't evert well.

743
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:56,813
I love watching med students
suture. It reminds me how good I am.

744
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,314
Was.

745
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,625
- What did you say?
- He said, "Was."

746
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,863
Loose stools in Exam
4. Knock yourself out.

747
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,528
Almost there.

748
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,834
Skin stapler will be next.

749
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:20,445
Cut, please. JACY:
Pressure's steady at 110/68.

750
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,079
He's here.

751
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,009
Mr. Strickland...

752
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:29,848
I'm afraid we've discovered a highly
malignant and inoperable cancer.

753
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,182
Oh, God.

754
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:32,380
Stapler ready.

755
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,458
Your wife's
chance of survival...

756
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:38,619
even with the most aggressive form
of chemotherapy, is extremely poor.

757
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,162
But not impossible?

758
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,360
The one sure thing...

759
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,367
is that she will survive long
enough to deliver your baby...

760
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,471
if she doesn't seek treatment.

761
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,540
But for that to happen, you'd
have to reverse her decision.

762
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,574
- OB's here.
- How close are we?

763
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,303
Almost closed.

764
00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,382
Mr. Strickland...

765
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:03,416
if you wish to overrule her
decision, you need to do it quickly.

766
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:07,081
The GYN team here is standing
by to perform an abortion.

767
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:10,726
I want her to live.

768
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,561
Your wife is going to die.

769
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,897
She's gonna fight this.

770
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,559
Do you understand
this baby has a chance?

771
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:27,701
- I can't, I just can't.
- Dr. Corday?

772
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,578
- Dr. Corday?
- Mr. Strickland?

773
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:40,153
Let's get her draped.
Start with the sterile spec.

774
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,242
Another?

775
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,176
Yeah.

776
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,108
And stop skimping
on the peanuts.

777
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:13,357
Hey, how about
putting something on...

778
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,688
for those of us in the
room without hairy knuckles.

779
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,686
Something wrong with this show?

780
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,960
Yeah. It only appeals to adults
making less than 20 grand a year.

781
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,465
Thirty grand.

782
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,970
Oh, car wash gave you
a raise. Good for you.

783
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,802
I'm a copier tech.

784
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,968
Well, that explains
the dirty fingernails...

785
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:37,347
but not why you enjoy watching
half-naked chunky trunks...

786
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,917
pull tractors with their teeth. Must
be a sort of homoerotic thing for you.
