1
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,818
Ah. I wish the sun
would rise already.

2
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:28,053
This graveyard
shift's going forever.

3
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,263
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

4
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,399
I love you too,
Carter, but it's over.

5
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,771
I'm gonna ask her tonight.

6
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,002
You're going to propose?

7
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:48,349
Actually, I already
did, but badly.

8
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,279
- She said no?
- She didn't say anything.

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,112
But this time I'm
gonna do it right.

10
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,948
Oh, wow.

11
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,150
That is a nice rock.

12
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,194
- That was my great-grandmother's.
- Wow.

13
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,193
Great-grandfather gave it to
her the day he left for the Army.

14
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,864
I don't think she'll mind
that it's secondhand.

15
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,937
Hey. You guys want something
from Magoo's? My treat.

16
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,663
- No, thanks.
- No, I'm all right.

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,378
Hey, Luka. KOVAC: Hey.

18
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,036
You dispo Mr. Lindsey?

19
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,375
- They took him up to Cards.
- He'll be all right.

20
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,383
- He's bounced back before.
- Actually, he died.

21
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,214
Oh.

22
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,284
- Way to start the day, huh?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,089
Can I buy you some breakfast?

24
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,731
Okay.

25
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,933
So, what's that you're reading?

26
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,732
The workplace sensitivity manual.
Weaver wants me to learn it.

27
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,774
What's...? What's "schmuck"?
- Schmuck?

28
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,912
It's one of the inappropriate
words. "Schmuck," "puts"...

29
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,072
No, I think you mean
"putz." KOVAC: Putz.

30
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,183
"Peckerwood." Is that a tree?

31
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,620
Hello? Anybody here?

32
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,761
Hello?

33
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,263
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,596
Gray matter.

35
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,966
No pulse. We
should get the police.

36
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,235
Oh, my God.

37
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,183
Oh, God.

38
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,492
GSW to the head.

39
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,654
Exit wound through
the spine. They're gone.

40
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,266
Trina. Oh, my God.

41
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,604
She's breathing. Go get help.

42
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,461
Do you remember the Rileys?

43
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,066
You guys stayed with them
when you were about 10 or so.

44
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,968
Yeah, they had a cabin
up by Mount Lutsen.

45
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:34,165
Yeah. Eric used to
call Sonia "Gammy."

46
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,105
- Grammy.
- Grammy. Whatever.

47
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,973
- Mm-hm.
- Maybe he went there.

48
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,637
Maybe.

49
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,352
They were really
good with you...

50
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,489
when things were bad.

51
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,851
They... They took you fishing.

52
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,686
- Remember?
- Yeah, in Grand Rapids.

53
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,623
- The Grand Rapids.
- I cut my finger.

54
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,990
Yeah, with a hook.

55
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,325
Eric caught this great,
big, old smelly fish.

56
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,731
He acted like he found
gold, for God's sakes.

57
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,743
- He'll be okay, Mom.
- I know.

58
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,844
I should pack.

59
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,418
- Is that John?
- No.

60
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,521
It's work, but guess what.
He asked me to marry him.

61
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,727
Really?

62
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,390
Well, he didn't really mean it.

63
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,337
I mean, it was... We
were on the roof...

64
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,906
it was freezing, there was a
helicopter flying around, and he was...

65
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,373
kind of shouting it at me.

66
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,273
It's every girl's dream, right?

67
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,048
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

68
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,045
Really, because, you
know, he didn't mean it.

69
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,653
It just... It was just...

70
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,785
something that happened.
I don't know. Hi, it's Abby.

71
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,358
What?

72
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:05,255
Oh, my God. Was anybody there?

73
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,734
No, from the ER.

74
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,227
Okay.

75
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,769
I'll be right in.

76
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,466
- What's the matter?
- I... I have to go.

77
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,133
But come by the hospital later, and
I'll give you a ride to the bus station.

78
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,677
Okay.

79
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,093
Or you could stay
a few more days.

80
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,688
No, I... I have to
get back to work.

81
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,296
Be here waiting in
case he shows up.

82
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,133
What if he shows
up in Minnesota?

83
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,709
You're right.

84
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,106
Nothing confirmed. Looks like you
got multiple shooters on the loose.

85
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,476
She's dropping her sats.

86
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,675
Keep those people
away from the building.

87
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,979
Can we talk to her now
in case she can't later?

88
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,281
Setting up for multiple
traumas. How many?

89
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,321
- One.
- Three were pronounced on the scene.

90
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,619
- Luka, let me take this.
- It's okay, I got it.

91
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,353
Officer, make sure these
cars don't block that entrance.

92
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,330
- Breathe for us, Trina.
- Tracheal shift. Hold up.

93
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,968
Her lung is down.

94
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,502
- Sats, only 88.
- Miss, can you describe who did this?

95
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,333
- Decreased on the right.
- Needle her.

96
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,974
- Want me to do it?
- No, 18 gauge.

97
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,165
How many were there?

98
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,506
You're gonna get your ID as
soon as she's stable, I promise.

99
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,113
She's not moving air.

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,646
No pulse. Try the other side.

101
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,374
- No, pull the dressing off.
- What?

102
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,610
The dressing on the
chest wound, pull it off.

103
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,559
- Okay, pulse is stronger.
- Good chest excursions.

104
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,659
All right, let's get her inside.

105
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,134
Luka?

106
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,070
Just need a minute.

107
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,078
Dr. Lewis, patron
saint of lost causes.

108
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,373
- GSW to head and chest.
- Tension pneumo.

109
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,518
One's clear. Hey. You all right?

110
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:09,486
Yeah. I'm a little nauseous. It takes me
a couple days to get back up to terminal.

111
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,218
- What's going on?
- There was a shooting across the street.

112
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,363
- Anybody you know?
- No, but still.

113
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,057
- Kind of scary when it happens so close.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,668
So I heard you're
getting released today.

115
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,802
My next round of chemotherapy's
in about two days, so...

116
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,839
I thought I'd come
by, say so long.

117
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,676
- How's your mom doing?
- You mean is she still pissed at you?

118
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,173
No, I didn't mean
exactly that, but...

119
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,177
- She's still pissed at you.
- Good to know.

120
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:42,215
She's upstairs with the "doc."

121
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,415
Does she know you're here?

122
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,862
I kind of snuck off.

123
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,760
I actually might need
one of those basins.

124
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,059
I think you need
some IV Compazine.

125
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,566
- That sounds good.
- All right.

126
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,762
I'll go tell your mom you're here.
Will you watch him for a minute?

127
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,105
I'm not a child.

128
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,445
Yeah, Marky! Yeah, Marky!

129
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,417
- Yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Come on, man. Come on.

130
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,110
- I got this corner ball.
- Let's go. Come on.

131
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,256
- Let's go.
- What you trying to do?

132
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,483
- What you doing, man?
- It's our ball.

133
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,986
Back up! Hey, back up! Hey,
man, it's all right. We got this.

134
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,596
- I'm all right. Come on.
- David.

135
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,893
- Let's go.
- Come on. It's game point anyway.

136
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,560
- Let's get these clowns out of here.
- Play ball!

137
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,434
Let's do it. Come on, come on.

138
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,777
Yo, watch it, bitch!
It's a man's game.

139
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,120
Come on, man.
What, you wanna go?

140
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,322
Forget about it.

141
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,865
We won. Let's get some
breakfast. Come on.

142
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,299
- Next week.
- That's what I thought.

143
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:07,830
- Hey.
- Hi.

144
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,442
- I thought you were on later.
- I heard what happened.

145
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,444
- I thought we might need help.
- Actually, we only got the one.

146
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,343
Three went straight
to the morgue.

147
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,780
- Sorry I didn't come by last night.
- It's okay.

148
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,477
Maggie and I played
Scrabble. I got a 75-point word.

149
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,713
- Really?
- "Cyanotic." She challenged it.

150
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,517
<i>Found brutally murdered
early this morning...</i>

151
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,161
<i>inside of this establishment,
Doc Magoo's...</i>

152
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,992
<i>a diner frequented by staff and
visitors of County General Hospital.</i>

153
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,329
<i>The crime was committed prior to
opening as the staff was preparing...</i>

154
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,336
<i>for a day of serving the
usual sandwiches and sodas.</i>

155
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,703
<i>What got served instead was a
cold-blooded robbery-homicide...</i>

156
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,811
<i>in which four people were
murdered execution-style.</i>

157
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,506
- One of them's still alive.
<i>- Police are trying to identify suspects.</i>

158
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,877
<i>- More on the story later.</i>
- Any word on Eric?

159
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,952
I don't expect any. It's
like a bear hibernating.

160
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,055
He won't come out till spring.

161
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,088
Hey, what do you
say we go out tonight?

162
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,692
Sushi. Just you and me.

163
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,200
Maggie can fend for herself.

164
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:03,227
Told her I'd drive
her to the bus station.

165
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,762
- She's leaving?
- Yep.

166
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,401
- Is that a good thing?
- I don't know.

167
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,163
It was kind of nice
having a roommate.

168
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,863
Sushi? I hope you have
a better plan than that.

169
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,238
It's all about misdirection. I don't
wanna show my hand too early.

170
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,709
Well, the two of you have
had enough misdirection.

171
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,280
Trust me, show your hand.

172
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,008
Move your toes, Trina. Good.

173
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,553
- O-neg's here. WEAVER:
Put it right on the infuser.

174
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,883
Trina, do you remember anything?

175
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,423
They started shooting.

176
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,758
They just started shooting.

177
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,897
Threading the
catheter. Wire back.

178
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,531
- What'd she say?
- Hook me up.

179
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,896
- Ten blade.
- Trina, how many of them were there?

180
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,500
Two, in an SUV.

181
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,067
I saw them drive up.

182
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,367
- Another 50 of fent.
- Knife back.

183
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,238
- Curved Kelly.
- I might have seen them getting away.

184
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,807
Anything more specific?

185
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:58,376
It was a 4x4, gold or tan
maybe. It looked pretty new.

186
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,315
Anything about the
men? Height? Weight?

187
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,989
- What they were wearing?
- It was far away.

188
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,751
Into pleural space. Tube.

189
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,088
Chen?

190
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,026
OpSite and Polysporin.

191
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,229
Tube's in. Hook
up the Thora-Seal.

192
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,459
Any detail would help us.

193
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,126
Sats are back up, 91.

194
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,263
- Were they Latinos? Black guys?
- I don't know. It happened so fast.

195
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,670
Let's page Corday.

196
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,977
Hey, Trina, you did really
good. Rest up now, okay?

197
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,138
For us to get to work here,
we need a real description.

198
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,343
I saw one of them.

199
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,952
I think he was black.

200
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,432
<i>Driver, get out nice and
calm. Face the vehicle.</i>

201
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:40,291
- Welcome to the 'hood.
<i>- Passenger, come around to this side.</i>

202
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,760
Face the vehicle. Put
your hands up on the roof.

203
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,421
Grab the roof.

204
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,930
Hey, man, take it easy.

205
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,932
License and
registration's in the glove.

206
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,102
Hey, what are we being stopped for?
- Easy.

207
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,172
Where'd you get
money for a ride like this?

208
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,807
We're doctors at County.

209
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,871
- Where you headed in a hurry?
- Y'all can't just do this.

210
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,568
Just be quiet.

211
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,306
I see you guys brought a
lot of pals. What's the deal?

212
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,111
- Four people shot this morning in a diner.
- What diner?

213
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,222
We were just up at the Sedgwick Y in
a pickup game. Call the gym manager.

214
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,359
Why don't you search the car
and let us get the hell out of here?

215
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,584
All right, go ahead.

216
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,739
See, that's my boss right
now. Somebody's very sick.

217
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,323
Look, we're late for our shift.

218
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,194
Dealers got shifts now, huh?

219
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,665
- We are doctors, damn it.
- Relax, punk.

220
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,996
No, wait a minute, I can
explain that. I can explain!

221
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,541
Get on the ground right now, or
I'll put a bullet in your damn head.

222
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,480
Cuff them.

223
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,453
You belong to the Y?

224
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,180
I play ball there twice a week.

225
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,915
Who do you play with?

226
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,027
I don't remember their names.
Some live up the street from Greg.

227
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,129
You show proof to
the arresting officers?

228
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,525
Yeah, they took my ID.

229
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,566
I told the arresting officer
my ID was in the glove.

230
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,169
Did you ever hear of a
place called Magoo's?

231
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,828
I work right across the street.

232
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,733
Yes. We work right
across the street from it.

233
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,739
Did you ever own a firearm?

234
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,343
I already told you no.

235
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,073
No, I've never owned a firearm. Why
are you hassling me? Just call County.

236
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,150
- Where'd you say you were?
- You know, I told you where I was.

237
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,413
- What kind of a doctor are you?
- I'm a med... I'm a med student.

238
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,853
I'm a med student. What
difference does that make?

239
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,890
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I told you what I am.

240
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,962
Look, we brought you in
because you match the ID.

241
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,222
Because I match the ID.

242
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,597
What? Young, black and handsome?

243
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,761
That's... No, that's ridiculous.

244
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,770
I'll send them over immediately.

245
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,466
Jerry.

246
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,045
- Do we have photo IDs down here?
- Yeah, bottom shelf.

247
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,275
Messenger off personnel face
sheets for Pratt and Gallant...

248
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,112
to Area Seven Headquarters.

249
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,084
- Really? Why?
- Just do it.

250
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:54,788
Susan, Sean Simmons is being
discharged to home hospice care.

251
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,520
- I know, the cancer's back.
- While he's here waiting...

252
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,599
the mother has asked
that you keep your distance.

253
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,736
- What?
- She doesn't want you interacting...

254
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,131
with her son.

255
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,737
What does Sean say?

256
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,502
She's a grieving mother. I think
we need to respect her wishes.

257
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,916
Look, we should get
their names or something.

258
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,522
How else are we gonna file
a complaint against them?

259
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,817
Why don't you just be quiet?

260
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,917
Story checked out at the Y.

261
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,059
County confirmed
you're employed there.

262
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,995
It's not like we didn't
tell you guys that.

263
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,602
You can pick up your
stuff at the front desk.

264
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,033
Have a nice day.

265
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,907
Is her crit stable?

266
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,672
Holding at 29 with two units in.

267
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,681
Luka, if you wanna
take it easy for a while...

268
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,844
we can keep you out
of the trauma rooms...

269
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,922
assign you to
non-critical-care cases.

270
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,992
If you need me anywhere,
Kerry, you need me in here.

271
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,560
We all have times where we
could use a little less stress.

272
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,131
I'm fine.

273
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,862
There's nothing wrong with
admitting that you need some help.

274
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,467
I don't.

275
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,873
Even so, I've scheduled a meeting
with Dr. Meyers up on seven.

276
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,175
It's a formality.

277
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,817
Unless you wanna
make it something more.

278
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,680
But it's mandatory.

279
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,457
You shouldn't have
let them search the car.

280
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,362
That's what you do
when you're innocent.

281
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,696
I don't usually ride
around with a bloody shirt.

282
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,031
You guys hear what happened?

283
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,070
I thought none of
our people got hurt.

284
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,708
Jing-Mei was first on the scene.

285
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,673
- Is she okay?
- A little freaked.

286
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,210
I don't get it, man, how
you could just roll over.

287
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,042
- That's the way it works sometimes.
- Yeah, if you let it.

288
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,344
- What are you gonna do, file a lawsuit?
- That's one way to fight it.

289
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,489
- There is no fighting it.
- You know, I don't buy that.

290
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,056
Carter wants the output
on Bed 4 before he leaves.

291
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,422
Look, we could be perfect,
you know, like Gandhi.

292
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,894
But as soon as the crap goes
down, we'll be the first ones laid out...

293
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,259
with a gun to our head.

294
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,694
Now, where I grew
up, you see it every day.

295
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,634
And if it happens to you
enough, you get the message.

296
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,074
You are not equal.
You are not a full citizen.

297
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,770
You are first, last and, above
all, one thing and one thing only:

298
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,642
A suspect.

299
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,911
You sure you
wanna wait out here?

300
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,713
Yeah, there's too many
sick people in there.

301
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,220
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

302
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,554
Hey. Cold enough for you?

303
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,564
My mom went ahead to help set
up stuff for the home hospice team.

304
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,793
- Then she'll be coming to pick me up.
- I think you're doing the right thing.

305
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,738
I think it doesn't
matter what you think.

306
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,115
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,449
I don't know why
I'm so pissed at you.

308
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,818
Guess it all just feels
so much more real now.

309
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,586
I keep daydreaming about
the stuff that I wanted to do.

310
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,229
Get really drunk
at a college party.

311
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,194
Go windsurfing.

312
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,995
Get married and have
kids. Stupid stuff like that.

313
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,431
It's not stupid.

314
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,968
Even after I got really sick...

315
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,475
I kept talking myself
into believing...

316
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,012
that I had more time.

317
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,478
At least enough to do
some of those things.

318
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,487
Sean Simmons?

319
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,987
You know what? Hold on a second.

320
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,616
Sean, I can't get you into
college, and windsurfing's nuts.

321
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,229
But you know what? Come
on, let's get out of here.

322
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,592
- For real?
- Yeah, come on.

323
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,631
Not unless you have
someplace else to go.

324
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,929
- I'm supposed to get him home.
- Yeah, could you call his mom for us?

325
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:01,370
- Tell her we went on a date.
- I'll have him back by curfew.

326
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,133
Maybe. Say maybe.

327
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,040
Abby. Abby. Listen, I
got ahold of Sonia Riley...

328
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,942
and I told her to call you
here if she hears from Eric.

329
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,743
I'll keep my eye
open for messages.

330
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,353
Can you get this banana bag to that
guy? My leg-splint girl's screaming.

331
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,852
The Soupbox for lunch?

332
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,821
Oh, you're busy. We could go
to that place across the street.

333
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,325
- That's not really a good idea today.
- Abby. Triage needs extra bodies.

334
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,624
They got 20 kids from Kelton
Elementary with vomiting and diarrhea.

335
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,391
I'll be there in five minutes.

336
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,400
Abby. Abby, it's okay. I can
get to the bus station by myself.

337
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,664
No, I'll take you. I'll take you.
Mr. Levine, what's your problem?

338
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,001
I just got drunk at a
Valentine's Day party.

339
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,201
- Five days ago.
- Yeah, it was a blowout.

340
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,142
- I wanted to tell you...
- Hey. No. Why did you take that out?

341
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,872
It was itchy.

342
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,575
- Altered mental status. WEAVER:
Abby, send up admit labs...

343
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,254
two sets of blood cultures,
and grab an LP tray.

344
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,287
- Meningitis?
- Let's find out.

345
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,255
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, I'll call you when I get home.

346
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,724
Okay.

347
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,290
- Bye.
- Bye.

348
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,218
Nurses shortage, you know?

349
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,856
Oh.

350
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,551
Working in the ER can be a
very inconvenient job sometimes.

351
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,096
I'm sorry, John.

352
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,931
I just wanted Eric to
come home so bad...

353
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:42,269
so that I could be with
my family just for a second.

354
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,578
Abby and I were
getting along so well.

355
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,538
You should stay longer.

356
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,411
- You know, she would love it.
- I'm sorry.

357
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,219
Thank you, John.

358
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,322
I can catch a cab
out here, right?

359
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,959
I'm off in a couple of
minutes. I'll drive you.

360
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,458
- Really?
- Yeah.

361
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,125
Dr. Kovac. Dr. Meyers.

362
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,631
Please.

363
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,632
So, what brings you here?

364
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,770
Dr. Weaver. She told me to come.

365
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,338
Well, why do you suppose
she wanted us to meet?

366
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:26,179
- You tell me.
- Well, that's not quite how it works.

367
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,444
Hey, you're a doctor.

368
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,886
Someone comes to me with a
problem, I tell them how to fix it, so...

369
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,025
- Let's start with you telling me...
- My problem?

370
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,893
What's on your mind?

371
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,395
My family died during
the war in Croatia.

372
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,196
So I came to America.

373
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:48,306
I had a relationship with someone
I cared about, which I then ruined.

374
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,034
So I started to look for the
answers in the wrong places.

375
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,204
You know, like sex,
drinking, living fast.

376
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:59,146
I killed a patient I should have saved,
then I almost killed a medical student...

377
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,947
in a car crash, so...
Woke up one morning...

378
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:05,148
and everything I
thought I had was gone.

379
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,194
Gone or broken.

380
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,330
So, what do you have for that?

381
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,901
Well, Dr. Kovac, it's not
something that I can really...

382
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,238
Yeah, that's what I thought.

383
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,573
I should get back to work.

384
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,978
Tell Weaver I showed up.

385
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:39,153
<i>Further complicating the commute,
a high-speed chase is underway...</i>

386
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,295
<i>snarling a two-mile
stretch of the I-40.</i>

387
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,521
<i>Police are in pursuit
of a tan SUV...</i>

388
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,189
<i>suspected of being connected
to the grisly murders...</i>

389
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:51,462
<i>of three people early this morning
in a coffee shop off South Foundry.</i>

390
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,799
<i>- A fourth victim...</i>
- Do they consider...

391
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,135
the collateral damage
of a pursuit like that?

392
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,904
They're hoping they kill them, avoid the
wasted time and money of due process.

393
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,911
They might have
the wrong suspects.

394
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,641
Last time I checked, the
police were still on our side.

395
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,377
- Well, what exactly is our side?
- Tell her what happened.

396
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:11,081
They laid us out on the sidewalk,
they took us in, and they interrogated us.

397
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:15,094
- That's terrible.
- The real problem is you guys are guilty.

398
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,555
- Guilty of what?
- DWB. Driving while black.

399
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,994
Just forget it.

400
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,761
The police play the odds just like
us. They look for horses, not zebras.

401
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,167
Tell me you don't think
that's the same thing.

402
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,001
Look, it's about percentages.
Last time I flew to London...

403
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,939
they pulled two Arab men
out of line for a security check.

404
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,444
I hate to admit it, it made
me feel more secure.

405
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,674
You think they'd pull over two
Arabs driving through Highland Park?

406
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,719
No, because terrorist acts in Highland
Park aren't high on the list of concerns.

407
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,322
But violent crime by
African-Americans certainly is.

408
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,959
Like I said, we should drop it.

409
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:50,688
So you really believe racial profiling
is a legitimate law-enforcement tool?

410
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,855
A lot of people do.

411
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,393
- Hey.
- Hey.

412
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,368
I don't know whose day's
been worse, yours or mine.

413
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:08,207
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

414
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,645
I never thought I'd
see something like that.

415
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,909
It's different when
they roll in on a gurney.

416
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,420
Yeah, but you stepped
up. That's all that counts.

417
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,352
I did my job.

418
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,857
At least we saved one of them.

419
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,053
- So I heard she gave an ID.
- Partial one.

420
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,255
I filled in some details.

421
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,560
What, you saw the guys?

422
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,794
A glimpse as they drove off.

423
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,439
- They were black, huh?
- I think so.

424
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,073
You think so?

425
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,735
Well, it was quick, you know?
But... And I only saw one of them.

426
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,905
So that's why the cops are
picking up brothers all over town.

427
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,810
I told them what I saw.

428
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,478
What you saw, or what
you thought you saw?

429
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,949
I was trying to help, Greg.

430
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:57,192
Can't you see you fed right into
what they always wanna jump to?

431
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:01,163
Look, I'm really sorry for what happened
to you, but that's on the cops, not me.

432
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,268
It's all part of the same thing.

433
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,630
What are you talking about?

434
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:10,538
- I don't know.
- So, what, now I'm a racist?

435
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,314
It's just hard not to
feel that everybody is...

436
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:19,543
when you're lying in the street with
a cop's foot to the back of your neck.

437
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,322
I've never seen it like this.

438
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:33,125
It's okay, there'll
be a later bus.

439
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,728
Yeah.

440
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,136
That's not your
music, that's Abby's.

441
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,073
She always liked that noise.

442
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,969
I'm getting used to it.

443
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:56,251
There's an accident up ahead.
Sit tight, we'll keep you posted.

444
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,481
- Thank... Thank you.
- Thanks.

445
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,686
- Well...
- Thank you for this, John.

446
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,261
- I know it's a huge inconvenience.
- It's no problem.

447
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,997
I'm sorry for getting so upset.

448
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,331
I hate being so pathetic.

449
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,600
Just the idea of going
home alone and waiting...

450
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,612
- Eric will turn up.
- Yeah.

451
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,617
Yeah, but I worry
about both of them.

452
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,515
Abby's good.

453
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,952
You know, we're both good.

454
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,285
You don't have to
worry about that.

455
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,790
She told me.

456
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,896
She told me you
might get married.

457
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:47,036
- Is that what she said?
- No, she told me you proposed.

458
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,875
I know she's work, it runs in
the family, but she's so worth it.

459
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,513
Yeah.

460
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:05,252
Yeah. I spend 23 hours a day wondering
whether we're wrong for each other.

461
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,883
Wondering whether we've got the
energy that we need to get through...

462
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,395
everything that we
seem to get into.

463
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,898
Whether the baggage we both
bring would sink a small ship.

464
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:23,071
But in the 24th hour, I realize I've
been thinking about her for 23 hours.

465
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,174
And I come back to, there's
something about her...

466
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:30,908
that I can't stay away from.

467
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,417
Something about her
that makes me wanna...

468
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,049
love her.

469
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:49,558
Julia, my sister, read this story about
a little Japanese girl who had cancer.

470
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,068
And she tried to make a
thousand paper cranes...

471
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,366
because she thought if she did,
it would make her wish come true.

472
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,670
- What was her wish?
- To get better.

473
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,780
So how many paper
cuts do you have?

474
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,381
A lot.

475
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,780
But my wish is
kind of different.

476
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,978
What is it?

477
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,123
It's hard to explain.

478
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,734
I kiss pretty good
for a dead kid, huh?

479
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,803
Not bad at all.

480
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,474
Cop wounded in a multi-car collision.
BP, 124/68, pulse, 96, good sats.

481
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,671
Jing-Mei, take him
in. I'll wait on the next.

482
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,645
- Find the guys?
- The guys opened fire.

483
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,843
- We have a bunch of cops hurt.
- Mitch Palnick, 41-year-old officer.

484
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,988
MVA with
passenger-space intrusion.

485
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,351
- Can't breathe.
- Hey, nice to see you again.

486
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:48,255
- You know him?
- He wears Florsheims, rubber-soled.

487
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,521
- Isn't that right?
- Correct.

488
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,229
He's got a couple of fractured
ribs, maybe his sternum too.

489
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,163
Set up for a chest tube.

490
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:59,533
- Pratt.
- Trauma panel, type and cross four units.

491
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,675
- He could've bagged his spleen.
- Look, I'll get the other one.

492
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,503
- We need you here.
- We'll be there.

493
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,905
- Now, Gallant.
- It's cool.

494
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,172
It's not cool.
Hurry the hell up.

495
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,044
- Come on, let's go.
- You've got two doctors. That's enough.

496
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,778
We've got a critical patient who needs
rapid assessment and prompt treatment.

497
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,889
What's the matter? Forget what
happened earlier and do your job.

498
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,049
- I... I can't help that guy.
- This is what we do, all right?

499
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,127
Now, get your ass in there.

500
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,729
Come on. Come on.

501
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,801
John, it's beautiful.

502
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,202
Absolutely beautiful.

503
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,733
Marriage can be a great thing.

504
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,242
- Can be.
- Yeah.

505
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,374
What the hell do I
know? Mine failed.

506
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,540
For many reasons.

507
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,380
You sure as hell
don't want my advice.

508
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,149
But I would think that kind
of commitment to somebody...

509
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:57,059
you have to be...
ready for anything.

510
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,424
Or nothing.

511
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,057
You never know
what's gonna happen.

512
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,827
Or you do.

513
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,400
You mean drinking?

514
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:12,408
I drank, I smoked
when I was younger.

515
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:17,479
It took having a baby
to make me stop.

516
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,914
Smoking, at least.

517
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,418
I always went
back to the drinking.

518
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,284
Maybe Abby will be stronger.

519
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,949
Have you two talked about this?

520
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,763
About having kids?

521
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,800
I know that she worries
about passing on the disease.

522
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:43,871
She and Richard never
communicated ever, I don't think.

523
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,510
Really?

524
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,444
I think they loved
each other at first.

525
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,516
But he had all these expectations
that she never realized.

526
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,947
He didn't understand her.

527
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,385
Well, I'm not
walking into this blind.

528
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:00,617
No, no, no, I
don't think you are.

529
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,455
I just don't want...

530
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,021
Yes?

531
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,126
I...

532
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,334
I just don't want
you to wanna fix her.

533
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,365
Abby doesn't need to be fixed.

534
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,235
- Or heal her or change her.
- I love her.

535
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:19,037
I just don't want you to be
waiting for her to change.

536
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,345
- I'm not.
- She's an amazing person.

537
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,984
- I know who she is.
- She's an amazing person...

538
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,985
with certain weaknesses.
And you'd be lucky to have her...

539
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,885
even with those weaknesses.

540
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,425
But you have to love her even
if she never changes anything.

541
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,426
- Pressure's only 85.
- Put two units on the rapid infuser.

542
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,364
- I don't want them.
- You don't get...

543
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,764
to choose your doctors.

544
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,802
Like we don't get to
choose our patients.

545
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,908
- No evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding.
- Twelve-lead.

546
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,703
- Prepping the chest.
- ST depression.

547
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,574
- Could be ischemia from hypotension.
- What about tamponade?

548
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,510
No, that gives you
low-voltage QRS.

549
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,173
We need to put a tube in
your chest to expand the lung.

550
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,081
Looks like a damn garden hose.

551
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,849
- There'll be some burning with the local.
- We were just doing our job, okay?

552
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,756
So let us do ours.

553
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,425
Gallant, there's no
pericardial effusion.

554
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,324
Start secondary survey.

555
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,632
- HemoCue's 14.8.
- Hold the transfusion.

556
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,859
No, no, no, prime the infuser.

557
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,299
Dr. Weaver, I don't think
he needs a chest tube.

558
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,235
It takes time for
your crit to drop.

559
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,535
Look, LV wall motion abnormality.
He's got a cardiac contusion.

560
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,109
That's not as bad, right?

561
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,998
Start dopamine
at 10 mics per kilo.

562
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,208
- Go.
- X-ray's back.

563
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:35,076
- I'll mix up some lido in case of ectopy.
- I don't see a collapsed lung.

564
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,485
Setting up cardiac
enzymes Q six hours. Yosh.

565
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,258
We'll bring you in
when the docs finish.

566
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,054
Good call.

567
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,941
So this must be a really
scary part for you, huh?

568
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,908
What?

569
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,980
Well, all the white folks left.

570
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:07,483
Now it's just you and a
couple of niggas with knives.

571
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,593
Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

572
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,596
- Why did you make me wait outside?
- Surprise.

573
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,324
- It's February in Chicago.
- I know.

574
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,027
It makes you feel
alive, doesn't it?

575
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,334
The visiting nurse waited an
hour, and then she had to go.

576
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,876
- It's my fault, Mrs. Simmons.
- No, it's not. I wanted a hot dog.

577
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,037
Sean, you should see your room.
They brought a bed with a remote.

578
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,807
No way.

579
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:41,613
I didn't mean to worry you, I just
wanted to make it easier for Sean.

580
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:45,154
- Easier?
- He wasn't ready to come home yet.

581
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,622
Mom, Sean wants to talk to you.

582
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,156
Well, he's home now. Good night.

583
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,361
Sean wants to know if she
could wait a minute, because...

584
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,637
- So you're Julia?
- Yeah, you're Susan.

585
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,296
Yeah, I work at the hospital.

586
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:06,206
I know. Sean said you were the only
doctor he ever met who was like a friend.

587
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,341
And that you were hot.

588
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,050
BP's up to 112/78 on dopamine.

589
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,984
- We need some more morphine.
- Yeah, push another four mgs.

590
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,680
How you doing, Mitch?

591
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,349
Your partner has an elevation
of his cardiac enzymes...

592
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,858
indicating a bruised heart.

593
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:25,054
It's the equivalent of
a small heart attack.

594
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,389
- Do you smoke?
- Yeah.

595
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,161
- I hear it's bad for you.
- Yeah, thanks for the advice.

596
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:33,999
No, you should be thanking this brother.
They profiled you as a collapsed lung.

597
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,506
But he kept an open mind, saved
you from surgery that you don't need.

598
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,838
- Yeah.
- Know what? That's not gonna cut it.

599
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,502
I think an apology's in order.

600
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,910
You think I'm gonna
apologize to you?

601
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,876
- No, to him.
- Hey, Pratt, forget about it.

602
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,314
I didn't do anything wrong.

603
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,516
There's nothing on your record.

604
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,886
You don't look like you're
hurt. You're here now.

605
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,685
- Lucky for you.
- And what is your damage?

606
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,557
You know, there
were three people...

607
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,024
butchered outside your hospital. We
were doing what we were supposed to...

608
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,103
You need cops like me
to catch animals like that.

609
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,703
"Sorry" would've
been a whole lot easier.

610
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,445
- You gonna tell me what this is about?
- I thought we both deserved a break.

611
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,646
- Especially after a day like today.
- Mm-hm.

612
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,756
Feels more like a month.

613
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,757
But what's it really all about?

614
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,763
So you think this is a keeper?

615
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,905
- The restaurant?
- Us.

616
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,065
You and me.

617
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,172
Are you okay?

618
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,911
I've spent a long time...

619
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:57,613
looking for a relationship
that I thought would stick.

620
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,759
Sometimes it was
the wrong person.

621
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,422
Sometimes I guess
I wasn't ready.

622
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:11,265
Or in the right place.

623
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,599
But I think I am now.

624
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,772
I really think I am now.

625
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,768
Are you?

626
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:28,112
- John...
- Because I really want this to stick.

627
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,647
Me too.

628
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,292
I know that...

629
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,463
we've had a rough time...

630
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:46,298
and that there's still a lot of
stuff that we have to get through.

631
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,671
But I think we're doing okay.

632
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:54,804
You know, I think
that we're growing.

633
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,308
We're changing.

634
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,154
Do you?

635
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,154
I don't know if people
ever really change.

636
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,822
But I... I know what you mean.

637
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,372
You do?

638
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,006
I think I do.

639
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:33,979
Mm-hm. Well, let's
see what's for dessert.

640
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,858
That's it?

641
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,855
You bought out this
whole place just for that?

642
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,533
That...

643
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,026
and the chocolate soufflé.

644
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,066
Hey.

645
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,966
Check this out.

646
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,742
Who knew it'd be
so much fun, huh?

647
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,644
Oh, here.

648
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,650
It's for you.

649
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,254
Open it later.

650
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,086
Sometimes...

651
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,957
if I think about what
comes next, it helps.

652
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,095
Maybe afterwards I'll know.

653
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,865
I'll know what it's all about.

654
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,468
What it all means,
if it means anything.

655
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,133
You'll know before any of us.

656
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,345
That sucks.

657
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,277
Yeah.

658
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,217
It does.

659
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,017
I want you to know what
you did for me, Susan.

660
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,958
It's mutual.

661
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,332
I want you to know.

662
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,966
I know, Sean.

663
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,626
I know.

664
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,702
How's Officer Palnick doing?

665
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,970
No cardiac ectopy on the lido
drip. Pulse ox, 99 on two liters.

666
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,136
That was good,
what you did in there.

667
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:45,811
But never make me ask
you twice again, okay?

668
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,179
Yes, ma'am.

669
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,345
A couple of cops
got real hurt...

670
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,184
trying to bring in those
guys that killed those people.

671
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,159
And that's why Mitch is here, because
he won't let scum like that get away.

672
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,831
Still, maybe we
overstepped this morning.

673
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,661
I think we did.

674
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,897
But thanks for
fixing up my partner.

675
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,701
They'll be moving him soon.

676
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,433
What was that about?

677
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,635
Almost sounded like an apology.

678
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,246
- One love, Gallant.
- Yep. Later.

679
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,043
Better day tomorrow
than we had today.

680
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:24,350
- Luka, how'd it go upstairs?
- Great. I feel a lot better.

681
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,361
- Hey.
- Hey.

682
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:38,196
It's so quiet now, you know? You'd
hardly know anything happened there.

683
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,272
- Yeah, except the police tape.
- Yeah.

684
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,207
You did good today. Probably
saved that woman's life.

685
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,403
Well, at least there's that.

686
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,743
Headed to the El?

687
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,778
No. I forgot something inside.

688
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,046
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

689
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:07,393
You know, ever since I was a kid, I've
always acted like it doesn't bother me.

690
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,067
But you know something?

691
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,568
It bothers me.

692
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,571
Well, at least they
caught the guys.

693
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,846
Let's get out of here.

694
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,306
Do you want tea?

695
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,071
Carter?

696
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,917
Hello. MAGGIE: <i>Hello, Abby?</i>

697
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,884
Mom. Are you there already?

698
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,321
No. No, I'm not. We're
delayed here in Tomah.

699
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,720
The roads are snowed in.

700
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,686
Tomah, Wisconsin?

701
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:49,493
Abby, I... I know I was in
the way, and I'm sorry. I...

702
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:53,695
- I never wanna be a burden.
- Mom, you are not a burden.

703
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,931
<i>I just wish Eric
would've come back.</i>

704
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,370
I know.

705
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,171
We could've all been together
just for one little minute.

706
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:03,246
<i>I love you both so much.</i>

707
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,576
<i>Sometimes I don't
know what to do with it.</i>

708
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,517
- I love you too.
- I'll call you in a few days.

709
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,883
Okay. Call me tomorrow.

710
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:15,384
- Get home safe.
<i>- Bye.</i>

711
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,933
- Who was that?
- Uh...

712
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,041
Maggie.

713
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,776
What did she want?

714
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,912
She wanted to
thank you for the ride.

715
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,985
What kind of tea do you want?

716
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,887
Whatever you're having.
