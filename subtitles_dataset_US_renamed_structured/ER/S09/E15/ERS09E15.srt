1
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,018
Abby.

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,991
Abby.

3
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,668
Kerry.

4
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,539
Sorry, the intercom
thing is broken.

5
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,814
- Did I wake you?
- No.

6
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,347
Good.

7
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,421
- Wanna come in?
- No. I'm on my way to work.

8
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,148
Remember that place where
you used to practice medicine?

9
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,519
- I told you I needed some time off.
- And you've had it.

10
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,959
Rumor is you quit, but
I've seen nothing official.

11
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:40,089
- So I've scheduled you to work today.
- I still have some things to do.

12
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,635
One of them is to decide
whether you still wanna be a doctor.

13
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,933
Be in by noon or don't
bother coming back.

14
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,715
Hey! Oh, God!

15
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,450
Oh, God. Don't move.
Don't move. Call 911.

16
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,960
Don't move. Hey!
Hey, wait, wait!

17
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,722
Come back here!

18
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:15,397
You could be seriously
injured! You assho...!

19
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,852
You scared me.

20
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,465
You okay?

21
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,204
- When did you get here?
- A couple hours ago.

22
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,834
You were still sleeping.

23
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,506
Any news?

24
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,176
How about some
breakfast? Can you eat?

25
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,514
Did the phone ring?

26
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,591
- I thought I heard the phone ring.
- No.

27
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,196
You can just leave that
stuff. I'll clean up later.

28
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,429
You want some aspirin?

29
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,296
Will you call me
if they call here?

30
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:59,328
- Where are you going?
- I took a shift.

31
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,810
You're going in?
- Gotta keep busy.

32
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,673
- Let's do something. Don't go to work.
- I can't drop it.

33
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,339
- They'll call for you.
- I'm going.

34
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,916
Hey, hey.

35
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,025
They're gonna find him.

36
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,390
Thank you for coming back.

37
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,031
Cancel your cell phone
and call your bank.

38
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,297
Yeah. I gotta renew my license, get a
new phone, replace all my credit cards.

39
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,739
Hey, listen up! If anybody gets
a scruffy white male in his 20s...

40
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,210
who looks like he got
hit by a car, find me.

41
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,212
- Where's Pratt?
- Paramedic ride-along.

42
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,248
You clip somebody
on the way to work?

43
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,648
- I wish. LEWIS:
Hey, where were you?

44
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,947
- Curtain 3.
- No, when I needed you.

45
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,148
I called you about a
dozen times last night.

46
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,725
- Oh, I must have had my phone off.
- We had a deal.

47
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,887
If I call you and it rings once,
you call my cell and bail me out.

48
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,895
I thought you
canceled with that guy.

49
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,092
I did. But he kept calling me,
so I just met him later for drinks.

50
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,932
- Oh, you caved.
- I know. I'm a sucker.

51
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,768
- Was it that bad?
- Well, I almost had to fake it.

52
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,239
- An orgasm?
- A seizure.

53
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,243
I called you at 11 to commiserate,
but you still weren't home.

54
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,506
- I spent the night at his place.
- Whose place?

55
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,149
- His.
- Spent the night?

56
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,751
Dr. Lewis. Do we lavage
for a rectal temp of 92?

57
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:19,943
Is she altered?

58
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,021
Yeah, but she has a
history of Alzheimer's.

59
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,454
I want details.

60
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,320
Hi. I'm Dr. Lewis.

61
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,487
She wandered outside for over an
hour before I realized she was gone.

62
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,931
Passive external rewarming. Put
her on heated humidified O2 by mask.

63
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:40,199
She's usually more alert. They
upped her medicine. Aricept.

64
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,037
Aricept.

65
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,442
Okay. She probably just has
a mild case of hypothermia.

66
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,946
- I'll check on her as she warms up.
- Thank you.

67
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,683
What are you doing back here?

68
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,982
Visiting.

69
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,648
Respiratory distress.
I think it's pneumonia.

70
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,828
Do I really have to wear this thing?
I mean, I just got a cough, right?

71
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,488
Temp's 102.6.
Neutropenic two days ago.

72
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:11,302
You have no white blood cells,
and this place is crawling with germs.

73
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:16,000
CBC, blood and sputum culture, chest
x-ray and half a gram of imipenem IV.

74
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,308
- Did you miss me?
- No.

75
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,711
One of my guys found him
this morning when he opened up.

76
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:29,050
He's a bum. Must've crawled in here
last night sometime after we locked up.

77
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,020
Wouldn't wake up
when I shook him.

78
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:38,161
And he stinks. You guys gotta get
him out before my customers show up.

79
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't get a pulse.
Give me the paddles.

80
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,000
Sorry, doc. This is our
show. You just watch.

81
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,004
- Then why am I here?
- To appreciate what we do.

82
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,743
No pulse, no resps.

83
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,579
But plenty of urine
and... Oh, gross.

84
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,547
Oof!

85
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,848
- Looks like lividity.
- Is that some sort of disease?

86
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,182
He's pooling blood.
This guy's dead.

87
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,749
Hey, where you going?

88
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,386
Back to the bus.

89
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,352
You're supposed to observe us.

90
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,363
This guy's a corpse, and whatever
you do with corpses, I don't need to see.

91
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,558
I'm going back in the
rig where it's warm.

92
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:19,399
Hey. If you pronounce this guy, we can
call the coroner and all get out of here.

93
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,938
I thought this was your show.

94
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,606
That's more of a
guideline than a rule.

95
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,142
Yeah?

96
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,592
Hi, John.

97
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,233
Maggie.

98
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,393
Is Abby home?

99
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:54,272
- No, no. She went to work.
- Work?

100
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,074
- What did he take?
- Crystal meth.

101
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,076
- He was just smoking glass.
- I think I'm having a heart attack.

102
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,476
- What do I...?
- You can hear it. Listen.

103
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,982
- You better do something.
- You think this is funny?

104
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,279
He never smoked before.
He just started puking.

105
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,083
The side effects of crystal
meth include brain damage...

106
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,249
- paranoia, hallucinations...
- Whoa!

107
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,760
Later, Zeki. Don't let them
give you a baboon heart.

108
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,764
I didn't even wanna do
it. Please don't let me die.

109
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,097
- CBC, tox screen and a UA.
- What is it? Do I need a transplant now?

110
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,464
- Yeah. Your brain.
- What?

111
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,698
Let's get him on a cardiac
monitor for a couple of hours.

112
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,866
Give him two of Ativan
and call his parents.

113
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,170
Don't call my parents.
My parents'll kill me.

114
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,610
No. Drugs will kill
you, not your parents.

115
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,613
- You don't know them.
- Need some help!

116
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,275
- Help!
- What are you gonna do about my heart?

117
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,011
Get a gurney!

118
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,114
- Help!
- Okay, what happened?

119
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,782
- My son.
- He got run over.

120
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,887
Get Weaver back here. I need
a backboard and a C-collar.

121
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,256
- Should've called 911.
- They weren't coming.

122
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,132
Put him down slowly. Try not
to move his head or his neck.

123
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,861
Prep a trauma room and
page Surgery. What's his name?

124
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,166
- Jared.
- Jared, can you hear me?

125
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,865
Can you open your eyes?

126
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,411
I got a pulse. Did you
see the car that hit him?

127
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,007
My car. I hit him.

128
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,182
Spiders, snakes, scorpions.

129
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,379
Any member of the
weasel family, rats.

130
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,151
Any kind of vermin. These are
things I spray for. These are not pets.

131
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:23,759
Bunnies, puppies, kittens, anything
you can cuddle, those are pets.

132
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,422
- Which do you have?
- Nothing. Breathe.

133
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm not kidding. They
banned me from the pet store.

134
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,866
They keep my picture
posted by the gerbils.

135
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,535
But you're a doctor.

136
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,234
Please. I'm only good
with people. Breathe.

137
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:43,046
Although I had
Sea-Monkeys once. Breathe.

138
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,015
On the package they're really
cute. These little families...

139
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,382
swimming through
the underwater castle.

140
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,684
- Yeah.
- Turns out they're just brine shrimp.

141
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,418
Everybody knows that. How old
were you when this happened?

142
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,894
Thirty.

143
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,123
- You...
- I'm kidding.

144
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,361
I was a teenager just like you.
Okay, I'll check on you later.

145
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,027
I'll be here.

146
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,869
He's back.

147
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,203
I thought I buffed him
up good enough last time.

148
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,210
You sure he's not back for the
company? He has a crush on you.

149
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,440
Oh, please. For starters,
I'm old enough to be...

150
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,552
- Well, I'm an older woman.
- Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.

151
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,450
Dr. Lewis, labs and films
are back on your boyfriend.

152
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,488
- You're sick. MARQUEZ:
And Mrs. Langston's...

153
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,251
coming around. When
you get a chance.

154
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,553
Thanks.

155
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,719
You know, younger
men have a lot of energy.

156
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,425
Not when they have cancer.

157
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,761
Oh, sorry. You know,
sometimes I forget they're sick.

158
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,603
I know. Me too.

159
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,706
So you and Pratt are
going together now?

160
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,140
- You think he thinks that?
- What would give him that idea?

161
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,938
- Have you guys seen Abby?
- Trauma 2.

162
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,742
I thought she was working Triage.
- Bad MVA, little boy.

163
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,913
- Apneic.
- Six-0 cuffed tube and a 2-Mac blade.

164
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,487
He was in the house. He
must've run out to say goodbye.

165
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,624
Full trauma panel,
type and cross for six.

166
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,985
Oh, my God.

167
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,254
I was... I wasn't going
fast. I was just backing up.

168
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,953
Drugs are in. He's loose.

169
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,259
- Set of crits and a Foley.
- Sats are down to 91.

170
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,492
Cricoid pressure.

171
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,430
Suction.

172
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,438
- No.
- She wants to talk to you.

173
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,441
- No.
- Abby, now.

174
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,936
I can't.

175
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,479
- John.
- What's happening?

176
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,554
Your son isn't
breathing on his own.

177
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,848
That was fast.

178
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,153
Well, your white blood count's up to
1900 with 80 percent segs and bands.

179
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,456
I know. My immune system's back.

180
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,289
Yes, it is.

181
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,631
But I have pneumonia?

182
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,005
Because your metastatic
lesions haven't decreased in size.

183
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,306
But I had two more cycles.

184
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,541
They should have
responded by now.

185
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,316
Well, at least it's not growing.

186
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,795
Right?

187
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,401
How long?

188
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,062
Four minutes and 30 seconds.

189
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,410
How long do you wait?

190
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,807
Five minutes.

191
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,414
And if he doesn't
breathe after that?

192
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:06,041
That would be a strong
indicator of brain death.

193
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:12,082
Jared, I just got off
the phone with Daddy...

194
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,421
and he'll be here
really soon, okay?

195
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,091
He'll be here any minute.

196
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,426
No excursions. Sats are okay.

197
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,092
No spontaneous breaths.

198
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,507
No oculovestibular response.

199
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,303
That's five.

200
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,815
That's it?

201
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,090
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,955
Jared can't breathe
without the ventilator.

203
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,528
When you're ready, we can talk about
how long you want him on the machines.

204
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,829
No, my husband...

205
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,772
You have to give my
husband a chance to get here.

206
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,773
We'll do everything that we can.

207
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,963
He hates it when I leave.

208
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:32,171
Stalls me with hugs and kisses.

209
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,768
He was running out
to give me another hug.

210
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,474
- You should really just go home.
- I don't wanna go home.

211
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,172
I wanna talk to Abby.

212
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,818
- She's preoccupied right now.
- Her brother is missing.

213
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,251
- There's not a lot she can do.
- You have cops coming in every day.

214
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,187
- She must know one of them.
- The FAA has the Coast Guard...

215
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,692
- searching both sides of the lake.
- I called the FAA and Coast Guard.

216
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,093
They won't give me any info. They
think I'm a terrorist or something.

217
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,258
- They refer me to the Chicago P.D.
- If it makes you feel better...

218
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,802
- I know the sergeant. I'll call him.
- Thank you.

219
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,837
We have to go down.
We have to push them.

220
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,531
We've got to do something.

221
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,643
- Let me talk to her.
- I wanna talk to her!

222
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,370
- Just give me one minute.
- I wanna talk to her myself.

223
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,515
We'll deal with
this. Just sit here...

224
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,480
- John, we have to find Eric.
- I know.

225
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,195
Everything all right? - No.

226
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,619
- I thought you were off.
- I am.

227
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,553
If Abby needs to go, she
should. I was surprised to see her.

228
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,660
- Yeah, I just need to find her first.
- Trauma 2.

229
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,794
- Is Luka here yet?
- Croat? Does he still work here?

230
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,398
- I guess not.
- Dr. Weaver.

231
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,693
- Yeah.
- A guy in Triage...

232
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,335
looks like a possible MVA.

233
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,638
- He matches your mugger's description.
- Tell the nurses to keep him busy.

234
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,333
- I'll be right there.
- Hey, Gallant, bad news.

235
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,638
Pathology lost Mrs.
Pincus' Pap smear.

236
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,715
You need to swab her again.
And stand by while they examine it.

237
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,249
- Oh, just swab her again?
- Yeah, that bad?

238
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,752
Possible wrist fracture, multiple
abrasions. He said he fell over a curb.

239
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,254
That's him. Get security
and hard restraints.

240
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,587
How about giving me something
for the pain? My arm's broken.

241
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,389
Where's my purse, creep?

242
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,224
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Hey, get back into bed.

243
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,369
You can't keep me here.
- Hey, man.

244
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,765
- Get out of my way! GUARD:
Okay, get him. Hold him!

245
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,180
- Is she manic?
- She's upset.

246
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,087
- She's blond.
- So are you.

247
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,521
His plane disappeared yesterday.
She wouldn't decompensate overnight.

248
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,788
- I've seen it happen.
- Well, then make your own assessment.

249
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,222
Can't you deal with her?

250
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,725
She's not my mother.

251
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,062
Who knows, maybe she can help.
- What's wrong?

252
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,298
This machine is going off.

253
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,635
- Are we treating? ABBY:
Until her husband gets here.

254
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,641
All right. Mg of atropine.

255
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,140
No pulse.

256
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,305
Starting compressions.

257
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,816
Mommy's here,
Jared. Mommy's here.

258
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,111
Oh, sweetie.

259
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,154
I got you.

260
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,718
Nothing?

261
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,658
No change at all?

262
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,833
Some cancers are more
resistant than others.

263
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,499
Then why would the
oncologist put him through that?

264
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,971
He said 20 percent.

265
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,414
Well, if you would give
me the appropriate IV...

266
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,522
antibiotics, and oxygen...

267
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,420
and whatever pain meds he
needs to stay comfortable...

268
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:43,359
- I would like to take him home soon.
- My white count's up, Mom.

269
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,691
I can beat the pneumonia.

270
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,598
Sean.

271
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,106
Think about how aggressively
you wanna handle this.

272
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,970
There's a possibility you'd
be put on a breathing machine.

273
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,006
Fine. Let's do it.

274
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,873
And then what? Hm?

275
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,775
More pain?

276
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:10,849
More nausea, more
infections, vomiting.

277
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,884
I can take it.

278
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,822
I know you can.

279
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,596
You have been...

280
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,999
so brave...

281
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,532
and so strong.

282
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,348
But do you wanna spend the rest of
your time on machines in a hospital?

283
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,753
What choice do I have?

284
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,991
You're not gonna take any more!
You're not gonna take any more!

285
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,752
- I only have nine left!
- Nine what?

286
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,261
- Toes. You took the big one.
- All right, relax.

287
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,921
I am not gonna relax!

288
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,862
Hey. BARNEY:
I'm not gonna relax!

289
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,334
Full-term, vitals stable,
contractions three minutes apart.

290
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,769
Just get it out! I
want an epidural!

291
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,932
- You didn't give her one?
- She said no drugs.

292
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,203
- I changed my mind.
- I need to crash at your place tonight.

293
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,907
- What?
- I took care of the roach thing.

294
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,847
- Uh, no.
- What? You'd make me get a hotel?

295
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,510
- I have a thing.
- What thing?

296
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,451
- A thing.
- Oh, more secrets.

297
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,885
No. It's just dinner with Susan.

298
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,459
She's been kind of lonely
and depressed lately.

299
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,381
- Oh, my God!
- She let loose a geyser.

300
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,966
- Get him away from me!
- Know what? I've got this. You can go.

301
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,135
- I guess I'll see you, then.
- I'll see you.

302
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,793
No! What are you doing?
Don't send him away.

303
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,031
- What? Who? Dr. Pratt?
- I love him.

304
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,404
He thinks pregnant
women are sexy! Oh, ow!

305
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,977
Oh, no, no, no. Don't push!

306
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,648
I have no control
over this thing!

307
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:46,718
Mrs. Langston, do you have any
chest pain, any shortness of breath?

308
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,985
- Can she speak English?
- She used to speak it fluently.

309
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,820
- Since she was a teenager.
- Not anymore?

310
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,226
The Alzheimer's started affecting
her speech a few months ago.

311
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,761
- But now she can only speak French.
- Her first language?

312
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,200
I never bothered to
learn. I never needed it.

313
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,113
It means, "I would
like a taste of melon."

314
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,944
It's the first full sentence
I learned in high school...

315
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,983
and the only one I remember.

316
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,454
We'll try and find a translator.

317
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,068
- Maxed out on atropine.
- Try another round of epi.

318
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,929
- What was that?
- I may have broken a rib.

319
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,535
- V-tach.
- Okay, charge to 100.

320
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,137
- We're gonna have to shock him.
- Will he feel that?

321
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:42,537
- You don't have to be in here.
- I'm not leaving him.

322
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,040
Okay, clear.

323
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,308
- Heart rhythm.
- Got a weak pulse.

324
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,713
- Is he alive?
- He has a pulse.

325
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,718
- Mix up some dopamine.
- Are you sure you want us to do this?

326
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,789
Quit asking me
that. He's my son!

327
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,193
Abby, I'm flying to Cleveland.

328
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,390
I bought you a ticket
if you wanna come.

329
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,699
I talked to some police
sergeant. I used John's name.

330
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,238
And he said that all search-and-rescue
operations for Lake Superior...

331
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,965
are stationed out of...

332
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:20,238
Out of the Cleveland
district command.

333
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,381
Abby.

334
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,741
I am not flying to
Cleveland, Maggie.

335
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,285
Have you spoken
with anyone else?

336
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,257
The FAA Chicago field rep
told me he would call me...

337
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,258
The FAA is not gonna tell you
anything until after the NTSB...

338
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,396
I don't need them
to tell me anything.

339
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,188
- What, you don't care?
- Eric is dead.

340
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,202
- He is missing.
- He was trying to kill himself.

341
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,862
No. No, he was not.

342
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,873
He did not. He was in
therapy. He was on his meds.

343
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,204
- You sure about that?
- Yes, I'm sure about that.

344
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,279
Did you watch and
make sure he swallowed?

345
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,314
- He was not suicidal, Abby.
- I saw him.

346
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,876
Two weeks ago he came to
see me, and I didn't get it then.

347
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:05,457
But now, I understand what it was.
He was at peace because he had a plan.

348
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,525
- No. No. He was doing well.
- Yes.

349
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,629
He apologized to me. He even
showed me a picture of the plane.

350
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,528
- Planes crash and people walk away.
- He came to say goodbye.

351
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,328
People walk away, Abby!

352
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,968
It was goodbye!

353
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,781
You're in the wrong place
if you got a sore throat.

354
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,975
- I have a specimen.
- Good for you.

355
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,086
Put it with the rest.

356
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,454
I was told to wait
while you did it.

357
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:42,060
You see this body here? I got
three more just like it before you.

358
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:46,256
Okay. I guess I can leave
it and come back later.

359
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,266
Like I said, put
it with the rest.

360
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,309
Sounds like you'll
need another specimen.

361
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,083
Dr. Upton?

362
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:02,414
Leave it. I'll get
someone to clean it up.

363
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,541
Dr. Upton, is that
supposed to happen?

364
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,078
No.

365
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:12,154
Well, don't just
stand there. Unzip it.

366
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,325
Someone told them electrical
current neutralized snake venom.

367
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,989
- Yeah, it kills you. Hey again.
- Hey.

368
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,266
- I'm gonna go restock the rig.
- You mean steal stuff?

369
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,777
- So how's Mom?
- What?

370
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,041
You know, the lingerie labor.

371
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,811
Oh. Big boy. Nine
pounds, six ounces.

372
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,318
Oh, that's a keeper.

373
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,854
And that's the most important
thing, isn't it? That she keeps it.

374
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,062
- What?
- Oh, you know. You like kids.

375
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:54,223
- You like pregnant women. That's great.
- How about you just relax?

376
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,392
I didn't expect you
to be a mom, that's all.

377
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,003
I'm not a mom. I
had a baby, that's all.

378
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:03,900
Hey, I feel for you. But we all
made mistakes when we were young.

379
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:08,478
I wasn't a teenager,
Greg. It was two years ago.

380
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,479
Yo, gotta roll. LOL slip
and fall on Dickerson.

381
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,848
Yeah, in a sec. Jing-Mei.

382
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,988
You feel guilty about something,
that's your thing. I don't care either way.

383
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,755
- At least I know how you feel.
- That's not what I meant.

384
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,091
Hey, Pratt. There's
someone I want you to meet.

385
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,324
Yeah, not now.

386
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,900
You've met him before.
Come here. You too.

387
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,037
Listen, I'm riding with 37
today. We had a slip and fall.

388
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,335
- Not anymore.
- You don't look lonely and depressed.

389
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,273
- What?
- Nothing.

390
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,744
Holy crap! You
pronounced this guy.

391
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,850
And he scared the hell out of me
when he came to in the morgue.

392
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:48,454
His alcohol level was .322. His
blood was practically antifreeze.

393
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,453
You should know you're not
dead until you're warm and dead.

394
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,526
- Yeah. But he had lividity.
- We call that dirt.

395
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,858
Excuse me. Dr. Lewis, could
I speak to you for a moment?

396
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,863
Of course.

397
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:04,367
This is Dr. Pratt. He's gonna
give you a nice, warm bath.

398
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,266
With bubbles?

399
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,567
Later, dude.

400
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,702
With bubbles.

401
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,115
I don't want Sean
to suffer anymore.

402
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,614
I know it's grim right now...

403
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:22,277
but he seems pretty determined.

404
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,915
Can you tell me something
different than all the oncologists?

405
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,460
Every specialist?

406
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:33,565
Because if you can tell
me that he has a chance...

407
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:39,237
And it's Sean's decision.

408
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,998
No.

409
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,802
No.

410
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:46,673
He didn't even wanna do
the second round of chemo.

411
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,475
But he did it for
me. I made him.

412
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,244
Do you have any
idea what it's like...

413
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:59,984
to watch someone you love suffer
like that just because he loves you?

414
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,253
- Mrs. Simmons...
- He went through hell...

415
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,830
to get to the point
where he and I...

416
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:09,435
finally accepted that
he was going to die.

417
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,433
And then he met you.

418
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,931
He likes you.

419
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,242
As a doctor and as a woman.

420
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:22,106
And without meaning to or
not, you're giving him false hope.

421
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,649
I just want Sean to come home.

422
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:32,522
He'll listen to you if you
tell him that's what's best.

423
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,335
Mr. Kroll.

424
00:26:56,482 --> 00:27:00,715
I'm very sorry. But your son
has suffered a severe head injury.

425
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,821
What are you saying?

426
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,223
He shows no sign
of any brain activity.

427
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,492
The machines are
breathing for him.

428
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,596
And we've been keeping his
body alive until you got here.

429
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:16,892
I didn't...

430
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,062
I didn't see him, Michael.

431
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:24,341
- I didn't see him.
- Okay.

432
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,875
There must be some kind of hope.

433
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,041
I know that you need to believe that, but
you have to understand your son is gone.

434
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,743
He died.

435
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:42,019
- Multifocal PVCs on lidocaine.
- What does that mean?

436
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,697
He'll soon fall back
into cardiac arrest.

437
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,891
And we might be able
to stop that temporarily...

438
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,193
but not indefinitely.

439
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,369
I need to see him again.

440
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,838
- Can I see him?
- Of course.

441
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,383
I don't know how you work here.

442
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,082
- Look, I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Abby, don't say anything.

443
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,716
I thought I could control
him. I thought I was.

444
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,052
Maybe I was blind or stupid...

445
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,991
or refused to see the signs.

446
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,131
Or maybe I'm just nuts.

447
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,233
But I'm not ready to bury him.

448
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,463
Last time I saw my son, he
was alive, and that's my reality.

449
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,099
Until someone proves
otherwise, he is alive.

450
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,482
Will the El take me to Midway?

451
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,981
- Mom...
- Will the El take me to Midway?

452
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,013
Eastbound track.

453
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,188
I'll call you from Cleveland.

454
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,358
Where's your mom?

455
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:59,630
She's out getting stuff
from the nurse to take home.

456
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:07,473
You don't have to put yourself
through this, Sean. Not for her.

457
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,406
What about me?

458
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,350
The most you'll get will be a
couple of months. It's not a cure.

459
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,522
My mom wants you to talk me into
going home with her, doesn't she?

460
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,175
What would you do?

461
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:45,943
Uh... I can't answer that.

462
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,318
I don't wanna die.

463
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,103
Then you should fight.

464
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,231
With everything you have.

465
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,206
Damn. KOVAC: What?

466
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,080
- Looks like I just lost 50 bucks.
- You shouldn't gamble.

467
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,448
Hey, Frank, where's Weaver?

468
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,613
She's at Personnel
looking for new docs.

469
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,520
- You still work here?
- I think so.

470
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,684
- Seizing teenager in Triage.
- Drug user?

471
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,297
Yup. Coming off a meth high.
Just started. Tonic-clonic activity.

472
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,895
How long?

473
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,934
- Two minutes.
- Did you give him anything?

474
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,368
- I - pushed four of Ativan.

475
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,365
Recheck a temp. He's burning up.

476
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:46,205
Amphetamines can raise body
temperature. High fever makes you seize.

477
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,779
Oh, man. It's 107.3.

478
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,913
Wait a minute. We need
to keep him on the monitors.

479
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:55,384
Grab four liters of irrigation. We
need to get his temperature down.

480
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,750
- What about ice packs to the axilla?
- Won't work.

481
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:00,392
- Start a cold gastric lavage.
- We don't have time.

482
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,425
Give me the saline. He needs to
be wet to increase the heat transfer.

483
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,997
- He's seizing again.
- No, he's just shivering.

484
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,624
He's gonna freeze. This is
crazy. I'm getting Weaver.

485
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,237
- V-fib.
- What's that?

486
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,341
- It's an unstable heartbeat.
- What will that do to him?

487
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,175
His heart isn't pumping
enough oxygen through his body.

488
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,076
And in a minute, it'll stop.

489
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,453
- That's when you would shock him?
- Mm-hm.

490
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,954
<i>Okay.</i>

491
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:48,002
I love you, baby.

492
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,969
I love you, sweetie, so much.

493
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,446
Hello.

494
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:05,647
Yeah, this is she.

495
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:16,333
Was it damaged?

496
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,169
Well, then where's my brother?

497
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,882
Did he leave a
bag or a note or...?

498
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,715
It's him?

499
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,020
Well, do you think you
could leave it there, so if he...?

500
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,490
- No.
- They found his plane?

501
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,152
What's the name of the town?

502
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,888
- Thank you. Intact.
- Intact.

503
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:51,161
Yeah. Tied down in a field
outside of Sault Sainte Marie.

504
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,329
- He's alive.
- He cared enough to tie down his plane.

505
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,635
- Yeah.
- I guess Maggie was right.

506
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,436
God, I'll be right back.

507
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,970
Mom.

508
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,304
Mom.

509
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,045
Mom.

510
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,922
- What are you doing?
- It was cooking his brain.

511
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,458
He needs to be on a monitor.

512
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:51,426
Ice immersion can cause an
arrhythmia or a heart attack.

513
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,122
- Not in a young, healthy patient.
- He'll get frostbite.

514
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,859
- He won't be out here that long.
- Temp's down to 104.

515
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,163
Okay, that's good. Let's
put him on a gurney.

516
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,773
We saved his brain,
heart, kidneys and liver.

517
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:07,140
Yeah. Well, I guess it's a good
thing you decided to finally come in.

518
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,042
Where is it? I don't see it.
- A little further north?

519
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,446
- What, Canada?
- No. Michigan, I think.

520
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,949
Oh, wait. Here it is.

521
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,920
Sault Sainte Marie. Michigan.
Yes, you're right. Michigan.

522
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,127
- You know, you were right.
- About what?

523
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,929
He's okay.

524
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:29,727
Yes, but you could've just as
easily gotten the other phone call.

525
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:33,030
And in his mind, it
wouldn't have been selfish.

526
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,038
It would've been other things.
He doesn't wanna be a burden.

527
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,470
He's not.

528
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,476
Well, we have to make
sure he knows that he's not.

529
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,873
He canceled his cell phone,
but he still has his e-mail.

530
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,041
Don't you think we could
send him a message?

531
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,016
I think if he wants to get
in touch with us, he will.

532
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,180
I have a little money. We
could go and look for him.

533
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:55,486
- Or I could hire a private investigator.
- No.

534
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,927
We don't get to do anything.

535
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,033
We just have to wait.

536
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,233
He's my son. How can I wait?

537
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,512
It's really hard.

538
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,543
But you just have to go about
your life and do everyday things.

539
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,551
Go to work. Do your
laundry. Clean the house.

540
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,088
You know, just try to keep your
mind off all the horrible things...

541
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,919
that might be happening to him.

542
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,562
And you do that for
a week, or a month...

543
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:34,564
or maybe a year.

544
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:40,299
And then someday he'll show up,
and we'll drop everything and go to him.

545
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,569
Or we get the other phone call.

546
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:53,911
Welcome to the
outside of the disease.

547
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,549
He sure looks good for a corpse.

548
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,123
- You heard?
- Yeah.

549
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,419
- Listen. I wanted to say...
- Look, I'm sorry...

550
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,325
- No, go ahead.
- No, no. You go.

551
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,399
Well, um, before, you
know, maybe you were right.

552
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,261
Maybe I was a little judgmental.

553
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,673
Well, that's good to know.

554
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:20,638
Well, look, I feel like people are
judging me all the time, and I hate it.

555
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:25,079
So if I did that to
you, then I'm sorry.

556
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,816
Especially because I
like you and respect you.

557
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,951
I mean, what the hell
do I know anyway?

558
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,117
You sure don't know
how to apologize.

559
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,126
No, I don't.

560
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,356
So, what were you gonna say?

561
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,469
You wanna see a picture of him?

562
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,304
Yeah.

563
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,269
You know, I get these letters
from his adoptive parents...

564
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,811
and I look forward to
getting them, but I also don't.

565
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,575
His name's Michael.

566
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,619
- He's black.
- Half.

567
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,382
Okay, okay.
Asian-African-American.

568
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,491
It's a great combination.
He's beautiful.

569
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,821
- Thank you.
- You almost ready?

570
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,594
Yeah, just give me 10
minutes. I'll be right there.

571
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,727
Night, Dr. Chen.

572
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,867
You told me you were
going out with Lewis tonight.

573
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,532
- Yeah.
- Jing-Mei, come on.

574
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:28,510
I'm taking the paramedics out. I told
Harms and Morales I'd buy them dinner.

575
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,706
I only see Harms.

576
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,010
- Why don't you come with us?
- I don't think so.

577
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,881
But have fun.

578
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,223
Oh!

579
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,519
- What's wrong?
- Pratt.

580
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,391
- What'd he do?
- He has a date.

581
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,032
- No.
- Yeah, with Harms.

582
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,827
The paramedic?

583
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,993
It's my own fault.

584
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,197
You're forgetting the number
one rule of dating: men are scum.

585
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,866
And women don't know what the hell
they want. Am I right? I'm right, right?

586
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,945
They want commitment until you
give it. Then, they want freedom.

587
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,342
Naturally, you oblige.

588
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,508
Then they accuse you of trying to
be with someone else. Can't win.

589
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,277
Women are hard to
figure out sometimes.

590
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,754
Sometimes? You know who's got it
all figured out, I think? Homosexuals.

591
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,390
I'm serious. Just listen.
There's two guys living together.

592
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,792
Toilet seat's always up,
channel's always on ESPN.

593
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,898
You can drink, leave
clothes on the floor.

594
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,864
- Gay cats got it good.
- Why you telling me this?

595
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,698
I have no idea.

596
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,973
- I thought you were on vacation.
- I thought you quit.

597
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,175
Can you take hives in 4?
- I'm not on.

598
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,597
- One more?
- I was never on.

599
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,442
- What are you doing here?
- I have no idea.

600
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,242
- Did you call Trauma 2?
- Yeah, Transpo's moving him now.

601
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,284
- Grief counselors are with the parents.
- Wanna stay and work?

602
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,047
- Not a chance.
- You already missed half your shift.

603
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,090
- I told you I had things to do.
- Good. You can work a double.

604
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,625
- Whatever.
- Board's full. You better get started.

605
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,763
- I did start.
- Good.

606
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,990
Hey, the prodigal
doctor returns.

607
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,134
Why is there a
sumo wrestler in 1?

608
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,202
See, like you never left.

609
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,407
- Takeout should be here any minute.
- Okay.

610
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,606
Hey. What you reading?

611
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,077
<i>Mansfield Park.</i>

612
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:15,311
- For, like, the 45th time.
- No, I just... It's the third time.

613
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,853
Why read, man, when you got TV?

614
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,031
You know...

615
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,427
I don't...

616
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,664
I don't wanna wait. I think
that we should try again.

617
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,275
You feel like
something's missing here?

618
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:44,644
Yes. Yes.

619
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,013
Okay. Well, are you
sure you're ready?

620
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,822
I was thinking
that it should be...

621
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,460
I was thinking that it
should be you this time.

622
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,498
Me?

623
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,868
Kerry, honey, listen.

624
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,063
You know what I
do. I'm the roof man.

625
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:11,175
I can't swing a Halligan
when I'm six months pregnant.

626
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,471
You could take a leave. You're
younger. You'd have a better chance.

627
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,341
Listen...

628
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:20,975
I know I'm supposed to feel like
I wanna carry a baby. But I don't.

629
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:26,517
Once that baby's inside of
you, it's... I mean, it's incredible.

630
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,818
- I mean, it's...
- Kerry, I don't want it.

631
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,586
I don't want it.

632
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,862
And I know that makes
you feel like I'm not...

633
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,832
- a total woman or something.
- No, it doesn't. It doesn't...

634
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,528
It doesn't make me feel that.

635
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,171
Babe, listen to me. Listen.

636
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,909
We're being totally honest here.

637
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,549
I can't.

638
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,081
I'm sorry, but I can't.

639
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,349
Not even for me? Come on.

640
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,692
Don't do that. Come on.

641
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,057
That's not fair.

642
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:12,234
Well, none of
this is fair, Sandy.

643
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,230
None of it's fair.

644
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:23,145
I'll call the takeout guy. He
should've been here by now.

645
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,919
Hey.

646
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,728
Don't put it out on my account.

647
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,660
I only wanted half.

648
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,357
Nobody smokes half a cigarette.

649
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,168
I do.

650
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,602
- When I'm trying to quit.
- Oh, back to that, are we?

651
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,069
- I like routine.
- Yeah.

652
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,174
Like disappearing on me.

653
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,005
I know. I'm sorry.

654
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,310
It's no problem.

655
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,086
You had bigger concerns.

656
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,183
Yeah, like ruining
your vacation.

657
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,458
You might've saved
me from a shark attack.

658
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,487
Run away, Carter.

659
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,423
Run as fast as you can.

660
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,292
Where's Maggie?

661
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,131
She went home.

662
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,138
- Minnesota?
- Please.

663
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,138
Well, you wanna hide
out at my place for a while?

664
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,046
Did you hear what I
said about running away?

665
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,985
I block out about
half of what you say.

666
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:36,716
Only half?

667
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,918
The negative half.

668
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,796
- I'm sorry.
- No. You're right.

669
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:54,166
I am negative. It's hard not to be when
you attract misery everywhere you go.

670
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,672
- I'm not gonna let you do this.
- I'm like a magnet for it.

671
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,869
- You shouldn't have to deal with this.
- Now you're pissing me off.

672
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,015
- Maybe you should just cut your losses.
- You know, Eric is alive!

673
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:07,846
- Take two seconds and rejoice in that.
- I did.

674
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,921
I hugged you, and then I ran
away to find my crazy mother.

675
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,990
And I never even
came back to thank you.

676
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,584
Thank you for
traveling all night.

677
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,991
Thank you for working
all day just to be with me.

678
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,357
You're welcome.

679
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:24,400
You know, my life is on hold. It
will always and forever be on hold.

680
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,902
- You don't wanna be on hold.
- Don't put it on hold.

681
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,666
- I have no choice. You do.
- Right. Your life sucks.

682
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,710
- There's nothing you can do about it.
- You don't want me to love you.

683
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,370
- Can I decide that for myself?
- Fine. What do you want?

684
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,574
- I want you to stop being so afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

685
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,184
- I'm just...
- I wanna marry you!

686
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,788
- What?
- I wanna marry you.

687
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,886
- Oh, you're proposing?
- Yeah.

688
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,553
- You're crazy.
- Well, then I'll fit right in.
