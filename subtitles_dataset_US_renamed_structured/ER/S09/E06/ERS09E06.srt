1
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,305
How much did you take out?
- None of it.

2
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,843
None of it?

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,508
Metastatic lesions are studding
the entire abdominal cavity...

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,916
present on the outer
surface of the liver...

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,522
the spleen, the small
intestines, the colon.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,556
Shouldn't you take
out what you can?

7
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:30,027
Surgical removal won't affect
survival. You need to see an oncologist.

8
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,063
Survival?

9
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,700
You don't think I'll survive it?

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,769
- You need to see an oncologist.
- No.

11
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,496
Tell me.

12
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,898
Do I have a chance or don't I?

13
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,634
There's always a
chance, Mr. Willow.

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,368
How much of a chance?

15
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,277
Given the extent of your
disease, with chemotherapy...

16
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,543
less than a 10 percent,
five-year survival.

17
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,519
What's the earliest?

18
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,282
The least amount of time?

19
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,058
I'll have the
oncologist see you.

20
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,594
Excessive therapy. Excessive.
How's this for excessive?

21
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,600
I had my arm sliced off. What
do I need to get full therapy?

22
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,398
I have to have a pack of
wolves come chew my leg off too?

23
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,700
My physical therapist,
my orthopedic surgeon...

24
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:17,709
and the chief of staff of the hospital...
What's his name again? Oh, yeah, me.

25
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,073
His insurance company.

26
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,715
Say I need five days a week
to regain occupational use.

27
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,783
I need a tumor
consult for Mr. Willow.

28
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,217
It's not disability, you gnat!
I'm... I'm still working! It's...

29
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,982
Hello? Hello?

30
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,585
Coward.

31
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,493
- Peek-and-shriek still out of it?
- No, I told him.

32
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,293
- You were in there for 90 seconds.
- Start a Dilaudid drip at 2 milligrams.

33
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,563
- I have to get you a complaint box.
- Nothing I can do but pain control.

34
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:49,301
Your medical student, the martini shaker,
says you refused to put him on call.

35
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,742
- He has Parkinson's disease.
- Hence the martini-shaker reference.

36
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:53,972
Come on, work with me.

37
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,810
Stress and sleep deprivation
only exacerbate his symptoms.

38
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,146
He says he's managing
it, makes a good argument.

39
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,515
It's not fair to the others
to pick up his slack.

40
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,589
I won't put the man
on 36 hours straight.

41
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,226
- He'll nap.
- It's bad enough he has to treat patients.

42
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,362
- Oh, I get it.
- What?

43
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,929
You have something against
doctors with disabilities.

44
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,861
- Only on a case-by-case basis.
- Look...

45
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,231
if this guy wants the surgical-rotation
experience, give it to him.

46
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,771
The last thing I need is some gimp
lawyer from the ACLU coming in here...

47
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,034
telling me to put
handrails on the urinals.

48
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,201
And, "The guy with the
twitch, he's suing you."

49
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,506
What, and we care
nothing about Mr. Nathan?

50
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,945
- Who's Nathan?
- Him. My Parkinson's student.

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,678
Oh, uh, right. No, I don't care.
This place is littered with masochists.

52
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,584
Just make sure he
doesn't kill anyone.

53
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,691
Found her asleep
on the El train.

54
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:41,295
Her name's Sara
Paspalis. She's 14.

55
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,861
Hey, Sara. How you doing?

56
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,256
- Sara, can you hear me?
- Just let me sleep.

57
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,426
- Did she fall?
- She was in her seat when we found her.

58
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,596
I don't see any signs of trauma.
Do you see any signs of trauma?

59
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,402
You could suggest a head
CT and LP just to be safe.

60
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,544
Why are you so sleepy, Sara?

61
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,942
- I'm tired.
- Are you taking any medicine?

62
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,809
- What about drugs?
- Mm-mm.

63
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,076
Let's get a tox screen,
an APAP, CBC and lytes.

64
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,881
- Foley, UA with dip and ICON too.
- Multiple GSW coming in.

65
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,287
Weaver's stuck in a meeting. She
wants to push your 12:30 meeting to 1.

66
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,983
Sure. Uh, wait. What meeting?

67
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,924
Uh, the one with HR. You
know, the nurses' petition.

68
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,061
What petition?

69
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,595
- Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,066
- Hi.
- Hi.

71
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,262
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

72
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,431
I wasn't planning on
coming here to see you.

73
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,601
But I'm glad you're working today. Jody got
sick, so I figured I'd just bring her in.

74
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,269
- Who's Jody?
- Oh, my girlfriend.

75
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,177
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah, what do you think?

76
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,681
- She's cute.
- Yeah? It's only been a couple weeks.

77
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,151
- Come on and meet her. You'll like her.
- Okay, just one second.

78
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,789
Um, she's not feeling well?

79
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,518
I don't know. Maybe the flu. She has a
headache and her stomach was upset.

80
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,322
We had some shrimp in
Biloxi. It smelled kind of funny.

81
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,795
- You had shrimp in Biloxi?
- I rented a Cessna.

82
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,797
Hey, Jody. This is
my big sister Abby.

83
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,435
- Hi.
- Hi.

84
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,265
Kind of little to
be your big sister.

85
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,771
Eric says you're not feeling
well. What seems to be the...

86
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,334
problem?

87
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,659
Thirty-six-year-old
GSW times three.

88
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,027
- Three?
- That's right, mamasan, I'm bulletproof.

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,066
Tachy at 110, BP
holding at 100/80.

90
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,864
- He'll need blood.
- I don't need blood. I need a beer.

91
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,133
- Happy hour isn't until 4:00.
- How about a nurse to sit on my face?

92
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,539
You up for a lap dance, Malik?
- Maybe.

93
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,406
Stay away from
me, chocolate homo.

94
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,911
How'd you know my stage name?

95
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,016
- Abby, we'll need some extra hands.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

96
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,211
- What do you think? Shrimp?
- It's a good theory. How did you meet?

97
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,879
She works in a bookstore.
She's really great.

98
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,355
She's smart, funny, when
she's not throwing up.

99
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,324
Does she go to school, or is
the bookstore a full-time thing?

100
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,192
- She's 21, almost.
- Twenty.

101
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:35,062
She's trying to become a writer. She is
a writer. She hasn't been discovered yet.

102
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,363
I've read her stuff.
It's really good.

103
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,732
- And...
- I think she's good.

104
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,602
- You're flying around the country?
- The Midwest, the South.

105
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,041
- Her parents are from Ohio.
- And you can afford a plane?

106
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,840
Renting a plane. What's wrong?

107
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,744
Nothing. It just seems
like a lot of money, that's all.

108
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,283
- We'll get out of your hair...
- We need your help!

109
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,183
Okay. It's not a bad time.
I'll be back in a minute.

110
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,416
- Muffled heart sounds.
- I want the American doctor.

111
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,052
Chen is the American doctor. Betadine,
seven and a half sterile gloves...

112
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,461
and a 30 French chest
tube on a vascular clamp.

113
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,897
- 70 systolic.
- Hey, Abby, have you seen Sara?

114
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,731
- Who?
- That girl that fell asleep on the El.

115
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,772
- She was in Exam 1.
- I was there, remember? She's gone.

116
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,704
Ten blade, sterile drapes.

117
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,368
Pericardial effusion.
Spinal needle and syringe.

118
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:23,415
- Me love you long time, right in the ass.
- Careful, she's the one with the needle.

119
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,052
Hey, dude, can you hear me?

120
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,155
- He's out, but he's breathing.
- She may have wandered off. Abby...

121
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:33,760
We're in the middle of a trauma. Would
you like us to stop and help you look?

122
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,122
I'm in.

123
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,786
No pressure. No pulse.

124
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,733
Needle out. 40 cc's of pericardial
blood. No blood in the Thora-Seal.

125
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,135
Hold it. Sinus rhythm.
Pressure's coming up.

126
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,098
- Nice needle. ABBY:
Third unit's going up.

127
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,404
Pressure's 100/72.
Sats are at 95 percent.

128
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,309
We have a trauma patient
in here in respiratory distress.

129
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,815
We should crack his chest anyway.
- No breath sounds at all.

130
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,749
Twenty-six-year-old female,
went down at a crosswalk.

131
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,446
GCS 13, slightly altered.

132
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,820
- Pulse ox 89, tachy at 120.
- She carries oxygen, but tank's empty.

133
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,985
We've been going easy on the
O-2 in case she's a chronic retainer.

134
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,688
- Think she has bilateral pneumo?
- It doesn't make sense.

135
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,800
- There's no signs of trauma.
- The scars?

136
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,869
Looks like lung-volume-reduction
surgery and a liver transplant.

137
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,437
All right, everybody
quiet. Just quiet.

138
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,176
Here.

139
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,675
Coarse rhonchi bilaterally.

140
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,985
- That's so faint.
- ABG looks good.

141
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,357
I understand you had a
conversation with Dr. Romano.

142
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,856
Yeah, he was very supportive.

143
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,460
Unfortunately, he's not
assessing your performance.

144
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,496
So if you have concerns
regarding your rotation...

145
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,360
I've told you my concerns.

146
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,731
- Go through the proper channels.
- Well, I'll certainly try.

147
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,496
Alison, do you have emphysema?

148
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,543
- Alpha-1-antitrypsin...
- Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency?

149
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,738
What can you tell us about
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Nathan?

150
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:04,351
A genetic disease. Causes reduced
serum levels in alpha-1 blood proteins.

151
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,316
- Why is that bad?
- The abnormal mutation gets hung up...

152
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,548
- in the liver, causes cirrhosis.
- And why can't she breathe?

153
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,694
Well, without alpha-1,
trypsin is unopposed.

154
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,989
It's eating the alveolar
surfaces in her lungs.

155
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,688
Yes. And?

156
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,998
Panacinar emphysema.

157
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,232
She's got the lungs of an
80-year-old chain-smoker. She's...

158
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,709
She's drowning in
her own mucous.

159
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,478
You're not getting
enough oxygen.

160
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,845
- We need to put a tube in your throat.
- No tube.

161
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,884
- No, we need to.
- How about a BiPAP, pressure mask?

162
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,387
Will that work?

163
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,587
It might. Get one, call RT.

164
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,056
Good call.

165
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,022
Third unit's up. MALIK:
Pressure's 100/72, sats 96.

166
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,131
Haleh, you know
anything about a petition?

167
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,699
- Yeah. I signed it. We all did.
- Not me.

168
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,804
A guy comes in here with three
bullet holes and nobody pages me?

169
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,941
- You're a trauma queen.
- What is it, about cafeteria hours again?

170
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,770
No, Dr. Kovac. They figure
you wasn't gonna do anything...

171
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,107
- because, well, you know.
- No. Do anything about what?

172
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,771
Don't sweat it. They're whining.

173
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,577
- You cut up Denise. PRATT:
Looks like she saved your butt.

174
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,447
We had to put in a chest tube.

175
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,953
- That was my wife, you gook bitch.
- Hey!

176
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,784
Me and my boys
are gonna cut you up.

177
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:21,052
The only boys you're gonna be
seeing are in the prison shower.

178
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,888
You okay?

179
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,296
- Chen.
- I'm fine.

180
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,299
Repeat ABG in 20 minutes and get
a portable chest before we move her.

181
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,565
Dr. Corday, penetrating
trauma in Curtain 3.

182
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,764
Be right there.

183
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,740
I'd like to follow the evaluation
for heart-lung transplant.

184
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,403
Complete discharge summaries
and review all ER charts...

185
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,105
for possible surgical consults.

186
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,682
Can I go to the ball after that?

187
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,217
There's an M and
M at 3. Don't be late.

188
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,914
- She's a good teacher.
- Yeah, that's what they keep telling me.

189
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,295
- How are you feeling?
- Yeah, a little better.

190
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,864
- Sorry I almost puked on you.
- It's okay. It comes with the territory.

191
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,797
- Where's Eric?
- He went out for a smoke.

192
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,300
- A smoke?
- I know.

193
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,497
I tell him to quit, but he doesn't
listen. You should talk to him.

194
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,938
He'll listen to you, especially
since you're a nurse.

195
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,629
- Can you excuse me one second?
- Yeah.

196
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,707
Hey.

197
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,611
I'm, uh, being sent to the
principal's office because of you.

198
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,184
- What?
- You pissed off a bunch of nurses.

199
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,345
- How?
- I think it's an attitude problem.

200
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,354
I have a good attitude.

201
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,856
- Hey, Abby.
- I do.

202
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,550
Abby, I still can't find her.

203
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,696
Jerry, could you help
Harkins find her patient?

204
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,198
Big hospital, many
patients, very busy.

205
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,729
Abby.

206
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,564
Call security.

207
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,066
Darius here skateboarded into a
car door. No LOC, normal vitals.

208
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,211
Obvious ankle deformity,
but good pulses.

209
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,041
- Guy opened it right in front of me.
- You have a last name?

210
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,012
- It's just Darius.
- Oh, like Cher.

211
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,175
- Do you have any allergies, Darius?
- No.

212
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,254
- Have you seen my brother?
- He wanted cigarettes.

213
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,856
He's getting me lottery tickets.
- What?

214
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,256
- I figured what the hell. It's 87 million.
- You have a better chance...

215
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,690
of getting hit by a car.

216
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,592
- Was that supposed to be funny?
- Sorry.

217
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,425
- You wanna go in with me?
- No, thanks.

218
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,159
Maybe you could use it to
cover my malpractice lawsuit.

219
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,201
- Hey.
- Hey.

220
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,738
Uh-oh. <i>National Enquirer.</i>

221
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,900
Embarrassing, I know,
but Jody's a gossip junkie.

222
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,410
- When did you start smoking?
- Oh, a while ago.

223
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,448
- What's "a while"?
- What difference does it make?

224
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,417
I don't know. Nobody starts
smoking over the age of 25.

225
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,352
Well, what can I say?
I'm a late bloomer.

226
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,918
You know, I'm serious.
Eric, it's really not good.

227
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,190
Well, you smoke, and you've been
smoking since you were what, 8?

228
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,325
- Cute. We're not talking about me.
- You're right. How's Jody?

229
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,763
I don't know. She seems better.

230
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,635
- She's not pregnant.
- Was that a possibility?

231
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,204
I don't know. You tell me.

232
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,110
Well, yeah, I guess.

233
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,582
Oh, come on. What if...? Okay,
what if she was? Then what?

234
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,880
- But she's not.
- You just said she could be.

235
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,048
- But she's not.
- What are you doing? What's going on?

236
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,285
Okay, Mom, I'm having sex with
my girlfriend. What are you, a nun?

237
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,728
You show up with this girl who's barely
out of her teens, who could be pregnant.

238
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,459
- But isn't.
- On some weird impromptu leave.

239
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,070
- People take vacations.
- You were renting a plane...

240
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,467
I know you can't afford.

241
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,874
Oh, I forgot, you're
a financial wizard.

242
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,076
Don't. Don't mock me.

243
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,506
I'm not the one who's...

244
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,407
Who's what? In love?

245
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,179
Oh, you're in love?

246
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,517
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Okay.

247
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,950
- Is that a bad thing?
- No.

248
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,320
Help! Somebody help! Over here!

249
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,516
Help!

250
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,488
Can you go inside and tell
them I need a gurney? Fast.

251
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,327
Sara?

252
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,334
Sara.

253
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,802
How long has she been like this?

254
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,502
I don't know. Is she dead?

255
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,280
Wake up, Sara.

256
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,178
She might wake
up if I kissed her.

257
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,319
She's seizing. Damn it.

258
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,683
Sats any better?

259
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,825
Ninety-three after a couple nebs.
She wants to take the mask off.

260
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,291
Okay. Just keep
an eye on her rate.

261
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,429
Did you call my dad?

262
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,565
We left a message.

263
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,964
Do you take Prolastin
for your Alpha-1?

264
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,935
No.

265
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,203
Got hives and
anaphylactic shock.

266
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,003
Throat closed up.

267
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,439
A true anaphylactic reaction
to Prolastin is pretty rare.

268
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,944
Lucky me.

269
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,511
They took me off
a few years ago.

270
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,756
You have pneumonia.

271
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,858
Fifth time this year.

272
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,723
- A new record.
- Well, we can clear that up.

273
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,922
Do you have any
allergies to any antibiotics?

274
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,566
No.

275
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,563
I wanna sign a DNR.

276
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,573
My liver's sick. My
lungs are shredded.

277
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,404
The antibiotics will
make you feel better.

278
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,408
Don't take it personally.

279
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,718
I just don't want any more help.

280
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,584
I'm ready to die.

281
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,091
Can you hold her arm down?

282
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,130
Nobody mentioned
she was seizing.

283
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,801
She is not.

284
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:36,606
Six centimeter jagged scalp lac.
Looks like it's torn straight to the bone.

285
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,904
- What was she in for?
- Uh, we don't know for sure.

286
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,310
Police found her asleep on the El.
- Possible drug overdose.

287
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,247
Possible brain bleed. I just
don't understand these girls...

288
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,683
who'll take any pill
handed to them at a party.

289
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,117
- Dr. Corday...
- Yeah.

290
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,747
Could you witness a DNR? I
need a second physician's signature.

291
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,451
Oh, there's no gag. She's
not protecting her airway.

292
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,460
- I got it.
- Thanks, Luka.

293
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,863
Okay, let's intubate her and then get
her up to CT. Care to do the honors?

294
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,469
Uh, yeah, sure.

295
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,538
Scope in the left hand.

296
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,809
- Sats are 98. CORDAY:
Slide along the tongue.

297
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,036
Across and out of the way.

298
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,506
Good. That was excellent.
Now look for the cords.

299
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,545
That's it. Excellent.

300
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,858
Lucky lottery ticket?
It's only 2 bucks a pop.

301
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,619
They're one buck
across the street.

302
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,856
Not with my patented
number-selection system.

303
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,572
Looks like she's feeling better.

304
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,538
She should, after 125
milligrams of Demerol.

305
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,201
- She had a migraine.
- So she needed Demerol?

306
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,680
She failed Compazine, she's
allergic to Imitrex, and she's almost 21.

307
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,716
Oh, he mentioned that, did he?

308
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,548
- He's a funny guy.
- He thinks he's in love.

309
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,213
Well, you can't have
enough love in the world.

310
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,087
- What, you don't like her?
- I just met her. So did he.

311
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,820
Jerry, call me when the
labs for Fay Graham get here.

312
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,262
You bet. Speaking of betting, are
you feeling lucky today, Dr. Chen?

313
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,766
Reselling lottery
tickets is a felony.

314
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,837
Got an officer needs
some work here.

315
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,166
- What happened?
- She was involved in a shooting.

316
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,935
Her hand got shredded by a
window. She says it's no big deal.

317
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,271
It's not. ABBY: Let's
sit down right here.

318
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,038
- She's lost a pint by now.
- I'm okay.

319
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,342
Okay, let me take a look at it.

320
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,115
Abby, director of Nursing's calling.
You're late for a meeting with Romano.

321
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,917
Okay, here. Someone'll be
with you in a minute, okay?

322
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,925
- Nathan, you're surgical, right?
- Yeah, but I'm taking this...

323
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,689
Somebody from Trauma or
Hand should take a look at this.

324
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,890
Irrigate, but she
might need an O.R.

325
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,625
She collapsed on the street.

326
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,235
She's got pneumonia,
signs of liver rejection.

327
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,803
Why isn't she on a vent?

328
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,600
She declined the use of one.

329
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,471
You said she had pneumonia and her
lungs are shot. How will she breathe?

330
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:55,547
Mr. Deluca, your daughter
signed a "do not resuscitate" order.

331
00:16:55,715 --> 00:17:00,119
She's just depressed. She gets that
way sometimes. Let me talk to her.

332
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,414
I don't think she wants
to be talked out of it.

333
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,489
- Of course she does, she's just a kid.
- She's 26.

334
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,092
She gets tired.

335
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,629
Yeah, she's dying.

336
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,991
We're all dying.

337
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,161
Not like that.

338
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,663
She's in tremendous pain.

339
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,236
And she knows that
that's never gonna change.

340
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,102
She stopped taking her
anti-rejection meds weeks ago.

341
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,971
Catch her up.

342
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,380
- Can't do that.
- Then I'll make her take them.

343
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,849
It won't work.

344
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,781
She's allergic to the only
medicine that can keep her alive.

345
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,580
We'll find new meds.

346
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,347
And when those fail...

347
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,391
she'll need a complete heart-lung
transplant for even a chance of survival.

348
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,429
Then I'll get her one.

349
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,395
So she can face the same
disease all over again?

350
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,601
If you don't want
to fight for her...

351
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,039
I'll find a doctor who will.

352
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,619
Insert and cock your
wrist at 90 degrees.

353
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,655
Fired three rounds
before I knew it.

354
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,655
Department-issue semi-automatic.

355
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,626
If possible, use your
pinkie to steady your hand.

356
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,566
- It was all really fast, you know?
- I'm sure you did the right thing.

357
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,367
It's my first week. I've
been scared every day.

358
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,475
If it's not what you
were expecting...

359
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,975
there's no shame in
exploring other options.

360
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,180
Dr. Corday, I need you.

361
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,682
I'll be back to
check the sutures.

362
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,517
Could you put some
pressure right here?

363
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,316
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be right back.

364
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,322
She was so altered
when she came in.

365
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,985
Don't you think that officer could be
suffering from post-traumatic stress?

366
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,028
Yes. Call a social worker.

367
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,532
You know, I just thought it was me,
but you're kind of cool, aren't you?

368
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,837
- Pardon?
- A social worker?

369
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,937
Isn't it our job to
take care of people?

370
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:05,374
If you insist on being on a surgical
rotation, Mr. Nathan, act like a surgeon.

371
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,375
Act like I don't
give a damn. Got it.

372
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,574
That woman's hand is bleeding and in
need of suture. That's how you can help.

373
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,775
What was it?

374
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,625
She was altered
when she came in.

375
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,951
I figured it was something that wouldn't
show on a tox screen, like Ecstasy.

376
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,116
I read this article
about Special K...

377
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,784
- Come on, get on with it.
- It's replaced roofies.

378
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,090
It's mostly a date-rape drug.
It's sometimes recreational.

379
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,429
I just never thought to
look before, Dr. Corday.

380
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:33,432
Of course you disagree. It flies in the
face of the culture you've established.

381
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,303
There is no culture.
We're too busy saving lives.

382
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,808
It's not funny. By not
occluding it at the onset...

383
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,775
you have allowed
it to proliferate.

384
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:45,042
You have anything monosyllabic to
add other than apologies for being late?

385
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,879
- Sorry.
- No, that's two syllables.

386
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,921
So, Mary...

387
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,458
answer me this. What
are you looking for from us?

388
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,460
As nursing director, I feel a
full investigation is in order.

389
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,394
- Of Dr. Kovac?
- Of the entire physician staff.

390
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,726
Oh, come on.

391
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,332
It's true we get no respect,
but this is one complaint...

392
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,905
filed by one nurse against
one doctor that she knew.

393
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,567
That she what?

394
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,601
Nothing, she just
doesn't like him anymore.

395
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,775
I have a petition signed by
every nurse in the department.

396
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,918
All of whom are tired, overworked,
underpaid and pissed off.

397
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,350
- Excluding the males.
- And Nurse Lockhart.

398
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:26,322
Apparently, your relationship with
Dr. Kovac ended better than Chuny's.

399
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,419
Did you really just say that?

400
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,127
So it's true. You're all
suckers for the accent.

401
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,060
- Robert. ROMANO:
Bottom line is...

402
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,497
this'll be handled by the medical
exec committee. So until then...

403
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,196
how do we untwist
everybody's panties?

404
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,538
Open your eyes. I
know you're faking.

405
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,008
Flowers from a doc.

406
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,443
I like this hospital.

407
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,550
Ah, they were half price
at the gift shop, day-old.

408
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,881
Pull off a few petals,
they're good as new.

409
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,216
Thanks.

410
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,214
Did he go outside?

411
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,053
Yeah. He's taking a walk.

412
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,856
- In circles?
- Yeah.

413
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,794
He did that a lot when Mom died.

414
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,131
Sometimes it's harder
on the people that love us.

415
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,238
He's in denial, thinks
there's actually hope.

416
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,203
So do I.

417
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,341
Excuse me. Excuse me.

418
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,643
- Did Weaver get down here?
- I haven't seen her.

419
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,251
Hey, how'd it go?

420
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,909
Luka.

421
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,484
Where'd you go? I was looking for you.
- I had a meeting.

422
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,752
- She's resting.
- Can I talk to you in a second?

423
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,362
She's feeling better and
John was great with her.

424
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,123
Luka.

425
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,761
- Who?
- Uh, your boyfriend, John Carter.

426
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,197
Carter.

427
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,430
Hey, can I borrow your keys? I
think we need to crash for a while.

428
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,110
- I hoped we could stay at your place.
- Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.

429
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:55,237
We'll grab a hotel if it's a hassle, but I
figured we could spend time together.

430
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,849
- No, you're right. It will be fun.
- You sure?

431
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,618
- There's not a lot of room, but...
- It doesn't matter.

432
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,722
Jody's great, and you're great,
and you should get to know her.

433
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,881
Okay, Eric. It's fine.

434
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,617
Good. Great.

435
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,661
- So...
- So...

436
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,961
- The keys.
- The keys. Right.

437
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,758
They're in my locker. Hold on.

438
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,563
Elizabeth, can you
handle the rape exam in 4?

439
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,967
- I believe you did her consult?
- She's an ER case.

440
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,301
Well, at the moment I'm
down an ER Attending.

441
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,306
Sorry, I tried to get to
you first. What'd she say?

442
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,416
Suspended, pending
an investigation.

443
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,109
I guess the nurses
don't like me.

444
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,312
Look, I'm sorry. But once
they got the director involved...

445
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,453
It's fine. Right now, I'm not
too crazy about them either.

446
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:43,062
It could be as little as three days.
You could use the free time, right?

447
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,822
Thanks for the heads-up.

448
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,935
Pull inferiorly on the
speculum heel slowly.

449
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,738
I should've checked sooner.
She was alone on the train.

450
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,246
Open and visualize the cervix.

451
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,611
Whoa, not so fast.

452
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,218
Sorry.

453
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,022
You sure this is the case
she should be learning on?

454
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,522
Patient's unconscious.
You have stricter criteria?

455
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,923
- Father's here. Should I let him in?
- No.

456
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,690
Could you shut the door, please?

457
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,027
Let's swab for a wet
mount and a Gram stain.

458
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,538
Is this the cervix? I
think it's the cervix.

459
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,137
A small tear at the introitus.

460
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,039
- What does that mean?
- Semen present.

461
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,874
Check the culture
for GC and chlamydia.

462
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,482
You'll need
consent for a full kit.

463
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,215
What, are they dating now?

464
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,787
I don't think he'll make
the best surgeon...

465
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,121
but he seems to have
a way with the patients.

466
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,060
Maybe he could
be a nursing liaison.

467
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,927
- Need me for something?
- No.

468
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,261
- Dr. Corday?
- Where is she? Where's my daughter?

469
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,997
Mr. Paspalis, uh, we're
examining her right now.

470
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,935
Why do they make
shower knobs so sharp?

471
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,009
- Hey, Pratt. Head lac, no LOC.
- Sorry, cat. I'm off.

472
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,906
Night, Lisa.

473
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,417
So did you get your
lottery tickets yet?

474
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,185
And live on the
dole my whole life?

475
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,919
I thought you were off at 5.

476
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:27,089
Charts. I can't sleep knowing that
they're sitting here waiting for me.

477
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,202
How come nobody told us being
a doctor was about killing trees?

478
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,496
Hm.

479
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,037
- You need some help?
- I think I have it down.

480
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,699
How about a beer maybe?

481
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,706
No! I don't take
trains! I hate trains!

482
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,469
Stop it! I wanna
get off! Let me go!

483
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,343
Haleh, Ativan's not working on
Dorothy. Give her five of Haldol.

484
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,279
My pleasure.

485
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,115
That guy really
spooked you today.

486
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,521
Who?

487
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,485
You should go home.

488
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,626
We treat crazy people
here. It's nothing new.

489
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,288
Come on, get your things.
Let's go. We'll split a cab.

490
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,001
Trauma coming in.

491
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,662
Car jumped a curb and
ran into a line of people...

492
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,706
- waiting to buy lottery tickets.
- Huh.

493
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,504
And some people
don't believe in luck.

494
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,146
We out of Haldol?

495
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:16,179
Top drawer.

496
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,310
Chuny forgot to restock.

497
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,681
It's nothing personal,
Abby. I like Dr. Kovac.

498
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,824
Really? It's hard to tell.

499
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,856
He'll be back to work tomorrow.

500
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,154
We have to do this
to send a message.

501
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,854
- Do you know what happened?
- I don't care what happened.

502
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:35,766
- You cared enough to sign a petition.
- Another nurse asks for support...

503
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,302
- I'll give it every time.
- Whether she's right or not?

504
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,007
I've been doing this
job for 17 years, honey.

505
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:46,543
Doctors come and go, but
nurses make this place run.

506
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,911
We don't get much credit or much pay.
We see a lot of misery, a lot of dying...

507
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,847
but we come back every day.

508
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,345
I've given up on
being appreciated.

509
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,855
But I sure as hell won't let
any of us be taken for granted.

510
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:06,031
I can't even get to
the bathroom anymore.

511
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,531
Well, nobody said it
was gonna be easy.

512
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,694
But you have a brain that
works, a father who loves you.

513
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,939
You hold on to that.

514
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,235
You hold on to that
as long as you can.

515
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,136
Anything could happen.
A cure could happen.

516
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,939
We need to move her.
There are traumas coming.

517
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,711
Fine. Just about to head up to six
west anyway, start looking for that liver.

518
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,719
- He's cute, but annoying.
- Only because I'm right.

519
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,921
Come on, they need
to prep this room.

520
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,619
- Have you ever been to the ocean?
- Better. I used to have a lakeside condo.

521
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,888
I dream about it.

522
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,724
I dream I'm down on the bottom,
and no matter what, I can't swim up.

523
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:47,570
I try to breathe, and it's
just water, breathing water.

524
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,265
And then when you
wake up, it's true.

525
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,569
But you do wake up, you know.

526
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,237
You open your eyes, you breathe.

527
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,442
It's another day. That's
because you're still alive.

528
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,519
Your body knows it isn't over.

529
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:02,746
Dr. Corday!

530
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,082
- What?
- She woke up.

531
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,420
Very good.

532
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,791
Sara, do you know where you are?

533
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,898
- Daddy?
- You're all right now, honey.

534
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,264
- What happened?
- Sara, do you know where you are?

535
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,775
- The hospital.
- What's the last thing you remember?

536
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,442
I... I was on the train...

537
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,142
with Pat and Andy
going to the city.

538
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:37,045
- My head.
- Oh, you hit it outside on the stairs.

539
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,056
Do you remember anything
else? Anything you did?

540
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,623
No. No.

541
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,661
We were laughing
about something.

542
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,797
And then...

543
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,636
We were laughing.

544
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,834
Sara, we think there may have
been a drug in your system. A sedative.

545
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,807
No, I don't do drugs.

546
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,741
Daddy...

547
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,142
- I don't do drugs.
- I know, honey.

548
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,983
- Upon examination...
- Doctor, I need to speak to you outside.

549
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,047
- Yes, in a minute.
- No. I would like to speak to you now.

550
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,851
Sara, we'll be right back.

551
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,653
Start O-2 humidified mask.

552
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,827
Don't tell her what happened.

553
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,277
- We don't know what happened.
- I don't want her to know.

554
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,184
Mr. Paspalis...

555
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,264
I'll check her out.
I'll take responsibility.

556
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,404
Mr. Paspalis, your
daughter was probably raped.

557
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:29,770
She could be pregnant. She might
have a sexually transmitted disease.

558
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:33,173
- I promise, I'll get her checked out.
- She may not remember, but she...

559
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:38,045
Look, someone hurt her body. It doesn't
mean that he has to ruin her life. Please.

560
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:42,177
I couldn't protect her then, but if she
doesn't know, I can protect her now.

561
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,552
Dr. Corday? EMT:
BP 110/70. Pulse 106.

562
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,023
Complains of headache.
History of hypotension...

563
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,685
I'm so sorry. Can you
just wait here a minute?

564
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:54,230
Lottery line guy. Good airway, no
LOC, refused treatment at the site.

565
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,369
- You thought to bring him anyway?
- I made an executive decision.

566
00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:00,700
I'm next in line. I just
wanna buy a ticket.

567
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,637
- The call was for multiples.
- Five minors went to Mercy.

568
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:07,541
Nine centimeter penetrating lac
over the right frontal... Bollocks.

569
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:11,241
- What?
- Sir, stay very, very still.

570
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,410
- Foreign body goes right through.
- More tachy, pulse 120.

571
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,716
Abby, your brother's
on the phone.

572
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,892
Lung sounds are clear bilaterally.
Maybe the keys don't work.

573
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,724
- We'll need a neurosurgeon.
- BP's dropping, 100/70. Eric?

574
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,264
<i>Sounds busy. Should I call
back?</i> ABBY: What's wrong?

575
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,732
- No other deformity.
<i>- I was looking for the blender.</i>

576
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,428
- When was your last tetanus?
<i>- We're making milk shakes.</i>

577
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,665
- High school, I think.
- The blender?

578
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,811
- Milk shake sounds really good.
- I think it's in the cabinet...

579
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,003
- under the coffeemaker.
- Mr. Gasmer...

580
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,774
we'll need to take you to
the operating room for this.

581
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,975
Jackpot's 87 million.

582
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,949
<i>Your breadmaker's
still in the box.</i>

583
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,021
Sats are at 96, pulse 110.

584
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,420
- Hey, Eric. How's Jody doing?
<i>- Hey, John. She's better.</i>

585
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:57,688
<i>She was thinking we should go out
tonight. Maybe get my sister to dance.</i>

586
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:01,300
- Yeah, she looks excited.
- Get off the phone. Call for a CT scan.

587
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,798
<i>There's the blender.</i>

588
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,767
- Crisis averted.
- They're making milk shakes?

589
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,133
Okay, let's pack him up to go.

590
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,276
We need Ativan
and an airway box.

591
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,172
Alison would like
to speak with you.

592
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:15,314
- Is she moving air?
- Yeah, sats 93, her temp's down to 99.

593
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,972
Send her home with
Biaxin and a fresh O-2 tank.

594
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,450
Uh, she's not ready to go.

595
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,190
She wants a consult
from the transplant service.

596
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:31,023
Did I say the last
ticket sold is at 6:00?

597
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,325
He did it. He
talked her into it.

598
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,199
- She needed to regain her strength.
- Wants to be considered for transplant.

599
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,796
She signed a DNR.

600
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,174
Well, unsign it,
destroy it. I don't care.

601
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,873
She was upset for a few hours.

602
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,312
- Does it disqualify her for the liver?
- No.

603
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,317
No, it shouldn't. But
she's not a great candidate.

604
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,651
Please. She wants
to keep fighting.

605
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,163
I'll be in to see her in a
minute. Would you excuse us?

606
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,267
So do we call UNOS
now or work her up first?

607
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,665
What are you doing?

608
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,937
- She didn't have all the facts.
- Do you know what it'll take...

609
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:20,579
to keep her alive for transplant if
she even qualifies for transplant...

610
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:21,907
and they find a match?

611
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,549
It's not worth it if
there's a shot at a cure?

612
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,015
She's dying. She's suffocating.

613
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,518
- That's her reality.
- There are a lot of realities.

614
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,782
Stem cell research is a reality.

615
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,426
- Stem cells?
- It's coming.

616
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:38,030
Whether the government approves
it or not, it's coming. You know that.

617
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:41,098
Embryonic stem cells can be
used to grow any tissue in the body.

618
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,725
- You told her we could grow new lungs?
- She's got a genetic disease.

619
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,437
Stem cells can fix the
defect at the genetic level.

620
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,201
- Yeah, maybe in 50 years.
- No, in five years.

621
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,470
The science is there if we get
past all this political posturing.

622
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,273
Do you know what it took
for her to face her mortality?

623
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,213
- I think I do.
- For me to convince her dad to accept it?

624
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,478
- This is about your time?
- No, it's about you.

625
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,053
Going in with your agenda
and giving her false hopes.

626
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,554
- It's not false.
- Oh, no?

627
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,726
- The flowers were an interesting touch.
- Well, you gave her 10 minutes.

628
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,963
There is such a thing
as dying with dignity.

629
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,728
Every time a woman goes in
for in vitro and harvests eggs...

630
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:20,896
- there are blastocysts...
- I know the issues. She's suffering.

631
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,565
- She doesn't care about politics.
- It's the politics that are killing her.

632
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:28,077
MI in 1, cured. All
heart disease gone.

633
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,007
Cancer in 4, cured.
Alzheimer's, cured.

634
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,412
The spinal cord injury
this morning, cured.

635
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:36,851
- Parkinson's disease.
- Cured.

636
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,356
- We're out of business.
- You need to believe that.

637
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,642
Pack up all this crap.

638
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,757
I would love to believe
in miracles too...

639
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,420
but she's dying.

640
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:49,932
She's dying, Nathan. And
the only question is, how well?

641
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:54,164
She's 26 years old.
There's no dying well.

642
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,302
You're giving up.

643
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,682
You were happy when he
was babysitting your patient.

644
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,650
He's spending more time in
the ER than the surgical ward.

645
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,654
If her mind was that easily
changed, she wasn't ready to sign.

646
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,850
- Not if he's distorting reality for her.
- He believes that reality.

647
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,961
It's not gangrene,
but he'll need Unasyn.

648
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:20,826
I'm all for big science, and I hope
he's right. But it won't save this girl.

649
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,992
- He offered her hope. Is that so terrible?
- For her, yeah, it is.

650
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,365
You want him on the
ward, I'll keep him there.

651
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,370
No, just supervise him.

652
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,769
Patients are who they are.

653
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:33,002
- I can't change how he sees them.
- Well, it is a teaching hospital.

654
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,148
- Quiet, they're announcing the numbers.
- Hey, move. I can't see.

655
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,807
<i>Jackpot is $87 million.</i>

656
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,618
You better watch out. They're choosing
the next megamillionaire out there.

657
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,454
Thought you already
won the lottery.

658
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,563
Oh, I did when I met you.

659
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,057
Is this gonna be warm enough?

660
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,328
I don't know. Who dances
outside in November?

661
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,904
- Eskimos.
- He doesn't even like to dance.

662
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,906
Well, love makes
you do crazy things.

663
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,575
- What?
- Nothing.

664
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,839
I just wish I could...

665
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,919
go be someplace quiet with him.

666
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:17,283
Well, give her a chance. Maybe
she's mature beyond her years.

667
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,290
I know.

668
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:24,995
It's not her, really. It's him.

669
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,263
- He's acting strange.
- Strange how?

670
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,064
You know, flighty, spontaneous.

671
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,264
- Happy?
- Too happy.

672
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,568
Oh, there's no such thing.

673
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,078
In my family, yes, there is.

674
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,917
He's what, 27?

675
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:53,353
Yeah, but he's smoking, and
he's flying around in planes...

676
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,118
and he has this
milk-shake obsession.

677
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,587
What?

678
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:00,763
- Milk-shake obsession?
- Well...

679
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,094
Think your radar might
be a little sensitive?

680
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,736
No.

681
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,969
I don't know. Maybe.

682
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,275
Hey.

683
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,941
It's a double date.

684
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,741
I think we can all
afford to have some fun.

685
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,315
- Only if you don't make me dance.
- I can't promise.

686
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,147
You have real commitment
issues, you know that?

687
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,823
- Yo, Greg! Yo, Greg!
- Leon.

688
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,289
I won! I won, man! Look at this!

689
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,985
What you doing here? You're
supposed to be at Stevie's.

690
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,461
Who are you? You pretty.
- Get out! Get out!

691
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,795
I'm a winner! PRATT: What
the hell is wrong with you?

692
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:13,200
- I checked the number three times!
- I don't care. Give me some privacy.

693
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,033
- I won!
- It's all right. I should go.

694
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,198
No, he's leaving.
Leon, get out of here.

695
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:21,972
- I'll see you at work, all right? Bye.
- No, Jing-Mei, it's...

696
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:25,447
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'll be fine. Nice meeting you.

697
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,279
Damn it, Leon.

698
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,318
She was hot.

699
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,051
Anybody win anything?

700
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,851
This place is cursed.

701
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,618
Abby. ABBY: I'm off.

702
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:39,629
Luka's in for counseling tomorrow. I
wanna get him on the schedule Tuesday.

703
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:40,822
He agreed to that?

704
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,059
Reluctantly. I threw it
on Human Resources.

705
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,727
- You should've been more on top of this.
- I didn't ask to be nurse manager.

706
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,736
- Are you quitting?
- You want me to quit?

707
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,169
No.

708
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,970
Did you change to go
home and then clock out?

709
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,704
Just set a time to meet
with him after your shift.

710
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,212
- Who?
- Luka.

711
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,850
No, no, no.

712
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,815
He needs to be
counseled by the manager.

713
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,817
- Maybe I do wanna quit.
- It's too late.

714
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,013
Did we get the UA
back on the rape exam?

715
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,991
- I called down there twice.
- If it's negative, have Harkins dispo her.

716
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,595
- You're sending her home?
- With an observation chart.

717
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,664
I mean, without telling her.

718
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,061
She's a minor.

719
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,328
- What about emergency contraception?
- It's the end of her cycle.

720
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,062
So you're gonna lie to her?

721
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,402
- Her father has the right to sign her out.
- She was raped.

722
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,272
- Doesn't she have rights?
- Check the labs. She wants to go.

723
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:29,346
- Sorry, I'm off.
- What?

724
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:33,110
ICU admitted Alison. They're
getting her FFP up there.

725
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,109
Fine.

726
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,619
Congratulations, Mr. Nathan,
you're on call tomorrow night.

727
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,086
- Thank you.
- Thirty-two hours straight.

728
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,856
Go home, get some
rest. You'll need it.

729
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,065
I can't wash my hair?

730
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:58,604
Only for a few days. Your pediatrician
will take your stitches out in a week.

731
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,540
You like being a doctor?

732
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,947
Some days are
better than others.

733
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:10,213
It must be weird seeing
people naked and stuff.

734
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:15,118
I suppose it's weird.
Depends on the patient.

735
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,024
I don't care for the hairy ones.

736
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,660
Sara...

737
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,601
I have to tell you
something very difficult. Um...

738
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,279
When we examined you, we
found evidence of sexual assault.

739
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:40,307
- Assault?
- Yes. You were raped.

740
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:44,186
You told my dad I was raped?

741
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:48,451
He's just trying to protect you.
But you do have the right to know.

742
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,288
The scratches, the bruising...

743
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,163
There's more bruising inside.

744
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,460
- You looked inside?
- We did a rape exam, yes.

745
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,667
Who said you could? I
didn't say you could do that.

746
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,830
You were unconscious.
We had to make sure...

747
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,770
I didn't say you could do that!

748
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:07,879
I know it's confusing and scary. If you'd
like to speak with someone about it...

749
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,310
I wasn't raped,
you stupid bitch.

750
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:15,379
- Sara, there were drugs.
- Yeah. Special K.

751
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,522
Makes the sex
all kind of swirly.

752
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,797
You took ketamine and
had sexual intercourse?

753
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:29,526
It's like having 20 boyfriends,
and they all totally love me.

754
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:34,235
- That's incredibly dangerous.
- No.

755
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,703
I do it every weekend.

756
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,343
You could suffer from
long-term brain damage.

757
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:42,207
I seize sometimes. But we
usually have Ativan or Xanax.

758
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:46,109
And all the guys
say I'm the best.

759
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,585
Catholic school
refugees, both of us.

760
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,748
Uh, Abby was completely famous.
She had a Sex Pistols T-shirt...

761
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,861
- that she wore over her jumper.
- Hope you saved that uniform.

762
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,260
And you were pretty bad yourself
because you got caught making out...

763
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:04,368
with, um, Justine
Miceli in the vestry.

764
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,596
Uh, church always brought
out the romantic in me.

765
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,866
Good to know.

766
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,067
How long you guys gonna stay?
- I don't know.

767
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,873
- We got some sightseeing we wanna do.
- I heard the art museum's really neat.

768
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,876
Yeah, we're just
playing it by ear.

769
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,113
Hang out for a couple
days before Ohio.

770
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:23,278
- Aren't you due back at the base?
- Not for a couple weeks.

771
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,714
- A couple weeks?
- Yeah, like I said, I was overdue.

772
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,359
Did you tell her
about the interview?

773
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,955
- What interview?
- O'Hare.

774
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,066
They're looking for
experienced controllers.

775
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,461
Hello.

776
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:43,073
Don't you have, like, another
year left on your thing?

777
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:47,406
I'm just exploring my options, you know?
I can't stay in the Air Force forever.

778
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,914
I know, but... Hey...

779
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,811
- is she always like this?
- Don't.

780
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,782
You're a little tense. I think
you and I should take a spin.

781
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,148
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Come on.

782
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,813
Want me to embarrass you
in front of your boyfriend...

783
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,982
- by telling more horror stories?
- Stop it.

784
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,991
Did you hear about the time
she almost set the garage on fire?

785
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,323
- Eric.
- She used to like this guy named Rafe...

786
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,160
- Okay, that's it.
- Wait. I wanna hear more about Rafe.

787
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,930
- I said okay.
- Biker dude who wore leather pants.

788
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,272
She really loves you.

789
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,339
- You think so?
- Yeah.

790
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,346
You're so comfortable
together, you know?

791
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,246
Intimate...

792
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,711
without, you know,
needing to show off.

793
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,218
Abby says that you guys have
known each other for a couple weeks?

794
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,027
Yeah.

795
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,727
Love this song.

796
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,465
Don't you love this song?

797
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,800
Do you wanna dance?

798
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,970
Come on. Let's dance. Come on.

799
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,907
- Hi.
- Hey.

800
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:40,088
Uh, I hear the organ service
got Alison on the UNOS list.

801
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,523
Yes, I know. Status two.

802
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,593
It's a nice feeling.

803
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,266
What?

804
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:51,198
When you realize you've
affected someone's life.

805
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,668
Touched them in some way.

806
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,540
You think she'll
last long enough?

807
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,802
One can only hope.

808
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,411
You on your meds?

809
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,346
Uh, got a little off schedule.

810
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:18,828
You can't get up, can you?

811
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:22,331
I'll catch the next one.

812
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,760
- I can wait if you...
- No, no. It's all right.

813
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,633
It'll kick in.

814
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,432
No, it's a nice night.

815
