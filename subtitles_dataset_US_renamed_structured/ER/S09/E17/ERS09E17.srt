1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,235
No! That is not the point!

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,501
You might save 2.4 up front...

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,840
but you're gonna lose 20,000
primary care visits a year...

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,745
- Thank you, Dr. Weaver.
- For a potential loss of over $10 million.

5
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:20,547
- We have to make tough choices.
- Tough, yes. Shortsighted, no.

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,950
Is there a motion to vote?

7
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,115
- Excuse me. I'm not finished.
- I think we understand the issue.

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,926
- Lack of primary care leaves thousands...
- And your argument.

9
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,793
These are human
beings, not statistics.

10
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,525
And we are abandoning
an entire community...

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,863
We get it. Thank you.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,235
Now is there a motion
to vote in open session?

13
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,706
- Mr. Chairman...
- Motion.

14
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,372
Second.

15
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,777
All right. All those in favor of
closing the Erie Street Clinic.

16
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,381
Those opposed to the closing.

17
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,218
The nays have it.
Fifteen-minute recess.

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,228
<i>Nice work, Kerry.</i>

19
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,095
- Is it always this close?
- You have the gift of persuasion.

20
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,997
Well, pugnacity is more like it.

21
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,400
And an understanding
of what motivates people.

22
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,770
- That's the secret to a good politician.
- I'm out of my league there.

23
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,743
Nonsense. It wouldn't surprise me if
you were Surgeon General someday.

24
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,608
Kristy.

25
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:25,313
Meet the future Surgeon General
and savior of the Erie Street Clinic.

26
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,817
- Hello, doctor.
- He's kidding.

27
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,149
- He never kids.
- Kerry, you have another minute?

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,990
Sure.

29
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,590
Parks and Recs has
been pushed to 11.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,423
And Bamberger called about
the gay-marriage amendment.

31
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,826
Tell him I'm sympathetic...

32
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,832
but it will never pass, and
I'm not gonna torpedo the bill.

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,263
Maybe we should
get you on that one.

34
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,373
Might actually stand a chance.

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,636
What do you mean?

36
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,938
You're a problem-solver,
Kerry. A pragmatist.

37
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,942
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate that.

38
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,951
Thank you.

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,714
That's why I hate to implore
you for another personal favor.

40
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,550
But, well...

41
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,455
I frankly don't know
what else to do.

42
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:12,225
You were very considerate in
treating my off-the-record condition.

43
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,300
Did the lesion not heal?

44
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,630
No, it did.

45
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,137
But I'm in a relationship with
someone, someone that works for me.

46
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,372
I'm single. We're in love.

47
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,739
But workplace affairs are...

48
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,814
Well, I don't
need the attention.

49
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,742
And she's symptomatic.

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,649
I was hoping you could provide treatment
with the same level of discretion.

51
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,655
Send her to any free clinic.
They're all confidential.

52
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,816
It's a simple shot
of penicillin, right?

53
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,225
Treatment without generating
a medical record is malpractice.

54
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,491
But you've done it before.

55
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,065
And I shouldn't have.

56
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,730
Okay. Okay. I
think I understand.

57
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,008
I'm sorry. I mean, you
know, I could lose my license.

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,048
Don't be sorry. You're
a woman of principle.

59
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,277
How can I not respect
that? Forget I asked.

60
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,183
And congratulations again.

61
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,848
- You did some real good today, Kerry.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,290
Of course, there are no guarantees
for next year's budget at your hospital.

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,129
What?

64
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,794
There's an afternoon vote on
eliminating emergency services.

65
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,606
At County General?

66
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,575
You mean closing the ER?

67
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,541
I need you, Kerry.

68
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,003
Is your jalopy
still in the shop?

69
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,699
- It's a Jeep.
- Oh, a Jeep.

70
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,901
Jalopy.

71
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:45,475
- You hardly touched your breakfast.
- I don't like to eat much before a shift.

72
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,618
All that blood and
guts, you know?

73
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,848
Don't remind me.

74
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,124
I had a feeling there was
some agenda this morning...

75
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,230
but you've been very mysterious.

76
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,628
I just wanted to check
in, see how you were.

77
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:07,834
And I wanted to give this
back to you for the time being.

78
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,677
- She said no?
- I didn't ask.

79
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,973
- Did something happen?
- No. It just felt kind of rushed.

80
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,810
- What did she do?
- Nothing.

81
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,315
Doesn't even know.

82
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,351
I don't think she knows.

83
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,453
Maybe she knows. I don't know.

84
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,182
- I'm sorry, John.
- I thought you'd be relieved.

85
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,724
That you're unhappy?

86
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,830
I got the impression that
you never really cared for her.

87
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:39,670
I've spent so many years trying to
get you to do what I think is best for you.

88
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,544
You're past having me
badger you about your choices.

89
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,708
This is yours.

90
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:53,047
Give it, or don't, to
whomever you choose.

91
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,615
- Why?
- Well, I'm thinking emergency medicine.

92
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,190
Here? FRANK: Better than Iraq.

93
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,587
Hey, that is not it.

94
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,193
Don't you still owe four years?

95
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,347
I can roll the time
to after my residency.

96
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:04,695
Afraid to fight, all right.

97
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,734
- Hey, any time, any place, old man.
- I can smell fear a mile away.

98
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,131
Answer the phone, Frank.

99
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,796
The holiday's called "St. Patrick's
Day," not "St. Patrick's Week."

100
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,635
You got something
against the Irish?

101
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:19,143
The giant shamrock in Triage
started drinking 72 hours ago.

102
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,577
- Excuse me. I'm looking for Dr. Weaver.
- Frank.

103
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,308
She'll be back in a few
minutes. Have a seat over there.

104
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,009
They always ask me. Do I
look like customer service?

105
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,053
- He's cute.
- He's a zygote.

106
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,953
- Any more blind dates?
- Never again.

107
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,424
But we're going to
Las Vegas tonight.

108
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,290
- Who's we?
- Me and Chen.

109
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,729
And 50 other County employees.
So how's it going with you?

110
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,597
I have a rule-out MI waiting
on his second troponin.

111
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,397
Uh, no, I meant in general.

112
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,473
- Any, uh, news?
- No.

113
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,109
- Did you need that?
- Um...

114
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,438
Oh, I thought it was
a different patient.

115
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,070
- So how are you and Carter?
- Good, I guess.

116
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,945
Kind of. He's been
acting a little weird.

117
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,916
It's been rough for
both of you lately.

118
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,850
I think we're getting
back to normal.

119
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,819
Dr. Lewis, he's seizing again.

120
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,119
Another four of lorazepam,
and load a gram of Dilantin.

121
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,092
Abby, clear a CT on this one.

122
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,356
- Blown pupil?
- Subconj hemorrhage.

123
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,931
- No ID?
- Too young for a license. No purse.

124
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,020
- This the assault?
- LOC in Union Station.

125
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,104
- Probably a street kid.
- With those boots?

126
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,431
Expensive jacket too.
- Maybe she shoplifts.

127
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,940
- She come in with that
girl? EMT: No. Different run.

128
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,169
Chest is clear. Belly's soft.
- Dr. Kovac?

129
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,644
- Isolated head and facial trauma.
- What happened?

130
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,976
- Let's get a C-spine, chest and pelvis.
- Dr. Kovac?

131
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,209
You got this?

132
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,944
Yeah. Trauma panel,
urine ICON, dip a UA.

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,454
- Sorry. I forgot.
- Three times. Three missed appointments.

134
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,058
Yeah. I have a bad memory.

135
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,491
Your department required
psychotherapy. I don't wanna be a heavy.

136
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,631
- I wanna help.
- Prepare for disappointment.

137
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,735
I have extended hours tonight. I'm
free from 7 to 8. Can you make that?

138
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,965
- I really don't see the point.
- You don't have to see it. Just show up.

139
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,637
<i>Just show up. That's all
I've been doing. Showing up.</i>

140
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,145
<i>Time goes by faster at work.</i>

141
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,509
<i>Shift work.</i>

142
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,982
<i>Treat and street
a few lost souls.</i>

143
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,321
<i>You're with them when
they are most vulnerable.</i>

144
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,491
- Is that bile?
- That's 17 Jell-O shots.

145
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,392
<i>When they're
naked, weak, hurt...</i>

146
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,396
<i>you touch them...</i>

147
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,063
<i>look at their bodies...</i>

148
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,171
<i>see them more closely than
their families, their lovers.</i>

149
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:29,168
But it's mechanical,
you know, temporary.

150
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,369
You fix them up, or
you watch them die.

151
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:36,744
Either way, it ends,
and you move on.

152
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,885
No next time, no strings.

153
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,386
No real connection.

154
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,753
<i>Maybe that's why I stay.</i>

155
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,758
- You waiting on an incoming?
- What?

156
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,960
- Did you sign out for an incoming?
- Coffee.

157
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,536
Cigarette break?

158
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,700
You want some?

159
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,476
- What?
- Coffee?

160
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,441
No, thanks.

161
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,050
- Not turning into a health nut on me.
- No.

162
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,676
Waiting for an old lady
that fell off her treadmill.

163
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,780
Okay.

164
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,589
Do you remember what happened?

165
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,232
Can I call your parents?

166
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,729
Um, I don't live at home.

167
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,840
Where do you live?

168
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,744
Molly, I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

169
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:48,577
They call it a boot camp for kids
who can't get along with their parents.

170
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,156
So they discipline you?

171
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,723
Does this look like discipline?

172
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,923
A camp counselor
did this to you?

173
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,628
Yeah. I heard they raped a girl.

174
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,196
Okay.

175
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:05,429
Haleh, perhaps Molly should
be speaking with a police officer.

176
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,475
I'm sure your mother would
like to know that you're safe.

177
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,943
Who do you think sent
me there in the first place?

178
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,945
- Any family?
- She said she has a husband, Charles.

179
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,553
- What else did I say about him?
- That he's useless.

180
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,312
Exactly. Forget him.

181
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,789
It's a stolen card. How am I supposed
to know her mother's maiden name?

182
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,054
Why are you boarding four ICU
players and eight med-surg admissions?

183
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,560
Susan's driving. Talk to her.

184
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,994
Dr. Weaver? Keith Mitchell.
I have an appointment.

185
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,864
We don't make appointments in the ER.
Report your complaint to the Triage nurse.

186
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,006
I believe special arrangements
were made by Alderman Bright?

187
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,978
Jonathan has nothing but
wonderful things to say about you.

188
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,143
How long have you
been in his office?

189
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,812
I started junior year, spring
quarter, so about two years.

190
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,653
Now I get grad-school
credit and on-the-job training.

191
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,160
He's a great mentor. Very
generous with his time.

192
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,823
Oh, uh, this goes
in the buttocks.

193
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,896
I'm surprised that you
waited so long to be treated.

194
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,938
I didn't notice the
sore. Jonathan did.

195
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,343
- When?
- Two nights ago.

196
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,505
I was so embarrassed. I just
hoped I didn't give it to him.

197
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,447
- He didn't have it?
- Uh, no.

198
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,678
I was pretty crazy
in my college days.

199
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,949
We're monogamous now. I have
to say, he was really cool about it.

200
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,719
Most people wouldn't
be so understanding.

201
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,123
All done.

202
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,533
We all have our past, right?

203
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,028
I told you not to
work out so much.

204
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,198
So I can sit and watch
the soaps all day?

205
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,899
Any other symptoms,
Mrs. Sanbery?

206
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,545
Yes. My hair's falling out.
But I blame that on him.

207
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,408
- She's just kidding.
- The hell I am!

208
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,551
- Did you check the fingernails?
- Yeah. I'm getting to that.

209
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,084
- What?
- These marks, these lines.

210
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,881
- What marks?
- These are Mees' lines.

211
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,219
- What kind of work did you do?
- Supervisor at a wood-processing plant.

212
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,437
Did they use arsenic?

213
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:08,555
Tested us for it all
the time. Can't be it.

214
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,256
Okay. Let's get Mrs. Sanbery's
blood and urine reports from OSHA.

215
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,663
- I will be right back.
- Take him with you.

216
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,063
Ruthie, just relax, please.

217
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,666
Wonders of marital bliss.

218
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,569
Who's worse? Her for being such
a pain, or him for being so pathetic.

219
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,074
It cuts both ways, I guess.

220
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,611
My bike-girl trauma may
have a diminished foot pulse.

221
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,975
Check Doppler. I'll
be there in a minute.

222
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,242
Um, Mrs. Banks.

223
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,181
- Yes?
- I'm Dr. Corday.

224
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,150
I'm the surgeon
treating your daughter.

225
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,187
- She'll need surgery?
- No, no.

226
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,092
I'm surprised the camp
actually called you.

227
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,392
Why wouldn't they?

228
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,493
Well, they assaulted
your daughter.

229
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,262
Is that what she told you?

230
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,671
She ran off on the second day.

231
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:55,104
- They didn't touch her.
- Somebody did.

232
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,177
With Molly there's all
kinds of explanations.

233
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,005
What makes you
certain it's not the camp?

234
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,445
Because she says it is.

235
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,279
Trashing my house
with a baseball bat.

236
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:11,117
Shoplifting, drinking, drug
use, unwanted pregnancy.

237
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,290
Do I need to go on?

238
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,228
I need to call my office.

239
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,128
Maybe you can talk to
her when you're finished.

240
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,964
I haven't been able to
talk to her in three years.

241
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,004
They actually threw
you across the room?

242
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,841
In a bar fight, not a
tossing. Big difference.

243
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,013
Congratulations, Kerry.

244
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,982
Whatever you're doing down
at City Hall seems to be working.

245
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,249
- Well, it was a close vote.
- But without a single cut.

246
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,585
- What?
- The hospital budget.

247
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,026
We were vulnerable to a 20-percent cut,
it sailed through less than an hour ago.

248
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,723
They say he drove
out the snakes.

249
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,528
Who? MAN: St. Patrick.

250
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:59,571
Well, I'd like to see you
and Robert in my office at 5.

251
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,664
Is there a problem?

252
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:02,675
Just a little administrative
housekeeping.

253
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,970
We should burn
through it quickly.

254
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,340
Dr. Weaver, Dr. Lewis needs you.

255
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,348
- What kid?
- That kid.

256
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,886
He was looking for you, waiting in
Chairs. Paramedic brought him in.

257
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,753
125 of Solu-Medrol, 50 of
Benadryl. Stand by with an epi drip.

258
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,259
- Hey, Kerry. Do you know this kid?
- What happened?

259
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,862
Passed out across the street.

260
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,124
Tight wheezes and hives.
Barely any breath sounds.

261
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,394
You don't happen to know if he
has any food allergies, do you?

262
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,534
- No, I don't.
- He was looking for you.

263
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,571
Sats are dropping,
93. Pulse, 120.

264
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,981
Cords are too edematous.

265
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,543
- 20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
- Prep a crike tray.

266
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,543
Fiber-optic with a 7-0 tube.

267
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,375
- Okay, one more look.
- Wasting time.

268
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,416
- You need to let the drugs work.
- He needs intubation.

269
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,054
- You do know him?
- He could be allergic to anything...

270
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,382
an insect bite, or
have a carcinoid.

271
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,422
He's got an ID from City Hall.

272
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,029
Okay, do a jaw thrust and keep
a good seal when you bag him.

273
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,325
You know, I did get some papers from
Health and Human Services this morning.

274
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,560
Maybe he dropped them off.

275
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,729
Okay, suction and light
source on high. Let's go.

276
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,509
This is an emergency.

277
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:17,241
You tell him that one of his staffers is
in the ER with a severe allergic reaction.

278
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,717
Tell him to call me
as soon as he can.

279
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,154
You were right. He
does work at City Hall.

280
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,453
- Mm. Alderman Bright's office?
- Yeah. How did you know?

281
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:32,861
Well, there's no insect bite, but
there's a chancre on his penis.

282
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,297
- Kerry?
- That's a bit of a leap, don't you think?

283
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,733
The alderman left here
with untreated syphilis.

284
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:41,272
- We don't know that it was untreated.
- Now one of his staffers comes in...

285
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,740
We don't know if the alderman...

286
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,539
is in the habit of sexual
harassment, much less gay.

287
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:50,046
The kid is in anaphylactic shock.
Either it's a food allergy or a drug.

288
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,150
- My guess is penicillin.
- Not necessarily.

289
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,844
It could be idiopathic
histamine release or vasculitis.

290
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,182
He's triggering the vent.

291
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,221
- Any spontaneous eye opening?
- Not yet.

292
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,293
Call Immunology for skin testing.
Have them include penicillin.

293
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,657
Get me as soon as he wakes up.

294
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,632
- What's his Fl-O2?
- Fifty percent.

295
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,051
Sounds like
upper-airway secretions.

296
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,346
I think he's just
a little wheezy.

297
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,284
Why don't you get
a suction catheter.

298
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,583
He may have a mucous
plug we need to clear out.

299
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:36,488
- He's satting at 98 percent...
- I wanna optimize his oxygenation. Get it.

300
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,159
Keith?

301
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,102
Keith?

302
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,810
Can you hear me?

303
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,576
Keith?

304
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:04,823
Keith, there's a tube in your
throat to help you breathe.

305
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:09,452
You had a severe allergic
reaction, probably to the penicillin.

306
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,929
But everything is
okay now, all right?

307
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,468
We'll take out the tube soon.

308
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,628
You'll be able to speak.

309
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,468
And the other doctors will
have some questions for you.

310
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,806
They've examined you. So
they know you have syphilis.

311
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,972
And they'll be able to
determine an allergy to penicillin.

312
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,145
But Jonathan cannot
have sent you here...

313
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,286
to me.

314
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,858
You know what that means.

315
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,854
We have to protect him.

316
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,894
We can't give anyone
reason to speculate...

317
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:54,735
or they might even target Jonathan
as the source of the infection.

318
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,076
Listen carefully, Keith.

319
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:03,841
People have been known to
borrow prescriptions from friends...

320
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,748
without ever seeing a doctor.

321
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,583
They think they know what
they have and how to treat it...

322
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,658
so they take care
of it on their own.

323
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,452
Do you understand?

324
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,759
Good.

325
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:28,969
Dr. Carter, dealership called. You
need brake pads. It'll be ready at 5.

326
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,407
- Can you get rabies from fish?
- No.

327
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,207
- You're sure?
- I'm pretty sure.

328
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,851
What do you make of this? Pike bit
me when I was getting it off the line.

329
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,816
Looks infected.

330
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,786
That's it?

331
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,186
Call me if you
start growing gills.

332
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,226
Doctor, OSHA results.

333
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,693
The arsenic levels in Mrs. Sanbery's
urine for the past three years...

334
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,197
have been undetectable.

335
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,060
- And today's results?
- Over 200 mics per liter.

336
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,436
Maybe she got down
about being home.

337
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,877
- Suicide attempt?
- I don't know.

338
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,877
Happens to some retirees.

339
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,209
Either that or her
husband's trying to kill her.

340
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:14,081
Well, find out if she's been
depressed. Take it from there.

341
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,482
- What's that?
- What?

342
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,214
On your back.

343
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,562
It's the patch.

344
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,197
For birth control?

345
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,529
No, for smoking.

346
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,102
- You quit smoking?
- Four days ago, yes. Thanks for noticing.

347
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,738
Thanks for sharing.

348
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,704
Last week, I had to bring a
throat-cancer patient outside...

349
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,435
so she could smoke
through her trach hole.

350
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:42,275
- And I decided this has gotta stop.
- Really?

351
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,784
There's some bronchospasm.

352
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,353
Add a unit dose of Atrovent to his
next treatment. I think he's waking up.

353
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,924
- Should I call Lewis?
- He's her patient.

354
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,358
- Get her out! Get her out of here!
- Lie back! You'll hurt yourself.

355
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,055
I don't wanna see her! I told
you not to call her! Get out!

356
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,791
- You need to talk to her.
- About locking me up again?

357
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,061
- About getting me raped?
- How about Haldol?

358
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,569
She never listens to me!
She doesn't care about me!

359
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,935
You said we were going
camping, you lying slut!

360
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,907
- Okay. Two of Ativan.
- Make it four. I could use a good buzz!

361
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,512
Now, you listen to me!

362
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,376
- I want you to settle down right now!
- Get her out of here.

363
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,145
I'll ask your mother to
leave if you stop struggling.

364
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,811
I put you in that program
because I care about you.

365
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,787
- Liar!
- Okay. Okay, hard restraints!

366
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,153
Oh, God... MOLLY: Liar!

367
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,626
- Where's the Ativan?
- Liar! Liar!

368
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,322
From the time she was 2,
she's been acting like this.

369
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,160
I thought she would get over it.

370
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,735
Okay. Come in here.

371
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,532
- And keep pressure on that.
- I know.

372
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,608
They shocked
four times for V-fib.

373
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,068
Hold compressions.

374
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,111
Asystole. Hate crime.

375
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,315
Forget it. Gray matter
and brainstem failure.

376
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:55,421
- Call it. KOVAC:
Time of death: 1343.

377
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,115
Some jerk shot him because
he wouldn't get off the bus.

378
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,283
Said it was only for Americans.

379
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,929
Morales is en route
with the shooter.

380
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,129
Okay, Keith, we have a breathing
treatment for you to work on.

381
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,998
Okay. Here you go.

382
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,333
Deep breaths in and out.

383
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,336
Pulse ox: 99.

384
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,509
Good.

385
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,114
You had an allergic
reaction to something.

386
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,945
Is there anything you've eaten
that you know you're allergic to?

387
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,577
- Any new medications?
- Penicillin.

388
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,849
Why are you taking penicillin?

389
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,743
Syphilis. My ex-girlfriend
told me she had

390
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:37,891
an outbreak and I'd
better take care of it.

391
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,191
- Did you know you're allergic to it?
- No.

392
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,335
Did the doctor who
gave it to you ask?

393
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,601
I didn't see the doctor. My
ex told me they gave it to her.

394
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,737
I had a friend who had some
leftover from a strep throat.

395
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,355
We're still waiting for
a Russian translator.

396
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:11,258
When they cry, the eardrum turns
red, and you can't rule out an infection.

397
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,923
Kovac, Eye Trauma Girl's losing visual
acuity. She may need decompression.

398
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,830
I'll be right there.

399
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:27,445
Dr. Kovac, I was wondering if you'd write
a letter of recommendation for my file.

400
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,444
I can't do that.

401
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,877
- What?
- Sorry.

402
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,178
Did you give him the
message? Luka, wait.

403
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,581
Corday needs some help.

404
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,053
Hold on. Tell him that I really
need to talk to him. It's important.

405
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,784
Well, you have him call me back.

406
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,895
- You're blowing off your therapy?
- No.

407
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,156
- We had an agreement.
- I never agreed to it.

408
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,061
Well, you came
back here, didn't you?

409
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,793
I told you it was
mandatory, didn't I?

410
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,734
- Excuse me. Luka, I...
- Hey, I don't need to see a shrink.

411
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,474
- What's wrong?
- His BP's down to 80.

412
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,236
- Might have vagalled with the ABG.
- My stomach...

413
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,540
Get his head down and
squeeze in two liters.

414
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,115
Belly's rigid.

415
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,479
Where's his last chest film?
- Why does it hurt?

416
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,586
Tachy at 120.

417
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,586
Oh, God. Free air
under the diaphragm.

418
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,985
What does that mean?

419
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,888
You have a perforation in
your stomach or intestine.

420
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,963
- From the penicillin?
- No. Hang a 100 gent, 500 of Flagyl.

421
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,191
- Pressure's down to
60. WEAVER: Keith?

422
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,233
Keith? How you doing? Keith!

423
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,598
How hard were you bagging him?

424
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,206
The cords were swollen shut.

425
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,343
Don't hyperventilate.

426
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,842
- Kerry, don't blame this on her.
- Get Corday in here.

427
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:36,847
Twenty of famotidine, IV piggyback.
Small perforations can heal spontaneously.

428
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,951
Now, Abby.

429
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:43,747
O-2, 15 liters by mask. Set up for
a central line. Get some Betadine.

430
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,290
I can't see. Why can't I see?
- Hold still.

431
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,450
Dr. Corday, Dr. Weaver
needs a consult.

432
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,960
Retrobulbar hematoma,
compressing the optic nerve.

433
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,361
Am I going blind? Please
tell me what's wrong.

434
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,297
Blood's collecting behind
your eye. We'll have to drain it.

435
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,697
- How?
- A tiny incision.

436
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,429
- Dr. Corday?
- Give me a minute.

437
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,006
- You're gonna cut my eye?
- Just the skin at the side.

438
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,473
No, please. I don't
want you guys to do this.

439
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,373
If we wait, we risk blindness.

440
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,014
Please don't. I really don't
want you to cut my eye.

441
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,877
- Molly, we have no choice.
- Mom? Mom?

442
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,485
- One percent with epi.
- I'm here.

443
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,053
<i>They believe what you tell them.</i>

444
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:21,019
<i>They have to trust you. You're
the doctor. You know best.</i>

445
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,684
<i>But I don't.</i>

446
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,955
<i>I guess.</i>

447
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,161
And lie.

448
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,304
Say the same things to different
people over and over again...

449
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,408
until I can hardly make the words
come out of my mouth anymore.

450
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,909
It's really hard not
to be disgusted.

451
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:47,182
With yourself, with the
system, everyone you work with.

452
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:53,352
<i>Even with the people
you are supposed to help.</i>

453
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,925
Hold on.

454
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,360
Dr. Corday, we
have a gastric rupture.

455
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,590
- Can you suture?
- Yeah. I got it.

456
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,859
How many fingers? MOLLY: Two.

457
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,164
- Infuser's primed.
- I'm in. Hook me up.

458
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,330
He has a history of
peptic ulcer disease?

459
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,499
Over-inflation from
bag-mask ventilation.

460
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:14,078
- Could've had an underlying lesion.
- Fluid's in. Pressure's not coming up.

461
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,114
Dopamine at 10 mics. Tell the
O.R. Why was he being bagged?

462
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,614
Anaphylaxis.

463
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:23,312
- Gram of cefoxitin. Cover anaerobes.
- No. He's allergic to penicillin.

464
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,448
Any family? LEWIS: Not
that I could see. Kerry?

465
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,526
Sinus tach on monitor. - Kerry?

466
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,356
- What?
- Any family?

467
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,260
- I don't know. Ask Frank.
- He's had steroids?

468
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,698
So how long am I in the hospital?
- A few days.

469
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,934
You can go home as long
as there's no rebleeding.

470
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,444
Home. Yeah, right. My
mom would rather I go blind.

471
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,482
She was just here
holding your hand.

472
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,711
Yeah, holding my hand for
10 minutes doesn't fix 10 years.

473
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,185
Ten years of what?

474
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,552
Of hating me.

475
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,457
- She hates me.
- That's not what I saw.

476
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,464
Whatever. I hate her too.

477
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:11,934
What I saw was a scared
little girl crying for her mother.

478
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,572
And her mother came.

479
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,306
She'd never let me come home.

480
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,513
- Ask her.
- I can't.

481
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,172
Getting beat up on
the street is better?

482
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,481
Would you?

483
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,249
What?

484
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,088
Ask her?

485
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,455
- The field's dry. He's septic.
- Dopamine's up to 20 mics.

486
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,590
How much blood loss?
- Insignificant.

487
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,158
What's the last crit?
- Thirty-six.

488
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,067
Run of six. 100 of lidocaine,
starting a drip at two per minute.

489
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:52,234
He needs crystalloid. Squeeze in
two units of saline and hang Levophed.

490
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:56,405
V-tach! CORDAY:
Crash cart! Charge to 200.

491
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,576
No pulse. Start compressions.
- Amp of epi.

492
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,780
We're charged. - Clear.

493
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,481
Clear.

494
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,119
No change. Charge to 300.

495
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,025
Epi's on board.

496
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,597
Charged again. CORDAY: Clear.

497
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,290
Clear.

498
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,064
V-fib.

499
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:21,105
Damn it. Three-sixty. He's
a kid. He should respond.

500
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:27,110
Vasopressin, 40 units
IV. Mix up a Pronestyl drip.

501
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,247
He was probably
gonna blow up the bus.

502
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,887
Blood in the belly.
He's tachy at 120.

503
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,784
Damn terrorists
everywhere you look.

504
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,084
He was Sikh. They're
committed to nonviolence.

505
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,921
Why's he wearing
a towel on his head?

506
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,586
Maybe he got out of the
shower, where you should be.

507
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,393
Blunt trauma. Still hypotensive
after a chest tube and two units.

508
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:52,561
- Looks like an intra-abdominal bleed.
- Probable splenic lac with fractured ribs.

509
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,536
Fluid in Morrison's.
Call the O.R.

510
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,676
- Pressure's down, 50 systolic.
- Let's put him in Trendelenburg.

511
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:02,008
100 percent 0-2 by mask. And
squeeze in two units of 0-neg.

512
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,774
Let's go. I'll take
him up myself.

513
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,777
- Dr. Romano.
- Grab the drug box.

514
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,544
Dr. Romano, your arm.

515
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,647
Damn it!

516
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,461
I'm fine. Let's just...
Let's go. Let's roll.

517
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,499
It's all my own fault. I
should've never married him.

518
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:26,002
You get one shot, maybe,
at being truly happy.

519
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:30,336
I had it with Henry Booth
when I was 20, and I blew it.

520
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,970
Okay. Well, I'm gonna come up and
check on you after your chelation therapy.

521
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,017
- Till death do they part, huh?
- Maybe they deserve each other.

522
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,950
- Do you wanna get dinner tonight?
- Uh, I can't. Not tonight.

523
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,386
- Abby, I need to pee.
- I'll be right there, Pablo.

524
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,958
- I don't think I can hold it that long.
- I'm coming!

525
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,619
- I was hoping that we could get together.
- I can't. I have a thing.

526
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,390
What thing?

527
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,299
I'm meeting someone.

528
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:59,131
- Who?
- My AA sponsor.

529
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,398
When did this happen?

530
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,304
I just decided maybe
it was time to say hello.

531
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,105
Hey, Gallant,
where's Mrs. Banks?

532
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,908
- Who?
- You took care of her facial lac.

533
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,641
- She's not in sutures?
- Nope.

534
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,917
Listen, I'm thinking of applying for
the match in emergency medicine.

535
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,647
Bad idea.

536
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,752
The letter wasn't
for my rotation.

537
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,589
- It was for my residency application.
- I know.

538
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,260
What? What?

539
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,923
He bit the balloon!

540
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,214
- You think he aspirated?
- He looks cyanotic.

541
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,636
Bag him and get a pulse ox.

542
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,438
Foreign body.

543
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,412
- Tough to ventilate.
- It's blocking his airway.

544
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,915
- Pedes intubation tray and a McGill.
- Pulse ox is 81.

545
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,783
<i>I'm good at what I do.</i>

546
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,152
<i>I have certain skills,
certain abilities.</i>

547
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,026
<i>They came naturally to me.</i>

548
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,924
- Perfect fit.
- Can you see anything?

549
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,758
It's not about seeing.

550
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:04,027
<i>Others would struggle to get
through the day, and I wanted more.</i>

551
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,431
I might have something.

552
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,198
<i>More urgency, more purpose.</i>

553
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,869
Sats are coming up.

554
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,918
<i>Medicine was
exciting, powerful...</i>

555
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,985
<i>alive.</i>

556
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,987
Today, we saved
a teenager's sight.

557
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,924
I saved a child's life.

558
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,792
I didn't feel it.

559
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,070
Didn't feel anything.

560
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,237
- Was he stopping at the ER?
- They said he was coming straight up.

561
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,846
- Sorry. I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
- For what?

562
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,950
I got tied up with a
parathyroidectomy. Is Robert here?

563
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:56,511
- Our 5:00.
- Right. Just, uh, give me a minute.

564
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,323
- What happened?
- Been trying to reach you.

565
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,290
- I was stuck at an EPA site.
- I've been calling and paging.

566
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,863
- Calm down.
- This is why we have records and notes.

567
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,660
This is why we take a history
before we administer drugs.

568
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,235
- Privately, please.
- You know that he died?

569
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:12,871
Keith died.

570
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,140
Went into anaphylactic
shock, and his airway closed.

571
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,539
Alderman, what brings you here?

572
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,043
Uh, I'm checking
on a staff member.

573
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,614
Congratulations on the budget.
First year they haven't tried to close us.

574
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,480
Dr. Weaver did an excellent
job of articulating your needs.

575
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,121
She's our own little articulator.
Where are you going?

576
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,553
- Don't we have this meeting?
- Give me a second.

577
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,454
- You okay?
- More trouble with the arm?

578
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,027
Uh, not worse than getting
it severed in the first place.

579
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,495
- I'm glad to hear it. Stay well.
- Yeah. You too.

580
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,800
His airway closed, but they
had to bag him anyway...

581
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,373
which caused his stomach
to over-inflate and tear.

582
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,770
In here.

583
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:55,073
But they intubated him anyway,
and that over-inflated his stomach.

584
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:04,017
Slow down. Slow down. I thought
he was getting a shot of penicillin.

585
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,317
He got one! That's what
caused the anaphylaxis!

586
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:10,724
- Things like this happen in medicine.
- My God! What did I do?

587
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:13,764
I didn't ask him if he was
allergic. We always ask.

588
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,195
We always have a chart.

589
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,700
The chart reminds us we're
treating the patient correctly.

590
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,395
Yes, you could've asked. It
wouldn't have prevented it.

591
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,599
I could've given him something
else, or better yet, nothing.

592
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:27,905
I told him it would be a shot of
penicillin even before I approached you.

593
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,913
He didn't tell me he was
allergic. He didn't know.

594
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,711
This would've happened
anyway, however he got treated.

595
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,755
They're waiting for you in the
conference. Anspaugh needs to scrub in.

596
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,854
Have them start without me.

597
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,219
All right.

598
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:48,231
There's already no record of
the shot. It's too late for that.

599
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,895
We can tell the truth.

600
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,571
- No one else knows?
- Not yet.

601
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,936
- Keith didn't say anything about me?
- For God's sake.

602
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,270
- Oh, my God. He's dead.
- I know. I know.

603
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,436
- He's dead.
- It hurts me more than you know.

604
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:05,050
That's crap. You let that poor kid
believe he gave you the syphilis.

605
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,550
Don't tell me I don't care!

606
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,551
I care.

607
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,385
I care.

608
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:19,088
But I do need to know
what people know.

609
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:22,428
Self-servingly, yes, I
have to protect myself.

610
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:26,333
But I also have to protect you and this
hospital and other county programs...

611
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:30,306
What about protecting your staff?
What about protecting your lover?

612
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,637
Kerry, this is not your fault.

613
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,745
You understand?

614
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,609
It's not your fault.

615
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,683
But if you confess to
something like it was...

616
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,184
people will treat
you like it was.

617
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,120
And then everybody loses.

618
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,395
Did he say anything about me?

619
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,694
Don't worry. He lied for you.

620
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,806
He loved you.

621
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,605
They're starting.

622
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,548
And I killed him trying
to hide that for you.

623
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,658
You won't wanna be
late for that meeting.

624
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,624
But I will need you later
for a press conference.

625
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,162
He was one of my staff.

626
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,532
Goodbye, Jonathan.

627
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,329
Congratulations, Kerry.

628
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,872
Hold on. I never let rehab
compromise my work schedule.

629
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,943
We both know administration
is not your strong suit.

630
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,808
- Should I come back later?
- No, Kerry. This involves you.

631
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,847
How long you been planning this?

632
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,680
I've asked Robert to consider sharing
the chief of staff position with you.

633
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,980
I'd rather cut off my good arm.

634
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,350
I'm sorry you feel that way. I
thought this solution served everyone.

635
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,457
Well, you were wrong.

636
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,665
It's a gift, Robert. I
suggest you take it.

637
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,958
Take it right up the ass.

638
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:09,531
Fine. Congratulations, Kerry.
You've just become chief of staff.

639
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:25,555
Good cap refill. No
disruption of the vasculature.

640
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:28,717
No. There wouldn't be
with a mechanism of injury.

641
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,658
What's next? I could cut
it while slicing a bagel...

642
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,322
and not realize it till I
pass out from blood loss.

643
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,901
- Robert.
- Maybe I could set the damn thing on fire.

644
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,237
You need to be patient.

645
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:45,036
Yes. So everyone
keeps telling me.

646
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:49,379
Although none of us actually believe
I'm even going to partially recover.

647
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:51,710
Do we?

648
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,081
You believe in the laws
of karma, Elizabeth?

649
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,919
Eastern philosophy, the influence
of past actions on your future life.

650
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,559
I know what it is.

651
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,091
So I can be a jerk. So what?

652
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,765
I've always been honest.

653
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,266
Brutally honest. Bruised
some egos, hurt some feelings.

654
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:18,774
Maybe provoked a few tears.

655
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:22,778
But honesty's a hell of a lot
more than most people can claim.

656
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:28,082
I don't deserve this.

657
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,717
Hey, what time's your thing?

658
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,562
Uh, she's probably
waiting for me right now.

659
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,663
Did you get your car fixed?

660
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,064
Yeah. One of these days,
I'm gonna get one that works.

661
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,902
So...

662
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,572
You know, right?

663
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,408
- Know what?
- That night at the restaurant.

664
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:01,051
I had a ring. You
knew that, right?

665
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,180
I figured if you wanted to
talk about it, you would've.

666
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,953
I didn't go through with it
because in that moment it just felt...

667
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:15,131
It didn't feel right.
And I don't know why.

668
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,768
And I wish I did know why.

669
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:20,963
I think the fact that I didn't do it means
that maybe something isn't working.

670
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,801
I get it.

671
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,445
It's okay.

672
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,480
I gotta go.

673
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,650
You get it?

674
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:39,352
That's good. Maybe you can
explain it to me because I don't get it.

675
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:42,858
I know I show up for work, and you
act like a completely changed person.

676
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,725
And I think that's great if that's
real. The patch, the sponsor...

677
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,367
- Real?
- For real, for you.

678
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,333
Or is this gonna get thrown out
next time something happens?

679
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,996
- If you're trying to prove something to...
- What?

680
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:58,507
- Like some kind of quick fix.
- I didn't do it for you!

681
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,503
I woke up sick of myself, okay?

682
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,049
And if you're sick of me and
just all of it, I don't blame you.

683
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,482
I'm not sick of you.
How do you hear that?

684
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,249
All I do is disappoint you. I feel
like all I'll ever do is disappoint you.

685
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,652
- I've said this before.
- Stop. Stop!

686
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,318
Stop with this
fatalistic, black-cloud...

687
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,691
nothing-good-is-ever-gonna-happen
routine.

688
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,026
- It's not a routine.
- Hey! What do I have to say?

689
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,836
What do I have to do
to get through to you?

690
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,758
- She needs a stable environment.
- She's the one that's unstable!

691
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,285
Yeah. I wonder why. - Luka.

692
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,361
- She's your daughter.
- I've got this now.

693
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,293
- Do you even give a damn?
- Thank you.

694
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,627
Does he think that
this is the first time...

695
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,498
I've ever had to make this
kind of decision with Molly?

696
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,503
I wish to God it
was, but it's not.

697
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,642
What if she wants to come home?

698
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,300
Now. She's scared. She got hurt.

699
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:16,471
But what happens when we get
there, and it starts all over again?

700
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,776
- You'll try harder.
- I have! A thousand times.

701
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:25,390
Maybe I am a bad mother,
but I can't do it anymore.

702
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:31,360
Enjoy her when she's this age.
She's not old enough to hate you.

703
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,007
I was, uh... I was
trying to calm the baby.

704
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,668
You know, with the
glove, the balloon.

705
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,904
Don't worry about it.

706
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,810
Yeah, but he could've died.

707
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,577
Yeah. But he didn't.

708
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,725
You're one of the best medical students
that's come through here in a long time.

709
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,029
The place will be
lucky to have you.

710
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,916
<i>A letter from me
wouldn't mean much.</i>

711
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,713
<i>They only tolerate me...</i>

712
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,378
<i>know I can burn through a shift.</i>

713
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,389
Tomorrow, I'll get
up and do it again.

714
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,430
Have you thought
about taking time off?

715
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,067
Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,863
Maybe moving home. I don't know.

717
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,841
There's a cartoon I
once saw in a magazine.

718
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,915
A little man is sitting in
a room with two doors.

719
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:01,541
One door says, "Do not enter."

720
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,553
And the other door
says, "Do not exit."

721
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:06,988
So, um...

722
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:10,623
he just sits there...

723
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,096
holding his hat.

724
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,796
We only have 15 minutes left.

725
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,772
Did you wanna keep talking?

726
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,612
Or do you wanna get to it?

727
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,594
One dispo, two admits,
and I am out of here.

728
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,597
Are you ready?

729
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,464
Yeah. But, uh, I
wasn't gonna change.

730
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,875
Hey, this way I go
straight to the casino.

731
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:56,904
You can sing backup
for Tony Orlando.

732
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,169
- Who?
- Never mind.

733
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,812
- I'll meet you outside.
- Okay, I'll get a cab.

734
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,006
Excuse me, miss. Can you tell
me how to get to the cafeteria?

735
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:08,415
- Uh, I'm sorry. I don't work here.
- Oh.

736
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:14,117
<i>All of us at City Hall are saddened
by the loss of Keith Mitchell.</i>

737
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:18,287
<i>He was a bright and
vibrant young man...</i>

738
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:21,863
<i>who had a promising
future in public service.</i>

739
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:25,435
<i>He devoted himself to bring
dignity and opportunity...</i>

740
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,334
<i>to the underserved
members of our community.</i>

741
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:32,307
<i>Even though his death was sudden,
unexpected and heartbreaking...</i>

742
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:36,505
<i>his spirit will live on through his
contributions to social programs...</i>

743
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:40,140
<i>and through the thousands
of lives he touched.</i>

744
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:43,018
<i>Our thoughts and prayers
go out to Keith's family...</i>

745
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:47,147
<i>to his many friends and
to all those affected...</i>

746
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:50,727
<i>by this unavoidable tragedy.</i>
