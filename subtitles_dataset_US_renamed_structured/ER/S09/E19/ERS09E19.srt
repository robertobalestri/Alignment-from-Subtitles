1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,575
Okay, okay, okay.

2
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,375
Okay, okay, okay.

3
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,097
Clear.

4
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,436
Got a rhythm. Sinus tach.

5
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,375
- Got a pulse.
- Trying for a pressure.

6
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:56,073
- Good breath sounds.
- Satting at 91.

7
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,117
Put him on 100
percent non-rebreather.

8
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,219
Pupils four millimeters
and reactive.

9
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,916
BP is 90 palp.

10
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,621
All right. He's
back, whoever he is.

11
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,740
Hey. ABBY: Hey.

12
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,182
- What's Kerry doing here?
- Romano damage control.

13
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,049
- Making a lab run?
- Ain't my lunch.

14
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,450
Thank you.

15
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,886
What you got there?

16
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,586
That is my NGO pack from
<i>L'alliance de Medicine Internationale.</i>

17
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,560
- I thought you said you weren't going.
- Yeah, I'm not.

18
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,256
Why did they send it to you?

19
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,493
They're hoping that I'm
gonna change my mind.

20
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,297
- My shots are good for a year.
- You didn't sign anything?

21
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:28,602
No. It's a volunteer
organization. They can't draft you.

22
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,439
- Luka is still going to the Congo.
- I know. He doesn't listen to me, either.

23
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,509
So with Weaver back down here,
does that mean that Romano is history?

24
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:40,882
He moved his office out of exam one.
Could be the urine smell burned his eyes.

25
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,024
She's probably working a couple
shifts for appearance's sake...

26
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,989
to keep people from killing him.

27
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,457
We tried that. ROMANO: Carter.

28
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:51,428
- They keep putting him back together.
- Dr. Carter, meet your new students.

29
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,627
- My students?
- Yeah. You're chief resident, aren't you?

30
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:55,894
Yes.

31
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,901
And this is still a
teaching hospital?

32
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,711
- Yes, but...
- Good, then start teaching.

33
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,174
Don't worry, he's a lot smarter than
he looks. He's been with us four years.

34
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,670
- Nine.
- Ah.

35
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,780
Well, hopefully you'll
be, uh, quicker studies.

36
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,040
Watch your backs.

37
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,344
You want this, Carter? George
Zito, complaining of 8/10 chest pain.

38
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,350
- That was 20 minutes ago. It's five.
- Relieved by nitro spray.

39
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,649
- Cigarette would've done the same thing.
- Had a heart attack before?

40
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,690
- You mean besides this one?
- Pulse 92.

41
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,829
BP's, uh, 155/100.

42
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,623
- All right, Trauma
1. JERRY: Carter.

43
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,959
Air rescue's bringing in
an MVA, 10 minutes out.

44
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,261
- Yeah, my dance card is full.
- I'll get Lewis.

45
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,304
So who can tell me the risk
factors for coronary artery disease?

46
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,164
Chopper's bringing a trauma in.

47
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,368
We're gonna need a
second line for lidocaine.

48
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,512
Is it unit 27? The helicopter?

49
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,875
- I don't know. Why?
- Chuck flies with the 27.

50
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,644
- Oh, right. Chuck.
- Yeah, I know. It's weird.

51
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,586
But there's something about
him. He makes me feel good.

52
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,349
Not that way.

53
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,360
Well, that way too.
You know what I mean.

54
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:00,593
Uh, his name's James Shaw.
He's on Mellaril, per Dr. Kazanjian.

55
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:05,205
Mellaril, anti-psychotic. James,
how many Mellaril did you take?

56
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,000
They're all gone. I
need some more.

57
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,370
If you take too many
pills, your heart can stop.

58
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,980
The pills scramble the signal.
It keeps them from finding me.

59
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,207
- Keeps who from finding you?
- They know my neural pattern.

60
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,181
No. Nobody's
gonna find you here.

61
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,547
They monitor the 40hz range.

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,881
- Abby.
- Yeah?

63
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,535
- Brother's on the phone.
- What?

64
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,420
Eric.

65
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,719
Uh, okay. I'll be right there.

66
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,679
You can tell because
it tastes like metal.

67
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:31,723
Your brother's okay?

68
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:36,268
- I haven't heard from him in two months.
- I must leave before they scan this place.

69
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,167
Listen to me. James,
they can't scan you in here.

70
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,400
Okay, because
Radiology is upstairs...

71
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,842
and the floors and the
walls are lined with lead.

72
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,581
Okay, my name's Abby.
I'm gonna help you.

73
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,021
- Okay.
- Okay.

74
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,953
Give him five more of Haldol.
Use restraints if you have to.

75
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,889
- Call his PMD, let him know he's here.
- Okay.

76
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,856
Can you watch him? I
have to take a phone call.

77
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,659
Mm-hm.

78
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,268
What line? JERRY: Hmm?

79
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:11,803
What line's my brother on?

80
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,908
Oh. He, uh, said he'd
call back in an hour.

81
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,771
Call back from where?

82
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,172
I don't know.

83
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,782
Well, did he sound in trouble?
Did he sound like he was all right?

84
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,576
He said he'd call
back in an hour.

85
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,448
Are you the only person here that
doesn't know about my crazy family?

86
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,647
- What?
- Just, can you please come find me...

87
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,622
when he calls back? Drag
me out of a stall if you have to.

88
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,454
Yeah, can I?

89
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,927
- Could you help me over here, please?
- One second.

90
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,725
Hey, Mom, it's me.

91
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,801
Uh, Eric called and I was
wondering if you'd heard from him.

92
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,994
Can you call me at work? Thanks.

93
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,969
I got a guy who came in
complaining of a severe sore throat.

94
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,609
- I wanna send off a culture and a CBC.
- Okay.

95
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,473
- This is Andrew.
- Hi, Andrew.

96
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,308
What is this guy
still doing here?

97
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,417
- I'm still working him up.
- Yeah, wrong. Hold this.

98
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,644
- Take these.
- I'm already seeing eight.

99
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,812
Now you're seeing 12. I'll give
you four more every 15 minutes.

100
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,481
So I suggest you start
turfing people, beginning here.

101
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,120
- He has low-grade fever and adenopathy.
- If I wanted a nurse's opinion...

102
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:14,632
Well, I don't know what I'd do, because,
quite frankly, it's never happened.

103
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,002
Say "Ah." ANDREW: Ah.

104
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,267
He's got no exudates. Write a scrip
for Erythro and get him out of this bed.

105
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,674
- He's in a lot of pain.
- That is why they call it a sore throat.

106
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,110
Viral pharyngitis will
go away on its own.

107
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,614
If it's viral, why would
you give him antibiotics?

108
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,344
You kept him here two hours.
Call it a consolation prize.

109
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,783
Hi. I'm Rocket Romano.

110
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,856
I'm head of the ER.
Uh, you look a little lost.

111
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,548
- Dr. Horvat.
- You're a doctor.

112
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,351
Surgeon. I'm
visiting from Croatia.

113
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,894
Aha, what a, uh, coincidence.
I'm also a visiting surgeon.

114
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,861
Can I buy you a cup
of coffee or something?

115
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,024
Hey, you been here long? - No.

116
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,501
- You two know each other?
- We went to the same medical school.

117
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,072
- No doubt. KOVAC: Uh,
Gordana is here to observe...

118
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,005
a correction of a heart
repair. Young boy from Croatia.

119
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,479
What a beautiful language.

120
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,312
Dr. Kovac, I don't wanna
keep you from your, uh, patients.

121
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,750
By the looks of the board,
you're running behind.

122
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,356
So it's a pleasure meeting you.

123
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,417
26-year-old passenger
in a rollover MVA.

124
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,577
Trauma 2. You wanna see
what American ER docs do?

125
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,849
- I guess so.
- He was initially awake with a GCS of 13.

126
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,687
He had a prolonged extraction
and we tubed him for LOC.

127
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,091
Susan, this is Gordana, a
surgeon from back home.

128
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,857
Hi. Did he talk before he
crashed? Headache, belly pain?

129
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,331
No. He was just cursing
me out till he crumped.

130
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,599
You want me to call a
social worker down on this?

131
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,936
She's not mother of the year, but
I don't sense she'd hurt the child.

132
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,203
Baby's sick and the mother's evasive.
Could be Münchausen by proxy.

133
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,711
- Let's get our tests back.
- Is this a spot check?

134
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,873
- Help me put this on.
- Still working shifts.

135
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,144
Wow, the perks down
here never stop, do they?

136
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,947
- What are you doing, Robert?
- Observation and evaluation.

137
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,113
Oh, you mean
belittling and bullying?

138
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,452
- Gloves too.
- You want both?

139
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,860
- Page Neurosurgery.
- I thought I could smell blood.

140
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,294
- No sats.
- It's the Marilyn Manson manicure.

141
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,933
Grab acetone and
get a good nail on him.

142
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,096
Crepitus around
sternum. Gonna be all day?

143
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,400
Till I secure the airway.

144
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,271
- I saw it go in.
- No offense. I check all paramedic tubes.

145
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,812
- Since you guys miss half the time.
- Quiet. I can't hear any breath sounds.

146
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,142
- Bag him.
- Pressure dropping, 70 systolic.

147
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,911
- Need a first crit. Tube's through cords.
- Told you.

148
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,315
We get a blood line on him?

149
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,978
- You wanna do it?
- No, thanks.

150
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,155
- Anyone page Corday?
- She's still next door.

151
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,816
- She need a personal invite?
- Triple lumen kit and...

152
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,588
Non-reproducible. First
it's here. Now it's here, here.

153
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,129
- Not my fault.
- There a problem?

154
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,096
Mrs. Reynolds had
a subjective fever.

155
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,634
Which magically resolved along with
her abdominal pain after passing gas.

156
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,001
You're gonna charge my insurance
50 grand to tell me I needed to fart?

157
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,802
Her belly is tender. There
could be a pulsatile mass.

158
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,842
- So admit her and work her up.
- Sorry.

159
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,274
Elizabeth.

160
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,642
Hey. Hey!

161
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,976
Don't you "hey" me. If you wanna
get a CT scan and reconsult me, fine.

162
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,020
Or send her home
and bring her back.

163
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,523
But I refuse to admit her just so
you can clear ER beds in 30 minutes.

164
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,662
Dr. Corday, can you
take a look at this patient?

165
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,191
Let me guess. Infectious
gangrene from a paper cut?

166
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,867
- Systolic.
- He's hypotensive.

167
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,503
His vasculature is collapsed.

168
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,832
Probably has an
intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

169
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,034
Tubed in the field for
LOC but had belly pain.

170
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,679
- Another liter up.
- Unh, it's clotted again.

171
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,748
What's your excuse for not taking
this one up? No exposed bowel?

172
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,043
Give it a rest. He's
got intraperitoneal fluid.

173
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,313
All bleeding eventually stops.
You can probably leave this one too.

174
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,548
O-silk and OpSite.
Hook up the infuser.

175
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,021
- It's not working. CORDAY:
We only have so many rooms.

176
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,188
- I'm gonna do a cut-down.
- He's slowing down. Pulse is 72.

177
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,925
- He'll need a box. Pull it together.
- Sats are 80.

178
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,161
Run in the blood and
get a post-line chest.

179
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,067
Enough Transylvanian
play-by-play.

180
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,936
Did you listen to his lungs?
- Yes.

181
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,702
Well, he's not moving much air.

182
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,175
Tension pneumo on the right.

183
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,871
Decreased on the right,
tracheal shift. Chest tube tray.

184
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,075
- Left lung's still up. It's not your line.
- The intubation.

185
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,779
- We don't know that.
- They should've heard it and needled it.

186
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,719
Betadine. Even if they did,
and I'm not saying they did...

187
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,417
you can't hear anything
in those choppers. Knife.

188
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,763
- Damn it. Watch what you're doing.
- I didn't drop it. You did.

189
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,429
Could you step outside,
please? Thank you.

190
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,366
She's just observing. - Yeah?

191
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,301
I have enough people
in here just observing.

192
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,601
If you think you can do it all
yourself, Susan, we can all step out.

193
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,768
- Might go faster.
- Might go a lot faster...

194
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,470
if he came properly intubated.

195
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,241
Glad to see your leadership
skills rubbing off here.

196
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,609
How do you say "bite
my big one" in Croatian?

197
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,414
He's bradying down,
if anybody's interested.

198
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,782
Take deep breaths for me.

199
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,995
- Is there any pain with that?
- No.

200
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,064
- Is that Blumberg's sign?
- No, Murphy's sign for cholelithiasis.

201
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,860
- Think he has diverticulitis?
- No.

202
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,161
- Pain's in the left lower quadrant.
- Too young.

203
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,964
- Kidney stone? CARTER:
Causes more pain.

204
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,368
- Ulcerative colitis?
- Gives you bloody diarrhea.

205
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,169
With the appy, do you worry
about intestinal obstruction?

206
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,472
- Maybe. But there's no vomiting.
- What about a femoral hernia?

207
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,979
No mass. Don't
you have a question?

208
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,411
We get a lunch break?

209
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,916
Are you going to do a rectal?
- Eventually.

210
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,611
- I've never done a rectal.
- Ultra-sounding the belly?

211
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,122
Okay. You and you are shortness
of breath. You and you, take vertigo.

212
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,227
And last but not
least, knee pain.

213
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,193
Watch each other doing H &
P, discuss with your partner...

214
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,124
- present back to me.
- Should we start...?

215
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,667
Ah-da, da, da, da.
No more questions.

216
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,240
- Thanks. They're giving me a headache.
- Me too.

217
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,501
Hey, Pratt. I got
something for you.

218
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,876
- I'm seeing too many patients already.
- Not a patient.

219
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,413
Gallant, I got
something for you too.

220
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,776
What's this?

221
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,941
- You forget what today is?
- What? Payday?

222
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,552
- Match day.
- Good luck, gentlemen.

223
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,885
- I thought you matched here already.
- I was just doing a one-year transitional.

224
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,226
I got County.

225
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,364
- Oh, man, I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, no, man. I asked for County.

226
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,123
- Why?
- Congratulations, Gallant.

227
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,961
Glad you're gonna be with us.

228
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,297
Talk to me. Talk
to me. Talk to me.

229
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,575
I got Northwestern,
baby. I'm going uptown.

230
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,644
- What's this?
- LOL with phlebitis in Exam Four.

231
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,549
- Know how many patients I'm juggling?
- Not enough if you have time to dance.

232
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,751
- How much on the right tube?
- Nearly 600 cc's.

233
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,086
BP's up to 92/66.

234
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,661
Let's hope his brain
survived the lack of perfusion.

235
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,559
- Where is Curtain 2?
- Just passed it.

236
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,290
- Nurse...?
- Could I ask a question?

237
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,764
In a minute.

238
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,628
- Did my brother call back?
- I thought he disappeared.

239
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,934
- Where's Jerry?
- On his break.

240
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,134
- ER. Hold, please.
- Is that him?

241
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,608
No.

242
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,275
Excuse me.

243
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,611
- Could you tell Dr. Kovac I'm leaving?
- He should be back in a minute.

244
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,684
We just sent that
trauma upstairs.

245
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,481
- And I'm Abby, by the way.
- Dr. Horvat.

246
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

247
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,588
You know Luka from Croatia?

248
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,518
We're old friends. We
went to school together.

249
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,757
He was what you call
a character back then.

250
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,957
- Luka?
- Oh, yes.

251
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,535
Always playing practical jokes on
the other students, on our professors.

252
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,330
Really?

253
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,541
You could always tell when
Luka was in the building...

254
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,941
because you'd hear him laughing. You
know that laugh of his. It's contagious.

255
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,106
He doesn't really
laugh much at work.

256
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,251
He seems like he's changed.

257
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,511
He's been through
a lot, I guess.

258
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:53,357
Still, I thought I'd find him married
to some American supermodel...

259
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,017
with three children and a dog.

260
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,330
His wife Danijela
would have wanted that.

261
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,395
Abby, page Psych again.
They gotta see this guy.

262
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,833
Okay. Excuse me.

263
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,872
- He's getting restless. Give him Haldol.
- Okay.

264
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,874
- Do I need to apologize to her?
- No. She seems pretty cool.

265
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,911
Then I'll apologize to you. Sorry.
Didn't mean to turn into a bitch...

266
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,914
- in that trauma room.
- Don't worry. I was unfocused.

267
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,745
- Did you talk to your brother?
- No.

268
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,716
Said he was gonna
call back but didn't.

269
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,584
Guys never call when
you want them to.

270
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,158
- Hey, did air rescue leave yet?
- What am I, air traffic control now?

271
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,557
- Use the helicopter check system.
- What's that?

272
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:33,188
Go up on the roof and check. If
the helicopter isn't there, they left.

273
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,699
- Taking anything for your cholesterol?
- No.

274
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,097
Good.

275
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:41,035
Call Myers in Psych and tell him I'm
sending a psychotic patient to him...

276
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,904
if he doesn't come down
here and assess this guy.

277
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,270
How you doing, James? - Oh, um.

278
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,713
Okay, I, um, need to
go now, because I can...

279
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,375
Um, because I
can feel the pulses.

280
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:57,388
They're trying to use the microwaves
to penetrate my synaptic code.

281
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,891
- Okay, you need to relax, all right?
- I just need to leave.

282
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,620
- Okay.
- I'm gonna give you medicine...

283
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,390
- to help you do that.
- Okay.

284
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,398
- Okay. Okay.
- Unh!

285
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,060
No! Please! No, wait!

286
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,466
Hey. No. Don't do that.

287
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,774
Okay. Stop it.

288
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,878
James, look at me. James. James.

289
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,446
You know I'm not
trying to hurt you.

290
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,813
I'm keeping you
safe. That's what I do.

291
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,582
- Abby, your brother's on line one.
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

292
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,509
Eric.

293
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,005
Where are you?

294
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,779
Are you okay?

295
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,775
Well, what's going on? I...

296
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,288
Yes, he's here. We caught him.

297
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,626
We have no other choice.
He's not cooperating.

298
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,826
He knows things. We have to
proceed with the surgical interrogation.

299
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:15,094
Okay. Are you on your meds?

300
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,402
Well, why didn't
you go to a hospital?

301
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,709
Well, what's the phone number
of the booth you're using?

302
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,504
- Unh! JAMES:
Stop talking to them.

303
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,478
I won't let you talk to them.

304
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:45,696
Frank, call Security
and cancel the fire alarm.

305
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,511
James!

306
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,675
Look out, look out, look out.

307
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,062
Hey, just hang out.
I'll be right back.

308
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,669
When are they gonna stop this?

309
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,739
Well, usually it doesn't take
more than four or five hours.

310
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,842
- Ha.
- You think I'm kidding?

311
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,875
Now you see why I
want out of this place.

312
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,535
Well, it's not all bad.

313
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,204
You know what I mean. - Hmm.

314
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:39,045
- You can get a job at Northwestern too.
- I left County once, but I came back.

315
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,278
Something about this
place just gets in your blood.

316
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,854
Mm, ha-ha. It's
probably the asbestos.

317
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,754
So you wanna help me
celebrate later or what?

318
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,225
- What do you have in mind?
- Hey, Dr. Chen.

319
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,455
She spiked a fever. - Uh...

320
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,725
Oh, am I interrupting something?

321
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,231
- Yeah.
- No.

322
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,802
Mona Reynolds, she dropped
her pressure in the CT scan...

323
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,734
and her temp's 39.8.

324
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,203
Find me later.

325
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,606
Her white count is 22. She's in a
lot of pain. I paged Dr. Romano.

326
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:08,270
- How are we doing, Mrs. Reynolds?
- My gut's gonna burst.

327
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,780
Let me guess. She ruptured
her intraperitoneal pus.

328
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,248
Pressure's 86/60.

329
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,580
We're gonna need
another liter. She's septic.

330
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:19,089
- Courtesy of Dr. Corday.
- Oh, my gut's killing me.

331
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,624
It will if we don't fix it.

332
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,763
A simple "please" and "thank
you" would have sufficed.

333
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,425
Okay. Let's grab a
two-gram dose of Cefoxitin...

334
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,437
a gram of p.r. Tylenol
and four of MS.

335
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,336
- Should I page Dr. Corday?
- Screw that.

336
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,511
If she can't diagnose a subphrenic
abscess, she can't fix one.

337
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,340
You should get a clean dressing.

338
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,572
Grab me a four-by-four.

339
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,745
Whoa.

340
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,113
Also looks necrotic. You
need to get that debrided.

341
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,687
If I were you two, I would
concentrate on my patient.

342
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,124
She has a history of peptic
ulcer disease, perforation...

343
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,592
chronic subclinical fevers,
weight loss, cough. It's classic.

344
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,459
- We must page Corday to book an O.R.
- Forget it.

345
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,033
She's already septic.
Open drainage could kill her.

346
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,262
We'll have to do this under
ultrasound. Set her up in Trauma 2.

347
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:10,633
History of CHF, noncompliant with
meds and diet. Wet crackles on exam.

348
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,180
- Orders?
- CBC, 40 of Lasix, chest x-ray and EKG.

349
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,043
Great.

350
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,812
- Good. Next.
- Positional vertigo, positive berene test.

351
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,150
- How's the cerebellar function?
- FNF, HTS and RAM all normal.

352
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,292
Ma'am, can you go like this?

353
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,520
Good. Hep-Lock, five of
Compazine, five of Valium.

354
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,959
Next.

355
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:36,296
Knee pain. History of rheumatoid
arthritis. No trauma or calf tenderness.

356
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,995
- We think ruptured Baker cyst.
- Dr. Carter, phone call.

357
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,834
- Okay, just a sec. What'd you order?
- Ultrasound.

358
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,806
Hey, Carter. Your
old guy just coded.

359
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,809
All right. 600 of ibuprofen.
Take a message.

360
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,381
Uh, I'm sorry, he's with a
patient. Can I take a message?

361
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,685
Uh, just a second. Dr. Weaver, can you
take this telephone call for Dr. Carter?

362
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,653
He's running a code.
They say it's urgent.

363
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,850
This is Kerry Weaver, Dr. Carter's
supervisor. What's the problem?

364
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,661
- Suction. MALIK:
He's throwing PVCs.

365
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,660
- Cricoid pressure.
- You want lidocaine?

366
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,356
Not just yet. I got
it. I'm in. Bag him.

367
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,365
You got a phone
call. I'll take this.

368
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,231
- I got it.
- Sats are coming up.

369
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,872
You really need to take this call.
- He's in V-tach.

370
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,031
- Charge to 200.
- It's your grandmother.

371
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,676
Good pulse with compressions.

372
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,611
John. MALIK: Charged.

373
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,181
- Uh, okay, clear.
- Still in V-tach.

374
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,580
Charge to 300. Give
me an amp of epi.

375
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,353
- I'm sorry.
- Is she dead?

376
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,381
Charged.

378
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,753
Clear.

379
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,624
- Still in fib.
- 360.

380
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,630
- How long do you keep trying?
- Clear.

381
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,927
Another amp of epi.
It's been 25 minutes.

382
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,538
- Does anyone survive after this long?
- Hold compressions.

383
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,538
- Fine V-fib.
- Resume compressions. Charge to 360.

384
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,574
- What else can you try?
- Procainamide.

385
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,612
- One gram, 30 mgs per minute.
- With lidocaine and amiodarone?

386
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,306
What's the most times you've
ever shocked somebody?

387
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,008
- Still no change.
- 360. One more time.

388
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,781
I thought if you don't get him
back after three, you never will.

389
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,116
And clear.

390
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,891
Well, I guess you
heard wrong. Sinus tach.

391
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,621
Good carotid pulse. Finish the Pronestyl
load and start a drip at five per minute.

392
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,600
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

393
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,033
- Is he ever gonna wake up?
- Let's just wait and see.

394
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,963
ABG on 100 percent. AC 14.

395
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,609
Tidal volume of 700.

396
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,971
Abby, I told you not to call
DCFS on the Baby Miles case.

397
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,548
I didn't. I called a social
worker. Mom needed help.

398
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,277
- Yeah, and Adele called DCFS.
- Hey, did you find him?

399
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,149
- No.
- Oh, she lost a Psych patient.

400
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,189
I was in the process of
restraining him when he bolted.

401
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,883
Wait. Did you call Security?

402
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:18,588
He'd already left the building. Can
you give me an address on this number?

403
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,132
- Is this patient a threat?
- I don't know.

404
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,996
- Where is this?
- It's a phone booth.

405
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,105
Chuck.

406
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:29,333
- You leaving?
- Yeah. How's the patient?

407
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,410
Hopefully he's not brain dead
from the prolonged hypotension.

408
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,046
It was a good intubation,
Suz. You saw it.

409
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,706
One, call me Susan, and
two, his lung was down.

410
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,853
Do you know how hard it is to
hear on that chopper with rotors...

411
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,819
and the vibration
and the headphones?

412
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,424
I do know. But...

413
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,857
That lung was up
when I transported him.

414
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,430
- He had pneumo. You should've caught it.
- You didn't.

415
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,863
- I stood up for you in there.
- What's that supposed to mean?

416
00:23:56,035 --> 00:24:00,166
You felt like you had to because
I'm a nurse and you're a doctor?

417
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,364
No, that is not it.

418
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,907
Well, maybe a little. I know
how they bag on the EMTs.

419
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,048
- What is so funny?
- Nothing. We just...

420
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,687
We bag on doctors all the time.

421
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,288
You're protecting me.

422
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,791
- Oh, you're too much, Dr. Lewis.
- Chuck.

423
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,388
Yeah? LEWIS: Chuck.

424
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,293
- Susan.
- Charles.

425
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,800
Susan.

426
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,462
- There's a dead body in here.
- I don't mind.

427
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,470
It's gross.

428
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,802
It's disrespectful.

429
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,809
It's wrong.

430
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,247
I'm sorry. I was
looking for Carter.

431
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,182
- Um, he was just here, wasn't he?
- Yeah.

432
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,186
- Yeah. But, um, he left.
- Yeah, he...

433
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,757
Okay.

434
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,428
Kovac. Uh, you ever drain
an intraperitoneal abscess?

435
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,928
- That's a surgical procedure.
- You're a surgeon?

436
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,127
Yes.

437
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,102
Good. Come with me now. Now.

438
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,067
I got a septic patient
moments from badness.

439
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,838
I need you to help me put a catheter in
a pocket of pus. Think you can do that?

440
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,504
Perhaps, but... Good.

441
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,206
Pressure's better. 110/72
after the second liter.

442
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,512
- What's her temp? GALLANT:
39. Cefoxitin running in.

443
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,982
I need you to sign this.

444
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,020
- What is it?
- A consent for the procedure.

445
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,351
- What happens if I don't?
- You'll probably die.

446
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,021
- What are they saying?
- Pillow talk.

447
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,667
Kidney stone in Two is pain-free. Send
him home with Vicodin and a strainer.

448
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,863
Uh, Eleanor Carter. It might
be under Eleanor Ferguson.

449
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,142
Mrs. Drummond can have Compazine.
She can come back if pain persists.

450
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,370
- The kid in, uh, Curtain Three?
- Lewis can take care of everybody else.

451
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,447
Okay. Hey, you all right?

452
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,982
Yeah, I'll be all
right. Thanks, Malik.

453
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,620
Uh, can you check again for me?

454
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,750
Hello?

455
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,220
Hello?

456
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,053
- Pressure's steady. 100 systolic.
- Has anybody seen Abby?

457
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,956
- No, sorry. HORVAT:
Find a needle.

458
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,757
- Try not to perforate the diaphragm.
- What are you doing?

459
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,127
- What's it look like?
- A lawsuit.

460
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,166
Advancing. No aspiration.

461
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,872
- Sorry to hear about your grandmother.
- Thank you. Um, I need to go home.

462
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,272
- Susan's gonna cover for me.
- How old was she?

463
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,408
- 78.
- We should all be so lucky. There's pus.

464
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,516
Pull out more.
Good. Wire. Uh, go.

465
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,709
Couple more Croatians,
I'd really clean house.

466
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,081
- Trocar and pigtail.
- I'll be right back.

467
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,917
Pull the needle out and put
the trocar right over the wire.

468
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,582
Hey, Carter.

469
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,318
Do you know anyone
in the state department?

470
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:37,519
Why?

471
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,528
Uh, my friend is trying
to get a little boy...

472
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,326
into this country
for an operation...

473
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,698
Luka, I'm really sorry. I can't
help you with this right now.

474
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,240
- Jerry, have you seen Abby?
- Nope.

475
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,570
- Can you find her for me?
- Sure.

476
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,310
Hey, Dad, it's me.

477
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,174
No, I didn't get ahold of Mom.

478
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,452
Are you sure that you're
gonna make the 5:30 flight?

479
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,817
Okay. No, I'll just leave right from
here to come to the airport to pick you up.

480
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,621
Okay.

481
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,523
No, I'm good.

482
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,622
Yeah, I know. Bye.

483
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,461
- I've been looking for you.
- I've been looking for you.

484
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,402
I got a 26-year-old with stridor in severe
respiratory distress. I can't tube him.

485
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,065
- His epiglottis is the size of my fist.
- Nothing's open. Put him in Three.

486
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:28,146
Pre-op labs, blood cultures times
two, soft tissue lateral to the neck.

487
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,940
Three grams of Unasyn.

488
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,107
Pulse ox is 85. He's
barely moving any air.

489
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,083
I saw this guy for a sore throat.
Romano told me to turf him.

490
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,246
One, two, three.

491
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,482
Needs a surgical airway.
You ever do a crike?

492
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,126
- No.
- Well, you're about to.

493
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:44,661
Prep and drape the neck.
Abby, can you open a Melker kit?

494
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,230
- What comes next?
- The cricothyroid space.

495
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,666
- Do it. Can you leave right after this?
- Yeah. I'm ready to go right now.

496
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:57,008
Angle the needle at 45 degrees. Good.
Because I don't wanna do this alone.

497
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,667
- Do what?
- Aspirate air.

498
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:03,913
Good, you're in. All the arrangements.
Everything that has to be taken care of.

499
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,880
Guide wire next.

500
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,280
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

501
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,184
- Where are you going?
- To get Eric.

502
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,916
- What?
- Needle out, 11 blade.

503
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,854
Yeah. He called from a truck
stop outside of Des Moines.

504
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,692
Just enough to pass the introducer.
- Okay.

505
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,134
- When did this happen?
- This afternoon.

506
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:26,898
Oh, and I need you to write me
a scrip for Depakote and Zyprexa.

507
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,473
Introducer out.

508
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,405
Okay, bag him.

509
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,106
Sats are coming
up. Nice work, Pratt.

510
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,543
What's wrong?

511
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,921
My grandmother died today.

512
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,227
Just didn't wake
up from her nap.

513
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,427
Oh, Carter, I'm so
sorry. No one told me.

514
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,465
- Hey, I got it. ABBY:
Let's get out of here.

515
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,767
Yeah, she called me,
like, for three days.

516
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,811
She was on some new committee.
She wanted me to hear somebody speak...

517
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,211
about a wetlands
learning center.

518
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:14,080
She knew I hated that stuff. I
think she just wanted to see me.

519
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,856
Well, you spent more
time with her than anybody.

520
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:21,691
Then she called again last night.
And I saw her number on the caller ID.

521
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,261
And I just... I
didn't pick it up.

522
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:30,099
Well, she lived a very full and
happy life and you're a big part of that.

523
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,672
She wasn't sick. She wasn't in
pain. She was in her own bed.

524
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,070
It's not a bad way to go.

525
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:40,375
And I'll be back tonight.
The flight's only an hour.

526
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,776
Do you have to go? I
mean, my dad's flying in.

527
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,109
I gotta do all the
funeral arrangements.

528
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,186
I just... I have to go get him.

529
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,053
Why? I mean, Eric's been gone
for weeks. What's one more day?

530
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,524
He's off his meds. And if I don't
go now, he might disappear again.

531
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,556
I'll be back tonight.

532
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,228
- John.
- Go. Go find your brother.

533
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,237
My grandmother will still
be dead when you get back.

534
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,179
- What should I tell Dr. Corday?
- That she's welcome.

535
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,283
And the least she can do is
admit this patient to Surgical ICU.

536
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,319
Good God, it's the Stepford
children. Where's your handler?

537
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,820
He said you'd shepherd
us the rest of the shift.

538
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,757
Oh, well, isn't he generous
with my life. Come on.

539
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,320
Wean him down to 50
percent and check a gas...

540
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,295
Would you like to present some
cases to the future of medicine?

541
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,026
- No, thanks.
- It's not a request.

542
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,761
Okay, listen up. This is what
happens when your chief...

543
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,907
forces you to clear beds at
the cost of proper examination.

544
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,203
Even a sore throat can
result in a near mortality.

545
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:50,213
Now, this particular patient came
in complaining of odynophagia.

546
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,214
- It hurts to swallow.
- I checked this guy's throat.

547
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,717
See, posterior
pharynx looks benign.

548
00:30:55,921 --> 00:31:00,950
But when pain is out of proportion to
exam, one must visualize the epiglottis...

549
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,891
either with a lateral x-ray
or looking down the throat...

550
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,827
with a fiber-optic scope
or a right-angled mirror.

551
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,556
Can't help it if
the guy's a wimp.

552
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,628
Epiglottitis is a
pediatric illness, junior.

553
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:14,398
Maybe back in the day. But we tend
to see it in adults now more and more.

554
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,565
If one takes the
time to look for it.

555
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,578
- I had to crike this guy.
- Well, good for you.

556
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:25,047
Don't ever do this. Get out, now.
Let's go. Move. Move, now! Move!

557
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,652
What's the matter with
you? Get out of here.

558
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,989
Congratulations. You just bought
yourself a month of midnights.

559
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,865
- Move!
- Good.

560
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,263
I love the nightlife.

561
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,963
Where's your friend?

562
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,203
Dr. Horvat left.

563
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,574
I heard Romano had her doing
surgery in the trauma room.

564
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,215
She drained an abscess.
It wasn't a big deal.

565
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,351
Unless there are complications.

566
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:03,683
Uh, I think you may have gotten the
wrong impression today in Exam Four...

567
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,348
- when you were looking for Carter.
- You mean with the flight nurse?

568
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,961
Chuck. And technically
we're married.

569
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,997
Oh, so it's technically okay to
boff your husband in the hospital?

570
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,734
- We weren't boffing. We were talking.
- Good night, Susan.

571
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,895
It's not the same as
a patient's mother.

572
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,041
Hey, at least I used
an empty room.

573
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,776
Thank you.

574
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,584
What are you still doing here?

575
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:35,243
I'm, um, picking up my dad
at the airport before I go home.

576
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,649
Good.

577
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,782
Do you remember any genetic disorders
that cause a buildup of ethylene glycol?

578
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,157
Not offhand. But if it's not in
Harrison's it probably doesn't exist.

579
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:48,824
There are hundreds of rare ailments that
fall under glycogen storage diseases...

580
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,469
amino acid disorders,
metabolism...

581
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,128
Try a Medline search for
substances that give you...

582
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,674
a false positive for ethylene
glycol. Might get lucky.

583
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:01,177
You went, uh, pretty long
and hard on that guy earlier.

584
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,680
Yeah. I figured it was the
least I could do. He was dying.

585
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,550
- If you need to take a couple days...
- I'm not on until Saturday. Good night.

586
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,350
Good. Crash resuscitation
means lines, tubes, fluids ASAP.

587
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,855
Like, now.

588
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,153
In a real case,
you'd have a minute.

589
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:20,459
Make a three-centimeter incision in the
fifth intercostal space, mid-axillary line.

590
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:23,329
- What are you doing?
- I am teaching. Give it all you got.

591
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,062
- Stop. ROMANO: Aim
for the ipsilateral nipple...

592
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,470
while you keep aspirating.
Somebody broke his ribs doing CPR.

593
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:33,134
He needs chest tubes and volume for
hypotension. Could've bagged his spleen.

594
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,213
- So do an ultrasound.
- Look, you coded him for 35 minutes.

595
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,715
He's brain dead. He'll arrest in
the next four hours. No next of kin.

596
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,047
Might as well get the
maximum student benefit.

597
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,900
- Run in 500 cc's.
- No, I said stop.

598
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,388
- I'm about to cannulate...
- Everybody get out.

599
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,355
This is a patient,
not a cadaver lab.

600
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,089
- Look, you need to go home...
- Get the hell out of here right now.

601
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,418
I wasn't sure you'd come.

602
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,050
I wasn't sure you'd be here.

603
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:00,893
What's going on?

604
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,698
Traveling. Uh, you know.

605
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,895
Here, there.

606
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:12,073
Visiting old friends. Just, uh, trying
to reconnect and, uh, keep in touch.

607
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,540
Not with me.

608
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,378
Not with Maggie.

609
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:26,049
- You know that guy?
- No, do you?

610
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,725
Does he look familiar to you? He's
been looking at me like he knows me.

611
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,396
- No.
- They all have.

612
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,273
I don't know. Did you notice when you
walked in? This is a weird place, isn't it?

613
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,336
- Yeah.
- I'm glad you came.

614
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,607
I don't know this area. This is
a strange part of the country...

615
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,250
About ready to get out of here?

616
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,845
- I need to pay for my coffee.
- Okay.

617
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,221
I don't have any money.

618
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,093
Don't tell me your HMO doesn't
cover somebody to do that for you.

619
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,861
You know what they say, you
want something done right...

620
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,870
Is that why you thought you
could perform surgery in the ER?

621
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,837
Hey, it worked, didn't it?

622
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,502
She's on dopamine
and still febrile.

623
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,671
The good news is we
haven't had to intubate yet.

624
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,338
She could've died.

625
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,883
I still haven't ruled that out.

626
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,317
It was a good call, Robert.

627
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,047
Unfortunately, the
drainage was incomplete.

628
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:36,558
There were loculations you couldn't reach
so I'll have to do an open laparotomy.

629
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,287
Damn shame that you
didn't catch it the first time.

630
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:42,662
Subphrenic abscess is a surgical
disease. They don't see it much here.

631
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,394
Robert, I would've
caught it if you'd let me.

632
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,062
And she'd be cooling down
on Zosyn before surgery.

633
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:51,402
Now she's more of a mess
than if you'd done nothing.

634
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,876
Did that hurt?

635
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,775
No, but I wish it had.

636
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,648
How long's it been like this?

637
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,088
- A few days.
- More than a few, I'd guess.

638
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,417
I'm gonna pack the
cavity with Iodoform gauze.

639
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:09,993
Is Gunn following this?

640
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:15,532
Gunn, Plastics, Ortho, Hand and ID.
Hyperbarics want me to try them next.

641
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:19,198
What's after that?
Witchcraft? Magnets?

642
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,538
I'll try anything at this point.

643
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,367
You know, at some point maybe...

644
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:33,946
What?

645
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,187
It's nothing.

646
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,818
Say it.

647
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,062
"When the wound
becomes life-threatening...

648
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,393
because of gangrene or sepsis...

649
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:55,605
it may be in the patient's best interest
to consider a definitive surgical cure."

650
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,444
Luka Kovac.

651
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,530
Hey, John, it's me.

652
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,468
Um, I'm at a motel room at the
airport because we missed our plane.

653
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,335
And I'm sorry.

654
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,210
I'm trying to get us
on the first flight out

655
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:14,775
tomorrow, and I'll
try to call you later.

656
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,675
Bye.

657
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,584
Better?

658
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,620
Better.

659
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,451
- Thanks for the clothes.
- Thank Carter.

660
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,354
They're his.

661
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,294
- He also sent this.
- What is it?

662
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:34,989
Depakote.

663
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,637
- This is my life now, isn't it?
- It's up to you.

664
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,144
We all thought you
were dead, you know.

665
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,083
Except for Mom, of course.
She refused to believe it.

666
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:56,710
- She know you were coming?
- Couldn't get in touch with her.

667
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,823
For all I know,
she's missing too.

668
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,526
- It's not funny.
- I know.

669
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,828
It's a little funny.

670
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,330
So, what happens now?

671
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,261
We go home.

672
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,333
Well, what about me?

673
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,435
I don't wanna live like this.

674
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,669
I can't keep doing this to you.

675
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,112
You have to get into a program.

676
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,679
Will you help me?

677
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,595
Don't I always?

678
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,523
- Dr. Carter.
- It's okay.

679
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,953
- Where's your father?
- He took a later flight.

680
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,393
He'll land in a couple
hours. Did my mother call?

681
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:14,156
No. Sorry.

682
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:18,099
Dr. Emerson was here earlier. He said
you can call him tonight if you'd like.

683
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,731
And Mr. Garrett called
from the funeral home.

684
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,841
He apologized for the delay.

685
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,704
They didn't come yet?

686
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,743
They should be here any minute.

687
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,403
Can I get you something to eat?

688
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:30,843
- No, thank you.
- Tea?

689
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,177
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

690
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,683
Dr. Carter.

691
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,245
She was a wonderful woman.

692
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,485
Yes, she was.
