00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,563
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,232
Sam, this is Mary Warner,
she's studying to be an EMT.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,378
- Pull the blinds, bitch.
- What's going on?

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,413
No, no, don't shoot. Luka.

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,606
He needs to be intubated.

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,776
You're gonna walk us out like
old Steve's going back to lockup.

7
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,214
Something's wrong.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,085
- Think about Alex.
- I already did.

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,352
Find Kovac, Jerry's hurt.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,123
- Are you all okay, honey?
- I think so.

11
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,633
Staging area, north of County...

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,570
Coming through.

13
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,539
Callahan, cordon off the area.

14
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,943
Don't let the witnesses leave.

15
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,246
All right, come on, here.

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,380
You folks back
off the perimeter.

17
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,286
- Back off the barricades. OFFICER
2: Come on, now, listen to him.

18
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,483
There's a car coming in.

19
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,618
What happened after that?

20
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,439
Lift those cords up, right now.

21
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,433
- They took one of our nurses.
- Got in the van and just plowed right by.

22
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,761
Was Sam...? Was
there a nurse with them?

23
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,304
- I saw a lady, guy was dragging her.
- She works here, Samantha Taggart.

24
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,565
You need to find her.

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,351
Holding area to the left.

26
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,277
- Lily, how'd you get through?
- Through Oncology, everybody okay?

27
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,108
I'm not sure yet. Call OEMC
and put us on medical bypass.

28
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,909
We're closed for
internal disaster.

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,019
- And page Kovac, it's his damn ER.
- I'll get on it.

30
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,245
- Dr. Weaver.
- Yes?

31
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,856
- Main area clear, working our way back.
- Thanks.

32
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,323
Admitted patients need to go up to
the wards, don't wait for open beds.

33
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,860
They can board them
in the hallways for now.

34
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,998
Okay, everybody
else is getting triaged.

35
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,033
We need to assess all equipment
for any possible damage.

36
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,081
Some of the techs
are starting on that.

37
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,795
- I came in as soon as I heard.
- Thanks, Frank.

38
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,171
Call Pratt, we need
him here. Frank.

39
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,954
<i>Requesting backup,
any available...</i>

40
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,004
Jerry is gonna be okay.

41
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,872
I found this lady
near the stairs.

42
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,648
- Finish checking the back hall.
- Hey, is somebody with this boy?

43
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,422
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

44
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,221
Hi, I'm Kerry. Are
you with somebody?

45
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,223
Jerry was taking care of me.

46
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,726
- Where are his parents?
- They were on their way in.

47
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,832
I'll take him up to Daycare until
they get here. Come on, honey.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,559
Have somebody
take a look at that.

49
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,364
- I'm good, this is nothing.
- Looks like something to me.

50
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,903
Lots of folks got it worse.

51
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,665
Haleh, how's Jerry doing?

52
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,401
We're waiting on a second
Thora-Seal. Abby's getting it.

53
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,977
- I'll be right in.
- Dr. Weaver.

54
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,443
Any word on Sam?

55
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,707
- I told you we should've waited.
- We waited long enough.

56
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,682
We would've walked out if
you hadn't let her play doctor.

57
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,344
He okay?

58
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,888
His insulin level is peaking.
He needs some food.

59
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,423
- Peaking?
- Yeah, he's diabetic.

60
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,322
What, did you forget?

61
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,326
- How far till the switch?
- About 10 minutes.

62
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,692
Hurry up.

63
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,959
We'll get him something soon.

64
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,336
- Systolic's down to 70.
- Call for type specific.

65
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,167
- Another two liters on the infuser.
- How you doing, Jerry?

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,900
- Breath sounds on the right.
- His chest tube is clamped.

67
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,875
- You want him to bleed out?
- He needs to get up to the O.R.

68
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,447
- Still waiting on that Thora-Seal.
- I'll go find it.

69
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:05,017
- Hey, sats are dropping.
- 8-0 ET, sux and etomidate.

70
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,620
Abby? Abby.

71
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,612
Abby, open your eyes.

72
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,782
Open your eyes, come
on. Come on, wake up.

73
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,990
I need some help, now.

74
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,812
I'm coming in right now.

75
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,279
There's been a shooting.
Jerry took a couple hits.

76
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,715
- They're trying to stabilize him now.
- Abby?

77
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,319
Found her in a pool of blood.

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,082
Frank wasn't sure about anything
else. I'm dropping you off before I go in.

79
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,385
- I'll check on you later.
- I'm coming with you.

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,153
County General,
as fast as you can.

81
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,495
Sats, 98 on room air.

82
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,634
Deep breath in and out.

83
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,838
What the hell happened?

84
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,668
That trainee girl
stabbed me with Beck.

85
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,834
Sam did the
intubation. How's Abby?

86
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,240
I need to check on
her. Six liters O2.

87
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,575
Call me if his pulse
ox drops below 94.

88
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,445
- Easy, Luka, come on.
- I'm fine. Oh...

89
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,018
You need to be monitored
for at least an hour.

90
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,748
- I'm fine, Kerry, okay?
- Luka, you were paralyzed and intubated.

91
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,755
You belong in the ICU.

92
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,086
Hey.

93
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,694
All right, get him a stool.

94
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,424
Pressure's up to 110 on two
liters, crit's 35, fetal heart tones, 160.

95
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,591
- Sounds good.
- Hey, Abby. How are you doing?

96
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,136
- How'd I get here?
- You passed out, you were bleeding.

97
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,363
I had a cramp.

98
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,838
- Probably vagal from the pain.
- Has it stopped now?

99
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,135
It seems to have slowed down.

100
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,837
No sign of abruption,
baby's moving around.

101
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,312
Looks healthy.

102
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,077
Congratulations, it's a boy.

103
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,887
Could be a placenta previa.

104
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,052
Uh... No, I don't have previa.

105
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,887
They saw a low-lying placenta
on the 20-week ultrasound.

106
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,393
That would explain the
bleeding. You may need a C...

107
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,532
- I don't need a C-section, call Coburn.
- She was paged.

108
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,895
- Dr. Weaver, Psych's here.
- I'll be right there.

109
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,195
Kerry, move me to OB.

110
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,403
- No, we still need a sterile spec exam.
- Dr. Weaver, send me up to OB.

111
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,702
- Vitals?
- Pulse, 85. BP, 112/78.

112
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,471
All right, take her up.

113
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,482
- Having a rough time with the airway.
- It's okay, I got it.

114
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,083
- Help with the intubation.
- I'm staying with you.

115
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,983
No, no, I'm just
going up for NST.

116
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,987
- Just come up after he's tubed.
- No.

117
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,250
Luka, it's Jerry.

118
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,057
Page me if something
changes, okay?

119
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,398
County ER.

120
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,738
Sorry, we're closed.
You have to call Mercy.

121
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,176
Clinic's taking any
walk-ins with stress reaction.

122
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,283
Good, thanks. Abel, stay with
him until he's settled upstairs.

123
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,509
Okay, Dr. Weaver.

124
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,950
We should discuss a
critical-incident debriefing.

125
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,952
In a few hours,
let's get through this.

126
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:59,558
- I don't care, you can't just barge in.
- Chris, it's okay, it's okay.

127
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,957
- What's up with Jerry?
- He is redlined to the O.R.

128
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,186
- And Abby?
- She's good.

129
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,798
We sent her up to
OB, just to be safe.

130
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,561
They just called. Dr. Coburn
is on her way in right now.

131
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,203
- Okay, great.
- Abby, how are you?

132
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,067
Oh, I think I must have hit
my belly when I fell, I'm fine.

133
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,266
- How's the baby?
- Fetal heart tone is 155.

134
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,707
- Thank God.
- I'm just going up for monitoring.

135
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,312
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.

136
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,278
Come on, it will be fun. We can
play Who Had the Worst Day?

137
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,974
I'm fine.

138
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,208
Really.

139
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,683
All right, I'll come
and check on you later.

140
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,720
Come on, come on, let's go.

141
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,664
- Mom, I don't feel good.
- He needs to eat something.

142
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,493
No, gonna get some
miles behind us first.

143
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,463
No, he can't wait.

144
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,833
Okay, get him something to
hold him over, but make it quick.

145
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,497
- Come on, Alex.
- No, Alex stays with me.

146
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,634
- I'll take her, let's go.
- I'll be back, okay?

147
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,603
Hey, get me some chips.

148
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,510
I'm hitting the head.

149
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,846
Come on, stand up straight.

150
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,718
Be a man. You're not
a little kid anymore.

151
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,525
Oh, shoot.

152
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,863
I think you're gonna
really like Canada.

153
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,535
I like Chicago.

154
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,579
- More cricoid, Ray.
- I'm about to crack the larynx.

155
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,711
It's a big floppy epiglottis.
I can't see, it's a long neck.

156
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,210
Eighty-two on the pulse ox.

157
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,871
Pull out the bag.
Give me the flipper.

158
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,213
If we can't get this in...

159
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,514
then we're gonna need
a straight long blade.

160
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,884
You okay?

161
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,117
Let me know when
the sats are up.

162
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,626
Tight wheezing throughout.

163
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,890
All right, sit down. Get
him an albuterol neb.

164
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,397
- I'm okay.
- It's bronchospasm.

165
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,229
You probably aspirated some saliva.
- Guys, I can do this.

166
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,895
If you don't get treated, I'm
gonna have two patients to intubate.

167
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,969
Grab an LMA, just in case.

168
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,165
Pressure's down again.

169
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,507
- Autotransfuse from the Thora-Seal.
- Okay, let me take a look.

170
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,146
How is he?

171
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,311
He's okay, Frank. Did
somebody call his mom?

172
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,048
I'll do that right now.

173
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,590
She can meet us up in the O.R.

174
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,585
Yeah, let's hope so.

175
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,795
Hey, grab what you need.

176
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,456
You planning on
paying for those?

177
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,634
No stealing, baby.

178
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,462
Yeah, these people
work for a living.

179
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,732
- He's bradying down.
- Should I get Weaver?

180
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,900
If you enter the trachea,
you'll feel clicks...

181
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,706
when you pass over
the cartilaginous rings.

182
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,406
Heart rate's only 50.

183
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,050
Click.

184
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,549
Click.

185
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,278
- Click. KOVAC:
Hold it right there.

186
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,854
Ray, pass an 8-0.

187
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,892
All right.

188
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,587
Here you go.

189
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,663
Okay, advance the tube.

190
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,168
- No, it doesn't wanna pass.
- Down to 40, amp of atropine.

191
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,863
Rotate counterclockwise.

192
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,170
It's caught up on something.

193
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,648
There we go.

194
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,613
Okay.

195
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,382
End-tidal CO2.

196
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,026
- Sensor is yellow.
- Yellow means yes.

197
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,864
- Thought you were bringing him.
- Problem. We're ready.

198
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,522
- His pressure?
- Up to 95 systolic.

199
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,191
Four units. Two liters
autotransfused off cell saver.

200
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:06,134
Everybody upstairs is doing
everything we can to help you guys out.

201
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,111
Well, baby looks good, but
you are definitely contracting.

202
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,373
- I don't feel anything.
- Sometimes you don't.

203
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,983
I think the belly trauma
put you into preterm labor.

204
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,620
Baby's head dropped down,
caused placental bleeding.

205
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,052
Okay, well, it's too soon,
so give me terbutaline.

206
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,954
Come on, you need
magnesium. I know you know that.

207
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,857
I remember all the times you
gave it when you were a nurse.

208
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,055
Mag makes you feel like crap.
So why don't we just start with terb?

209
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:35,669
Terbutaline can mask the
signs and symptoms of abruption.

210
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,530
I didn't know that.

211
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,437
Today you're the
patient, not the doctor.

212
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,337
I'm not having an abruption.

213
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,678
Not right now, but the
trauma puts you at risk.

214
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,513
And if you do abrupt, we
need to know right away.

215
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,253
So you could do a C-section?

216
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,325
Four-gram load, then two an hour.
- Yeah.

217
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,502
- Let me know if you have any more pain.
- Okay.

218
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,210
You got my chips?

219
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,681
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,616
- That the key to the restroom?
- Yeah, but it's nasty there.

221
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:28,948
No, no, we need to leave.

222
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,956
Let the girl take a pee. We
can't hold it in like you guys.

223
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,289
Hey, can I have my
chips? I'm starving.

224
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,020
Thank you.

225
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:32,109
Next time you try something
like that, I'll take it out on your kid.

226
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,726
- You're definitely not contracting.
- Contractions don't last this long.

227
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,591
- When did the pain start?
- About 15 minutes ago.

228
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,060
How bad, one to 10?

229
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,860
I don't know, like
a four, maybe.

230
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,560
But it's probably just a
bruise from when I fell down.

231
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,934
I just need some
Tylenol or something.

232
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,200
- Well, there's no evidence of abruption.
- Great.

233
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,843
See? I told you.

234
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,380
CBC with platelets, PT/PTT
fibrinogen, D-dimer and FDPs.

235
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,708
Why? What for?

236
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,113
Twenty percent of abruptions
have ultrasound findings.

237
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,877
Let's send the labs to be sure.

238
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,223
Baby looks great, heart
rate's good, excellent variability.

239
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,451
Abby, Abby, hey, Abby.

240
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,186
Here's what I would say to
you if you weren't a doctor.

241
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,593
The placenta separates
from the womb and bleeds...

242
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,393
the baby can be
deprived of oxygen.

243
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,865
Now, even if we
don't see a blood clot...

244
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:27,474
the labs will give us advanced
warning before the baby's in trouble.

245
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,903
Okay.

246
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,442
- Twelve of betamethasone.
- Oh, come on.

247
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,410
We have to mature the baby's
lungs in case of an emergent...

248
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,073
No, no, no.

249
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,613
I have two and a half months left to
go. This baby is not coming until then.

250
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,728
- That's what we're all hoping for.
- I can wait two more weeks.

251
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,330
The risk of prematurity
goes way down at that point.

252
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,457
I can wait, I'll go on bed rest,
I'll use a bedpan, I won't move.

253
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,400
You know that I want
you to have a healthy baby.

254
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,835
Why do you keep focusing
on a worst-case scenario?

255
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,873
That's her job.

256
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,295
- Eight monitored beds good to go.
- Night staff's been called?

257
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,490
- All coming in except two.
- You check on Sam?

258
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,794
My guy at the district
called, still no leads.

259
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,028
OEMC's on the line,
wanna know where we're at.

260
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,537
Tell them we can take
four critical paramedic runs.

261
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,675
Back on bypass till we
see how we're doing.

262
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,141
- Got people for treatment.
- We'll take care of it.

263
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,281
Chuny, let's set up fast
track in the west lobby.

264
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,882
Speed through anybody who
doesn't need x-rays or labs.

265
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,144
- Pratt.
- All right, I'll help set it up.

266
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,854
Great. How long
is this gonna take?

267
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,200
What are you doing? - Shut up.

268
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,499
- You're gonna get us all killed.
- Relax, train's probably a mile away.

269
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,382
Oh, son of a bitch.

270
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,066
All right, everybody be cool.

271
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,067
Nobody gets hurt.

272
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,760
License and proof of insurance.

273
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,226
We're on our way to the lake so my
son can get some fishing in before dark.

274
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,295
It's his birthday.

275
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,625
I'll be right back.

276
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,639
That's good. He's just
gonna give us a ticket.

277
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,070
What's he doing back there?

278
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,591
He's a local yokel, man.

279
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,777
This is the most
excitement he's had all day.

280
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,749
- Probably calling for backup.
- Sammy.

281
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,650
Every cop within a 1000-mile
radius knows what you look like.

282
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,724
- He's taking too long, screw it.
- Ah...

283
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:39,123
So they're trying to find the
source of the bleeding and tie it off.

284
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,267
Oh, my Jerry's
not the hardy type.

285
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,960
I only hope he doesn't
wilt under all this.

286
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,470
He had a good blood pressure and
good pulse when he left the ER, so...

287
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,767
Oh, the ER.

288
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,466
This would never
have happened...

289
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,511
if he didn't insist on working
at that <i>fakakta</i> cesspool.

290
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,446
Well, as long as the surgeons find the
bleeding and stop it, he should be fine.

291
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,609
He could have gone
to law school, you know.

292
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,119
- I didn't realize that.
- I myself sent the application to Harvard.

293
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,487
Harvard. But, no,
he wouldn't go.

294
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:07,683
Oh, that's, uh...

295
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,659
- Jerry got into Harvard, wow.
- No, they rejected him.

296
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,854
Four times.

297
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,363
- But that's not the point.
- No, of course it isn't.

298
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,431
- So how much is all this gonna cost us?
- Um...

299
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,971
I don't really know. I mean, I'm
sure his health insurance will cover it.

300
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,769
Oh, but they don't cover
the deductibles, do they?

301
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,775
You know who
covers the deductibles?

302
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,846
Me, I cover the deductibles.

303
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,983
Why don't you wait here, okay?

304
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,812
And I will talk about this
with you as much as you want.

305
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,817
But I'll go see
how he's doing first.

306
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,048
He doesn't have any savings,
you know. But why would he?

307
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,389
He can barely survive
off that weekly insult...

308
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,224
you people call a paycheck.

309
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,696
- How's he doing?
- A bullet nicked the right ventricle.

310
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,338
Damn it, I was hoping
it missed the heart.

311
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,406
Another 3.0
Prolene on a pledget.

312
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,007
Eighth unit going up.

313
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,837
Systolic's 85.

314
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,707
I mean, a cardiac
defect isn't so bad.

315
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,816
It's repairable, right? It's not
like he needs a pneumonectomy.

316
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,042
Metz.

317
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,711
Looks dry, barely any oozing.

318
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,020
V-tach. DUBENKO:
Internal paddles.

319
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,989
Lost the pulse.

320
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,154
Twenty joules.

321
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,355
Oh, God.

322
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,261
- Charged.
- Clear.

323
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,370
- Still tach.
- Come on, Jerry.

324
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,529
Charge to 50.

325
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,439
Clear.

326
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,542
- No change.
- Damn it.

327
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,576
Starting internal compressions.

328
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,043
Why is he in V—tach?

329
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,704
Elevated potassium?

330
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,214
T-waves aren't peaked,
but we've got ST elevation.

331
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,716
He's having a heart attack.

332
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,046
What about hypocalcemia?

333
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,700
Could be high doses of
citrates with the transfusions.

334
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,688
Amp of calcium chloride.

335
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,885
- Excuse me, Dr. Dubenko.
- Not now, Neela. Epi's onboard.

336
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,596
I'm sorry to interrupt, but is it possible
the suture is tying off a coronary artery?

337
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,894
- What?
- If you occluded the coronary artery...

338
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,798
with the stitch,
you'd have an MI.

339
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,734
That's a good call.
I'm near the RCA.

340
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,464
- Eleven blade.
- Charged to 20.

341
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,108
You could see inside the field?

342
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,903
I just had a hunch.

343
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,409
Sutures cut.

344
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,906
Clear.

345
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,087
- Sinus.
- Way to go.

346
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,555
Okay, we'll go on bypass
for a coronary graft.

347
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,285
Call the perfusionist. We'll
reposition for a clamshell.

348
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,794
Neela, scrub in. I need
another set of hands here.

349
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,265
Whoa, whoa.

350
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,577
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- Oh, man.

351
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,142
- They know where we're going.
- Just let us out, please.

352
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,947
- You don't need us.
- You're not prisoners, you're family.

353
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,114
You're gonna get your family
killed. Is that what you want?

354
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,257
Steve!

355
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,724
What are you doing?

356
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,545
- Cops are gonna be crawling everywhere.
- We'll get further off the grid.

357
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,650
They didn't know what
direction we headed.

358
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,548
Then we'll change the direction.

359
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:24,815
Steve, please, just let us out, okay?
I can go back and check on that cop.

360
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,652
Shut the hell up, Sam.

361
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,151
Shut up, you're not leaving.

362
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,160
Nobody's leaving. Do
you understand that?

363
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,494
- Does everybody understand that?
- Whoa. Hey, buddy, chill out.

364
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,033
We're okay, hey, hey.

365
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,694
Hey, easy, man.

366
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,504
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

367
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,001
Sam probably saved your life.

368
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,342
Yeah, I hope she's all right.

369
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,550
- How's he doing?
- Good.

370
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,314
Turn and see for yourself.

371
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,889
The magnesium has
drained all my life force.

372
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,825
We're so not ready for this.

373
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,428
No one is ever ready for this.

374
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,260
Yeah, but we don't even
have a car seat or a stroller...

375
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,526
We have a crib.

376
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,795
We don't have a name.

377
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,440
I was kind of hoping we
could name him after my father.

378
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,402
- Really?
- Yeah.

379
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,606
He would really have loved to
have a grandson named Mongo.

380
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,845
Mongo?

381
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,956
Yeah, it's a very
popular name in Croatia.

382
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,890
I'm just kidding, my...

383
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:45,066
My father's name is Josip. I don't
care how we're gonna call him.

384
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,399
It's not funny.

385
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,236
Oh, my God.

386
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,945
- What is it, contraction?
- I don't know, I think my water broke.

387
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,719
- Ugh. What are you doing?
- Opening up your saline.

388
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,580
We need some help in here.

389
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,750
Are you sure it's
not a contraction?

390
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,122
Nothing on the monitor.

391
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,622
- Oh, what's that?
- His heart rate's dropping.

392
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,734
- Oh, God, how low?
- Okay, get on your left side now.

393
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:16,925
Abby.

394
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,934
Sharp pain, gush of blood.

395
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,437
Heart rate's in the 60s.
We're going to the O.R.

396
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,367
- Is it an abruption?
- Looks that way.

397
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,104
- Stat, page Anesthesia.
- No, I want a spinal.

398
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,679
General anesthesia is quicker.

399
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,444
I wanna be awake for the birth.

400
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,781
You're okay. You're
gonna be okay.

401
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,219
No, keep going.

402
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,834
I wanna sit tight for a while.

403
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,489
I don't think so. Babe,
what do you think, split up?

404
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,545
Yeah. STEVE: Not
until we get another car.

405
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,331
All you do is slow us down,
you and this dumb bitch.

406
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,734
- Oh, shut up, shut up.
- Hey, hey, take it easy.

407
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,169
They're fighting.

408
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:58,004
Yeah, they don't
know what to do.

409
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:03,012
They know that they're in trouble,
they know the cops are coming to find us.

410
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,941
- Mom.
- Yeah?

411
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,450
Is Dad gonna hurt us?

412
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,783
Everything's gonna
be okay, buddy.

413
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,187
Keep your voice down.
They might hear you.

414
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,459
Just come in here, come in here.

415
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,806
Buddy, I need you to
help me do something.

416
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,917
But you gotta do it so
no one else knows, okay?

417
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,484
Okay.

418
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:41,984
Come on.

419
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,788
- Find some keys, okay?
- I think the other guy has the keys.

420
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,589
- Or a gun or something.
- A gun?

421
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,493
- Anything.
- Mom, I'm scared.

422
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,828
Okay, I know you're scared,
and I know I messed up a lot...

423
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:01,235
but I would never, ever let
anybody hurt you, no matter what.

424
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,308
I swear to God.

425
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,505
Go, go.

426
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,948
Hey.

427
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,793
Are you guys hungry?

428
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,733
What's up, Frank?

429
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:40,369
You know, I always believed
that nothing ever really changed.

430
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:47,148
I'm old enough that I know that
there's always gonna be troubles.

431
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,013
War, taxes.

432
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:54,320
Bad guys now are pretty much the
same as bad guys have always been.

433
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,461
That's not how I feel today.

434
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:04,628
I feel like the world's getting
worse and worse and worse.

435
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,466
And what we're watching
is the slow, steady descent...

436
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,302
of the human race.

437
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,374
Uh...

438
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,479
No, no, I don't buy that.

439
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:25,188
I think that, um, today was just
a rough day for the home team.

440
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,819
- Straight across the sternum?
- Exactly.

441
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,830
Ten blade.

442
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,035
Lap pads. Oh, boy.

443
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,043
- What?
- Lots of oozing.

444
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,118
Cross-clamping the aorta.

445
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,657
Cardioplegia going on. - Ice.

446
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:39,658
Opening the uterus.

447
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,264
Hang two units of packed cells.

448
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,413
Greater saphenous is isolated.

449
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,747
Cannulate, check for
leaks, then pass it up.

450
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,631
Banded scissors.

451
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,101
Cord is cut.

452
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,941
Come on, little
guy, give me a cry.

453
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,376
Pulse is less than 60.

454
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,893
Let's bag him. Intubation
tray, 3-0 ET tube.

455
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,997
Add 20 units Pit to the bag. Draw
up Methergine and Hemabate.

456
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,964
Twenty joules. - Charged.

457
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,472
Clear.

458
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,875
Sinus rhythm.

459
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,244
We have a pulse.

460
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,351
All right, Neela.

461
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,747
Hole punch for the
proximal, 5.0 Prolene.

462
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,818
I'm in. Ambu-bag.

463
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,824
Abruption clot.

464
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,091
Consumed all of
your clotting factors.

465
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,596
Uterus is not responding
to massage. Let's pack it off.

466
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,704
Draw up epi, .03.

467
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,763
- Holding compressions.
- Pulse up to 120.

468
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,619
Get ready to move.

469
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,191
- Damn it.
- What?

470
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,849
The uterus is boggy
and hemorrhagic.

471
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,791
The sutures are making
it worse, not better.

472
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,755
Nothing after 20 minutes.
She's not clotting at all.

473
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,264
Am I in DIC?

474
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,801
The FFP should reverse
that now that the baby's out.

475
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,404
- What if it doesn't?
- Pressure's down to 80/50.

476
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,565
All right, two more units.
We gotta control this bleeding.

477
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,872
- Go to the NICU.
- No, I'm staying.

478
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,569
- Stay with the baby.
- Abby.

479
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:12,207
Shut up, shut up, please, just shut
up. I want you to stay with the baby.

480
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,256
Try to ligate the
uterine arteries.

481
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,153
Go, I will call you
if we need you.

482
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,317
I don't want him to be alone.

483
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,934
This will help.

484
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,943
You see that one up there?

485
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,048
The real bright one?

486
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,741
Dead.

487
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,950
By the time we see
it, it's already gone.

488
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:30,524
We'll get him his insulin way
before he needs it. He'll be fine.

489
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:37,900
You know, Steve, I
was gonna ask you...

490
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:43,475
what happened to
you to turn you into this.

491
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,705
Then I realized...

492
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:56,151
it was always in the cards
from the moment that I met you.

493
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:02,360
You were on your way to becoming
exactly what you are right now.

494
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,096
I love him.

495
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,935
I know you don't believe that.

496
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:16,098
Especially right now.

497
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,376
But I do.

498
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,035
Yeah, you love him, right.

499
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:26,116
That's why you get some
woman to snatch him from school...

500
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,454
and tie him up and
leave him in a van.

501
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,223
You don't even
remember his medicine.

502
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,626
Hey, hey.

503
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,423
You're right to be pissed.

504
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,034
You're right.

505
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,227
It was my fault.

506
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:49,740
It was my fault for ever letting
us get separated in the first place.

507
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,245
But now we gotta stay together.

508
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,440
The three of us.

509
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,378
There's no other way.

510
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,756
I'd rather we were all dead.

511
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,621
Hey.

512
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,460
I don't want you
to be afraid of me.

513
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,941
You don't need to be
afraid of me anymore.

514
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:47,961
As long as we stay together,
you and Alex are safe.

515
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,815
Where are we in
factor replacement?

516
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:17,452
Four of red cells, two
units FFP, pack of platelets.

517
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,830
You've had
uterotonics, packing...

518
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,297
an O'Leary stitch
and a B-Lynch brace.

519
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,491
Still bleeding?

520
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,899
Blood has penetrated the
thickness of the uterine wall.

521
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,937
I don't know what else to do.

522
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,074
We can keep
waiting for you to clot.

523
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,337
Or we can start thinking
about a hysterectomy.

524
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:43,814
How long can we wait?

525
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,652
Too many transfusions
put you back into DIC.

526
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,226
And then the bleeding
gets even worse.

527
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,428
Last crit is 21.

528
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,966
Stay ahead two units.

529
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,247
Uh, Jerry is in recovery.

530
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,408
I thought you'd wanna know.

531
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:19,417
Um... Have we heard
anything about Sam?

532
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,116
No.

533
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:30,065
This is a scary place. I remember
the feeling just walking in.

534
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:36,302
I know your baby is a lot
sicker than Henry was...

535
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,807
but everything turned
out okay for my boy, Luka.

536
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,879
And I know that it
will for yours too.

537
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,285
Uh... They're concerned
about prolonged hypotension.

538
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,789
And, uh, he's on
100 percent oxygen.

539
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,157
So there's a risk of toxicity.

540
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,957
And...

541
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,236
Um...

542
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:15,236
They're going to, uh, do...

543
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:21,546
periodic, uh, ultrasounds to check
for intraventricular hemorrhage.

544
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,056
There's nothing more you
can do for him right now.

545
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,858
You should go be with Abby.

546
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,188
She doesn't want
him to be alone.

547
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,559
He won't be.

548
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,340
Okay, so Morris got
you through the ER.

549
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,843
The first circle of hell.

550
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:50,448
- And Neela got you through surgery.
- The second.

551
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,552
I guess it's up to me to
get myself through recovery.

552
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,711
Yeah, those are circles
three through nine.

553
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,824
Well, here's one way to
start, the incentive spirometer.

554
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,751
It'll keep you from
getting pneumonia.

555
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,340
Suck it to make the balls rise.

556
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,519
Twice an hour.

557
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,562
Do you know what time it is?

558
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:11,726
I've been out there watching the
same cable news over and over.

559
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,503
- Hey, Ma.
- I missed my water aerobics.

560
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,507
- You were supposed to take me.
- I know, I know.

561
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:27,684
<i>Oy, vey,</i> you gave me such
a scare, my <i>sheyn boytshik.</i>

562
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,055
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma, I'm sorry.

563
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,415
Oh, look at that,
look at that <i>punim.</i>

564
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,621
I'm...

565
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,574
- Hey.
- Hey.

566
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,442
- How's he doing?
- He's fine.

567
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,575
Still intubated?

568
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:01,015
Yeah, but, uh, he's
satting well, you know.

569
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:03,712
Pressure's holding
with dopamine.

570
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,947
He's making urine.

571
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,022
- Brain scan?
- Clear.

572
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,361
- Well, those are all good things.
- Yeah, all good things.

573
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,229
Is one gonna be enough?

574
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,441
What?

575
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,974
One baby.

576
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,610
Um...

577
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,116
My uterus wouldn't
stop bleeding...

578
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,276
and Coburn did
everything she could, but...

579
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,286
You had a hysterectomy?

580
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,469
Well, one is all we need.

581
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,180
So, um, I'm not gonna be
able to see him for a while.

582
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:11,255
I can't get to the NICU
for at least 24 hours.

583
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,223
You don't have
to wait that long.

584
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,771
That's when I told
him to wave to Mom.

585
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,875
Yeah, he's a smart one. - Ha-ha.

586
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,646
- Joseph.
- Hmm?

587
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,620
I don't remember much
about my dad, but, uh...

588
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,757
I remember when I was little,
he used to love to watch boxing.

589
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,230
And especially Joe Frazier...

590
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,768
because he thought he
was the best pure fighter, so...

591
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:13,078
I'd like to call him
Joe, if that's okay.

592
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,431
I'll be right back. Do
you need anything? Okay.

593
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,494
Steve.

594
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,657
Steve.

595
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,772
Steve, I have to pee.
