00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,313
You're a proponent on
the National Health Plan?

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:12,437
If we had one, this guy'd be home with
his kids instead of fighting for his life.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,037
That was gold.

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,774
I want these two out of my
O.R. Shirley, call Security.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,784
Nice working with you guys.
- Bovie. Stand back.

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,193
- Wanna hook up?
- Hook up?

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,453
Prep for the M and M. I'd give you
a heads-up before I kick your ass.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,116
Uh, is Tony there?

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,852
Sorry, he's busy right now.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,293
- Nobody here goes to the doctor?
- Hell, no.

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,765
I just don't know
how to fix this.

13
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,786
Yo, Dr. K.

14
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,289
Hey, hey. What's up, guys?

15
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,292
Oh, my God, he's
so cute. Hi, Joe.

16
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,623
Don't let the looks fool
you. He's a tough one.

17
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,957
Takes after his mom.

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,398
Ain't that the truth. Let
me give you a hand, doc.

19
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,797
Thanks.

20
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,269
Babysitter couldn't make it again.
We finally decided to hire a nanny.

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,305
My mom raised eight
kids all by herself.

22
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,443
- Don't know how she did it.
- She available?

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,670
- What about SBO guy?
- Waiting on Surgery.

24
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,906
- And your chemo boy in 4?
- Oncology about a half hour ago.

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,414
Who's this, the new chief of ER?

26
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,519
Yep, training him
so I can retire early.

27
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,314
Good. We could
use some new blood.

28
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,150
- I'm new.
- You're too old to be new, Gates.

29
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,752
Excuse me, Dr. Weaver. Hi,
Courtney Brown, Channel 5.

30
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,919
- You got a minute?
- No. Give me a half-inch.

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,157
The station loved you and
our segment that we did.

32
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,802
They've given us a green
light to do some more.

33
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,301
Wow, that sounds cool.

34
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,271
Yeah, I don't think so. I'm an
ER doc, not a TV personality.

35
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,667
Exactly what we're
looking for. Someone real.

36
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,506
You'd be really great. That
piece you did was so good.

37
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,545
You know what? Why
don't you take over?

38
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,809
Pack all four quadrants
and Dawn can help you.

39
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,715
- Wouldn't require much time.
- Gyn has a bed but can't take PID.

40
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,014
- Dr. Weaver, Radiology on 2.
- Gotta take this.

41
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,215
I get it, you're
swamped. I'll try later?

42
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,689
I think he has Abby's eyes.

43
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,794
- Yeah, and his dad's head.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,281
- Heh.
- What? He'll grow into it.

45
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,693
Could you guys keep an
eye on him for a minute?

46
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,632
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,033
Mr. Ames?

48
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,907
Luka.

49
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,201
Can I...? Can I help
you with something?

50
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,641
No, no.

51
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,407
Got a meeting with
Angela Gilliam upstairs.

52
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,914
Give me the other
bearing, Steve, would you?

53
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,211
That one should fit.

54
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,854
About my appeal.

55
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,721
- She didn't tell you?
- No, no.

56
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,381
Yeah.

57
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,857
Had to gather
some hospital files.

58
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,326
You're appealing the case?

59
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,894
Only if I have to.

60
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:49,901
You know, a settlement will save the
hospital a lot of time and a lot of money.

61
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,863
Look, this hasn't been
easy on any of us...

62
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,738
least of all you, but...

63
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,738
But what?

64
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:04,414
Maybe it's time to move
on. Put the past behind you.

65
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,887
I couldn't agree more.

66
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,424
I'm gonna hop up the stairs.

67
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,357
I'll see you around.

68
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,745
Can you smell my...?

69
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,645
You can't, but I can.

70
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:37,876
I can hear now.

71
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,418
I can smell it. I mean,
you can't smell it.

72
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,579
I can smell it.

73
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,925
I can smell it. I can smell it.

74
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,390
Tight. Keep that thing
pressed to your nose.

75
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,929
- When?
- I wouldn't.

76
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,163
- Real nice.
- Yeah, it's cool.

77
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,103
Score.

78
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:09,010
And the big top winner wins.

79
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,514
Go.

80
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,448
Win.

81
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,355
Hey.

82
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,052
Are those Hot Wheels?

83
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,625
- Want one?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,064
I got lots of Hot Wheels too.

85
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,625
What does this one have?

86
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,062
I don't know.

87
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,464
Number five.

88
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,275
- Ha-ha-ha. Beautiful.
- Get off the floor. Come on.

89
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,638
- Don't make me embarrass you.
- Mom, I'm racing.

90
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,142
Get over here now.

91
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,541
Come on.

92
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,578
Out of the way, man.

93
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,617
Hot oil. Third-degree
burns to the hands.

94
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,948
Let's go, let's go.

95
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,714
Exam 3's open.

96
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,985
You can't, but I can, you know.

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,061
I can smell them.

98
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,924
I can smell them.

99
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,127
I can smell them.
I can smell them.

100
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,830
I know you're coming for this.

101
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,909
Hey!

102
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,982
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but you got people waiting here.

103
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,755
You actually got any
doctors working back there?

104
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,017
What is it, golf day?

105
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,251
Sir, please sit down.

106
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,519
Don't "sir" me, bitch.

107
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,754
Just let me see a damn doctor.

108
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,421
Calm down or I'll call Security.

109
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,089
Oh, go. Oh, oh, oh, call them.

110
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,531
Go ahead. I'm right here. - Hey.

111
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,370
- What?
- Calm down now.

112
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,099
You are not the only
patient here, okay?

113
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,267
Yeah, I can see that.

114
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,436
I can see that.

115
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,438
- You sign in?
- Signed in what?

116
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,278
All I got is a
little congestion.

117
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,545
You think you morons
can handle that?

118
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,313
Fill this out.

119
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,027
Sit down and shut up. I'll
bring you back in a few minutes.

120
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,691
I just got the flu,
for God's sakes.

121
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,668
I wanna apologize in advance
for the smell in the break room.

122
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,467
- Luka changed Joe's diaper in there.
- How bad is it?

123
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,008
- We got a men's room.
- Not carrots? I hate carrots.

124
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,510
You know, I said I'm
sorry. My babysitter flaked.

125
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,511
I feel bad enough
dragging him in here.

126
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,582
Hey, has Radiology
called back yet?

127
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,809
I don't think so.

128
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,265
Excuse me.

129
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,354
I'm here to see Dr. Luka Kovac.

130
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,718
How long have you
been congested?

131
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,387
I don't know. Does it matter?

132
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,534
No, I'm just making
conversation.

133
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,396
About a month or so.

134
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,935
All right, what have we got?

135
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:47,006
Temp's 99. URI symptoms.

136
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,869
The flu.

137
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,874
Deep breath for me, please.

138
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,604
Get that damned thing
off of me, it's freezing.

139
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,715
I have to take a listen, sir.

140
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,283
I told you,
assholes, it's the flu.

141
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,183
Now, just give me some antibiotics
or something and let me out of here.

142
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,290
Listen, Prince Charming...

143
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,892
quicker we check you
out, the quicker you can go.

144
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,052
I need to check the
oxygen in your blood.

145
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,198
Part of the exam.

146
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,690
Omit that part.

147
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,631
All right, look.

148
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,861
You have the flu...

149
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,632
that's an easy fix,
then you can go home.

150
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,934
Believe me, I want you to go.

151
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,307
I need you to go.

152
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,415
Wow, Rio.

153
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,550
So Chicago must be a big change.
- Mm-hm.

154
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,379
Have you been
here for a winter yet?

155
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,214
No, but I love the cold.

156
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,084
In Brazil, it's always sunshine.

157
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,752
Jeez, that must have
been hard to manage.

158
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,955
Why did you leave your last job?

159
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,933
I didn't really like New York. I
wanted a change around the scenery.

160
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,431
Change of scenery. You
wanted change of scenery. Heh.

161
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,235
Ah. Sorry. My English...

162
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,968
I still make mistakes. Heh.

163
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,446
Great. Thanks for coming by.

164
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,982
Discipline. Discipline.

165
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,052
Especially with the little boys.

166
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,355
This is key.

167
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,189
Amway money ran out
along with my husband.

168
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,591
So I ask myself, "Jackie,
what do you love?"

169
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:19,290
Kids. Love kids.
Crazy little bastards.

170
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,867
Oh, hey. Can I smoke in here?

171
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:27,507
It was the best 10 years of
my life. I really loved those kids.

172
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:32,002
I don't wanna brag, but for
all the families I've worked for...

173
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,977
the kids always end up calling
me Mommy by the third week.

174
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,380
- Ha-ha.
- Okay, great. Thanks for coming by.

175
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,654
What, you get lost?

176
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,315
Seems to be a little
problem with your heart.

177
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,818
That from the flu?

178
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,988
Normal heart's about the size
of a fist. Yours is twice that big.

179
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,463
I don't think you have flu.

180
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,865
Your congestion, shortness of
breath, definitely because of your heart.

181
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,336
Sorry, couldn't
find the SonoSite.

182
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,008
How many times do I have to tell
you? Lay down, put the gown on.

183
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,668
- I ain't wearing that dress.
- Then lose the shirt.

184
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,146
You gonna at least
buy me dinner first?

185
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,220
Hey, you get in a lot of fights?
Have an accident or something?

186
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,983
You got what look
like old fractures.

187
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,751
A lot of them. Few ribs.

188
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,087
Collarbone. Your arm.

189
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,661
I was an active kid.

190
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,093
How about the scar
and those burns?

191
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,667
Yeah, well...

192
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,569
My pop had a
two-pack-a-day habit.

193
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,585
Whoa, he's got a
pericardial effusion.

194
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,789
- A what? SAM: Fluid
around your heart.

195
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,523
Restricts blood flow, makes
it hard for you to breathe.

196
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,066
IV, two of Ativan, set
up for pericardiocentesis.

197
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,933
Hang on. What are you doing?

198
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,906
We need to do a procedure where I place
a needle into the sac around your heart.

199
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,771
- It's no big deal.
- What?

200
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,574
No. No way.

201
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,079
- You need this procedure.
- No, I don't.

202
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,550
- Yes, you do. You could die.
- No. No, not a chance.

203
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,712
Son of a bitch.

204
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,992
Where'd you get the doctor
degree, through the mail?

205
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,431
Hey, get out while you can
before Kevorkian starts sticking you.

206
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,635
Let me the hell out of here!

207
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,237
Now!

208
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,281
What can we do
for you today, sir?

209
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,286
Need my cholesterol
prescription filled.

210
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,255
Cholesterol, silent killer.
It's good you're being vigilant.

211
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,452
Dr. Wong from the Family Medical
Center prescribed this for you?

212
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,997
- And why didn't you go back to her?
- They can't take me for a few months.

213
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,362
Supposed to get a blood
test to check my liver...

214
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,935
You need to see Dr. Wong.

215
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,369
I'll call up, make sure they know
to give you an earlier appointment.

216
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,305
Doc, please. I don't know
when I can take another day off.

217
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,310
I work two jobs. I got his
grandma watching him all the time.

218
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,812
I'll call now and let them
know you're coming over.

219
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:25,509
Hope, please discharge Mr. Batista
and point him to the Family Center.

220
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,655
Hey, Morris, why is
Grasso still in Curtain 2?

221
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,289
Vertigo guy is still here?

222
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,324
You know, mine felt better after
meclizine. OTD in 45 minutes.

223
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,985
It's a first shift in a month
he hasn't killed anybody.

224
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,064
- My case is more complicated.
- He have an abnormal neural exam?

225
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,201
I just have a clinical hunch,
okay? Takes years to develop.

226
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,666
CT results from Radiology.

227
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,395
That for your vertigo guy?

228
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,141
It's normal, isn't it?

229
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,976
And we can all sleep a
bit better tonight, can't we?

230
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,841
Sam, could you get something
from the drug-sample closet?

231
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,175
There's limited samples.
Ask an Attending to...

232
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,080
Dr. Weaver asked me to
get it for one of her patients.

233
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,548
Oh, okay.

234
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,986
No, yeah, it's
Batista. B-A-T-I-S-T-A.

235
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,819
Okay, thank you.

236
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,655
That TV news girl,
Courtney Brown, called again.

237
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,229
Whoa, Channel 5 Courtney
Brown? What did she want?

238
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,332
She offered me a
job as a reporter.

239
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,865
What, you?

240
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,094
Of course you. What did you say?

241
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,327
I turned it down.

242
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,735
Turned down a chance to
be the next Sanjay Gupta?

243
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:21,931
Are you insane, woman?

244
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,203
I have no interest in fluff pieces
about sunburns and bee stings.

245
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,940
What's wrong? Half the patients
that come are fluff. I'm the king of fluff.

246
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,583
You're the best fluffer in town.

247
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,776
Hey, Hope, you ready
for the fecal impaction?

248
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,011
Sure am.

249
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,263
Ha.

250
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,092
This is an extremely
uncommon error.

251
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,699
Our personnel were clearly
distracted by the ongoing debate.

252
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,896
Reason why ER docs
should remain in the ER.

253
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,769
I know ER sounds a
lot like O.R., but it's not.

254
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,776
Our guys were there trying to
keep you from making mistakes.

255
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,881
Based on the information, our
decision to operate was correct.

256
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,608
You know what, you didn't
have sufficient information...

257
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,447
because you didn't allow
us to complete an evaluation.

258
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,079
This isn't a witch-hunt. We're here to
learn from our mistakes and improve.

259
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,486
You mean, their mistakes.

260
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,891
Okay, let's not forget that
we're on the same team here.

261
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,725
Oh, Dr. Gates, come on in.

262
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,301
- You missed the case presentation.
- Sorry, I had a patient.

263
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,993
You know, sorry. I just gotta...

264
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,901
No, that's okay. Timely
enough, Dr. Gates. No need to sit.

265
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,302
Come on down.

266
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,809
Why don't you tell us what
the differential diagnosis was...

267
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,073
when this patient presented?

268
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,912
Um... Triple A was
on the top of our list...

269
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,384
but there were
other possibilities.

270
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,822
Should have stayed a Resident.

271
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,255
No responsibilities, just
heal them and deal them.

272
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,826
That was the life.

273
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,428
Morris?

274
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,087
- Can I tell you something as a friend?
- Hmm.

275
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,129
Sometimes you
are such a little bitch.

276
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,429
You make three
times as much as I do.

277
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,664
And for what? To give
orders instead of take them?

278
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,036
Boo-hoo for you.

279
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,268
Mr. Batista.

280
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,436
We got a double coming.
Might wanna jump on.

281
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,774
I'll be right there,
Dr. Morris. Mr. Batista, wait.

282
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,209
I called the Family Care Center.
They can't take you for a month.

283
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,786
I'm very sorry about
all that. The system's...

284
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,119
Well, it needs work.

285
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:23,059
Lovastatin. Thirty pills,
20 milligrams each.

286
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,292
Shh. This should hold you
till your next appointment.

287
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,369
- Thanks a lot. HARMS:
I got a present for you.

288
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,560
This is us, Hope.

289
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,469
Unidentified male, early
20s, altercation on a bus...

290
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,370
blunt trauma to
the chest and face.

291
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,807
Ray, Malik, you take
this. Trauma 2 is open.

292
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,207
Sam, Hope, you're with me.

293
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,976
He's tachy in the 120s,
resps in the 30s, BP, 104/56.

294
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,018
CBC, IV, type
and cross. Let's go.

295
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,191
Fred Douglas, 38, blunt
trauma to the face with epistaxis.

296
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,485
- Son of a bitch broke my nose.
- Keep pressure.

297
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,922
He was yelling at some lady.

298
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,087
I tell him to shut up, next thing
you know, he's throwing punches.

299
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,225
How you doing in there, Ray?
- I'm doing good.

300
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,393
Could probably use a
hand when you're done.

301
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,198
Guy I got in a fight with, I
didn't hurt him bad, did I?

302
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,670
HemoCue's 12.8.

303
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,777
First, we look for an obvious source
of bleeding that can be cauterized.

304
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:16,613
Is it broken, doc?
It sure fee... Ugh.

305
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,681
God bless you.

306
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,683
Snuck up on me. Sorry.

307
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,583
You need a definitive
triple A diagnosis...

308
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,550
before committing an unstable
patient to major surgery.

309
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,558
Mortality ruptured
triple A, 90 percent.

310
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,789
- We don't have time for tests.
- Ultrasound can be done at the bedside.

311
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,364
Theoretically. Not in this ER.

312
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,934
Every textbook and
print says this patient...

313
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,367
Ultrasound in ER is
new, not in every textbook.

314
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,031
- Studies show it's very accurate.
- Ignore experience because a new toy?

315
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,540
People die with delays.

316
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,234
Valentine paper, 1993...

317
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,143
found that most patients without triple
A's still need surgery for one thing...

318
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,749
Most, not all.

319
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,113
With severe heart failure,
surgery can be fatal.

320
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,948
Guy's lucky all you
did was torch him.

321
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,056
You could've killed him.

322
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:05,096
Okay. What is your experience
in the ER with bedside ultrasound?

323
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,994
It's been going
on for a few years.

324
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,398
He's cute, but I hear
he lives with somebody.

325
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,594
Really?

326
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,171
I think he has a kid.

327
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,970
With final radiology interpretation,
no significant clinical disagreements.

328
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,147
What about for a
triple A, specifically?

329
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,184
Uh... Heh. I don't
know, exactly.

330
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,349
Though finding a gallstone is one
thing, ruptured aneurysm, quite another.

331
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,758
Well, if we'd seen a normal
aorta with an enlarged liver...

332
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,161
we would've saved the
guy the risk of surgery.

333
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,997
- You couldn't do it in a reasonable time.
- We weren't given a reasonable time.

334
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,002
He was unstable,
surgery was necessary.

335
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,370
- Lighting the guy on fire was necessary?
- A Bovie wasn't grounded.

336
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,599
- Whose fault?
- Yours.

337
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,837
Shouldn't even been in O.R. You
were there being a pain in the ass.

338
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,778
- We have protocols. You interfered.
- Our duty doesn't end.

339
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,850
Okay, okay. That's
enough. That's enough.

340
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,213
Thank you, Dr. Gates.

341
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,991
I think we can all see what
the real problem is here.

342
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,818
Providing the best care
requires communicating openly.

343
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,124
And when we fail to
do that, lives are lost.

344
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,166
I think that's something we can
all learn from today's M and M.

345
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,064
<i>Crenshaw is such a little prick.</i>

346
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,535
You know what? I bet
I could take him too.

347
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,903
I definitely think I could take
him, and you could kick his ass.

348
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,634
- Luka.
- You're scaring me.

349
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,336
I was looking for you.
Sorry I didn't get back earlier.

350
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,483
- Angela, you remember Abby?
- Sure. Nice to see you back at work.

351
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,811
Nice to be back.

352
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,148
So I probably should have warned
you Curtis Ames was coming in.

353
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,313
Okay, what's all this
about settlement?

354
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,822
There is no settlement.

355
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,358
We agreed to the meeting
as a show of good faith...

356
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,428
in case we went back to trial.

357
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,189
But don't worry, the
appeal's never gonna happen.

358
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,596
Ames can't even find a
lawyer to take the case.

359
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,102
- We're not settling. It's over.
- Good.

360
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,500
All right, what do we got?

361
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,232
Okay, hypotensive secondary...

362
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,936
to what looks like a
traumatic pericardial effusion.

363
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,004
Wow, guy's got a lot
of fluid around his heart.

364
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,241
Looks like I'm gonna
do a pericardiocentesis.

365
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,885
BP's still dropping, 88/52.

366
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:09,420
- So weird, I had one this morning.
- Okay, Malik, set me up.

367
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,888
- How's your guy?
- Just a bloody nose.

368
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,118
You say there's something
wrong with my heart?

369
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,352
He's awake.

370
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,930
Sir, I'm Dr. Morris,
Attending physician.

371
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,863
Wait a minute, it's
you, from this morning.

372
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,525
- You know him?
- Yeah... No, no.

373
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,865
You were here earlier?

374
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,973
No, I wasn't.

375
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,700
- Hey, Sam?
- Yeah?

376
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,710
He's our AMA patient
from this morning, right?

377
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,683
Yeah, the flu jerk.

378
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,452
I don't know what you
people are talking about.

379
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,686
I don't have the flu.

380
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,989
And I've never been here before.

381
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,230
Joe. Hey, what's it gonna be?

382
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,769
Good-looking Brazilian
or big mean Russian? Ooh.

383
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,840
Joe...

384
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,900
Okay. Go home.

385
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,705
Say bye.

386
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,072
Bye.

387
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,424
We use an ultrasound to see...

388
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,093
while we insert the needle into
the pericardial sac to drain the blood.

389
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,967
You use sound to see?

390
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,932
That's fascinating.

391
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,475
Just like bats and dolphins.

392
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,644
It'll release the pressure on your
heart, make it easier to breathe.

393
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,410
And I won't feel a thing?

394
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,280
Not a thing.

395
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,788
- Can I watch?
- Yeah, sure.

396
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,154
Okay, cool.

397
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,796
Oh, come on.

398
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,425
This morning, bats-and-dolphins
here was ready to rip my head off.

399
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,502
- What are you trying to pull, buddy?
- Why is he so angry?

400
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,536
Prep his chest, have
two of Versed ready.

401
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,642
Mr. Payton, we'll be right
back. Morris, can we talk?

402
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,201
Morris.

403
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,948
I don't know what his game is...

404
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,313
His game is he's kooky from a blow
to his head. He could be amnestic.

405
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,477
He's gotta be on
something. He's different.

406
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,646
Give the guy a break.
He got his ass kicked.

407
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,724
He didn't want that
procedure this morning.

408
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,191
Maybe he's really pissed off at
you, Archie. Wouldn't be the first time.

409
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,295
Now, I know this may
sound a little corny...

410
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:39,133
but I always catch more flies
with honey, you know what I mean?

411
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,146
That's good. That's good, Ray.

412
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,544
I like that approach.

413
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,483
You'll make a great
Attending someday, my man.

414
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,713
I'm sorry, I know my
wallet's in here somewhere.

415
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,650
Damn it. AMES: I got that.

416
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,024
- And can I get a Polish please?
- No, that's okay.

417
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,596
Don't worry. I insist, really.

418
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,597
It's not necessary, really.

419
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,498
Well, you got your hands
full. It's the least I could do.

420
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,693
It's just a hot dog.

421
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:17,275
My mama taught me random acts of
kindness make the world a better place.

422
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,746
Well, I can't argue
with that. Thank you.

423
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,180
- What is he, about 6 months?
- Five and a half.

424
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,513
- He's really cute.
- He's got pipes you wouldn't believe.

425
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,919
Are you driving your
mom crazy? No, no.

426
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,187
Hoo. Hoo.

427
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,261
Frog. Ribbit.

428
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,300
This one yours?

429
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,901
Here you go.

430
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,135
- Excuse me, Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah.

431
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,746
Something is weighing on my
heart, and I just can't take it anymore.

432
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,609
What's the problem?

433
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,411
I gave Oscar Batista
Lovastatin samples.

434
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,987
That sweet, hard-working man, I
was afraid he would stop taking pills...

435
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,590
and come back here with
a heart attack or stroke...

436
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:06,987
- Hope.
- That little boy.

437
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,094
Reminded me how
moved I was by your piece.

438
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,163
- Thought some act of kindness might...
- Okay, okay, okay.

439
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,664
- And please forgive me, doctor...
- Okay, okay, stop.

440
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,594
You did a good thing.

441
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,832
Really.

442
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,269
There might be
hope for you, Hope.

443
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,684
You told me those drug samples
were for Dr. Weaver's patient.

444
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:39,152
Well, they were, technically.

445
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,123
Well, technically,
you lied to me.

446
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,161
There are rules for breaking
the rules, and rule number one...

447
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,300
is that you never, ever lie
to the nurses, you got me?

448
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,594
I'm so sorry.

449
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,535
<i>Fell off a ladder at work.</i>

450
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,936
Dude wasn't paying attention,
so I had to pay the price.

451
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,872
Oh, sounds like a dangerous job.

452
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:01,070
No, carpenter.

453
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,813
It's tough doing it
with one arm, though.

454
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,612
Well, sprains
heal pretty quickly.

455
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,152
Yeah, that's what they
told me at the hospital.

456
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,625
Uh... I'm headed
for the red line.

457
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,954
Oh, I'm headed this way.

458
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,460
Well...

459
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,405
- Nice to meet you.
- Ha-ha. You too.

460
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,662
- And thank you for the hot dog.
- It's my pleasure.

461
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,738
Catch you later, Joe. Ha-ha.

462
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,488
Hey, any messages
for me yet, Frank?

463
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:48,094
No, Morris, the TV-producer
lady has not called back yet.

464
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,662
You ask me one more time, I'm gonna
slap you so hard you turn brunette.

465
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,991
Have you got that?

466
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,363
- Position's been filled.
- What position?

467
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,834
Stop calling the station.
I'm getting complaints.

468
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,735
Oh, that position,
right. They filled it, huh?

469
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,739
- Mm-hm.
- Who did they find so fast?

470
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,435
- Me.
- You? I thought you turned it down.

471
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,341
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

472
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:12,417
Figured it was about time someone
put something worthwhile on television.

473
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,778
So, Smitty, how long
you had the rash?

474
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,583
About two weeks now.

475
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,021
- Got any food allergies?
- No.

476
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,684
- You on any medications?
- Just my blood-pressure pills.

477
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,523
All right, come on. Have a seat.

478
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,293
What kind of pills?

479
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,432
Right.

480
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,138
Oh, you see, that's the problem.
Rash is a common reaction to enalapril.

481
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,366
Who prescribed these?

482
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,034
Doc up at the clinic put me
on them about 10 years ago.

483
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,372
This and something else.

484
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:43,243
- Ten years ago? Who gave you these?
- Mm-hm.

485
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,741
See, my man, T-bone. You know T.

486
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:49,320
Smitty, you can't take other people's
medications, man. It's not safe.

487
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,423
- Everybody does it.
- Everybody who?

488
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,493
Up at First Mission Baptist, Pastor
Watkins does a drug-exchange program.

489
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,993
You come up there sometime,
man gives a powerful...

490
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,392
Okay, hold on, hold on.

491
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,329
He does a drug-exchange program?

492
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,765
Hell, yeah. I ain't
got insurance.

493
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,999
You know how
much this stuff costs?

494
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,435
You can't possibly think
ultrasound was contraindicated.

495
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,946
- I do if it can't be done immediately.
- Could've told me before M and M.

496
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,244
Didn't realize I had to
point out the obvious.

497
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:20,442
I can't win with you.

498
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,499
- Oh. Finally, we agree on something.
- Finally.

499
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,678
- Yes.
- Yes.

500
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,085
Don't take piss out of me.

501
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,452
- Piss? Piss?
- Yes. Yes.

502
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,118
Yup, you've got a nice fluid
pocket. This is gonna be a snap.

503
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,129
Sam, draw up
some 1 percent lido.

504
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,656
Whoa.

505
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,997
- You're gonna feel a pinch.
- Okay, before I start, just a few things.

506
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,368
- I don't want a shot.
- Main risks here, bleeding and infection.

507
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,009
You could infect my heart?

508
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:47,340
Sterile technique makes it unlikely.
- Mickey, calm down.

509
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,106
No. Aah.

510
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:53,878
Look, what about bleeding? I
have trepidation about bleeding.

511
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,455
Well, it's only a minor risk, because
we're using such a small needle.

512
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,490
Well, not so small, but thin.

513
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,889
And you'll be all numbed
up so you won't feel a thing.

514
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,555
- Relax.
- No, no. Stop it.

515
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,200
Okey-dokey, let's do this.

516
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,566
Get that thing away
from me, you clown.

517
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,676
I told you, I don't want that.

518
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,040
- You agreed to the procedure.
- Screw that.

519
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,340
Mr. Payton.

520
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,678
And stop calling me that.
My name's Clyde Sandberg.

521
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:29,413
You people got short-term
memory loss or something?

522
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,017
Huh?

523
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,987
- You ambushed me.
- You were spewing absurdities.

524
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,924
- Do you not like me?
- You're a wanker.

525
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,224
- A wanker. Ouch.
- Yeah, you're cocky, arrogant.

526
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,526
- And you're not smooth as you think.
- I'm not?

527
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,397
- No, you're not.
- I never said I was.

528
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
- Mm.
- Mm.

529
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:57,506
I called the other night
and a woman answered.

530
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,845
Yeah, I can explain that.

531
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,953
Now would be a good time.

532
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:21,572
Here, here, bats-and-dolphins
guy, I figured it out.

533
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,239
- It's DID.
- What?

534
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,571
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

535
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,476
Multiple personalities?
Psych make that diagnosis?

536
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,412
No, I paged them.
They haven't come.

537
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,610
So this is based off of what? Your
extensive psychiatric expertise?

538
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,414
No, he's a classic presentation.

539
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,251
Old abuse injuries,
keeps changing his name.

540
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,484
Maybe it's you that
needs a psych evaluation.

541
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,289
No, I'm serious, Ray. We
have to double-doctor this guy.

542
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,456
Listen, he keeps refusing
treatment, that effusion will kill him.

543
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:51,092
Who knows how long Psych will take?
By the time their Resident sees him...

544
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,501
they present to the
Attending, could be hours.

545
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,504
Double-doctoring,
that's a big deal.

546
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,472
Can't we treat with
NSAIDs and steroids?

547
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,943
He's refusing vital treatment. And
that is grounds for a double-doctor.

548
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,513
Come on, get with me here.

549
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,980
- What, so I'm back on the case now?
- Yeah.

550
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,618
Huh.

551
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,617
Look, I'll tell you what.

552
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,312
I'll talk to him.

553
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:14,449
I'll try and get some sort of read,
but maybe you should hang back.

554
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,118
You already pissed
him off enough today.

555
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:26,136
So I have a few
questions for you.

556
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,638
Can you tell me what day it is?

557
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,907
Thursday.

558
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,645
Month and year?

559
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,774
You know, they got this new
thing out called a calendar.

560
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,315
My freaking God.

561
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,958
November, 2006.

562
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,019
- Do you know where you are?
- What is this, <i>Romper Room?</i>

563
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:54,963
I see stupid and
retard and jerk-off.

564
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,695
I'm at County General Hospital.

565
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,402
- I'm not double-doctoring.
- He's gonna get worse.

566
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,633
He's hypotensive with
reduced cardiac output.

567
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,334
He hates doctors,
especially you.

568
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,638
You wanna tie him, stick
a needle in his chest?

569
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,339
- If it'll save his life, hell, yeah.
- Ha-ha. I am out, Archie.

570
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,881
Fine, I'll get somebody else.

571
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,382
Hey, Pratt.

572
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:14,884
No, no, no. <i>Hasta la</i> bye-bye.

573
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,045
Pratt, I need you to sign
off on a double-doctor.

574
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,653
- Got a foster kid?
- No, he's a competent adult.

575
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:23,193
Got pericardial effusion
and doesn't want treatment.

576
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,558
Morris wants to get
medieval because he thinks...

577
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,223
- I think he's DID.
- Multiple personalities.

578
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,028
Yeah, I know.
What did Psych say?

579
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,329
They're MIA.

580
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,199
You know that
multiple personality...

581
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,204
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

582
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:39,243
- Yeah, some docs don't think it exists.
- There's ton of literature to support it.

583
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,846
- Okay, his vitals?
- Systolic's holding in the 90s.

584
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,880
- And mental status?
- Alert and oriented.

585
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,108
Tox screen and CT?

586
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,284
Clear.

587
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:51,123
Gotta treat him conservatively.
Wait for Psych, it's their call.

588
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,758
You want me to be thorough.
That's what I'm doing.

589
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,054
Pratt, listen to me
for one second. Pratt.

590
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,791
If patient presents within a week of
surgery, it's considered bounce-back.

591
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,228
Make sure bounce-backs...

592
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,029
Hey, can I speak
to you for a sec?

593
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,899
Wound seroma. Removing the
staples and packing the dermis.

594
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,632
I wasn't actually
talking to you.

595
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,070
Oh. Um...

596
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,410
Okay, go ahead.
I'll just get started.

597
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,876
So how's Surgery treating you?

598
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,418
Like a stepchild.

599
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,316
Radiology's looking
better every day.

600
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:26,822
It'll be over soon enough. I
hated my surgical rotation, anyway.

601
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,722
So do you like hockey?

602
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,822
Tonsil or ice?

603
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,825
- Ice.
- Oh.

604
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,735
Mm. Too bad.

605
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,440
But, yeah, I'll settle
for a Hawks game.

606
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,585
He's still refusing treatment?

607
00:30:55,454 --> 00:31:00,688
Last BP was 84/50, and he's
developed <i>pulsus paradoxus.</i>

608
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,056
I found his old file.

609
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:12,803
Willis Payton is his real name,
probably be the host personality.

610
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,169
This Clyde character
must be one of his alters.

611
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,812
He was here a bunch of
times between '88 and '96.

612
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:24,279
Foster kid, abuse-related
injuries, some bad ones too.

613
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,578
It's classic DID history.

614
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,981
Psych's still a no-show?

615
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,660
I know everybody down
here thinks I'm a joke.

616
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:47,462
You know, if Pratt said
DID, he'd be a genius.

617
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:55,103
But I know that
I'm right about this.

618
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:00,609
And all I can do is suck
on it and watch this guy die.

619
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,324
You did what you could.

620
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,054
And you're not a joke, Archie.

621
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,694
You're an Attending.

622
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,160
Thank you.

623
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,843
Was a time when that
mountain seemed so high...

624
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,508
like it stretched up to the
pearly gates themselves.

625
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:41,024
Promised land seemed like an idea,
like no matter how hard we worked...

626
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,286
it was only sand
between our fingers.

627
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,257
But we're still here.

628
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,925
Proud and strong, Lord
have mercy, we're still here.

629
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,594
But we got a whole
lot of work to do.

630
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,800
Because the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

631
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,467
Young brother in the back.

632
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,711
You're new. Stand up
and introduce yourself.

633
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,651
No, no, you. Ha-ha-ha.

634
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,916
Evening, everyone.
I'm Greg Pratt.

635
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,148
Welcome, brother Pratt.

636
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,226
Come up front. Nice to see young
folk in the evening service, ain't it?

637
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,392
Your heart's getting
worse, you know.

638
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,166
Here we go again.

639
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,668
No. You need me to spell it?

640
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,400
If you keep refusing treatment,
it's gonna go down one of two ways.

641
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:34,137
One, doctors are gonna come in
here, tie you down and do the procedure.

642
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,905
They can't touch
me, I got rights.

643
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,745
Or two, we get to watch you die.

644
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,750
Fun for you.

645
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,118
There's a third option.

646
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:49,819
You give consent, we fix
your heart and you go home.

647
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,431
All we wanna do is help.

648
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,296
Yeah, you've been
loads of help so far.

649
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:08,236
- I know you're scared.
- No, I ain't scared of nothing.

650
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,842
I know you've been hurt...

651
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,943
a lot.

652
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,684
But you are safe here.

653
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:24,862
I know you don't wanna
trust us, but you can.

654
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,396
I promise.

655
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,816
I was...

656
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,319
Was...

657
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,825
Was I sleeping?

658
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,519
No.

659
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,599
I lost time.

660
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,830
I lost time again.

661
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,667
Willis?

662
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,936
Yeah?

663
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,308
Clyde's been giving
us a hard time.

664
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,950
Oh.

665
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,850
I thought he was gone.

666
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,956
You know about Clyde?

667
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,859
Yeah.

668
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,021
My friends told me about him.

669
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,825
He's very negative.

670
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,867
Well, Clyde doesn't
want us to help you.

671
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,135
So all we could do was
give you some medicine...

672
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:47,210
but that's not working too well.

673
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,972
Um... Wha...?

674
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,776
Can you...?

675
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,377
Can you still fix me?

676
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,582
Willis, I need
Clyde's permission.

677
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:01,056
I can't make him
do anything. I can't.

678
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,492
We can't start and stop
again. We're running out of time.

679
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,722
No.

680
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,661
No, no, no.

681
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,591
No.

682
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,161
Willis.

683
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,101
Damn it, let me talk
to Clyde right now.

684
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,004
Do not make me hurt
you. Let me talk to Clyde.

685
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,805
How many times I gotta
tell you to get off me, bitch?

686
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,005
Huh? How many times? Huh?

687
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,916
I saw Willis.

688
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,618
- He's letting us do the procedure.
- He's a pansy.

689
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:35,455
Yeah, well, he's brave enough
to let us stick a needle in his heart.

690
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,961
Piss off, bitch.

691
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:40,922
Fine.

692
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,592
You be a tough guy all the
way to your funeral. I'm done.

693
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,696
Hey.

694
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,642
You stick my heart, that
means I get out of here, right?

695
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,282
Yup.

696
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:02,954
Do it. I told you, I
ain't scared of nothing.

697
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:08,792
The drug-exchange program is only
for people who have prescriptions...

698
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,485
but can't afford the drugs.

699
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,632
Smitty's prescription was 10
years old, and he had enalapril.

700
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:18,395
Enalapril is not the first drug of choice
for black folks with high blood pressure.

701
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,199
Look, I suggest that you
start an exercise program.

702
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:25,241
Get your congregation to stop eating
salt and fried foods and start exercising.

703
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,413
Trust me, you'll do a
whole lot more good.

704
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,913
We don't just help people
with high blood pressure.

705
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,313
We have diabetics,
asthmatics, you name it.

706
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:36,319
Look, what you're doing
is dangerous, okay?

707
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,922
Not to mention illegal.

708
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,827
I have an obligation to
this community, Dr. Pratt.

709
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,261
These people are shackled by a
system over which they have no control.

710
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,869
- Yeah.
- The one thing I will not do is nothing.

711
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,427
Excuse me, Dr. Morris?

712
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,097
- Can I ask your advice on something?
- Yeah.

713
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:01,042
I lied to Samantha about something,
and now she's really steamed.

714
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,339
Oh, bad move.

715
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:05,245
Piss one nurse off, piss
them all off, like the Mafia.

716
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,215
You know, whenever I'm
in a precarious situation...

717
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,720
I always ask myself,
"What would Jesus do?"

718
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,449
Right.

719
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,357
What would Jesus do
if the nurses hated him?

720
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:20,397
Well, he would do the
right thing, of course.

721
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,535
That's the problem. See, I
thought I was doing the right thing.

722
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,694
I guess I just did
it the wrong way.

723
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,305
Hey, the story of my life.

724
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:33,474
You know, sometimes it doesn't
matter how much we kick and scream.

725
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,908
Even when we're right.

726
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:40,315
The prophet is without
honor in his own land.

727
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,487
Matthew 13:54.

728
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,749
Oh, I love that one.
Big Matthew fan.

729
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,461
You have a good
night, Dr. Morris.

730
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,839
Feeling better?

731
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,980
Drained half a liter of fluid
from around your heart.

732
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,515
Blood pressure and
pulse are back to normal.

733
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,950
Soon as a bed opens up,
we'll get you upstairs to a room.

734
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,291
So you're doing great.

735
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,960
You got my glasses?

736
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,301
Let me check. Yeah.

737
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,434
Okay.

738
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,347
That kid gonna be okay?

739
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,292
Who?

740
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,489
Yeah. I'm sure he is.

741
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,188
Looks like he's leaving.

742
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,632
He was racing a Hot Wheels.

743
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,703
His mom, she was mean.

744
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,191
Um...

745
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,423
Willis?

746
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,127
My name's Andre.

747
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,068
I like Hot Wheels.

748
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:50,209
I wish his mom wasn't so mean.

749
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,654
Hey, hey.

750
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:03,053
Don't tell my dad
I'm here, okay?

751
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,253
He can be pretty mean too.

752
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,033
Yeah.

753
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,598
Your secret's safe with me.

754
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,034
Okay?

755
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,269
It's kind of dark in here.

756
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:27,745
You're not gonna leave, are you?

757
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,189
No.

758
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,417
No way, buddy, no.

759
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,084
I'm here all night.

760
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,291
That's good.

761
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,647
So, what kind of
Hot Wheels you got?

762
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,652
All kinds. I collect them.

763
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,947
Yeah?

764
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:05,515
I used to collect them too.

765
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,354
What kind you got?

766
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:13,429
I used to have a '57 Chevy.

767
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:16,261
- Heh. I got that one.
- You got that.

768
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,096
Shelby Cobra.

769
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,430
Got it.

770
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,630
Okay, all right.

771
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:24,537
'65 Mustang Fastback.

772
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,938
Heh. I got two.

773
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,012
- You got two?
- Yeah.

774
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,513
Wow.

775
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,817
I used to have three, but
I gave one to my friend.

776
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:38,218
You'll have to give one to me. I
don't think I have mine anymore.

777
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,290
Okay, I'll give it to you.

778
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,450
What else did you have?
