1
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,029
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,926
- We're closing down.
- It's only temporary.

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,672
How do you know? Old boys run
around here, checking for cracks...

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,244
and now we're
having some dinner.

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,780
Probably just wants
to boost morale.

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,179
How are we affording a
fancy place? It's not Ladokern.

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,684
- Finally get things sorted out with Neela?
- There's nothing to sort out, man.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,900
Neela, I want you to say hi to Mae Lee
Park. She's our new surgical med student.

9
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,602
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- I've heard a lot about you.

10
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:29,290
I can smell a wedding a mile
away, Archie. It's like a sixth sense.

11
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,983
It's in your eyes. You have the
glow. I can't wait for the glow.

12
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,114
I can't wait to try on
wedding dresses with...

13
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:34,431
Hope!

14
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,955
If you tell
anyone I'll kill you.

15
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh, man, what you swinging at?

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,905
We're closed.

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,474
Yeah, I work here.

18
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:19,306
Then you ought to know the ER
is shut down until further notice.

19
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,538
I'm an R3.

20
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,649
I left something in
my locker. You mind?

21
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,748
Go on. You might need this.

22
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:15,962
Yeah, just a second.

23
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,595
Come on, Mayday, we're
gonna miss the canapÃ©s.

24
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,672
- What are you doing here?
- I thought we'd go together.

25
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,938
Oh.

26
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,942
Or not. Wow.

27
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,349
You look, uh... Wow.

28
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,319
Listen, I know things have
been a bit crazy with me.

29
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:42,395
- And our relationship is undefined, but...
- Yeah, we should talk.

30
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,827
Ahem. Yeah, maybe...

31
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,028
I don't know, maybe
we could talk at dinner?

32
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,033
Yeah. Uh...

33
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,170
Let me just get my stuff.

34
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,820
Why are we here so early?

35
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,483
Well, I'm the chief.

36
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,822
I thought I should
be here first.

37
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,055
Were the chief.

38
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,359
Well, consider this
my last official act.

39
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,059
The department dinner is here?

40
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,363
Yup.

41
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,872
Haven't been in a neighborhood
like this since I tried to score crack.

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,879
- Budget cuts are getting serious.
- Come on, it's different.

43
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,107
That's for sure.

44
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:39,344
See this? Pretty cool, huh?

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,544
Is this a restaurant?

46
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,591
No, no, it's a rental space.

47
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,228
- A patient told me about it.
- Oh.

48
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,957
And was she, by any
chance, a porn star?

49
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,534
- He is a music producer.
- Oh.

50
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,432
So it is a drug den.

51
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,596
Since when did these
things get so formal?

52
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,242
- It's fun, people like to dress up...
- Good evening.

53
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,438
Dr. Kovac,
Dr. Bobeck's in back...

54
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,604
and she needs you to make a
decision about the centerpieces.

55
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,615
- Hi. Big night, huh?
- Hi.

56
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,116
What's he talking about?

57
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,744
Hope is here. She
helped set everything up.

58
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,617
What do you mean,
"helped set everything up"?

59
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,255
What do you think?

60
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:27,029
Yay, yay, yay!

61
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,566
A wedding. ABBY: No.

62
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,815
- You the bride?
- Nope.

63
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,598
- Sophie, her dad's the caterer.
- No.

64
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,468
- She's your flower girl.
- Like hell.

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,074
Abby.

66
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,643
You're kidding me, right?
You gotta be kidding me.

67
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,337
- Can we just please talk?
- How do I get out of here?

68
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,778
You're just nervous.
It saves you the stress.

69
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,817
- Do you think I look unstressed...?
- The cake's coming up.

70
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,750
- Where you want it?
- Check with Hope.

71
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,481
How could you imagine
I'd wanna do it like this?

72
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,320
Planning was freaking you.
It's ripping off a Band-Aid.

73
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,122
Oh, man, you really know
how to melt a girl's heart.

74
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,855
This is something we both want.

75
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:02,297
- Oh... Luka, it's crazy.
- We can do something for families later.

76
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,598
- Tonight is for us.
- Yeah, and a bunch of people from work?

77
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,173
- Our friends.
- What about the food, the music?

78
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,833
It's like getting married
in a Meat Loaf video.

79
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,209
- I took care of everything, Hope helped.
- It's like a labyrinth.

80
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,815
Hey, hey, hey.

81
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,611
I love you, you love me.

82
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,685
Let's make it forever.

83
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,385
Let's get married.

84
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,234
ER rocks.

85
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,809
Party like New
Year's in Mozambique.

86
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,843
Looks like somebody
already started.

87
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,207
Mm-hm. Which way is the bar?

88
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,941
- Back there. MARQUEZ:
I hope they got margaritas.

89
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,712
I need me an apple martini,
something strong and stiff.

90
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,651
I'll race you to that martini.
- Oh, there's the bar.

91
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,154
- Luka...
- Give me 10 minutes.

92
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:00,317
Hey, hey, 10 minutes. Let
me show you what I've done.

93
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,658
If you don't like it, I'll
take you home. I promise.

94
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,598
Come on.

95
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,437
One foot after the other.

96
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,423
- Looks like a Victoria's Secret ad.
- Oh, it's so pretty.

97
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,527
I love the way ER
people do things.

98
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,686
Is something going on
we don't know about?

99
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,887
No, you guy... Hi.

100
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,144
Not there. PRATT: Hope...

101
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,928
- I'm gonna set you up here.
- Morris.

102
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,899
What's the deal,
bro? What's going on?

103
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,698
Well, tonight is the night.

104
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,465
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,906
Abby and Luka,
they're getting married.

106
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,476
- You were right.
- I told you.

107
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,307
Abby and Luka
is getting married.

108
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,381
- Seriously?
- Dr. Kovac and Dr. Lockhart?

109
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,040
- Yes, siree.
- That is so dope.

110
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,245
- A surprise wedding, how novel.
- Doesn't sound like Lockhart.

111
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,652
- Does Abby know?
- It's awesome, isn't it?

112
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,884
We're just running a bit behind.
We've hit an itty-bitty snag.

113
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,494
- Do you need help?
- No, thanks.

114
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,655
- Small case of cold feet. Ha-ha.
- It's a logistical issue.

115
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:15,063
We will be sealing this deal
within the hour. Excuse me.

116
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,259
I know what you think.

117
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,168
That this is a manipulation that
makes me question our relationship?

118
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,399
Maybe it's a symbol
of how much I love you.

119
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,137
How well I know you, how
deeply we're meant to be together.

120
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,573
Jeez.

121
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,713
What kind of ring
do you think I got?

122
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:33,083
I have no idea what
kind of... It's not bad.

123
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,949
I don't wanna
ruin the surprise...

124
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,989
but there will be no Celine
Dion, Air Supply, boy bands.

125
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,593
- Not even Menudo?
- The food is international.

126
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,252
- Name the country, we got it.
- What am I gonna wear?

127
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,865
- I'm supposed to wear this?
- You mentioned it.

128
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,594
I was half asleep and you
were flipping through a magazine.

129
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,638
You thought I wasn't
paying any attention.

130
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,307
That's not gonna fit.

131
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,314
- Hope sized it off your other things.
- Hope, Hope, Hope.

132
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,542
Her cousin's a tailor.

133
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,519
She's got him on standby
if it needs any adjustments.

134
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,434
Croatian sensation pulls
a rabbit out of the hat.

135
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,362
I just wanted to
make the wedding...

136
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,564
that I thought was
gonna make you happy.

137
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,710
- Ha. Luka.
- Oh, no, don't say no.

138
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,539
Not now, not after everything.

139
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,374
It's too weird.

140
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,072
It's too sudden.

141
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,481
You just wanna just do it on
the spur of the moment like this?

142
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:48,421
If there was ever anything
that was not rushed into...

143
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,259
it's you and me promising
to be together forever.

144
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,404
You know, Ray... Thank you.

145
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,066
Weddings are great
opportunities for guys like us.

146
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,769
Weakens a woman's defenses.

147
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,777
Sure.

148
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,109
You ever think
about settling down?

149
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,013
- Sometimes, I guess.
- Hmm.

150
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,517
You?

151
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,120
- Me? Ha-ha-ha.
- Mm-hm.

152
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,620
No, never.

153
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,352
If I did, I would never admit it.
- Hi, guys. Hey.

154
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,594
Well, the bar's right there.

155
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,892
Yeah, but, you
know, I said more half.

156
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,630
Ahh. Bartender, give
my friend another.

157
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,637
The energy is
sagging. Do something.

158
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,242
Here, have a drink.

159
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,010
Mm.

160
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,875
Timing, momentum, flow,
they're crucial to an event like this.

161
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,041
Calm down, everybody's
having a good time.

162
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,050
It is sagging, damn it.

163
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,883
- Lapel, lapel, lapel.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

164
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,548
- Thank you. Okay, this is easy.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

165
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,661
Excuse me, do you have
a playlist that I can see?

166
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,411
<i>Bum-bum-bum-bum</i>

167
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,445
Look, it's sweet, it really
is, and I love that you did it.

168
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,024
But this should be something
that we plan together.

169
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,455
Something we both want.

170
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,756
- What else do you want? I'll get it.
- Luka...

171
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,802
We could put this off forever.
Always gonna be reason not to do it.

172
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,832
We want it, we deserve it.

173
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,166
So let's stop stalling
and dive in the ocean.

174
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,672
Jump into the pool.

175
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,834
- It's been seven years, Abby.
- I know how long it's been.

176
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,056
- Look, I just...
- Hey, let's just do this one thing.

177
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,027
That's fast and easy and right.

178
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:12,163
Let's get married, right
here, right now, tonight.

179
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,313
And what about Joe?

180
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,152
We can't get
married without Joe.

181
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,918
My secret weapon.

182
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,231
Save the best for last, huh?

183
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,678
This is pretty kooky, huh?

184
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,978
Them getting married like this.

185
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,320
Yeah, it's pretty
kooky. Heh-heh.

186
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,983
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, they're getting ready.

187
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,928
What's this?

188
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,795
It's for you.

189
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:20,532
Heh. I know, I started doing a little
bit of recording again on my own.

190
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,801
It's got some songs
I've been working on.

191
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,403
Really? That's great.

192
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,572
There's one about you
that you'll have to figure out.

193
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,081
Plus a few others I burned.

194
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,016
Some songs we used to listen
to when we were roommates.

195
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm sorry, Ray.

196
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,750
About what?

197
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,428
I thought I was coming
alone, and he just turned up.

198
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,029
I didn't know what to do.

199
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,332
No offense...

200
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:51,836
but not knowing what to do
has become your baseline.

201
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,966
This isn't easy for me, Ray.

202
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,347
I've had a pretty
hard time ever since...

203
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,441
Losing Michael.

204
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,349
- I still haven't quite...
- Yeah, I know.

205
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,683
I mean, Tony was new.

206
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,553
There's no history.

207
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,423
Didn't make me think
about things from before.

208
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:22,294
Maybe I rushed into it because
it made moving on easier.

209
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,874
So I feel like history to you?

210
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,247
Well, I couldn't separate
you from Michael.

211
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,381
I couldn't be with
you and not feel guilty.

212
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,813
What about now?

213
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,316
Now?

214
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,891
I'm not sure all that
matters anymore.

215
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:54,957
Meaning?

216
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,238
Ah! There you guys are.

217
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,739
Neela, Abby needs to see you
before the ceremony, come on.

218
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,844
Okay.

219
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,908
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

220
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,052
Okay.

221
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,034
- This is so nutty.
- Tell me about it.

222
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,638
- It's great, everyone's so excited.
- I have to ask you a question.

223
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,433
What do you need? Something
borrowed, something blue?

224
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,099
Chuny has a scarf, it's
aqua, but might do the trick.

225
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,007
Can you just sit down
for a second? Sit down.

226
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,448
Sorry.

227
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,284
First, I know this has been
a really rough year for you.

228
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,653
And I don't think I have been
around as much as I should.

229
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,023
- And I feel bad about that.
- Oh, you don't have to.

230
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:06,095
But you have always been
a great friend to me, so...

231
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,634
So I was wondering...

232
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,509
if you didn't mind, do
you think you could lead...

233
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,913
and stand up there with
me when we do this?

234
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,487
You mean, like be
a maid of honor?

235
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,596
Well, I hate to put that kind
of conventional term on it...

236
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,755
but yes.

237
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,833
I'd be honored.

238
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,601
Thank you.

239
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,342
Your first job is to figure
out how I put these in my hair.

240
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,036
- Hair?
- Yeah.

241
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,411
It's a Croatian thing, I don't know.
They belong to Luka's mother.

242
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,684
Okay.

243
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,860
Okay, stop it, don't start now.

244
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,298
Oh, God.

245
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,369
I know.

246
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,863
Whew.

247
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,675
Come in.

248
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,747
- There he is, dead man walking.
- Ha-ha.

249
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,214
Very funny.

250
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,444
You're not getting
cold feet, are you?

251
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,589
I could find a back
way out of here.

252
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,452
I'll have you at a gentlemen's
club in under 20 minutes.

253
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,492
Pratt... I'm just
teasing you, man.

254
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:40,258
So Hope said you wanted to
talk to me, said it was important.

255
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,501
We've had our moments, Pratt.

256
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:47,162
And I haven't always liked
the things you've done...

257
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,903
or the way you've done them, but
I've always respected your reasons.

258
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,278
Thanks.

259
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,911
I had to supervise you...

260
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,746
which wasn't always
easy for either of us.

261
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,449
But I think we've managed to reach
a place where at the end of the day...

262
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,923
we're also friends.

263
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,954
Yeah, I feel the same way.

264
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,659
Would you stand up for me?

265
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,974
Wait, you mean, like...? Heh.

266
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,535
Be my best man.

267
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,173
Anytime, anyplace.

268
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,018
- Don't lose that.
- No.

269
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,287
It's go time, my brother, are
you ready? Because it's go time.

270
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,765
Let's do it.

271
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,547
Oh... Your tie's crooked.

272
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,967
- Let me fix that.
- I'm fine.

273
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,574
- Leave me alone, stop pointing that...
- Okay, sorry, I'm just emotional.

274
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:55,798
I'm emotional.

275
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,137
Everything's good,
everything's under control.

276
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,177
- There's just one minor change.
- Change?

277
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,077
The justice of the
peace couldn't make it.

278
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,810
- Someone else is doing the ceremony?
- Very experienced. It will be lovely.

279
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,511
Okay, go. Go, go, go.

280
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,790
Go, go.

281
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,012
Okay.

282
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,278
- Ready?
- No.

283
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,788
- She'll be fine.
- Take this.

284
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,755
- I don't...
- You wanna make Sophie cry?

285
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,792
I'm sorry, but I'm
really not ready.

286
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,554
Why do you have to be a whiner?

287
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,632
- Why do you have to be a crybaby?
- Okay, sweetie. Ahem. Come on.

288
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,666
Go, go, go. ABBY: No, no.

289
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,267
Just don't...

290
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,692
Welcome.

291
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:34,562
I understand from my
notes, "Luka and Abigail..."

292
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,827
Um... It's Abby.

293
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:40,336
Have no patience for the normal
rituals, which I find a little meshuga.

294
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:44,534
But, hey, if that's how you
want it, we'll get right to it.

295
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,915
Today, you become a man. No,
sorry, bar mitzvah this morning.

296
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,717
Kid was such a schnook.

297
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:57,653
Here. Marriage is an important
step, a great responsibility.

298
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,358
Uh... A coming
together of souls.

299
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,190
Yada, yada. Yada, yada.

300
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,825
Any readings?

301
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,435
No, no, no.

302
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,662
No readings? Oh.

303
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,102
Come on, readings
are a nice touch, classy.

304
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,435
- I've got one.
- You do?

305
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,942
Yeah, it's a Punjabi tradition.
- Oh.

306
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,406
Um...

307
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,091
- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.

308
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,956
What is it?

309
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,065
It's about love,
faith and devotion.

310
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,394
It's kind of a blessing.

311
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,966
Alrighty.

312
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,299
Next thing.

313
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,876
Any ex-lovers wanna say something
about why these two shouldn't be married?

314
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,138
- Okay, moving on.
- Okay.

315
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,077
- Vows.
- No vows.

316
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,241
Can you just skip ahead to
the I-now-pronounce-you thing?

317
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,909
No vows?

318
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,546
You have vows?

319
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,794
Be my wife.

320
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:20,472
I offer myself with all
my faults and strengths.

321
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,675
We'll help each other
when we need help...

322
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,835
and work together
to raise our son.

323
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,144
I choose you as the
person I will love and honor...

324
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,583
for the rest of my days.

325
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,060
Abigail?

326
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,993
Well, it's not really fair,
because you got to practice.

327
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:48,430
- Abigail. Abigail?
- It's not fair, because he got to...

328
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,365
It's Abby.

329
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,674
Um... Well, okay.

330
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,975
Okay.

331
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,574
First of all...

332
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,510
First of all, I love you.

333
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,614
I do.

334
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:16,088
And you've helped
me through a lot.

335
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:22,330
And we got here together
with a beautiful little boy.

336
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:31,040
And I was thinking of
a poem before, actually.

337
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,838
Before, when I
was getting ready.

338
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:36,414
And I think it starts:

339
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,113
<i>I carry your heart in my heart</i>

340
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,217
<i>I am never without it</i>

341
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,330
<i>Anywhere I go, you go</i>

342
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,990
I'm probably messing...

343
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,191
the whole thing up...

344
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:02,501
but I think the end goes:

345
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:07,837
<i>And this is the wonder
That keeps the stars apart</i>

346
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:12,852
<i>I carry your heart I
carry it in my heart</i>

347
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,916
So I guess what I'm saying is...

348
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:27,863
let's just try to love each
other and persevere.

349
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,935
Jeez. Hmm.

350
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,444
For two people who
wanna cut to the chase...

351
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,791
you sure know how to go on.

352
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,711
Rings.

353
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,340
Humor me.

354
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:25,588
By the power vested in me by
Cook County and the state of Illinois...

355
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:28,250
I hereby pronounce
you husband and wife.

356
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,530
Step on the glass
and kiss that girl.

357
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,645
Attention. Attention, please.

358
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,347
Quiet. Shut up.

359
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,804
I have been asked to kick off...

360
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,527
the party portion of
tonight's festivities.

361
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,389
Thank you, thank you.
And I'd just like to say...

362
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,094
that this is clearly a
marriage made at County.

363
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,568
Aw.

364
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,578
Because if we worked
at Northwestern or Rush...

365
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,580
there'd be better food
and a lot more booze.

366
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,434
The top shelf
stuff, right, Lucien?

367
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:20,669
Relax, big guy.

368
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,615
Hey, you know, I'm not
saying that Kovac is cheap...

369
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:29,050
but he did try to get Murray, the
roach-coach guy to cater this thing.

370
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,588
Anyway, the kids have rested up
and are ready for their first dance.

371
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,785
So I give you...

372
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:40,797
Abby Lockhart, Luka
Kovac, married couple.

373
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,236
It was so beautiful.

374
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:33,681
What you said, it really added
an ethnic spice to the ceremony.

375
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,412
I was just trying to do my part.

376
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,113
What did it mean?

377
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,291
Uh... I wasn't really prepared.

378
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:46,228
Don't be so modest,
you were great.

379
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,434
Oh, it meant:

380
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,439
"I went to the market
to buy some meat...

381
00:27:53,605 --> 00:28:00,512
but the butcher wasn't
there, so I got fish instead."

382
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,749
It was the only Punjabi I
could come up with in a pinch.

383
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,049
Okay.

384
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,779
Let's just keep that
between ourselves.

385
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,339
Stevie Wonder, huh?

386
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,412
I told you, I hear
everything you say.

387
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,339
I know, sweetie.

388
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:41,578
Just try to go to sleep, if you need me
or just wanna talk to me, call me, okay?

389
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:45,815
It doesn't matter what time, just
call me and I'll be here, all right?

390
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,687
Okay.

391
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,384
I love you too.

392
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,859
Bye.

393
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,328
Missing the first dance.

394
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,989
Eh.

395
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,901
Sarah called, she's
having a rough night.

396
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,568
Is she all right?

397
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,871
She's a tough kid, mostly.

398
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,444
Sometimes she's just a kid.

399
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:09,775
Are you all right?

400
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,541
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,345
I'm happy for
them, this is good.

402
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,612
This is a beautiful night.

403
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:16,845
I'm fine.

404
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:18,515
Tony.

405
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,587
I just don't get it sometimes.
You know, I don't...

406
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,229
Why did she do this?

407
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:27,264
I mean, I think I'm handling
it fine most of the time.

408
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,765
But then other times, I
get so damn angry at her.

409
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,530
I mean, how could she
leave a beautiful kid like this?

410
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,866
How could she mess
with our minds like this?

411
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,770
- How could she lie to us?
- It's okay.

412
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:41,073
- It's not okay. It's not okay.
- It's okay to be angry.

413
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,078
It is? She's dead.

414
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,552
I'm angry at Michael.

415
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,846
Still. I'm not sure
I'll ever get over it.

416
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,794
I...

417
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,762
I haven't been a good
friend. I know that.

418
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:06,963
I screwed up, and I
wanna make it right.

419
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,768
I wanna make it better.

420
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,243
Can I have another chance?

421
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,610
Tony...

422
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,679
I don't think this is the
time or the place for this.

423
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,754
It seems perfect to me.

424
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,259
I...

425
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,025
Maybe we should talk
about this another time.

426
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,192
- We can go for coffee this weekend?
- Coffee?

427
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:42,499
People get back together over
dinner. They break up over coffee.

428
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:48,106
I just need to get back inside.

429
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,562
All right, please.
Listen a few minutes.

430
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,352
You're having a
good time. Lovely.

431
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,619
Twinkle toes, you did
a great job out there.

432
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,025
All right, just give
a few seconds.

433
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,224
Listen, first and foremost,
I have to thank Luka...

434
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,699
- for inviting us all here today.
- It's not like we had a choice.

435
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,498
I think I speak for everyone,
including Frank, when I say...

436
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,133
that it is an honor and a privilege
to be here on your special day.

437
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:20,711
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

438
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,181
Now, you guys know me. I've
never been married before, so...

439
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,147
But he's dated women who were.

440
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,179
Leave your mom
out of it, Morris.

441
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,392
What's the difference between
an ER nurse and a Porsche, Sam?

442
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,721
Okay, okay, okay.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

443
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,022
All right, listen.

444
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,165
I can't believe you guys
save lives for a living.

445
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,765
But really, I've had the great pleasure
of working with Abby and Luka...

446
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,906
both of whom I consider friends.

447
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:53,273
And I see them working together,
sharing a life, sharing a family.

448
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,107
Tonight's been a great night,
and I know... We all know.

449
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,877
That this can't last forever,
but I think we all do agree...

450
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,953
that the love between you
two will, and I know it will.

451
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,352
And hopefully, with some luck...

452
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:08,858
maybe some of that love
will rub off on all of us here...

453
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,258
and help us find
someone as special.

454
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,792
Someone to spend the
rest of your lives with...

455
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,061
as friends and as lovers.

456
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,238
To Abby and Luka.

457
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,906
And love and
friendship. Hear, hear.

458
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,202
DJ, you know what
to do, come on now.

459
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,375
Oh, here we go. Marquez?

460
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,731
Hey, baby.

461
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,496
Who are you talking to?

462
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,436
The hottest nurse in the ER.

463
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,082
Don't take a plate away without
making sure the guest is finished.

464
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:10,018
And make sure that there are no empties
and don't forget to crumb the tables.

465
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,521
And you, button
your vest up, please.

466
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,024
- Hope.
- What are you doing here?

467
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,855
- No, you should be out there.
- Hope.

468
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,759
- The bride cannot be back here with...
- Hope.

469
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,100
I want to thank
you for all of this.

470
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,102
You do?

471
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,742
Yes.

472
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,803
Oh.

473
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,641
You're not gonna hurt me?

474
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:36,941
No.

475
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,611
What's wrong?

476
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,882
You're just so beautiful.

477
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,219
Okay.

478
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,670
Luka.

479
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,305
Hey, have you seen Abby?

480
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,464
Congratulations, Luka.
You're a lucky guy.

481
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,769
- Thanks.
- No, really, Abby's great.

482
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,844
- I know.
- Don't ever hurt her.

483
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,174
- Excuse me?
- I mean it.

484
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,407
Okay.

485
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,924
Chuny.

486
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,856
Anybody ever told you, you
is the hottest nurse in the ER?

487
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,087
Yeah.

488
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,356
No, no, no,
seriously, I'm sorry.

489
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,967
You're great, you'd
never hurt her, I know that.

490
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,364
What was I thinking?

491
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,098
But if you did, I would hunt
you down like a cheetah.

492
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,297
Hello.

493
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,176
Lucien, having fun?

494
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,720
Yeah, it's fun.

495
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,881
It's a lot of fun.

496
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,723
I went to a Surgery
wedding, it was such a bore.

497
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,659
All they did was
talk, talk, talk.

498
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,892
ER weddings have spunk.

499
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,127
Yeah.

500
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,466
- They're serving coffee now...
- What about you, are you having fun?

501
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,303
- Yeah.
- It is fun, isn't it? It's a lot of...

502
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,205
Fun.

503
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,352
Uh... I have to go
to the bathroom.

504
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,818
I'm looking for...

505
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,987
Pardon, I'm so sorry.

506
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,397
Has everyone gone bonkers?

507
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,608
Hey.

508
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,872
Hey.

509
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,716
You all right?

510
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,514
- I always cry at weddings.
- Oh.

511
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,548
I'm alone.

512
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:04,722
Oh, well, it's all right.

513
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,055
I just wanna say...

514
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,969
I appreciate all the
mentoring you've done.

515
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,606
Have I done that?

516
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:21,046
And I totally admire you a lot.

517
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,874
And...

518
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,784
I just really wanted
you to know that.

519
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:38,162
Really, really know it.

520
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:49,673
Yo, there's some freaky
stuff going on in here, man.

521
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,843
Yeah, probably
something in the water.

522
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,606
Timmy told me I was the
hottest nurse in the ER.

523
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,944
What do you want from
me, a second opinion?

524
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:12,026
Hi, I'd like a dry dirty martini
and a tequila sunrise, please.

525
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,695
Hey, Ray, what's shaking?

526
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,527
Dry and dirty?

527
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,330
I should've figured
that one out.

528
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:25,444
Actually, I prefer the tequila sunrise
because of all the pretty colors.

529
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,502
Asshole.

530
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:31,140
Gates, what are you doing? Save
some liquor for everybody else.

531
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,285
Another one, please,
vodka and cranberry.

532
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,649
Ray, there's a party going on here,
everybody's having a good time.

533
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,451
So anytime you feel like jumping
in, just get off your little stool, and...

534
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,560
Bartender, hot coffee for him.

535
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,355
Keep it coming, fast and black.

536
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:48,557
- Thank you.
- You're a real prick, you know that?

537
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,163
- Problem?
- Not yet, but soon.

538
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,005
What's your damage, Ray?

539
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:11,987
My damage is you walked into
our ER like you owned the place.

540
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,756
I don't appreciate that.

541
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,086
Nobody else does.

542
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,329
Ray, I realize that
you don't like me.

543
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:25,368
But sooner or later, you're gonna
have to get used to living with me...

544
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,768
because I ain't going nowhere.

545
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,409
You wanna leave a mess
wherever you go, that's up to you.

546
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,577
But there are two things I will
not let you screw around with.

547
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:39,548
- That is patients' lives and...
- And what, Ray?

548
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,548
- And her.
- Hey, I care about her, you little...

549
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,350
- Wrong time.
- Bet you almost have yourself convinced.

550
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,551
- Oh, yeah?
- But you're the only one who buys it.

551
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,093
- Come on, Ray.
- No.

552
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:55,131
Wait, let me just say, Ray, you know
that thing you guys had in the past?

553
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,030
- It's over, finished, done.
- Tony.

554
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,564
- You don't know how to take care of her.
- Ray, please.

555
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:09,136
Well, Ray, at least I'm trying.

556
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:10,782
That's right. That's right.

557
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,145
- Like you took care of Meg, huh?
- Oh.

558
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,913
Hey, let it... Let it go.
Let it go, he's drunk.

559
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,783
Oh, that's it, come on.

560
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,887
Gates. NEELA: Stop it.

561
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,619
Cut it out!

562
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,991
Stop it.

563
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,065
Stop that. RAY: Come on.

564
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,725
- Come on.
- Hey, screw you.

565
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,598
- Go, go.
- Come on, come on.

566
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,676
Hey, come on, come on.
What the hell is wrong with you?

567
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,948
- Okay, I'm good. Get off me.
- Trying to ruin it for Abby and Luka?

568
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,886
Just get the hell
off of me, man.

569
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,390
Hey, Ray, what's going
on with you, man? Huh?

570
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,859
I think you get it,
Greg, you know?

571
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,836
Every time I think I'm turning the corner,
I feel like I know what I'm doing...

572
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,802
- I end up falling backwards again.
- It's a wedding...

573
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,339
you're drunk, and
you're hooked on a girl.

574
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,670
Just go, you'll feel
better in the morning.

575
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,712
- I don't wanna go home.
- Well, you're done here, okay?

576
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,012
So just catch a cab.

577
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,208
- Pratt.
- Go home, Ray.

578
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,650
I'm not kidding, go home.

579
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,490
You know what I
love about you, Gates?

580
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,652
Just when I get worried that
maybe I'm being tough on you...

581
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,421
you prove what an ass you are.

582
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:36,193
Me? I was perfectly civil till that
alcoholic <i>O.C.</i>reject went off on me.

583
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,733
You should've kept walking.

584
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,531
Well, Morris, as my role
model, Kenny Rogers once said:

585
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:43,004
"Sometimes you have to
fight when you're a man."

586
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,507
Oh, that's deep.
That's... Gates.

587
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,873
I'm not going back. I
just wanna talk to her.

588
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,446
- Neela.
- Not right now, Tony.

589
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,315
- Can't you see she's upset?
- Chuny, I just wanna talk to her, okay?

590
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:01,259
It's all right. I'm fine,
Chuny. Thank you so much.

591
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,891
Okay.

592
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,331
I'm sorry that happened.

593
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,592
Abby and Luka are in the other
room, they don't know about it.

594
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,533
- There's no excuse.
- No, there isn't.

595
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:16,197
I wasn't looking for trouble,
he wouldn't back down.

596
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:19,811
Right, and there was no way for
that to end without him backing down.

597
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,105
What do you mean?

598
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,146
Well, with men, you have to win.

599
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,374
And with women...

600
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:30,784
Well, with women, you have to
feel like you've done right by them.

601
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,117
Even if all you're doing
is causing them pain.

602
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,919
Or at best, wasting their time.

603
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,358
Is that what you think
I'm doing? Wasting time?

604
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,003
You know, I think we both got into
this because we knew it had no future.

605
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,072
It was just a bridge from one
part of our life into another.

606
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,233
- I think it's a lot more than that.
- No, I don't love you.

607
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,016
And I don't think you love me,
and I don't see much chance...

608
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,278
of that changing anytime soon.

609
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,019
So that's it?

610
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,493
We're done?

611
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,799
Yeah.

612
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,969
- Because Ray couldn't get over you?
- No.

613
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,031
Because...

614
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:26,637
You can stand there as if you're
listening to what I'm saying...

615
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:30,213
and still believe that
none of this is your fault.

616
00:42:57,208 --> 00:43:00,576
Have you got any bourbon?
- Yeah.

617
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:09,752
Can you make it a double?

618
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,086
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I just...

619
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,991
Wish that hadn't
happened though.

620
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:23,965
- You did a really good job tonight.
- No, no, no, you did an awesome job.

621
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,368
They look so happy.

622
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,068
I got them the honeymoon
suite at the Ritz for a few nights...

623
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:35,543
but they can't use
it on account of Joe.

624
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,581
Yeah, I can see that.

625
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:42,277
It's too bad. I really don't
want the room to go to waste.

626
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:47,289
Yeah. I don't either.

627
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:49,222
Really? You don't?

628
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,419
No, of course not.

629
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,727
Are you suggesting what
I think you're suggesting?

630
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,562
Oh, it's go time.

631
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,860
It's...

632
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,563
Can I get that on record,
please? Say it... Say that again.

633
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,902
No.

634
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,271
So you quit your job and
get married in the same week?

635
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,575
- I'm a new guy now.
- Is that so?

636
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,042
Being chief was gonna just
mean spending less time...

637
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,585
with my wife and baby.

638
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:27,388
Well, I have to admit, I don't think I
could've planned a better wedding.

639
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:30,763
- You don't?
- I don't.

640
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:42,245
Uh... Abby, it was a
really nice wedding.

641
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:51,111
Luka, what I said before
about hurting Abby, I meant it.

642
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:59,292
I'm not really sure why I'm here,
but I'm very happy to be invited.

643
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,365
I don't really
know these people.

644
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:05,332
Okay, let me just put this down.

645
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:08,473
- And... No, no. Okay.
- Oh, there's Morris with that thing.

646
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,609
- Yup.
- Come on in, Morris.

647
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:14,336
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Hey, we just wanna say...

648
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,708
congrats to our
fearless leader here.

649
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,340
Yes. Yeah, and we wish him
a life of contentment and joy.

650
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:22,646
- And love.
- Yes, yes.

651
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,948
What else? Oh, oh.

652
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,954
Sleeping with only one woman.

653
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,183
- Ever again.
- Forever.

654
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,658
Without end.

655
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,222
Everybody's real nice. I hope
they'll be real happy together.

656
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,698
I do. Even the bride.

657
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,820
Ray, can you call
me when you get this?

658
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:14,659
I thought we could go out for
breakfast or coffee or something.

659
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,997
Listen, I'm sorry about tonight.

660
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,311
It's a pretty amazing night.

661
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:10,012
I guess it just makes you look forward
to a time when you get to be as happy...

662
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,520
as Abby and Luka
are right now, so...

663
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,530
Good, good job.
Okay, Ray, we gotta go.

664
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:18,129
Hey, dude. Dude,
can you get this for us?

665
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,321
Thank you.

666
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,670
Abby and Luka.
