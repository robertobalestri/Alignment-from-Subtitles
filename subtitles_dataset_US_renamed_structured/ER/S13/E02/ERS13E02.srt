1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,304
To prove I'm a good guy,
know what I'm gonna do?

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,934
I'll let you sit in front, play with
the siren. And I'll buy you a coffee.

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,276
I have two and a half months
left. This baby's not coming till then.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,694
- Pain. Gush of blood.
- We're going to the O.R.

6
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,429
Come on, little
guy. Give me a cry.

7
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,730
Pulse is less than 60.

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,098
Let's bag him. Intubation tray.

9
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,615
We can wait for you to clot or can
start thinking about a hysterectomy.

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,124
Is Dad gonna hurt us?

11
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:30,594
Now we gotta stay
together. The three of us.

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,893
I'd rather we were all dead.

13
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,535
<i>I'm losing it.</i>

14
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,476
I don't... I can't even drive.

15
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,275
You're the only person
I could think of to call.

16
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:31,552
I don't know. I'm, uh,
somewhere close to Waukegan.

17
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,492
There's a Phillip's Diner
and, um, a gas station.

18
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,365
Yeah.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,666
Okay, thanks.

20
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,263
Hurry up, okay?

21
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,944
All preemies have the
same five problems:

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,956
Infection, hypotension,
hypoglycemia, tachypnoea, cyanosis.

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,424
Your guy has four out of five.

24
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,120
White count's up, he's
on dopa and dobutamine...

25
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,766
and we're needing higher
pressures to ventilate.

26
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,299
How high?

27
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,936
Pips at 32.

28
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,800
You're pummeling his
lungs. He's gonna get BPD.

29
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,304
Abby.

30
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,942
Luka, listen to me.

31
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,010
It's hard enough
being a parent in here.

32
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:28,342
You're gonna have to trust me
to do what's best for your son.

33
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,216
Abby?

34
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,284
Any questions?

35
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,115
No.

36
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,120
I've been here before.

37
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,207
Do you want me to wheel
you back to your room?

38
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,907
- You shouldn't stay out of bed that long.
- I know.

39
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,876
I've given that "watch
and wait" speech...

40
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,141
and never realized
what a load of crap it is.

41
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,544
Well, it's just the reality.

42
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,886
And I can't shut my brain off.

43
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,548
I keep thinking, "Why's
the dopa at 17 and not 20?

44
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,889
And did they check the
tube position? And..."

45
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,497
I can't see his eyes.

46
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,698
I need to know
what color they are.

47
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,695
They're blue.

48
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,210
Um, Neela asked me.
She wants to come and visit.

49
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,011
No, I don't want any visitors.
I don't wanna see anybody.

50
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,620
Abby. Abby, Abby.

51
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,688
Oh, thank God.

52
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,690
Oh, I came as soon as I heard.

53
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,400
- You're not running.
- They're gonna send me to jail.

54
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,141
For what? Killing a scumbag?

55
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,405
He's better off dead.

56
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,809
I was in the car.

57
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,178
I could have driven away.

58
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,979
I went back to kill him.

59
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,554
And that's the last time
you're ever gonna say that.

60
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,016
You hear me? There's only
two people who know here.

61
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,490
You and me.

62
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,652
You fill out a rape report.

63
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,993
You tell the cops you
shot him in self-defense.

64
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,661
- You think that will work?
- That's what happened.

65
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,833
Do you understand?

66
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,178
It's what happened.

67
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,751
Serial crits and foot
pulses, q.30 minutes.

68
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,385
Hey, any word on Sam?

69
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,317
The police are
still looking for her.

70
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,184
You want the walls
eggshell or white?

71
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,725
Do I look like Martha Stewart or
the chief of staff? I've got work to do.

72
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,693
- What's with her?
- I guess she has to pay for the repairs.

73
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,594
- Oh, Ray, is this your writing?
- Mm-hm.

74
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,668
Yeah, linebacker from
Northwestern. Looks like rotator cuff.

75
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,032
No MRIs if you've got
a metal plate in your leg.

76
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,696
The tech's gonna go over that.

77
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,536
You're lucky I caught this or
it would have been a mess.

78
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,373
I better enjoy myself the next few
weeks because you're gonna be a pain.

79
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:20,952
- Hey.
- Hey.

80
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,248
What time is it?

81
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,721
It's time to go home.
You've been here all night.

82
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,350
- I should go and check on Abby.
- No, you should go and get some rest.

83
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,292
Gallant's parents will
wanna see you today.

84
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,796
No, I'm not going over there.

85
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,865
Neela, go home.

86
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,471
The dopa's at 17,
mean's hanging around 25.

87
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,305
Two out of six. Systolic
ejection murmur on exam.

88
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,708
- Translate into English, please?
- Hold on, wait.

89
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,905
There's a murmur?

90
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,641
Get the echo. Let's take a look.

91
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,252
- I don't understand.
- It's okay. I'll explain later.

92
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,821
Your daughter was a star
student when she was here.

93
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,423
Really? She never
gives herself any credit.

94
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,060
All the good ones never do.

95
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,090
Is that the heart?

96
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,763
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

97
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,525
It's just beating
away, isn't it?

98
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,896
- I didn't tell her to come.
- It's okay.

99
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,670
- Are you sure?
- Isn't it amazing?

100
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,670
Seems like she's on her meds.

101
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,966
- Hey, Neela.
- Hi.

102
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:20,443
I know you can't eat in here, but
maybe you can take a break in the hall.

103
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,745
- How's he doing?
- We don't know.

104
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,111
- What about you?
- I'm okay.

105
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,844
You can see all the ventricles
and things in the heart.

106
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,351
That is just astonishing.

107
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,490
- Who's that?
- My mother.

108
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,151
- Mom.
- Yeah?

109
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,296
- Maybe you wanna meet my friend.
- Hi.

110
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,624
Maggie Wyczenski.

111
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,527
Neela Rasgotra. I've
heard a lot about you.

112
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,033
- Mostly right to left, T-R jet's 3.4.
- What are T-R jets?

113
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,331
Blood flowing the wrong
way through the heart.

114
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,198
Couldn't it be the pulmonary
pressures haven't dropped?

115
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,367
- Elevated from the RDS.
- Wait, wait, wait.

116
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,443
Something wrong
with the baby's heart?

117
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,480
- We don't know.
- What do you mean? You're gonna fix it.

118
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,551
Well, we can't just
fix it. He's premature.

119
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,482
He's gonna be here for weeks.

120
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,221
Oh.

121
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,526
All right, then we'll just wait.

122
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,494
It's all right.

123
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,995
We'll just wait.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,696
James Clivus, 39, fell 20
feet scaling Tribune Tower.

125
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,966
- He gets better reception up there.
- Cell phones are just a cover.

126
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,200
What's with the tinfoil?

127
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,072
Amplifies frequency bands
allocated to the U.S. government.

128
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,976
The Pentagon says it's for
communication, but that's a lie.

129
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,515
- Vitals?
- Distal deformity on the right LE.

130
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,710
Hey, Mayday. Heard
about yesterday.

131
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,855
Glad to see you're okay.

132
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,353
Yeah.

133
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,855
What's with her?

134
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,019
- What?
- Her husband was killed in Iraq.

135
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,590
- Are you kidding me?
- Do you think we'd joke about that?

136
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,032
We ceded control to the
search engines. I gotta go.

137
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,535
- Just calm down.
- I gotta go.

138
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,003
Let us check you out.

139
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,766
Don't think I don't
know what you mean.

140
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,244
Hey, there's Sam.

141
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,111
- You got this?
- Yeah, I got it.

142
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,544
It's impossible if we produce...

143
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,946
- Honey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

144
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,618
I'll be punished for this.

145
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,276
Oh, my God.

146
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,047
Well, how did you get here?

147
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,782
A friend dropped me off.

148
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,458
I need a rape exam.

149
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,164
Oh, honey.

150
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,363
So, what do you
call that thing again?

151
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,562
It's a PICC line.

152
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,575
It allows us to give nutrition and
medicines without sticking the baby.

153
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,235
It's kinking or something.

154
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,643
Oh, wait. Maybe you
should let Dr. Raab do that.

155
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,374
Uh, will you step back?
You're making it harder for him.

156
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,882
It's okay. You're doing fine.

157
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,918
You don't want students
working on your son.

158
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,385
He's a Resident, not a student.

159
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,089
What's that?

160
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,820
PVCs. It's the tip of the
catheter tickling the heart.

161
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,928
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but
you pulled back the line, right?

162
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,260
Of course he did, Abby.

163
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,163
Pull back the line.

164
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:59,795
All right, uh, 2:37, PVCs.

165
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,441
What's the deal with the notes?

166
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,442
I'm writing everything down,
so I can look it up later on.

167
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,240
Last night, I was reading
about smoking and prematurity.

168
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,007
- Do you...?
- I quit two years ago.

169
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,413
I know you did, but you work so
hard, and stress can be a factor.

170
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,781
Are you blaming this on me?

171
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,423
No, I'm not blaming you.
I'm not blaming anyone.

172
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,286
My grandson is on a...

173
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,490
- Ventilator.
- Ventilator, and I need to understand...

174
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,292
Maggie, she fell. People were
shooting and she fell, okay?

175
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,470
Look, you can ask
yourselves why all day long...

176
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,970
but in the end, the
answer doesn't matter.

177
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,039
- Miss Lockhart.
- Yeah?

178
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,735
Uh, we're about to start a
lactation seminar in the pump room.

179
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,840
If it's not a good time...

180
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,145
No, it sounds great.

181
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,781
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you.

182
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,150
Great.

183
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,690
Okay, here we go.

184
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,327
Great.

185
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,567
Hey, Joe.

186
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,691
These go between
the boob and the tube.

187
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,196
- You know what I mean?
- Mm-hm.

188
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,266
It's pretty self-explanatory.

189
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,561
You seem hesitant.

190
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,431
She is.

191
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,072
Breast milk is best for babies.

192
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,003
Well, she knows
that. She's a doctor.

193
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,541
I think I just need
a little privacy.

194
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,374
Okay, yeah. I'll
get you a screen.

195
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,710
- Well, she seems nice.
- Yeah.

196
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,080
Um...

197
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,512
You too.

198
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,282
What?

199
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,086
I need you to...

200
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,554
Oh, Abby, I've been
through all of this before.

201
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,129
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

202
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,391
Have you had a C-section, a
hysterectomy and a premature baby?

203
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,128
- No, I haven't, but...
- I didn't think so.

204
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,600
Abby. Look, I can...
I'll meet you outside.

205
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,306
- I think that you...
- I would like to meet you outside.

206
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,309
- All right.
- Fine.

207
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,607
- Fine, I'll meet you outside.
- Thanks.

208
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,284
They have a boy or a girl?

209
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,755
Boy.

210
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,986
He's in the NICU.

211
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,288
What about Jerry?

212
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,923
He was shot through the
chest, but he's pulling through.

213
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:46,869
Okay, you'll feel a little
pressure while I get the cultures.

214
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:52,978
Haleh, send off for
HIV and hepatitis titers.

215
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,580
No problem.

216
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,273
Sam, can I get you some water?

217
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,442
I'm... I'm okay. Thanks, Haleh.

218
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,282
You know I knew that he stole
TVs and video equipment...

219
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:11,625
but I just never thought he'd
be capable of anything like this.

220
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,824
It's not your fault.

221
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,624
Yeah? It feels like it.

222
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,469
Well, it's not.

223
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,707
Do you know where
Steve and the others are?

224
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,672
Did they catch them?

225
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,336
They're dead.

226
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,140
All of them?

227
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,445
All of them.

228
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,731
Not a good place to take a nap,
buddy. You could drown out here.

229
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,264
Track marks everywhere.
No way we get a line in.

230
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,732
- I'll throw in an EJ.
- Yeah, right.

231
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,770
Hey, I just spent a month in
the ICU. I can do it in my sleep.

232
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,171
You got a bad batch of heroin
there. Knocked you on your ass.

233
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,607
- I hate when that happens.
- That's not funny, man.

234
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,406
Say, "Ah."

235
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,451
- What the hell is that?
- Narcan.

236
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,586
Sublingual? Are we
authorized for that?

237
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:07,812
What? I can't hear you.

238
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,456
- That's not in our scope, man.
- I got the base online.

239
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,092
- Hello?
- County General on Alpha 1, go ahead.

240
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,526
Electrocuted juggler, self-inflicted
toe amputation, kerosene ingestion.

241
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:18,790
What...? What is this?

242
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,161
People will do anything
to stay out of the rain.

243
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:25,135
We've got three near-drownings and
this board hasn't changed in over an hour.

244
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,365
No, no, no, Gates.
You cannot put in an EJ.

245
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,702
<i>- Why not?</i>
- It's out of your scope of practice.

246
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,537
<i>- Ten minutes out.</i>
- I'll see you then.

247
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,509
- What was that?
- Unresponsive overdose.

248
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,706
Ten minutes out with
one cocky-ass paramedic.

249
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,213
ER said okay on the EJ.

250
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,646
- They did?
- Yeah.

251
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,481
Hey, they know me there.
They trust me, unlike my partner.

252
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,624
Look, if you're lying, I
promise you I'll sell you out.

253
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,398
- How's my boy?
- He's hanging in there.

254
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,626
I've been reading to him all morning,
and I swear to you, he recognizes my voice.

255
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,172
Vent wean, uh, isn't working.
They had to crank the O2 up to 70.

256
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,570
Take that coat off, Dr. Kovac.

257
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,506
We don't need the nasty
ER bugs in the NICU.

258
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,043
Sorry.

259
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,080
Have you two made a decision
about the Fludrozalone trial yet?

260
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,409
- Yeah.
- No.

261
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,074
Fludro...

262
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,583
- What is it? KOVAC:
Fludrozalone.

263
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:17,246
It's a new drug they're studying
for use in persistent hypotension.

264
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,722
Baby Joe is over 1500 grams.

265
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,726
- He's a perfect fit for...
- For your trial. We know. We know.

266
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,087
We're still making a decision.

267
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,166
Spontaneous intestinal perf,
fleeting neurodevelopment delays...

268
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,859
Theoretical risk, Abby.

269
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,336
I don't wanna subject our child to
an experimental protocol when we...

270
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,271
Because he still doesn't have
an adequate blood pressure.

271
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,605
Yes, but why just dopamine? Why
not dobutamine and an epi infusion?

272
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,838
Don't micromanage.

273
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,777
- Don't you. Don't.
- I won't. Okay.

274
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,451
Okay, why don't I just
leave the consent form...

275
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,382
just in case you
change your mind?

276
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,249
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

277
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,454
She's just trying to give
him the best possible chance.

278
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,064
- She's been pushing this trial.
- Come on, Abby, that's ridiculous.

279
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,860
- Is it?
- Why assume the worst about people?

280
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,797
It's not about me
being negative.

281
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,699
You need to pay attention
and wake up. It's our baby.

282
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,132
Hey.

283
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,273
- Luka.
- Abby?

284
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,739
Do you believe him?

285
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,148
I think... I think he's right.

286
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,318
You don't know the
first thing about it.

287
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,547
Maybe this drug would
turn everything around.

288
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,056
I know it's tough, but
we have to consider it.

289
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,490
Now, sometimes you
have to use your instincts...

290
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,927
Shut up, shut up. Please,
please, just shut up.

291
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,464
You know, I didn't
ask you to come here.

292
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,103
I didn't ask you to be involved.

293
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,068
Maybe you should just leave.

294
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,299
Okay.

295
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,823
Hey, Dori, can you find out when
the lab runs pertussis assays?

296
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,255
Every day but
Tuesday and Sunday.

297
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,418
- What did you do, mug a pimp?
- Ha-ha.

298
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,927
Yeah, your dad says hi.

299
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,860
How are you all
surviving without me?

300
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,296
Just fine. Hard
as it is to believe.

301
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,495
I got six hospitals to add
Maxanoxx to their formulary...

302
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,163
and now they're sending
me to Vegas for the weekend.

303
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,364
Vegas. Sweet.

304
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,043
Hey, put a bet down for me.

305
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,112
Hey, Pratt, can you get a
consent for the lid-lac sedation?

306
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,303
Sure.

307
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,110
Not until you sign the discharge
for Gonorrhea Grandma.

308
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,377
- Need any help?
- No, it's just the usual mess.

309
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,714
Nothing I can't handle.

310
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,884
Okay, I don't just mean today.

311
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,855
I, uh... I want my job back.

312
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,392
What happened to Vegas?

313
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,622
Vegas? Do I look like Vegas?

314
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,790
- Kind of.
- I'd hate Vegas.

315
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,027
Where's Weaver? She's
been ignoring my calls.

316
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,171
She's busy with some admin crap.

317
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,398
Nineteen-year-old male
found down in an alley.

318
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,235
- Probable overdose.
- What do we got?

319
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,708
Pulse, 84. Systolic, 86,
after a liter into the EJ.

320
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,007
EJ? I told you not to do that.

321
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,877
- You're dead.
- It's flowing great.

322
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,018
- Ought to thank me.
- I ought to report you.

323
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,053
Dr. Kovac was running the floor
when Clemente had his meltdown.

324
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,245
Yes, he was.

325
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,324
He was there the day that
Clemente and his girlfriend came in.

326
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,927
I believe so. I'd have
to check the schedule.

327
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,152
Yeah, he was.

328
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,764
He was there the day he
signed off on the diabetic...

329
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,164
whose family is bringing a
multi-million-dollar lawsuit against us.

330
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,031
Donald, where
you going with this?

331
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,732
I've drawn up a press release
announcing Dr. Kovac's dismissal.

332
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,399
You're firing him?

333
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,238
There was negligent
management here.

334
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,880
Shouldn't we give him a
chance to defend himself?

335
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,609
Too late for that. I'd like everyone
to look this over before I send it out.

336
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,753
- This sounds right.
- Works for me.

337
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,788
Look, I am the one
who hired Dr. Clemente.

338
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,152
But you didn't keep him here.

339
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,094
You even said that you warned
Dr. Kovac to get rid of him...

340
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,957
but he ignored you.

341
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,229
That's not how it happened.

342
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,464
Oh, Dr. Weaver.

343
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,266
- Not now.
- Uh, rehire me, please.

344
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,103
I'm efficient. I'm a
walking encyclopedia.

345
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,144
- I said, not now.
- I'm not trying to toot my own horn.

346
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,147
But had Jerry wound up in the
hands of Barnett or Lockhart...

347
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,909
he'd be rapping with Tupac now.

348
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,111
- Morris, I can't help you.
- I know I look good in this suit.

349
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,119
But I'm not an
ass-kissing company man.

350
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,225
- I'm an ass-kissing ER man...
- I said, I can't help you.

351
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,486
- Dr. Weaver, wait.
- Will you listen to me?

352
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,062
You get off the floor. You're
embarrassing yourself.

353
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,131
I don't care. I'm
desperate, please.

354
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,927
Then stop it.

355
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,503
I can't rehire you, because
I am no longer chief of staff.

356
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,804
Third of Narcan.
Still no response.

357
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,105
This isn't an overdose.

358
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,339
- And I need a little cricoid here.
- I got it.

359
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,847
I wasn't talking to you, Gates.

360
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,452
All right, got it.
I'm in, bag him.

361
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,418
Run of 10. Systolic's only 78.

362
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,524
Hundred of lido, half amp
of epi and 50 of mannitol.

363
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,284
He doesn't have a head bleed.

364
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,521
Pratt, we don't know what this is.
Until then, keep your mind open.

365
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,791
- Add a gram of ceftriaxone.
- Throwing the kitchen sink at the guy.

366
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,298
V-tach, no pulse.

367
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,266
- Damn it.
- Starting compressions.

368
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,371
- Strip looks weird.
- Why?

369
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,268
It just doesn't
look right. Look.

370
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,207
Ah. ST depressions and U
waves. He's hypokalemic.

371
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,869
Sam, F 40 of KCL.

372
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,207
All right, charge to 200.

373
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,872
Come on. Clear.

374
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,653
- Still V-tach.
- Resuming.

375
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,845
- What about periodic paralysis?
- What?

376
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,890
- Potassium's in.
- I got it wrong. I had to go look it up.

377
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,550
It's a zebra, Gates.
Three hundred, clear.

378
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,320
Something about
being common in Asians.

379
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,397
Treat with beta
blockers, not KCL.

380
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,294
Metoprolol.

381
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,630
- May I?
- Well, we've got nothing to lose.

382
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:31,964
Right.

383
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:37,200
Fifty mgs going in. The condition
could have stopped his breathing.

384
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,073
Okay, holding compressions.

385
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,747
Back in sinus.

386
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,715
Wow, periodic paralysis. Way
to pull that one out of your ass.

387
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,650
Sometimes you have to try
everything. Even the kitchen sink, huh?

388
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,983
Pratt, call the ICU.

389
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,592
Stay with him until
he gets upstairs.

390
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,920
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Morris.

391
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,155
No, it's an emergency.

392
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,198
I mean, not like an "emergency"
emergency, but it's important.

393
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,427
- Find me later.
- I want...

394
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:07,061
- I need my job back.
- Later.

395
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,377
They didn't have sugar,
so I brought the fake stuff.

396
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,726
They don't allow coffee in here.

397
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,728
No one's looking.

398
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,885
You know, um...

399
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,487
when Eric was
about 3 months old...

400
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,724
he got this really terrible
strain of pneumonia...

401
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,596
and ended up in the ICU.

402
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,603
Do you remember that
at all? You were so little.

403
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,740
His kidneys were shutting
down, and the doctors said...

404
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,071
he wasn't gonna make it.

405
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,736
Oh.

406
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,017
Your father and I fought
because he wanted us all...

407
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,414
to say goodbye to him.

408
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,351
He even dressed you up and
brought you down to the hospital.

409
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,389
Don't you remember any of that?

410
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,961
Well, I wouldn't stand for it.

411
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,793
I didn't care what the doctors said.
It didn't matter what the doctors said.

412
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,832
I wouldn't give up. I couldn't.

413
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,198
Ma, I'm not like you. I
think we've proven that.

414
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,872
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are, Abby.

415
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,473
You are like me.

416
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,371
You are like me.

417
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,012
You have to find the strength
to get Joe through this...

418
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,273
so you can take
him home with you.

419
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,313
I don't know if I can.

420
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:01,915
Oh, Abby, you've spent your whole
life getting strong enough to do this.

421
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,285
- Hey, Abby.
- Yeah?

422
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:18,226
I know the Fludrozalone trial scares
you, and trust me, it scares me too, but...

423
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,666
No, stay.

424
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,736
Sometimes the long shot, you
know, that weird kitchen-sink thing...

425
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,540
sometimes...
Sometimes it really works.

426
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,420
- What if something goes wrong?
- What if it goes right?

427
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,249
We can't take it back.

428
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,818
I know that.

429
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,566
Okay, let's do it.

430
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,900
I hope you're right.

431
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,411
Day of life, 15. Day seven
of the Fludrozalone protocol.

432
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,555
Baby's off pressors.
Weight's up.

433
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,883
Thirty-seven grams.

434
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,319
Excellent.

435
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,221
DC the antibiotics.

436
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,328
Decrease the labs to q.o.d.

437
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:20,159
And Baby Joe is now
officially a feeder and a grower.

438
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,665
We'll take that as compliment.

439
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,329
He's so alert. Look at him.

440
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,370
- Eyes wide open.
- Yeah.

441
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,069
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- Get a life, Mom.

442
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,302
Oh, gee, thanks.

443
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,776
You haven't been out of here...

444
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,142
for more than a few hours
over the past two weeks.

445
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,477
- Two of you go away for a while.
- I don't know.

446
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,279
I'm here.

447
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,346
That's obnoxious.

448
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,650
The nurses keep yakking.

449
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,293
- Well, you could just ask them to stop.
- Oh, just go.

450
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,986
Let's take a walk.
It will do us good.

451
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,162
You're leaving her here?

452
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,766
She'll be okay.

453
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,368
Has anyone got any tape?

454
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,527
How far was the gun from him?

455
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,139
About 10 inches or so.

456
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,832
That's in the
detective's report.

457
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:07,139
That's funny because there was no
gunshot residue on Mr. Curtis' body.

458
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,611
In fact, the autopsy shows...

459
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,512
you would have had to have
been at least 5 feet away.

460
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:14,347
Well, maybe I was
further. It's hard to say.

461
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,354
Big difference between 10
inches and 5 feet, Miss Taggart.

462
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,719
Mr. Evers, can I call you Byron?

463
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,023
You're a very sharp guy.

464
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,924
You got a bright
future ahead of you.

465
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,226
You think your boss is gonna
want you chasing your tail...

466
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:31,962
over a guy who shot up a hospital
and raped this woman here?

467
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,472
Maybe we should call
my boss and ask him.

468
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,835
You think?

469
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:40,070
I talked to him just this morning, in fact.
We, uh, confirmed our dinner for 7:15.

470
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:44,341
We go to Gibsons every
second Thursday for the rib eye.

471
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,711
This guy was murdered.

472
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,911
- My job is to prosecute the law...
- We're not talking about the law.

473
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,718
We're talking about time and
money and how you're wasting both.

474
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,553
Now I'm gonna give
you this opportunity...

475
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,060
to drop this right now,
on your own, okay?

476
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,326
Do you want me to handle
it over a steak and a martini?

477
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,900
Have you looked at the mail?
- Nothing too urgent.

478
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,565
You should maybe
check the electric bill...

479
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,075
because the water
was cold this morning.

480
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,405
How's it going?

481
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,603
Hey.

482
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,271
It's a little bit better today.

483
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,077
- Just get off?
- Yeah, I'm exhausted.

484
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,915
I'm gonna go and grab some dinner
at Ike's and then go home and crash.

485
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,185
Hang in there. ABBY: You too.

486
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,025
How's she doing at work?

487
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,098
Seems to be fine.

488
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,200
- She's still in your place?
- Yeah.

489
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,767
She hasn't found anything.

490
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,068
I'm never there. I
should just give it up.

491
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,644
Well, you don't have to
make any decisions right now.

492
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:51,147
But we're a family. We can't
just keep having slumber parties.

493
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:02,226
Have you thought
about what I asked you?

494
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,961
I have.

495
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,961
Uh, and I haven't.

496
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,497
It's okay.

497
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,601
I'll convince you later.

498
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,073
We have a great life together.

499
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,677
I don't need a ring or a white
dress to prove that I love you.

500
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,843
I'll take love.

501
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,154
We can save marriage for later.

502
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,583
Luka.

503
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,754
I hope she's okay.

504
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,488
Who? Neela?

505
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:43,500
The NICU nurse. Your
mother was driving her crazy.

506
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,582
Excuse me. Something's beeping.

507
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,155
- Not anymore.
- Well, you didn't even look at him.

508
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:06,292
Sat wasn't picking up.
It happens all the time.

509
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,314
Uh...

510
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,548
Excuse me.

511
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,053
Excuse me.

512
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,215
Uh, something's wrong.
Dr. Raab needs to take a look.

513
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,885
Miss Wyczenski, the team's in Radiology.
They'll come by when they're done.

514
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,360
Well, that could take hours.

515
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,762
If you overreact to every
little blip and bleep...

516
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,367
you'll make yourself crazy.

517
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,227
Well... - Page Dr. Raab. - What?

518
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,670
Why isn't anyone listening to
me? Page Dr. Raab, page Dr. Raab.

519
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,776
- I'm not supposed to.
- His belly's too big.

520
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,543
- His breathing's too fast.
- You need...

521
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,580
Don't tell me to calm down. I
don't care what Dr. Raab is doing.

522
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:06,947
She needs to get down here
and take care of my grandson now.

523
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,087
They're putting
the tube back in.

524
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,689
- He's bradying down to 70.
- Miller, 130.

525
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,416
- Mean BP, only 24.
- What happened?

526
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:16,061
- I knew something was wrong.
- Okay, what happened?

527
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:19,426
Bolus, 20 cc's, and
.2 of epi ready to go.

528
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,657
He was blue, Abby.

529
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,967
- Luka?
- Free air in the abdomen.

530
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,637
- He perfed?
- Good thing your mom was watching.

531
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,739
Is this because of
the Fludrozalone?

532
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,273
- No way of knowing.
- This could be fixed in surgery.

533
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,638
Spontaneous intestinal
perf is one of the risks.

534
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,076
It's one of the things
that happens to preemies.

535
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,115
Check his breath sounds. It can
be many possible explanations.

536
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,718
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

537
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,051
Dr. Anspaugh's
waiting in the O.R.

538
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,781
Okay, he's all yours.

539
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,926
What's happening?
Where are you taking him?

540
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,119
We'll remove any damaged tissue
and attempt a primary anastamosis.

541
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,595
No Residents. We don't want
any Residents cutting on this baby.

542
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,597
Call the chaplain
and have him meet us.

543
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,430
- You don't have to do that.
- You wanted the baby baptized.

544
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,836
You said it was important to
your family. Call the chaplain.

545
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,939
- Ready, one, two, three.
- Two, three, face off.

546
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,141
- She's a pro.
- One more.

547
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,339
Ugh!

548
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,178
That's what I'm talking about.

549
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:17,187
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All right, I've gotta go.

550
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,791
No, we'll walk you out.

551
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,982
It's okay.

552
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,490
- Whoa, careful.
- I think we need to get you a cab.

553
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:29,965
No. Why don't you go and
play some pool or something?

554
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,001
- Pool.
- Why would we play pool?

555
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,765
You want fries or onion rings?
- Vegetables.

556
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,670
You drank a milk
shake an hour ago.

557
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,607
You're not driving, are you?
- No, I'm not.

558
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,111
- Then we'll take good care of you.
- Oh, come on.

559
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,375
Boys, back to the
frat house. I got this.

560
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,018
- Dude, you got a problem?
- No, she's a friend of mine.

561
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,209
- Right, doc?
- Yes.

562
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,015
Thank you. He's
gonna take me home.

563
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,986
- Oh, thanks a lot.
- You little bitch.

564
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,624
What did you say?

565
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,201
Tony, easy, man.

566
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,671
Tony. Easy, man, easy.

567
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:12,970
All right. Okay, okay.

568
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,137
- He gets the message.
- All right, I got it.

569
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,215
All right, I got it. I got it.

570
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,406
We're gonna leave.

571
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,916
And, uh, you fellas
are gonna go home...

572
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,488
and sleep it off or
whatever you wanna call it.

573
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,359
Dissect free the vessels
to the diseased ileum.

574
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,091
Isolated. Mixter clamp.

575
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,397
Systolic's only 22.
I'm bolusing again.

576
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,905
We thank you, God, for the support
and skill that surrounds and sustains life.

577
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,737
Mobilize the hepatic flexure.

578
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,505
We are thankful that we
are known to you by name...

579
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,116
Careful. I don't want him
third-spacing all over the place.

580
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,201
No, really.

581
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,210
- You didn't have to do this.
- I know.

582
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,280
Are you a boxer?

583
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,315
You know, you should go to bed.

584
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,748
Oh, you can sleep
when you're dead.

585
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,784
That rhymes.

586
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,951
- Beer?
- No, thanks.

587
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:39,496
Neela, the last thing you
need right now is another drink.

588
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,257
You know...

589
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,927
You've got a mean left hook.

590
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,636
I like that in a man.

591
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,969
Do you like Sergio Mendes?

592
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,736
I don't really know.

593
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:59,818
I used to think he was really
corny, but his album is really cool.

594
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,319
Neela, you are gonna have
such a headache in the morning.

595
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,987
- Ow! Ow.
- All right.

596
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,324
I have to go, okay?
Zadro's still in the rig.

597
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,162
- Oh, he can come up too.
- No, no, no.

598
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,099
You'll lay down
and I'll leave, okay?

599
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,900
- No, please don't go.
- I have to go.

600
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,646
I'm sorry.

601
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,024
I don't wanna be alone.

602
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,322
Is there anyone you can call?

603
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,722
I don't have anyone.

604
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,710
Check his status. MAN:
Repeat ABGs. 6.98, all metabolic.

605
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,021
I can't do this. I can't pretend
everything's gonna be okay.

606
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,821
Abby, all the bad things
you've seen, let it go.

607
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,835
I can't believe I let
myself get talked into...

608
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,465
Stop it.

609
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,070
I spent a month in the NICU.

610
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,232
- I know how this ends.
- Abby.

611
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,537
You have a lot of great qualities,
but optimism is not one of them.

612
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,912
- Whose fault is that?
- Yeah.

613
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:41,713
All right.

614
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,921
I did not create a good
environment for a child to grow up...

615
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,922
believing things would work out.

616
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,924
But you're not a
child any longer.

617
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,222
You're the mother now.

618
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:57,431
And that baby down there needs
you to believe he's gonna be okay.

619
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,637
Bradying down to the 60s.

620
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,806
Another round of epi.
- Guys, he's gray.

621
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,811
Point-two of epi.

622
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,106
Four hundred of calcium,
10 cc's of fam now.

623
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,273
God, I'm trying. I'm
really, really trying.

624
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,542
I'm trying.

625
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,270
Hey, cath lab's waiting
on your Rollerblader.

626
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,668
You need to finish the chart.

627
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,899
Where are you going?

628
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,806
I'm going to get beer. It looks
like Weaver ordered lemonade.

629
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,002
- For graduation?
- Yeah.

630
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,977
She's no fun since
she's been demoted.

631
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,982
I thought Kovac was gonna
take the flak for everything.

632
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:49,087
- I guess it all came down on Weaver.
- Lucky us.

633
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,348
Hey, um, have
you talked to Abby?

634
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:55,623
I think they want
privacy for a while.

635
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,827
Okay.

636
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,299
- Tell her we miss her, okay?
- Okay.

637
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,301
- The paint has streaks.
- Streaks?

638
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,530
I don't see any streaks.

639
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,437
If you stand here in the light,
you can see it has streaks.

640
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,771
- Neela, what's it look like?
- I see streaks.

641
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,139
Hey, Mayday.

642
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,974
- How are you?
- Great.

643
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,615
Look, I'm really embarrassed...

644
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,842
Don't. I'm glad it was
me that took you home.

645
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:23,011
Jones, this is for you.
McCrary, this is for you.

646
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,679
Intern orientation.

647
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,620
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
- Yeah.

648
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,884
What are you doing here?

649
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,527
Yo, Gates.

650
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,464
Want me to take this or put
this in the lost and found for you?

651
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,794
Oh, I don't do the whites.
I'm into natural fibers.

652
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,637
You know, Gates,
you've always bugged me.

653
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,797
But you're in my ER now,
so put on the damn coat.

654
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,368
- You're a new intern?
- Mm-hm.

655
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,379
- Did my last paramedic shift yesterday.
- You're kidding me.

656
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,983
Guys, get your photos
taken for your new ID badges.

657
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,382
I look forward to working
under you, Dr. Rasgotra.

658
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,216
Anyone hear from Jerry? He
was supposed to be discharged.

659
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,383
Just spoke to him, he's getting a
massage from a home-care nurse.

660
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,585
Your big daddy called.
Wants you to meet him.

661
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:04,923
Really?

662

Courtesy of Maxanoxx.

663
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,492
Oh, come on, buck up, Morris.

664
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,900
Be glad you don't have to spend
summer teaching pelvics to the interns.

665
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,869
- No, you're lucky, Pratt.
- Yeah, right.

666
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,509
I clean vomit from my
shirt while you fly first class.

667
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,735
Corporate jet, actually.

668
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,209
Sounds corny, but I never
appreciated how great it is...

669
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,349
- to have a job that really matters.
- That suit matters, Morris.

670
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,348
That day with Jerry
was so terrible...

671
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,249
but also kind of the best
moment of my life, you know?

672
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,913
Look at me now. It's so silly.

673
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,922
Well, you know,
you're doing a service.

674
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,527
I mean, you're educating
the medical community for...

675
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,096
Oh, it's a load of crap,
Greg. We all know it, okay?

676
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,288
I sold out to the man.

677
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,367
- I guess you never spoke to Kovac.
- He didn't return my calls.

678
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,470
Well, he is pretty
preoccupied these days.

679
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,663
I guess I can always try
doing this somewhere else.

680
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,672
At least I figured out what's important. I
know I wanna practice medicine again.

681
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,914
I gotta go do my thing for
the Critical Care Department.

682
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,106
I'll see you around.

683
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,617
- All right, man.
- That waffle-iron thief left AMA.

684
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:07,116
- Hey, you know where Kovac is?
- No.

685
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,930
What are you doing here?

686
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:21,471
Well, the DA determined
it's justifiable homicide.

687
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,502
This is over.

688
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,212
I can't believe it.

689
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,240
Every day I keep thinking
they're gonna come arrest me.

690
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,817
Well, stop worrying about it.

691
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,613
Just focus on Alex, hm?

692
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,721
You talked to him about it?

693
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:43,986
Uh, he knows his dad is gone, but
I need to talk to him more about it.

694
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,962
You're a good mom.

695
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,101
I just want to tell
you that in person.

696
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,471
Anything else you need...

697
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,816
The key here is the
glucuronyl side group...

698
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:08,283
which gives Maxanoxx higher
specificity for the Alpha 1 receptor.

699
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,821
Why invest in a course of Maxanoxx
when we have cheaper drugs...

700
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,959
for pulmonary edema
that are effective?

701
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,187
Well, you'll see here that a subgroup
of patients had .4 fewer ICU days.

702
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,992
But there was no difference
in the overall outcome.

703
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,501
Do you know what one day
in the ICU costs taxpayers?

704
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,161
I mean, this hospital, society.

705
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,500
Morris, may I speak
to you out here now?

706
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,336
Not a good time, Dr. Pratt.

707
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,541
Uh, you'll save money
in the long run. Trust me.

708
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,681
It's an emergency.

709
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,081
Excuse me a moment.

710
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,015
What? What is it?

711
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,352
Can't you see I'm working?

712
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,591
Kovac is gonna
offer you the job.

713
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,861
- Oh! Oh.
- Hey.

714
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:00,733
You know what, stick with
Lasix. Maxanoxx is a scam.

715
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:08,410
You know, it's great Kovac
offered Morris that Attending spot.

716
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,744
Well, he's like a stray dog.
He'd just keep coming back.

717
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,441
You know that
blunt chest trauma?

718
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:16,918
I stuck a needle in the heart. Got
half a liter out of the pericardium.

719
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,853
- That's not bad for an intern.
- Well, I had a good teacher.

720
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,460
Have you two met?

721
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:27,622
Oh, yeah, I've seen you around.
Hey, I'm Tony Gates, intern.

722
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,767
Ray Barnett, R3.

723
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:33,102
Maybe you can show me how
to do an open pericardial window.

724
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,570
I could show you how to do that.

725
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,637
If you'll excuse me.

726
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,440
You know, I hear
she had a roommate.

727
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,776
Never tried to sleep with her.

728
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,713
What a dill weed.

729
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,711
- So can I call you Kerry now?
- I don't think so.

730
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,120
Why? We're colleagues,
we're contemporaries.

731
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,226
Hey, no touch, no touch.

732
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,760
- Luka.
- Hey.

733
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,757
- Sorry I'm late.
- I didn't think you were gonna make it.

734
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,300
I had to see it for myself.
Archie Morris and Greg Pratt.

735
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,461
- Attendings, huh?
- Is Abby coming?

736
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:10,302
Uh, she wanted
to, but not tonight.

737
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,468
How's she holding up?

738
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,113
She's okay. She's doing okay.

739
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,492
It's almost time.

740
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,364
Call a cab?

741
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,832
It will be here any minute.

742
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,666
So, uh...

743
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,376
When are you coming back?

744
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,980
Oh, my God, is
that an invitation?

745
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,850
I guess it is, yeah.

746
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:59,557
I mean, the, uh, signs and the
notes were a little crazy, but, uh...

747
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,456
I couldn't have gotten
through this without you.

748
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,358
Oh, you would have found a way.

749
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,554
You're a fighter.

750
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,200
You've been fighting me
since the day you were born.

751
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:12,735
I'd say, "Honey, wear the cute, little
pink dress," so you wear the jeans.

752
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,169
I'd say, "What a nice little drawing
you've done," and you'd throw it.

753
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:19,675
I told you to be a lawyer
and you became a doctor.

754
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:26,683
My greatest hope would
be this little guy causes you...

755
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,811
as much agony and
pain as you've caused me.

756
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,046
It would serve you right.

757
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:36,451
- I gotta go.
- Uh, hey.

758
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:41,157
You don't have to
go today, you know?

759
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,568
You'll be fine.

760
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,995
Mom?

761
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,830
I love you.
