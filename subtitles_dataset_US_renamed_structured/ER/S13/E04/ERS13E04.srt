00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
NARRATOR <i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,269
- Are you loving motherhood?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:12,436
- I hope this isn't awkward.
- What? That you and I are equals now?

4
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,276
Dr. Crenshaw is our new
chief Resident. Neela Rasgotra.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,883
Two years in ER, then defected.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,212
Took that long to figure
you were wasting time?

7
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,146
- I'm your daddy.
- What's up?

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,345
How's the new intern?

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,958
- She's very, uh, devoted.
- Thank you, Jesus.

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,061
Were you the best one there?
How many people did you save?

11
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,321
Did you rock?

12
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,140
Next time you don't
do what I tell you to

13
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,955
do or any other
Attending tells you to do...

14
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,967
you're gonna find yourself getting
rushed right out of this program.

15
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,972
You don't appreciate that I
took the time and the money...

16
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,738
to buy you some new clothes.

17
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,246
I didn't ask you to do that.

18
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,783
No, because you'd rather go to
school dressed like a bag lady.

19
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,787
Would you rather I dress like a slut?
Because that's how the other girls dress.

20
00:00:55,956 --> 00:01:00,257
I'd rather you dressed like someone
that has a mother that cares about her.

21
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,621
- Tony, would you please say something?
- Good morning.

22
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,457
What's wrong with
the way I dress?

23
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,762
She won't even try
on the clothes I bought.

24
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,269
Those are nice.

25
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,599
They're ugly.

26
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:18,007
And I refuse to conform to some
anorexic, media-fueled ideal of beauty.

27
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:22,616
That's fine, but you're not
leaving the house dressed like that.

28
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,476
Tony?

29
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,791
I hate living here!

30
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,240
We never resolved
the nanny issue.

31
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,495
Do you really want someone
else raising our child?

32
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,692
Well, I'm just talking
about a few hours a week...

33
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,860
so I can get some
stuff done around here.

34
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,233
I thought we had agreed
to stagger our shifts.

35
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,898
Well, and what,
never see each other?

36
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,068
I mean, even if
that was practical...

37
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,578
after your first day alone, you'd
be begging for help, trust me.

38
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,216
Mm. I think I can handle it.

39
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,582
Well, if you can handle it so well,
help me get Joe in the car, will you?

40
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,847
We're late for our first
mommy-and-baby class.

41
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,486
What?

42
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,721
Nothing.

43
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,830
What? I thought it
would be fun for... What?

44
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,867
I didn't say anything. What?

45
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,602
I'm late for work. Bye.

46
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,242
I'll call you later.
Don't forget his frog.

47
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,111
I know. Come here. Oh.

48
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,444
Can you say,
"Daddy is a butthead"?

49
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,916
Hm?

50
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,915
Why is your daddy
a butthead? Shhh.

51
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,036
I look like a dork.
- No, you don't.

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,926
This is not my style,
and this is not me.

53
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,030
If you didn't like what
your mom bought...

54
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,757
ask to go shopping again
and buy something together.

55
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,261
What are you doing?

56
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,735
Damage control.

57
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,968
- Sarah.
- What?

58
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,542
- This is not cool.
- Do you mind? I'm changing.

59
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,074
I hope your mother
doesn't find out about this.

60
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,841
She won't.

61
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,414
And besides, you don't know what
it's like for girls my age these days.

62
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,712
Hmm.

63
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,483
- There is a lot of pressure at school.
- Oh.

64
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,786
What you wear, what
you eat, what you don't eat.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,327
- What's his name?
- Who?

66
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,930
This is obviously about a guy.

67
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,594
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

68
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,262
Maybe I should
dress like a hussy.

69
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,135
Maybe we should
get you a plaid jacket...

70
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,435
and we'll just tell
everyone you're a lesbian.

71
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,749
- Adam.
- Huh?

72
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:40,010
Adam Horner. He
doesn't even look at me.

73
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,952
Well, good. I don't want some
guy named "Horn Dog" near you.

74
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,285
It's Horner.

75
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,293
Listen, most guys are jerks,
but if you want this guy...

76
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,125
Okay, wait a
minute. You're a guy.

77
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,426
Exactly. If you want
this guy to notice you...

78
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,466
forget about your
clothes and ignore him.

79
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,331
- That's your advice?
- Yup.

80
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,106
- Ignore him?
- Yeah, that's right.

81
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,768
Wow, you really suck at this.

82
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,676
Most guys want
what they can't have.

83
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,443
You ignore him, that guy
will come running to you.

84
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,950
Try not to kill anyone today.

85
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,683
Bye.

86
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,103
He's out. PRATT: All right.

87
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,655
Hope, you're gonna take a deep
breath and you're gonna hold it.

88
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,631
Now, if you don't get the tube
in by the time you run out of air...

89
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,360
we're gonna stop and bag.

90
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,198
Okay? Are you ready?

91
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:36,173
With you and Jesus
guiding my hand, I am.

92
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,504
Right.

93
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,810
Okay, sweep the tongue to the side
and advance until you're in the vallecula.

94
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,818
Elevate the scope
at a 45-degree angle.

95
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,683
- See the cords?
- Uh-uh.

96
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,347
I'll give you some cricoid
pressure. How's that?

97
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,125
- Uh-uh.
- All the cords should be there.

98
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,824
He's a young guy. Pull up more,
but do not rock back against the teeth.

99
00:04:56,997 --> 00:05:01,367
Aim the end of the handle to
where the wall meets the ceiling.

100
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,831
Can you see the
aryepiglottic folds? Hello?

101
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,700
Sats are dropping. Pratt.

102
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,366
All right, pull out.

103
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,172
You bag. You breathe.

104
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,345
I'm sorry. I ran...

105
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,008
If you were doing what I told you, you
should've been able to pass the tube.

106
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,711
- Maybe you should sit down.
- Yeah.

107
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,219
- Okay.
- I don't feel so good.

108
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,755
All right, I'm in.

109
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,765
- Here, this should keep it from swelling.
- Oh, bless you, Sam.

110
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,870
- What happened to her?
- Nothing.

111
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,036
- It's only the morning test.
- What are you doing with the beeper?

112
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,187
I gave that to Jane.

113
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,206
I don't think she
wanted it, so I offered.

114
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,250
You can't monopolize the beeper.
Residents need the experience.

115
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,048
- She gets airsick.
- What's with your rhabdomyolysis guy?

116
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,748
- He's stable, making urine.
- What about his creatinine?

117
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,654
- I have to check the chart.
- Peak CPK?

118
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,386
- Medicine team's all over it.
- You gotta be all over it.

119
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,724
You cannot let the
internal med docs take over.

120
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,457
- I can't?
- Hey, I'm serious, man.

121
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,102
You've got critical patients,
stay on top of the labs.

122
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,897
But the guy was
ready to hand off...

123
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,563
- And what?
- And it was a good talk.

124
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,939
What's going on with
the PACS system?

125
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,807
Down. They said they should
have it running in an hour.

126
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,812
They've been saying
that since yesterday.

127
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,006
So is it true?

128
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,742
Rumor is you killed an intern.

129
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:25,977
Yeah, I wish.

130
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,621
Everything in this place is
crap. The equipment sucks.

131
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,781
The students are incompetent.
The interns can't finish a chart.

132
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,087
The Residents, they don't
give a damn about their patient.

133
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,753
Yeah, okay, okay, Kovac.

134
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,832
I see what you're gonna say,
that I was the same way. I wasn't.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,333
- I didn't say anything.
- I could chart, clear beds.

136
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,164
I never passed
out tubing a patient.

137
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,203
I know, you were
really, really special.

138
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:50,435
You need to go through in-service
exam results with your Residents.

139
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,542
Have you seen these? See, this
is exactly what I'm talking about.

140
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,807
They don't know jack
about emergency medicine.

141
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,474
Soloman's an idiot. Hope is
annoying and incompetent.

142
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,780
Gates should've stayed
a paramedic, and Jane...

143
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,152
- What's wrong with Jane? She's good.
- No, Jane is creepy. I'm serious.

144
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,987
Always sneaking up on me,
like those twins in <i>The Shining.</i>

145
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,619
Look, in-service shows their strengths
and weaknesses. So focus on that.

146
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,290
They all have their own learning
process, so you need to adjust accordingly.

147
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,403
If the Residents fail, it may be
because you're a bad teacher.

148
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,542
One, two, up on three.

149
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,984
And mommies let go. Okay, good.

150
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,987
Everyone pick up their babies.

151
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,318
Hi.

152
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,924
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm
Abby and, uh, this is Joe.

153
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,760
Hi.

154
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,493
Hi.

155
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,768
Um, am I in the right place? Is
this the mommy-and-baby class?

156
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,071
Yes. Yes, it is.

157
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:05,048
Good. Well, uh, I'm a
mommy and, uh, this is a baby.

158
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,016
Yeah, being
suspended by his crotch.

159
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,387
Excuse me?

160
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,457
You're carrying your
child in a device...

161
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,253
that can cause hip
luxation and spinal injury.

162
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,861
He should be in a sling.

163
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,794
Oh, well, you know,
I'm a doctor, um, and...

164
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,866
Then you'd think
she'd know better.

165
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,969
She's sitting right here.

166
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,739
Well, um, then you should know
that, um, a happy, healthy baby...

167
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,603
is always carried in a sling.

168
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,939
Well, I do know that if
you dress your baby...

169
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,082
like some sort of
designer accessory...

170
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,648
you're headed for problems.

171
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,717
But don't worry, I
work in the ER...

172
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,821
so I'll be there to take care of
her when she comes in, 14...

173
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,581
pregnant with a drug overdose...

174
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,693
Maybe this isn't the
best class for you.

175
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,095
Thank you so much
for the lunch tray, Archie.

176
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,255
I particularly enjoyed
the bread pudding.

177
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,958
You're welcome, Emma.
That's one of my favorites too.

178
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,603
Ah. The return of Goat Boy.

179
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,639
I heard one of the doctors made a charm
bracelet from all they took from his belly.

180
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,901
Here's what we got:
stable CHF, going to Tele.

181
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,602
Seventy-six-year-old lady
with pyelo, had Levaquin.

182
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,305
Incomplete miscarriage.
Do a repeat pelvic, see if...

183
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,814
- Wait a minute. What the hell are these?
- Pass-ons.

184
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:14,614
Her BP's low. Like 90, systolic. It's
up with 2 liters and her crit was 24.

185
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:18,247
- Did you type and cross for transfusion?
- No. That's a good idea. Do that.

186
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:22,157
Two-year-old with possible meningitis.
Ceftriaxone onboard, currently at CT.

187
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,762
Needs an LP when he gets back.

188
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,331
- Morris, we do not sign out spinal taps.
- Since when?

189
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,468
Wait a minute. Hold on.
These aren't pass-ons.

190
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,275
They're train wrecks.
I'm not taking them.

191
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,532
I can't. Max has a soccer
game. I promised I'd be there.

192
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,766
- Who?
- My son. It's a family thing.

193
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,808
Yeah, his family even
know about you yet?

194
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,105
No, we're keeping that
on the low-low for now.

195
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,509
You know what I'm saying?

196
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,980
Exactly. Thanks, dog.

197
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,719
Did you just see that?

198
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,718
Yup, he's your dog boy.

199
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,720
He's not my dog
and he's not my boy.

200
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,483
And we don't use
the two together.

201
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,252
I know.

202
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,993
You gonna take one of these?

203
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,630
Nope, I have a trauma coming in.

204
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:01,290
And you're not always gonna have
another Attending on shift with you.

205
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,802
You need to learn how to
handle these things on your own.

206
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,703
Mr. Jennings is on his way up to
Ortho and Lundquist is out of here.

207
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,810
Nice job, Ray. Here's four more.

208
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,572
Are you kidding me? Is this
about the transport beeper?

209
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,408
And we wrap...

210
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,847
We try to keep it tight
enough to immobilize...

211
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,815
but not to the
point of discomfort.

212
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,716
You don't wanna
cut off circulation.

213
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,880
Soloman, you know,
you didn't do so hot...

214
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,083
on the ortho section
of the in-service.

215
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,091
What's the difference between
a Jones and a dancer fracture?

216
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,831
Dancer's a proximal avulsion,
does great with conservative therapy.

217
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:40,337
Jones is transverse, a little more
distal. There's a good chance of nonunion.

218
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,738
Let me guess, you
had a patient like that.

219
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,343
No.

220
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,343
Right. Come on.

221
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,609
- Who's got somebody in Curtain 2?
- Uh, me, sir.

222
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,547
Forty-eight-year-old, PSVT,
uh, resolved with adenosine...

223
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,348
Excuse me, is
your boss still here?

224
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,181
- Excuse me?
- I need to speak with Archie.

225
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,062
Dr. Morris is not my boss, and
I'm afraid he's gone for the day.

226
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,721
Is there something I
could help you with?

227
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,534
No.

228
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,299
Jane, you need to
focus on cardiology.

229
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,271
What are the options with
a hemodynamically-stable...

230
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,273
wide-complex tachyarrhythmia?

231
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,537
Lidocaine, if you think V-tach.

232
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,408
What else?

233
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,541
Amiodarone.

234
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,346
Okay, I'm guessing amiodarone.

235
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,218
Well, procainamide and
amio can do the trick...

236
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,227
but you wanna stay away
from beta and calcium blockers...

237
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:40,265
because you'll end up with a V-fib
if you have a bypass tract, right?

238
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,995
So how'd you manage to fail every
subsection of the in-service exam?

239
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,639
I guess I just don't test well.

240
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,072
Yeah, well, you
better start. Come on.

241
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,269
- Have you got something to present?
- No, I started with Dr. Kovac...

242
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,812
- Where are your charts?
- I'm still working on them.

243
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,745
Keep them current.
Do them as you go.

244
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,078
What part of this concept
don't you understand?

245
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,212
Five-year-old with
crush injury to abdomen.

246
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,153
He and grandpa were
chopping down a tree.

247
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,019
Grandfather with
chain saw injuries.

248
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,922
Got it. Keep working up your
patients and grab more charts.

249
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,094
He needs O-neg, a
second line. Page Surgery.

250
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,528
- Where are you going?
- Saw injuries can be gnarly.

251
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,534
You need to finish with the patients
you've got before you do anything else.

252
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,369
- Dr. Rasgotra?
- Yeah?

253
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,099
- Hi, I'm Katey Evans. Medical student.
- Hey.

254
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,642
Dr. Crenshaw told me
to shadow you today.

255
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,542
- He did?
- I got the feeling I was on his nerves.

256
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:31,207
- He gives that impression to everyone.
- See you, Katey.

257
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,878
- Friend of yours?
- Hardly.

258
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,488
We went out a couple
times. It didn't work out.

259
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,557
Oh, that's too bad. He's cute.

260
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:42,492
Cute, but he's way too into himself,
and to be honest, he's orally challenged.

261
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,028
Oh, bad breath?

262
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:48,430
Not exactly. He won't
go south of 14th Street.

263
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,831
- You know, he refuses to dine at the Y?
- Oh.

264
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,501
Oh, I'm sorry.

265
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:59,043
This is what I'm talking about,
making friends and saving lives.

266
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,238
Does it get any
better than this, ladies?

267
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,211
No, it does not.

268
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,650
So Mrs. Draper is back for her
27th hospital admission status.

269
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,221
- Post-pancreatic pseudocyst.
- Twenty-seven?

270
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,326
Yes. Tell her the hospital
stopped giving frequent-flier miles.

271
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,758
Oh, and she's a
chronic rectal discomfort.

272
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,899
And you two get to work her
up and review her old charts.

273
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,090
All 27?

274
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:26,167
No, why don't you just forget
all about visit six, 13 and, uh...

275
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,898
What do you think, 21?

276
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,772
Yeah, that should keep it interesting.
It'll be like playing patient roulette.

277
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,209
Be prepared to present
her at afternoon rounds.

278
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,178
Smiles all around.

279
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,746
Maybe he should
use his surgical skills...

280
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,397
to remove that bug from his ass.

281
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,616
Saved. We've been paged.

282
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,850
I'm glad I'm not doing an ER
rotation. I've heard horror stories.

283
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,757
Oh, it's not so bad. Once
you get used to the smell.

284
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,364
- Line is good to go.
- Pressure's 85 after the bolus.

285
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,467
- How much O-neg?
- Forty per kilo, 800 cc's.

286
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,728
Chest and pelvis films are back.
- Let me see.

287
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,873
Sam, your son's school called.
He never showed up for homeroom.

288
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,701
What? I dropped
him off this morning.

289
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,309
Type and cross four units.
He's losing a ton of blood.

290
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,536
- Crush injury?
- Yeah, unstable pelvis.

291
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,238
Open-book fracture
with complete...

292
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,440
SI-joint disruption and
lateral displacement.

293
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,209
- I got the T-POD.
- How's the belly?

294
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,320
Spleen is okay.
Looks like a liver lac.

295
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,749
So he goes to Angio first?

296
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,084
Immobilization.
Hypotension, pelvic fracture...

297
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,385
- Fifty percent mortality.
- Blood in the meatus.

298
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,462
- Tore his urethra, that'll have to wait.
- Along with his liver.

299
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,929
If they can stop pelvic bleeders in
Angio, he might make it to the O.R.

300
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,468
Okay, bring blood, FFP, and
get him on a portable monitor.

301
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,266
It wasn't a very big tree. It was
only about 8 inches in diameter.

302
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,966
I was just finishing the cut
when the chain saw broke...

303
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,554
- Aah!
- Sorry, about that, Mr. King.

304
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,342
We're gonna get you
numbed up right now.

305
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,946
Another five of lido to me.

306
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,743
- How are we doing?
- He's lucky.

307
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,284
Most of these wounds look superficial.
I'm just gonna clean and close.

308
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,546
How's my grandson?

309
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,620
Uh, his injuries are serious.

310
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,191
He's bleeding internally,
but he's hanging in there.

311
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,089
- Can I see him?
- Not right now.

312
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:59,164
We're taking him upstairs and we're
gonna try to stop the bleeding, okay?

313
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,195
You good down here if I
go up to Angio with him?

314
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,597
Yeah.

315
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,362
I'm good. Go.

316
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,165
Okay.

317
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,099
I was being so careful.

318
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,370
I thought he was safe.

319
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,104
Don't worry. We're doing
everything we can to help him.

320
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,341
- Are you almost finished in here?
- No, why?

321
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,954
- I could use your help in Curtain 2.
- You gotta be more specific, Ray.

322
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,486
Morris' little old UTI lady...

323
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,056
the one waiting for a
ride, has a systolic of 55.

324
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,955
Damn it, Morris. All
right, here, keep irrigating.

325
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,447
- Set up another suture kit.
I'll be back. MARQUEZ: Got it.

326
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,864
Seventy-six-year-old, fever and
gram-negative rods on the UA.

327
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,662
Morris said she was tucked,
nothing to do. Guess he lied.

328
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,237
Tachy after 2 liters. He
should've seen this coming.

329
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,896
- Access?
- PIV. We're working on...

330
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,131
Pratt!

331
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,153
Rennie Stevens,
welding-tank explosion.

332
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,737
Second and third-degree
burns over chest, face and arms.

333
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,815
- Vitals?
- Tachy, BP, 138/90, sat 82.

334
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,712
- Other one's more stable.
- Other one?

335
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,321
Luis Escobar, 23, shrapnel
to neck and left chest.

336
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,081
Vitals stable. Good
breath sounds.

337
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,317
- I'll page an Attending.
- I'm an Attending. Put him in Trauma 2.

338
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,586
Jane, you're with Haleh.

339
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,992
Soloman, you're with
me. Trauma 1. Let's go.

340
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,497
Titrate dopamine and mix up Levophed
if she doesn't respond to 10 mics.

341
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,158
- All right.
- All right?

342
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,295
Alex, where are you?

343
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,531
No, you're not. Don't lie to me.

344
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,972
The school called the hospital.

345
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,805
Well, you got 10
minutes to get back...

346
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,139
Soloman, help Sam
make some room.

347
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,874
Give me something for the pain.

348
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,039
Another five of morphine.

349
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,742
Hang tough, we're
gonna help you.

350
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,410
Start a second line. Two
liters of LR, wide open.

351
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,581
- Full thickness over the entire chest.
- I'll alert the Burn Unit.

352
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,885
- Sats down to 83.
- Listen to me, Mr. Stevens.

353
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,086
We need to put a tube
in to help you breathe.

354
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,993
Eight-O and an intubation
tray. I'll be right back.

355
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,224
Talk to me.

356
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,766
Blunt and penetrating
trauma. Thrown against a wall.

357
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,495
Looks like shrapnel to
the upper torso and neck.

358
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,005
- Hey, what's your name, man?
- Luis. Luis Escobar.

359
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,234
How's Rennie?

360
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,344
We're working on
him, now it's your turn.

361
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,104
- Tell me where it hurts.
- My chest.

362
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,273
- BP, 95/65.
- Yup, he's decreased on the left.

363
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,419
- Sats, 92 percent.
- Any pain here?

364
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,779
All right, CBC, chemistry,
coags, type and cross for two...

365
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,790
liter of Ringer's,
C-spine chest and pelvis.

366
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,451
Page Surgery. I'll be back.
Doing good, Mr. Escobar.

367
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,594
That's it, Max.
That's it. Hustle!

368
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,099
- Go, Stuart. Stay with it.
- Come on, Max. Come on, take this guy.

369
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,295
If you can't go around
him, go through him!

370
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,372
- Hey, come on, man.
- What?

371
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,565
You're not setting
a good example.

372
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,702
Come on.

373
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,815
Nice, nice, buddy. You're
killing them out there.

374
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,151
Who's that with your son?

375
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,880
I don't know.

376
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,456
Excuse me, coach?
Who's Max talking to?

377
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,390
Uh, not sure. Said
he was a friend.

378
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,296
Chest x-ray on Escobar.

379
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,800
Pneumothorax on the left. Send
him for a chest tube. I'll be right over.

380
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,735
- Hard time finding a line. JANE:
Dr. Pratt, he's bradying down.

381
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,637
Hold on. Try a saphenous. If
that doesn't work, go central.

382
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,243
- Right.
- Heart rate's in the 40s.

383
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,074
I need to put a tube in your
chest to re-expand your lung.

384
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,239
- Need any help?
- Push 50 mics of fentanyl.

385
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,147
- What's going on with Morris' patient?
- Uh, I think she's okay.

386
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,878
- I handed her off to Gates.
- Gates.

387
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,353
- You left her with Gates?
- Yeah, he's all over it.

388
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,049
All right, you're gonna feel
some pressure here, okay?

389
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,488
Gates is an intern, Ray.
Who's supervising him?

390
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,029
I guess, officially, you are.

391
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,724
Jane, find out what's
going on with Gates.

392
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,896
- I'm not having any luck with the ABG.
- Angle the needle at 45 degrees.

393
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,938
I can't see. My
glasses keep fogging.

394
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,700
Next time you should leave
the HAZMAT uniform at home.

395
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,742
- Feel for the pulse. See that?
- Yo, doc.

396
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,347
Your sheet-metal guy in
Exam 3 lost his foot pulse.

397
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,846
Nurses can't get his leg out.

398
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:41,511
Tell them to give him 5 more morphine
and grab me a Doppler. I'll be there.

399
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:46,617
Someone grab me a central line kit.
This young lady needs a CVP monitor.

400
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,454
You're putting it
in a central line?

401
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,722
Early goal-directed therapy for
sepsis. All the kids are doing it.

402
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,560
- Are we gonna get in trouble?
- No, this lady is in trouble.

403
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,568
We're trying to save
her. That's what we do.

404
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:02,072
God, please give us the strength and
the knowledge to save this sweet woman.

405
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,733
Hallelujah to that, sister.

406
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,831
Good embolization...

407
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,211
of the superior gluteals
and pudendal arteries.

408
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,317
That ought to buy
you a little time.

409
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,252
- Pressure's back down to 60.
- Another 400 of PRBCs.

410
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,084
Crenshaw's standing
by in the O.R.

411
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,058
Looks like the
liver lac opened up.

412
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,220
His heart rate's dropping.
- Damn it.

413
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,730
Yeah, let's transfer
him. One, two, three.

414
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,668
Mic of atropine and
squeeze in the blood.

415
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,771
- Want me to continue bagging?
- No, see what they need in the ER.

416
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,065
I've got this.

417
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,936
Hi, it's me.

418
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,736
Mommy-and-baby was a freak show.

419
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,030
Um, so we're headed to the
park and I thought maybe...

420
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,614
if you had a couple minutes...

421
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,807
you might wanna
come by and say "hi."

422
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:48,284
I'm gonna look for some normal
moms, so we'll be here for a while. Bye.

423
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,291
- Hi.
- Hey.

424
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,758
- Can I sit here?
- Sure.

425
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,438
- Is everything okay?
- She thinks she's pregnant.

426
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:09,800
Oh, congratulations.

427
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,807
- Oh, no.
- No?

428
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,640
No, the father is the husband
of the woman she works for.

429
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:18,148
Oh, wow, that's...

430
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,877
- What's she gonna do?
- I told her to have an abortion.

431
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,851
That's what I did.

432
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:26,459
You got pregnant with the husband
of the woman you work for too?

433
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,317
It happens.

434
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,333
Uh-huh.

435
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,662
What'd she say?

436
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,836
The only husbands that don't
fantasize about banging their nannies...

437
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,976
- Are the ones who are already doing it.
- It's our nanny motto.

438
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,007
- Oh, you're all nannies?
- Yeah. Aren't you?

439
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,573
Yes.

440
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,679
Yes, I am.

441
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,150
- Tube's in position. No pneumo.
- Vent pressure's almost 50.

442
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,383
The chest wall's
restricting lung expansion.

443
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,823
He needs an
escharotomy. 10 blade?

444
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,156
Sats down to 84.

445
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,532
All right, put the vent rate up to 25
and the tidal volume down to 500.

446
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,727
Soloman, I need room, man.

447
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:14,601
Okay, Mr. King. We're gonna
find you a new parking spot.

448
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,605
Mr. King?

449
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,210
Mr. King, can you hear me?
- Son of a bitch.

450
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,540
Pratt. The little head
lac's not so little.

451
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,377
Keep pressure on it. He
must've hit something arterial.

452
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,610
Re-check the crit and
type and cross for two.

453
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,345
Okay, okay, sats are coming up.

454
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,442
- Thank you. HALEH: We
need an Attending in here.

455
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:32,855
Pratt, take a look at this.

456
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,051
Fluid in the spleen?
Looks like a hematoma.

457
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,128
- Where's Surgery?
- Paged them three times.

458
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,957
- Anything in the abdomen?
- Nothing.

459
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,293
- Vitals stable?
- Tachy, but pressure's okay.

460
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,867
Second hematocrit's 38.

461
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,233
- Entrance, exit lateral to the midline.
- Doesn't penetrate platysma.

462
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,532
Burn Unit on two.

463
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,107
IV blew. Can we get
a second line in here?

464
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,711
- Grandpa's crit is down to 29.
- I'll be right there.

465
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,212
- What's going on with Gates?
- Uh, he's asking for a rib spreader.

466
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,908
What the hell would he be
doing with a rib spreader?

467
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,643
I'm not really sure.

468
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,094
Pratt, what do you want me to do?
- Just a sec.

469
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,592
- What's going on out there?
- We were stuck upstairs.

470
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,319
- What do you need?
- Burn Unit is holding.

471
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,895
- Page Kovac.
- Don't bother.

472
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,463
We left him with the pelvic
trauma. The boy crumped in Angio.

473
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,104
All right, Neela, get this guy up to
CT. Ray will fill you in on the way.

474
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,069
Haleh, transfer the
Burn Unit call next door.

475
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,334
- Jam it into overdrive. Go.
- Stay with him.

476
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,137
Come on, ref, that's a foul.

477
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,246
Come on, this is
soccer, not water ballet.

478
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,780
Way to go, buddy. Dig
deep. Work that ball.

479
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,817
Hey, sorry I'm late. I
got hung up at work.

480
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,783
- How are they doing?
- Winning 2-1.

481
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,754
- Go, Stuart, go.
- Come on, Max.

482
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,209
You stay with him, buddy.

483
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,623
Come on, Maxi. Kick in
the afterburners, baby.

484
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,523
Do you know that guy?

485
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,924
No, who is he?

486
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,792
Apparently he's
a friend of Max's.

487
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,460
Never seen him before.

488
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,697
Okay, don't get
fancy, don't get fancy.

489
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,205
Just put it in the
net. Put it in the net.

490
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,042
Goal!

491
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,512
Yes, baby.

492
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,913
That was a rocket, huh?
That's gotta hurt, right?

493
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,981
Yes. All right.

494
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,147
- See that?
- Yeah, that was beautiful.

495
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,192
You were giving them a
taste of Max-imum destruction.

496
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,829
Yeah!

497
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,295
Hey. What the hell do
you think you're doing?

498
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,497
- Did you touch my kid?
- What?

499
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,795
- You touched my kid.
- Wait. He's not your kid?

500
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,961
- Well...
- No, I don't know who this creep is.

501
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,668
Is this how you get your
jollies, touching boys?

502
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,640
- Whoa. You're making a big mistake here.
- No, you made the mistake.

503
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,370
- You freaking pervert.
- Hey. Back off.

504
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,674
- What am I, too big for you?
- Yeah, you...

505
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,576
Sir, are you okay?

506
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,313
Wake up, sir.

507
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,856
- Call 911. Get an ambulance.
- Yeah, and the cops.

508
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,017
No, there's no need
to panic. It's all good.

509
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,857
I'm an ER doctor. Okay,
everybody just back up.

510
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,330
Let me do what I have
to do, and give me some...

511
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:00,868
They spent about a million dollars
on fertility drugs to have this kid.

512
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,168
Look at her. That's
not a million-dollar baby.

513
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,901
Right. Like, take
the hint, lady.

514
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,874
Maybe there's a reason
why Mother Nature...

515
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,981
doesn't want you
having kids of your own.

516
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,545
The woman she
works for is a bitch.

517
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,184
She felt sorry for her
husband. He seemed so lonely.

518
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,692
She was always going away with
her friends and all she did was shop.

519
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:29,028
My boss has closets full
of clothes she never wears.

520
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,931
Which is good for me.

521
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,263
So you wear her clothes?

522
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,929
- You don't?
- No.

523
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,199
- You fool around with her husband?
- No.

524
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,902
- He's ugly?
- No. Oh, no, he's...

525
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,844
He's hot. He's a doctor.

526
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,347
I worked for some doctors.

527
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,247
They wanted the kid safe,
so they let me drive the Lexus.

528
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,878
And they went away a lot, so I
could always use their apartment.

529
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,520
Which they didn't know about.

530
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,889
Of course not.

531
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,459
Of course not.

532
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,058
How are you feeling?

533
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:06,137
I was a little woozy there for a
bit, but I feel better after my nap.

534
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:10,106
Bacitracin and gauze dressing.
These need to come out in seven days.

535
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,040
- I could probably take those out myself.
- No.

536
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,374
You need to come
in for a wound check.

537
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,745
Hey, make sure that guy's x-ray
goes up with him to the Burn Unit.

538
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,115
He's had 3 liters of fluid and
needs 7 more in the first eight hours.

539
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,415
Is there any chance I
can be with my grandson?

540
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,220
I don't think so, but we can
get an update on his condition.

541
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,920
CT's back on Escobar.
Grade 3 splenic lac.

542
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,292
Good. Consent for
Surgery. He's all yours.

543
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,627
My chief wants to
observe him down here.

544
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:39,135
- You told me he tore his spleen.
- With no free blood and stable crits.

545
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,274
His belly's tender, he's
tachycardic, he'll have fluid losses.

546
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,433
The O.R.'s full. We
can't take him anyway.

547
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,340
Well, we can't
keep him down here.

548
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:49,004
We're getting slammed and
he's tying up a trauma room.

549
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,307
Put him in ICU.

550
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,781
Crenshaw says we can't
use our last bed in ICU.

551
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,852
Hey, that's not Crenshaw's call.

552
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,149
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to get rid of him.

553
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,459
If his crits are stable for six
hours, he can go to Telemetry.

554
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:03,755
Neela...

555
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,190
Luis Escobar's
girlfriend is here.

556
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,631
I gotta go find Gates
before he kills somebody.

557
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,499
Hey, when I get back,
that guy better not be here.

558
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,005
Systolic pressure in the 70s after
aggressive fluid resuscitation...

559
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,805
but responded well to a dopamine
infusion at 10 mics per kilo per minute.

560
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,708
- What have you been doing?
- Excuse me.

561
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,975
Central venous oxygen saturation
is in target range at 88 percent.

562
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,609
At this time, patient remains guarded
but stable for Critical Care Service.

563
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,517
- What is that?
- I'm dictating my notes.

564
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,157
And you're kidding me, right?

565
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,953
There's no time to send
stuff to a transcription service.

566
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,151
I need your notes now.

567
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,490
It's so inefficient to
write everything down.

568
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:41,065
Well, that's how we all do
it, so you better figure it out.

569
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,064
What were you doing
with a rib spreader?

570
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,998
One of your victims
from the explosion...

571
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,002
came in with metal
wrapped around his leg.

572
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,732
It was occluding
blood flow to the foot.

573
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,003
I used the rib spreader
to pull the metal off.

574
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,804
It seemed safer than
a blow torch, right?

575
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,002
Yeah, right.

576
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,206
Okay, hold on, hold on.
One second, one second.

577
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:02,018
I get it, okay? You're the cool guy,
the paramedic who became a doctor.

578
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,486
I'm sure that all the
Residents are eating up...

579
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,496
your war stories and
tales from the streets.

580
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,650
- I don't tell war stories.
- But this is the ER.

581
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,729
We have a curriculum for
shaping young doctors, even you.

582
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,332
Oh. Is that what this is? You
feel the need to shape me?

583
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,833
Why don't you teach
me? I like the shape I'm in.

584
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,733
I can't teach somebody who
thinks they know everything.

585
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,540
What are you talking about?

586
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:24,609
You running around here
unsupervised, putting in central lines.

587
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,780
You were busy in a trauma. I
saved some woman and a guy's foot.

588
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,347
- What would happen if you messed up?
- I don't know.

589
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,111
Who would've been
responsible for that? Not you, me.

590
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,720
It would've been my ass on the
line. So do we have to go through this?

591
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,188
I don't know. You gonna
ride my ass every shift?

592
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,623
You're missing the point
here. I didn't mess up.

593
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,887
That's not the point,
and that's your problem.

594
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,394
Who's got the urosepsis case?

595
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,261
- Dr. Gates at your service.
- Maya Tennyson, Critical Care.

596
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,801
- Excuse me, but we're in the middle...
- She's still on dopa at 10?

597
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,235
She's holding her
pressure like a champ.

598
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:57,875
Hm. Nice work with the
early goal-directed therapy.

599
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,411
By the way, I love the dictation. I
can never read anyone's writing here.

600
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,982
Bluetooth. You speak in this
machine and it prints up at the desk.

601
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,949
I like it. This ER needed an
Attending with some initiative.

602
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,748
I'm the Attending.
He's an intern.

603
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:12,289
Well, actually, the
Bluetooth was Dr. Pratt's idea.

604
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,323
I wanna see the rest
of your charts now.

605
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,961
I'll bet you do.

606
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,159
Timmy, do they still
put people's names...

607
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,630
on hats and stuff like
that in the gift shop?

608
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,771
I think so. But If you wanna write
your name on your underwear...

609
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,133
a Sharpie works well.

610
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,275
No, I just need to get
a gift for somebody.

611
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,740
- What happened to you?
- I was attacked by ninjas.

612
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,934
What's it look like?

613
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,273
- Who's this?
- Obnoxious soccer dad.

614
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,779
Blunt head trauma with LOC.

615
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,180
Breathing on his own,
normal vitals. What's open?

616
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,977
- Talk to me.
- Nothing to talk about.

617
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,679
Guy came at me, I defended
myself, I'm patching him up.

618
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:44,948
Why did he come at you?

619
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:49,458
Have you ever been to a kids'
soccer game? Parents are crazy.

620
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:53,429
I would never do anything
to hurt my grandson, Irene.

621
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,931
It was an accident.

622
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,625
What were you thinking?

623
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:00,796
He's only 5 years old. He shouldn't
be anywhere near a chain saw.

624
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:01,997
He wasn't.

625
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,873
Then why is he in surgery?

626
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,305
Hey, I'm Dr. Pratt.

627
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,779
Uh, Dennis King.
This is my wife, Irene.

628
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,142
I can't believe this.

629
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,807
We only leave our son
with family just to be safe...

630
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,613
and this is how we're rewarded.

631
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,982
We're doing everything
we can for Thomas.

632
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,987
Why don't I have a
nurse take you up...

633
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,649
so you can be with him
when he gets out of surgery?

634
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,658
Dennis, Dennis.

635
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,861
I'm sorry. You know I am.

636
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:32,538
I know, Dad. I know.

637
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,141
I raised my two boys by myself.

638
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,141
Wasn't easy being a
single dad back then. I...

639
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,012
I don't think I was
very good at it.

640
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:50,679
I thought I could make up for it
by being a terrific grandfather.

641
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,720
Looks like I blew that too.

642
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,927
Pratt, you got a sec?

643
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,658
Yeah. I'll be right
back, Mr. King.

644
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,694
Thanks.

645
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,031
What's going on?

646
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:09,436
The police are here for Morris
in connection with some assault.

647
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:13,704
And there are two moms with the cops
saying that Morris is a child molester.

648
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,370
What?

649
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,681
I got a feeling the white
mom's got a fracture.

650
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,011
What is Morris' problem?

651
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,518
Brain damage is the first
thing that comes to mind.

652
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:26,125
Dr. Pratt, Escobar's
losing his airway.

653
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,184
Why didn't you intubate
prophylactically?

654
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,263
He didn't seem like he
had respiratory issues.

655
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,866
- He's already got too much swelling.
- Page Crenshaw.

656
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,467
Get someone from ENT down here.

657
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:39,298
- Sats down to 76.
- Somebody get me a smaller tube.

658
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,405
- A 7-5, a 7-0.
- It's too late for that.

659
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,065
- He might need an open trach.
- Heart rate is dropping.

660
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,609
Please help him. He
was just talking to me.

661
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,576
- Seven-0 won't pass.
- He needs a trach.

662
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,649
ENT's in O.R. 2 doing a neck
dissection. They can't come down.

663
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,719
- ENT needs to be here.
- They're not. This guy needs an airway.

664
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,752
- You sure you can do this?
- I think so.

665
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,653
- How many have you done?
- I've assisted on several.

666
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:06,496
All right, O.R. girl, please
do not make me regret this.

667
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,327
Katey, Betadine
and sterile sixes.

668
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,593
Without electrocautery,
this could be messy.

669
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,829
- Haleh, take Tina to the family room.
- Sure.

670
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,098
- No, I wanna stay with
him. No. HALEH: Come on.

671
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,742
We'll come get you as soon
as we make him comfortable.

672
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,310
Okay, 15 blade to me.

673
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,107
Neela.

674
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,420
I was hoping there
would be a reasonable...

675
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,320
explanation for your
incessant paging...

676
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,290
but you know
what, this is not it.

677
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,928
I had to do a tracheostomy tube.

678
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,963
Really? And who told you to
do that? Because I sure didn't.

679
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:43,000
Nobody did. My chief
didn't answer his pages.

680
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,365
- You did this without any supervision?
- Dr. Pratt was here.

681
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:49,030
Oh, great, that
is such a relief.

682
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,200
Unfortunately, your little ER
forest friends don't count anymore.

683
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,381
You wanna be a surgeon,
huh? Wanna be a big-girl doctor?

684
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,641
This isn't Barbie's
Dream Doll Hospital.

685
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,843
I'm an ER Attending. Dr. Rasgotra
was only following my orders.

686
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,284
Oh, I'm sorry,
hello. Dr. Pratt, is it?

687
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,549
I took your silence
for subservience.

688
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,819
You know, not a lot of ER
Attendings have the skills to do a trach.

689
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,053
Very impressive.

690
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,687
Well, you just, uh, take care of
my girl here and we'll call it even.

691
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,663
You don't need
to worry about that.

692
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:19,828
Dr. Rasgotra gets
plenty of my attention.

693
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,837
Oh, I think I can
manage this from here.

694
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,670
Why don't you girls,
uh, finish up down here?

695
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:27,870
You've done more than
enough. Believe me.

696
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,842
Wow, you're so lucky.

697
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,917
- He seems like a great guy.
- Yeah, right.

698
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,713
I'm gonna find the girlfriend,
tell her what's happening.

699
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,253
Hey.

700
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,585
You did good, man.

701
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,649
Thanks.

702
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,422
Must be quiet if you
have time to stand around.

703
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:46,656
How's the kid?

704
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,994
He's gonna pull through.
How's the grandfather?

705
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,863
Uh, he's worried,
but he'll be okay.

706
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:53,938
You make out okay here? I
heard you had two more traumas.

707
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,767
Nothing I couldn't deal with.

708
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,773
If it's that quiet, maybe I'll
leave a little early tonight.

709
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,173
Abby could probably use
some help with the baby.

710
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,370
I bet. Go for it.

711
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,571
- Sure?
- Yeah.

712
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,445
I got it all dialed in. This
place practically runs itself.

713
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,087
Can one of you guys look
at a suspected hand fracture?

714
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,587
- Who ordered the films?
- I did.

715
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,691
Everybody was busy.

716
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,721
I'll take it.

717
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,252
Did you find Alex?

718
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:21,298
Oh, yes, he was ditching
school with a friend at the mall.

719
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,231
Well, I guess I have all
that to look forward to, huh?

720
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,768
Yep.

721
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,636
You saved that guy.
That was so cool.

722
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:29,900
You mean terrifying.

723
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:33,102
Dude, you rocked. Did you
see the look on Crenshaw's face?

724
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,476
The one that suggested he was
gonna punish me for what I just did?

725
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:41,086
You spanked him. And deep
down, I think he probably likes it.

726
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:44,587
It's always those type-A guys who
are so wound up that they go home...

727
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,385
and put on a diaper or wanna
be led around by a leash.

728
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,084
- You're mad.
- Hey. Hey, Neela.

729
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:50,490
Hey.

730
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,927
Uh, Ray Barnett. I don't
think we've officially met.

731
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,464
- Katey.
- Hey.

732
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,397
Um, I'm still getting
some of your mail.

733
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,970
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll try to
change everything over.

734
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,972
I don't mind. I just figured
you might need some of these.

735
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,576
- Thank you.
- Okay.

736
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:12,084
Okay. I'll see you guys
around. It was nice meeting you.

737
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,311
- You two lived together?
- Oh, we were roommates.

738
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,614
I hope you had benefits.

739
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,757
It wasn't like that.
We were just friends.

740
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:21,086
Why? That guy is smoking hot.

741
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,096
Why? Does he have a girlfriend?

742
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,255
Uh, not that I know of.

743
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,835
Just remembered something.
Um, I'll catch up with you later, okay?

744
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,471
Sure.

745
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,494
Witnesses confirm that
the other guy started...

746
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,158
and you just pushed him away.

747
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,531
I told you that.

748
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,197
But that doesn't
explain touching the kid.

749
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,001
I wasn't touching him.

750
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:15,341
My relationship to the boy is
complicated. It's, uh, sort of a secret.

751
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,680
No, no, not like that.

752
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,843
Well, your hand isn't
broken. It's just sprained.

753
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,718
Would've been worth a fracture if
I would've knocked out his teeth.

754
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,518
What's gonna happen to him?

755
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,921
He's going to jail.

756
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,653
What do you think
about that, Max?

757
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,860
Wait, wait, wait.

758
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,025
Don't arrest my dad.

759
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,364
What did he say?

760
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,766
Max, what's going on?

761
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,238
This is where I leave.

762
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,639
Good luck with that, Pops.

763
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:53,416
Mom, Mom, this is my
dad, Dr. Archie Morris.

764
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,048
What's up?

765
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,098
Timmy, did you get it? - Yeah.

766
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,061
- But I didn't get a chance to wrap it.
- Yes. No, it's all good.

767
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,761
Gates, just the man I was looking
for. Here, I got a present for you.

768
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,370
- What's this for?
- It's so, uh, people know who you are.

769
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,735
- Hey, you didn't have to do this.
- Yeah, I did.

770
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,876
Let's see.

771
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,179
What the hell is this?

772
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:26,912
Students wear short coats.

773
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,317
It helps remind everyone, including
you, that you are still learning.

774
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,758
- You feel better now?
- I feel great, man. Yeah.

775
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,195
Gates.

776
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,605
- Hey.
- Hi.

777
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,342
- How long has he been crying?
- Like 10 minutes.

778
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,450
I think he'll settle down.

779
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,650
How was your shift?

780
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,847
Uh, the usual. I had a
5-year-old kid crushed by the tree.

781
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,284
I don't wanna hear stories about
bad things happening to children.

782
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,861
He survived, okay?

783
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,224
How about your day?

784
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,131
It was divine.

785
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,735
Hmm.

786
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,637
I've been thinking.
Maybe you're right.

787
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,140
Maybe we should get
somebody like a nanny...

788
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,006
No, thanks.

789
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,309
- But I thought you wanted...
- I changed my mind.

790
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,654
No nannies.

791
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,823
Just us.

792
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,165
Doesn't sound like
he's settling down, huh?

793
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,267
I'll get him.

794
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,571
Ah.

795
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:08,480
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
What's all that crying?</i>

796
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:13,617
<i>Should I stay Or
should I go now?</i>

797
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:20,525
<i>If I stay it will be trouble
If I go it will be double</i>

798
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,904
That good?

799
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,540
- I should have stayed a paramedic.
- No.

800
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,546
Doctors are much more sexy.

801
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,815
- Mm.
- Uh-huh.

802
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,716
- Rough day?
- Yeah.

803
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,880
One of my Attendings
has it out for me.

804
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,027
Either that or he's in love
with me. I can't tell which.

805
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,730
How was your temp gig?

806
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,389
Same thing, different people.

807
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,695
Nobody knows you.
Nobody really talks to you.

808
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,733
It's like being
the office ghost.

809
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:05,404
Do you want a drink?

810
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,637
No, I have to study.

811
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,246
Knock, knock.

812
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,575
You decent?

813
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,047
I'm in my thong.

814
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,050
Guess what.

815
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,746
I take it your homework's done?

816
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,356
Yeah.

817
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,450
I've got some stuff from
school you need to sign.

818
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,858
I left them on the table.

819
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,456
All right.

820
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,262
There's lasagna in the
fridge if you get hungry later.

821
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,098
Thanks.

822
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:48,118
- Well, you were right about Adam Horner.
- Uh-huh.

823
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:52,749
I ignored him all day, even when he
was looking at me, and tonight he IM'd me.

824
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,790
The Horn Dog comes through.

825
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,191
- It's Horner.
- Watch it. I bruise easy.

826
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,526
Did you save anyone today?

827
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,793
Yes, actually, I separated
a pair of Siamese twins.

828
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,800
Must be gross seeing
all that blood, huh?

829
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,462
No, I saw more blood
when I was a paramedic.

830
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,802
Besides, I'm half
vampire, so I kind of dig it.

831
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,005
Do you want me
to help you study?

832
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,845
No. I want you to work
things out with your mother.

833
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,486
I'd rather shave my head.

834
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,519
Oh, good, I have a
razor in the bathroom.

835
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,816
We can shave it into
a nice little Mohawk.

836
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,323
Okay, I'm just kidding.

837
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,792
I'll talk to her.

838
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,125
Sometime.

839
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,992
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

840
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,797
All right, hey.

841
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,735
Good night, baby girl.

842
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,175
Night, doc.

843
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,223
<i>For the next hour,
we're gonna be talking...</i>

844
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,182
<i>about abdominal pain
in the elderly patient.</i>

845
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,511
<i>What an important
disease this is.</i>

846
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:57,019
No pass-ons, no
major tragedy, no death.

847
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,180
- Gates still here?
- You just missed him.

848
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,826
- What about his charts?
- They're over there.

849
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,258
Hey, from what I've
seen, cat's a good doctor.

850
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,658
He's all right. Plenty of
room for improvement.

851
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,858
Dr. Morris, I heard some guy
attacked you. Are you okay?

852
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,230
Oh, yes. Yeah, I
turned the other cheek.

853
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,770
You know what Jesus said.

854
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,601
You know, when those guys...

855
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:23,538
who trespassed against him, as
those who trespassed against us...

856
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,274
Can I get an amen? - Amen.

857
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,781
Amen.

858
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,954
I have a patient waiting, so...

859
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,214
Good night, Dr. Morris.
God bless you.

860
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,722
God bless all of us.

861
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,756
Hey, you wanna grab a bite
with me and Max and his moms?

862
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:40,262
- You worked things out?
- Yeah, they're pretty cool.

863
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,425
And if everything goes well at Ike's,
we may really work things out tonight...

864
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,070
if you know what I'm saying.

865
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,536
- I think you do.
- You do know they're a couple?

866
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,902
Yeah, a couple of lesbians
in desperate need...

867
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,373
of a Morris sandwich. Unh.

868
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,069
- You know you're sick, right?
- What?

869
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,238
Good night, Archie.

870
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,407
Could you help me
with a two-layer closure?

871
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:00,916
Nope. Nope, not now, I'm off.

872
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,418
Weaver should be
here any minute now.

873
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,587
All right, wait, wait.

874
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,423
First off, you never wanna
inject directly into the wound.

875
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,758
It distorts the
anatomy for your repair.

876
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,729
He needs regional anesthesia.

877
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,892
Have you ever done
an infraorbital block?

878
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,628
Not really.

879
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:23,571
Okay, well, it's pretty easy
once you, uh, know the tricks.

880
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:27,977
Now, first, what you wanna
do is use your left index finger...

881
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,274
to palpate the
infraorbital ridge.

882
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:31,939
- Got it.
- Good.

883
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:36,315
Now you're gonna inject 1
centimeter lateral to the ala...

884
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:40,015
and advance upward until
you're 5 millimeters from the ridge.

885
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:43,161
Good, good. Very good.
