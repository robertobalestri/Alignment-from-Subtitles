1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,440
Did you work on a
Edgar Dixon today?

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
why? What's up?

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,346
First Mission Baptist is
dispensing meds without a license.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,039
It's a felony,
Pratt. A man died.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,185
- And thank you for the hot dog.
- It's my pleasure.

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,615
I'll catch you later, Joe.

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,688
- How long are you staying, Gracie?
- Just till you throw me out.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,096
- Luka, this is...
- Eddie.

10
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,487
Eddie.

11
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,656
Nobody called you a whore.

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,559
- My mom did.
- Your mom's mistaken.

13
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,394
Find budget cuts somewhere
else. No way we're losing you.

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,092
Thanks, but I resigned.

15
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,868
This is Dr. Abby Lockhart.

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,476
I'm calling from County General, and
can you tell him I got his lab results?

17
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:47,775
And he needs to come in
and discuss them. Thanks.

18
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,679
Since when do you call
ER patients from home?

19
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,843
I was worried about this guy.

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,487
I wanna make sure he gets seen.

21
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,454
Isn't that more of a job for
his primary care physician?

22
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,683
He doesn't have one.

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,626
Well, no incentive to get one if
you're gonna make house calls.

24
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,625
I phoned his hotel to make
sure he comes in for follow-up.

25
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,071
- Hotel?
- Yes, he's from out of town.

26
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,067
- Who's this guy?
- It's Eddie Jackson, you met him.

27
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,578
What?

28
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,007
- Nothing.
- Well, why are you acting weird?

29
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,777
I just think it's a little strange,
the amount of personal attention...

30
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,320
you seem to be giving
some guy you met in a bar.

31
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,780
You didn't talk to her, did you?

32
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,859
I didn't see her.

33
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,458
I thought you were
gonna talk to her last night.

34
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,064
Yeah, but I got home so late...

35
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,134
and she was excited about how well
she did on her history presentation, so...

36
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,170
- Tony...
- I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it.

37
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,406
You've been saying
that for a week.

38
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,510
She needs to hear this from you.

39
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:54,307
She needs to know that it was your
idea. Otherwise, she'll never forgive me.

40
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,109
All right, I'll tell her.

41
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,509
Tonight, I promise.

42
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,021
Oh, man, would you
look at this board?

43
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,890
We got cough, cough and vomiting, itchy
feet, diarrhea, diarrhea and vomiting.

44
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,361
Hasn't been decent
trauma in my last three shifts.

45
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,261
People are too damn
careful these days.

46
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,232
Chopper's bringing in some
kind of snowmobile accident.

47
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,936
Called it.

48
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,745
- Is this the snowmobile?
- One of them.

49
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,216
Clarke Sutton, 13, lost
control and hit a fence.

50
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,753
It was an accident.

51
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,083
I was trying to turn.

52
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,860
- Where's Dennis?
- McKay's unloading the older brother.

53
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,359
This one got the worst of it.

54
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,088
His brother carried him
almost a mile to get help.

55
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,063
Can I be in the same
room with Dennis?

56
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,203
- It hurts to breathe.
- Try not to talk.

57
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,237
- Gates, grab the next one, I'll take this.
- I got this covered.

58
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,704
- I got this.
- I got this.

59
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:57,402
- This kid needs someone to treat him.
- That'd be me, I'll call if I need you.

60
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,739
- Knock it off.
- Okay, who gets this patient?

61
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,280
Me. Act like babies, then
that's how I'll treat you.

62
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,315
- Luka, sats are dropping.
- Okay, bag him.

63
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,146
Abby, run ahead and intubate.

64
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,919
- Way to go.
- It was your fault.

65
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,489
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, I am right.

66
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,750
- Don't be an idiot.
- Ass for brains.

67
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,388
Edgar never liked to
talk about his troubles.

68
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,657
In fact, the only thing he
ever talked about was football.

69
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,098
So speaking about that,
ahem, I remember one Sunday...

70
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,604
Edgar looked troubled, and I said,
"Well, is there anything I can do for you?"

71
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,641
So he said, "No, no, Pastor,
you can't help my problem."

72
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,439
I said, "Well, maybe I can't,
but I know someone who can.

73
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,739
God will always listen."

74
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,439
Oh, amen.

75
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,113
Dr. Pratt.

76
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,845
Pastor, that was a nice service.

77
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,984
- Thank you.
- Very nice.

78
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,180
Amen.

79
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:50,422
Um, Mrs. Dixon, I just wanted to
pass on my condolences once again.

80
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:57,326
I just, uh, wanna let you know if
there's anything, anything I can do...

81
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,973
please don't hesitate
to call the hospital.

82
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,310
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.

83
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,669
Thank you.

84
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,250
Greg.

85
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,728
The medical board called me.

86
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,832
Yeah, I bet they did.

87
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,663
They said they're issuing a letter for
us to cease and desist our drug program.

88
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,997
That's not a surprise.

89
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,003
I told them to go to hell.

90
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,733
- You did what?
- They don't understand what we're doing.

91
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,777
Yeah, but I'm sure they
got a pretty clear idea now.

92
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,346
Look, I like what you're
doing, but it doesn't work.

93
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,644
People need a continuity of care.
Church clinic isn't open every day.

94
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,152
How many people do you think we've
helped since we started this program?

95
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,516
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,960
- We're not giving up on the program.
- You're headed for trouble.

97
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,119
My people have
nowhere else to turn to.

98
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,663
They're already in trouble.

99
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,332
I'm out.

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,166
- Sats drifting into the 70s.
- Clarke, stay with us.

101
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,640
- Want me to do that?
- No.

102
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,040
- You sure?
- Yes.

103
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,374
If you wanna help, you
can give me some cricoid.

104
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,211
- I got blood here, what do you want?
- Uh, CBC, LFTs, Chem-7...

105
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,511
- I'm in, bag him.
- UA and a blood gas.

106
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,552
You're probably
not gonna need that.

107
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,161
Decreased on the
left, pull back the ET.

108
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,560
- No, I stopped past the cords.
- It's obviously not, so pull it back.

109
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,563
I'm gonna call the blood bank.

110
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,928
Good idea.

111
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,036
Still decreased, sterile
6's and a chest tube tray.

112
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,176
Hold on, let's not jump the gun.

113
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,235
He's got a bruise and bad sats. Not
jumping the gun, it's a pneumothorax.

114
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,644
- I'll call for a portable chest?
- Let's see what we're dealing with.

115
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,251
Twenty percent of
pneumothoraxes are missed on x-ray.

116
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,012
- You taught me that.
- Nice to know you were listening.

117
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,022
We have time to wait for the
film before we start cutting.

118
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,654
What about the
sliding lung sign?

119
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,861
Okay, lungs are up, no
hemothorax or rib fractures.

120
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,932
What's happening?
Why isn't he sitting up?

121
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,092
They put a tube down
his throat to breathe.

122
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,601
Good bowel sounds.

123
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,432
He got the wind
knocked out of him.

124
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,075
- I had to carry him to the road.
- Good thing you did.

125
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,609
Crit's 38, pressure's
still good, 122/76.

126
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,405
Let me know if anything is sore.

127
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,241
He kept begging
me to let him drive.

128
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,543
- His father's gonna kill me.
- Wait, I thought you two were brothers.

129
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,243
He's my stepbrother.

130
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,920
My dad died when I was little,
my mom remarried in August.

131
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,286
He thinks I'm a screw-up.
This isn't gonna help.

132
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,256
Pretty much wrecked
the snowmobile... Ow!

133
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,192
Left lower quadrant, call Surgery.
- Not so fast.

134
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,993
- It's not a contusion, it's an abrasion.
- He's guarding.

135
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,397
Yeah.

136
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,966
- Do you have to keep doing that?
- Sorry.

137
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,198
He's hemodynamically
stable, his crit's good.

138
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:51,038
Get a CT of his belly. If it's normal,
we won't waste the surgeon's time.

139
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,646
Well, I'm gonna have to
disagree with your assessment.

140
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,113
- Okay.
- Let's run it by Kovac.

141
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,945
Let's not.

142
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,544
I decide when we
present to an Attending.

143
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,590
- No lung sliding.
- What the hell is lung sliding anyway?

144
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,819
Normally, there's lung
movement on ultrasound.

145
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,554
If it's not there, the lung
must be partially deflated.

146
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,096
Show off.

147
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,564
Okay, chest tube tray to Abby.

148
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,464
What? You don't wanna do it now?

149
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,539
I wanted to do it
15 minutes ago.

150
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,606
It looks like Abby was right, and Luka
confirmed the diagnosis radiographically.

151
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,544
Good work, team.

152
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,119
What do I have to do to
get someone to come here?

153
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,192
Dr. Gates from the ER.
That's with an E for emergency.

154
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,330
- You called for a consult?
- I dialed the Hot Surgeons chat line.

155
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,862
Which room?

156
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,694
No "Hey, how you doing?
You look sexy in that white suit"?

157
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,960
Hey, what's wrong?

158
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,638
Besides the fact the
last time I saw you...

159
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,367
the woman you live with assaulted
me and her daughter called me a whore?

160
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,203
I told you I was sorry.

161
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,939
And I don't live with her
anymore. Not for long anyway.

162
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,183
How's Sarah?

163
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,614
We're working through it.

164
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,653
No blood out, it's not the chest.
Xeroform and the Thora-Seal.

165
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,051
Could be cardiac contusion.

166
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,886
Get a 12-lead, hold off on
the blood till troponin's back.

167
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,187
- CT's ready. I'll take him up?
- I'll take him.

168
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,695
- You sure?
- Yeah, in case he crashes.

169
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,739
Well, that wasn't awkward.

170
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,900
Further proof workplace
romance, bad idea.

171
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,012
- Is that so?
- Uh, yeah.

172
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,638
Hey, look, the other night, you kind
of caught me off-guard with that kiss.

173
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,843
And I don't... I have a rule
against dating people at work.

174
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,420
- You do?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,021
It's kind of a new rule.

176
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,418
Oh, yeah.

177
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,058
But a solid rule.

178
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,627
That's cool, really.

179
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,266
This is Dennis' father, Gary.

180
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,700
Gary, this is Dr. Gates
and Dr. Rasgotra.

181
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,067
- Where's Clarke?
- Oh, upstairs for more x-rays.

182
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,772
Is this a social visit?

183
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,432
Tony asked for a consult.

184
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,175
I hope you're happy now.

185
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,940
I'm sorry. We were
being really careful.

186
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,947
You obviously weren't if
you put Clarke in the hospital.

187
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,247
I wanna see my son.

188
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,049
Where is he?

189
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,413
Lily, could you...?

190
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,025
- I can take you to him, sir.
- Thank you.

191
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,458
You better pray he's all right.

192
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,203
Uh, Neela, I'm sorry you
had to come down here.

193
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,863
He doesn't need a consult.

194
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,032
Well, I'm here now,
and I'm almost finished.

195
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,771
Can you explain to him why this patient
is not a good candidate for surgery?

196
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,279
I'm suggesting we
admit him for observation.

197
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,442
Why? His kidneys look good, liver
and spleen appear to be normal.

198
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,086
Did I miss something on the CT?

199
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,654
An occult injury could
take time to declare itself.

200
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,121
- He's right.
- No, he's not.

201
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,055
The surgeon concurs
with my assessment.

202
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,492
Hey, don't worry, boss, I'm not
one of those "I told you so" kids.

203
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,494
- Can I speak to you outside?
- Certainly.

204
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,894
Okay. Not you.

205
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,325
Sammy.

206
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,494
Hey, guys.

207
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,070
- Ben, hello.
- Hey, Gracie.

208
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,765
What's up, Alex? ALEX: Hey.

209
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,275
Alex is signing up for the
volunteen program today.

210
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,140
He's really excited about it.

211
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,613
I had to practically drag
him here by his ears.

212
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,184
Even if you volunteer for
a couple of hours a week...

213
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,651
it will still help on your
college applications.

214
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,620
- Maybe you'll even like it.
- Keep telling yourself that, Mom.

215
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,421
- When I was your age, I had two jobs.
- Yeah, doing what, milking the <i>T. rex?</i>

216
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,922
I worked on the Milfords'
farm before school, smartass.

217
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,192
And at night, I worked
in Addison's Bakery.

218
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,495
I can take Alex to
the volunteer center.

219
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,001
That's great, thank you, Ben.

220
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,164
Well, actually, I probably know
this hospital better than you do.

221
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,800
Great, then you can give me the tour.
I still can't find the gift shop, come on.

222
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,311
Ha-ha. So...

223
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,546
He gets cuter
every time I see him.

224
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,549
- Ben.
- I heard you.

225
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,016
You should be
going after that one.

226
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,455
It's a little tricky dating
someone you work with.

227
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,152
What's tricky about it?

228
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,320
- Having sex without getting caught?
- Gracie.

229
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,695
Look, honey, I know
what your life has been like.

230
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,066
Trust me, Sammy, I know.

231
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,135
All the women in our
family are the same.

232
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:20,804
Very fertile, allergic to chestnuts,
prone to bladder infections.

233
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,477
And we all have that damn gene
that predisposes us to bad boys.

234
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,878
Chestnuts?

235
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,853
Sammy, life is short.

236
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,185
You deserve to be happy.

237
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,088
You deserve a good man.

238
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,025
If you like this guy, go for it.

239
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,759
The least you can do
is give me an honest...

240
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,596
- and professional opinion.
- I did.

241
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,236
- You didn't.
- How would you know?

242
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,430
- You're not a surgeon.
- Neither are you.

243
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,437
Sorry, sorry, look...

244
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,408
No, I came down, I assessed
and made a professional call.

245
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,946
Your opinion isn't
professional, it's personal.

246
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:59,051
The only reason why you're siding with
Gates is because you're screwing him.

247
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,350
I can't believe
you just said that.

248
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,072
So it's true?

249
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,119
No. If it were, it's
none of your business.

250
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,887
- It has nothing to do with this case.
- It does if it's clouding your judgment.

251
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,697
Get an Attending
to weigh in on this.

252
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,196
- No.
- No.

253
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:17,030
Hey, somebody wanna tell me
what the hell's going on here?

254
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,033
Oh, so everything's
just all good now, huh?

255
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,641
Well, somebody better have
a good explanation. Ray?

256
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,141
Okay, a 13-year-old drove
a snowmobile into a fence.

257
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,542
Normal CT, stable crit and BP.

258
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,412
Gates wanted a Surgical
consult. I said we didn't need one.

259
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,611
- He decided to call Neela anyway.
- Better safe than sorry, right?

260
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,483
Wrong, it wasn't
your call to make.

261
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:37,715
Ray's above you.

262
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,383
Have a problem with your Resident
or with his judgment, call an Attending.

263
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,723
I wanted to present to Kovac.
- And I didn't.

264
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,330
He was busy with another trauma.

265
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,899
Now they've taken the
hospital's last surgical bed.

266
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,663
- That kid needs 24-hour observation.
- You can't give up the last surgical bed.

267
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,965
- I need to follow serial exams.
- Do it here.

268
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,438
- You're full.
- Send him home.

269
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,668
Have him come back for re-exam.
- Exactly.

270
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,641
- I'm trying to help you guys here.
- No.

271
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,145
Give up your last surgical
bed and we get stuck...

272
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,807
boarding a real surgical
train wreck here for days.

273
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,853
- Ray's patient, Ray's call.
- Fine, keep him here, less work for me.

274
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,491
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you better be right.

275
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,326
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, boss.

276
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,390
- Luka.
- Yeah?

277
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,193
Did you get to speak to Angela
Gilliam about Edgar Dixon?

278
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,233
- Who?
- The guy from the church clinic.

279
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:28,000
- Oh, yeah, she said she'd look into it.
- All right, I'm just a little concerned.

280
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,973
Someone called the medical
board, and they called the church.

281
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,875
- Okay, I'll talk to her again.
- All right, thanks.

282
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,918
- You looking for something?
- A patient.

283
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,645
Which one?

284
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,156
Hockey dad, Jim Singer,
30, hockey puck versus face.

285
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,420
It was a slap shot.

286
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,062
This is his son, Jimmy Jr.

287
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,391
- God, he spit out his teeth.
- Okay, uh, Jimmy.

288
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,228
We're gonna fix your dad
up, and you get to play Xbox.

289
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,427
Okay, Margo, you take Jimmy.

290
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,503
- How you doing, sir?
- I can't breathe.

291
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,574
A fractured jaw, multiple broken
teeth, pulse ox is down to 88.

292
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,906
Okay, he needs an airway.
Pratt, you want a piece of this?

293
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,904
Sure.

294
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,688
How come they didn't
bring Clarke back?

295
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,627
Probably moved him to another
bed to free up the Trauma Room.

296
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,664
And that could be a good sign.

297
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,802
Your stepfather
hasn't come by, huh?

298
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,295
No.

299
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,302
Why didn't you tell him you
weren't the one who was driving?

300
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,980
What's the point?

301
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,046
I don't know, maybe so that
he knows you didn't do this.

302
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,387
He'd still find a
way to blame me.

303
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,115
At least, now he can't
get mad at Clarke too.

304
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,317
You two are close?

305
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,691
Yeah, I guess.

306
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,996
First, it was kind of weird
having a little brother.

307
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,196
But he's cool.

308
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,941
His dad's really strict on him.

309
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,403
I'm afraid he thinks
that I'm a bad influence.

310
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,509
Sometimes let him do
things his father doesn't.

311
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,813
Like drive the snowmobile?

312
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,023
I'll find out how
he's doing, okay?

313
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,019
Thanks.

314
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,697
We're never gonna see the cords.

315
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,493
Let's bag him up and prep
the neck for a Seldinger crike.

316
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,000
What's the status on the
other kid, Clarke Sutton?

317
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,638
CT showed persistent pneumo.

318
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,037
Kovac put in a second tube, other
than that, he's good. Try Exam 3.

319
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,265
Thanks.

320
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,936
Dr. Pratt, I'd like you to stop by
my office at 4 today, if that's possible.

321
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,207
- Cricothyroid is right here.
- Yeah. Um...

322
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,146
- Did you to talk to
Dr. Kovac? ANGELA: Yes.

323
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,345
We need to have a quick sit-down with
the hospital lawyers about Edgar Dixon.

324
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,887
Guide wire.

325
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,719
I was at his funeral today.

326
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,122
I spoke to his wife. She's
not pressing charges.

327
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,819
Not the problem, the board is.

328
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,898
They're not happy Mr. Dixon was
getting his medications through his church.

329
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,625
Medications that
you distributed.

330
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,669
Yeah, but who got the
board involved in this?

331
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,364
I don't know. Four o'clock?

332
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,504
- Abby, here's your introducer.
- Greg.

333
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,545
- We got a hot MI five minutes out.
- Uh, Greg.

334
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,045
Yeah, all right. Uh...

335
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,548
Chest x-ray, call for a
vent, page Head and Neck.

336
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,050
And, uh, come find
me when you're done.

337
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,179
Do either of these
belong to you?

338
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,415
Hey, how'd it go?

339
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,526
Spectacular.

340
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,253
Sarcasm is a poor
substitute for wit.

341
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,194
- Do you know who said that, young man?
- Do I care?

342
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,596
Alex, don't be rude.
Say you're sorry.

343
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,737
- Just relax, okay?
- Hey, don't tell me to relax.

344
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,165
I think it's time we went home.

345
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,707
Okay, let's go.

346
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,338
March.

347
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:03,954
Hey.

348
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:08,391
So, uh, you finally get
things sorted out with Neela?

349
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,189
There's nothing
to sort out, man.

350
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,629
You sure? Because it looks like
you got some sorting out to do.

351
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,268
If you need my advice, all
you have to do is talk to...

352
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,301
Oh, no, no, no, I
don't need your advice.

353
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,031
I don't want your advice. I
took your advice, remember?

354
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,473
You know, "Give her some time,
Ray. Give her some space, Ray."

355
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,044
Yeah, I did that.

356
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,307
I gave her so much time and space,
she started seeing somebody else.

357
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,883
- Thank you for the advice, Pratt.
- What, so I...?

358
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,784
Stop acting like a baby.

359
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,049
Why are you even
here? Nobody invited you.

360
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,592
Hey, it's time you started
showing a little respect.

361
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,128
And you need to mind your
own damn business, bitch.

362
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,592
Don't you ever talk...

363
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,860
And don't you ever touch me.
- Hey.

364
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,969
You ever raise your hand to me or
your mother or any other woman...

365
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,604
I'll break every bone
in your sullen little body.

366
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,471
Grandma's got some game. - Ray.

367
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,672
Your snowmobile kid's
not looking too good.

368
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,677
The one you insisted
didn't need surgery?

369
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,289
Hey, I got this.

370
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,620
Thanks.

371
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,890
Yeah, okay.

372
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,398
Hey, look, um...

373
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,128
I'm sorry about Alex. You
know, he's not always like that.

374
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,706
- He's had a rough year.
- You don't need to apologize for him.

375
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,916
I just don't want you
to think that he's...

376
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,707
That he's what?

377
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,709
That he's a teenager?

378
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,778
Look, Sam, I was a
holy terror at his age.

379
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,114
My principal suspended me
from school one time for fighting.

380
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,880
So you know what I did?

381
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,547
- I slashed all the tires on his Corvette.
- Oh.

382
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,492
- That is a little delinquent.
- Yeah, I was a real piece of work.

383
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,558
My mom raised me by herself
too, Sam, so I know it's not easy.

384
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,732
We fought every single day
for probably 10 straight years.

385
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,168
And now we talk at least once
a week, and we're best friends.

386
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,871
And in time, I'm sure
you and Alex will be too.

387
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,746
Hey, have you seen Dr. Pratt?

388
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,886
- In the ambulance bay, waiting on a rig.
- Thanks.

389
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,217
I have a working girl with a
mandible dislocation. Tried everything.

390
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,983
Know any tricks?
No pun intended.

391
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,354
- Can this wait?
- No, I've paged Kovac and Pratt.

392
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,393
She's premedicated.
They're all tied up.

393
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,326
I've tried everything,
it won't budge.

394
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,592
- I gave a hundred of fent.
- Add some midazolam.

395
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,429
How'd you do this? Big yawn?

396
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,231
From what I gather, it was
an oral occupational injury...

397
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,704
- she got while performing a service.
- Oh.

398
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,399
Okay.

399
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,271
- Two milligrams in.
- Did you try it from behind?

400
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,277
Oh, you're talking to me?

401
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,609
Relocating the mandible?

402
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,013
Oh, no, that's a new one.

403
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,745
From the back, you've got
leverage for downward force...

404
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,787
and you could put
your weight into it.

405
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,118
- Makes sense.
- You also get a better grip.

406
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,788
Hey, Tony, got a visitor.

407
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,623
Sarah, what are you doing here?

408
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,527
I went up to your room.

409
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,634
I saw your boxes.

410
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,269
Why didn't you tell me?

411
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,738
Mmm.

412
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,032
I was going to.

413
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,504
You lied to me.

414
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,610
Sarah, this isn't a good
time. Go in the break room.

415
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,907
- Go with Sam, I'll be there in a few...
- You wanna leave, then leave.

416
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,482
- I don't care anymore.
- Sarah.

417
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,142
- You want me to get her?
- Go ahead, I got this.

418
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,789
You okay?

419
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,650
Sarah, wait.

420
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,093
Hey, stop and listen to me.

421
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,290
No, you can't tell me what
to do, you're not my dad.

422
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,766
Yes, but I'm your friend.

423
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,269
Friends don't leave.

424
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,951
Damn it, abdomen's
rigid with fever.

425
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,582
- Crit's stable, he's not bleeding.
- Could be a bowel perf with peritonitis.

426
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,228
Blood cultures and Zosyn 3.375.

427
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,954
- Should I get Gates?
- No, no, no, I need Surgery down here.

428
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,331
I already called them.

429
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,660
Okay, mix up dopamine.

430
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,234
Dennis? Dennis, can you hear me?

431
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,338
I need you to start fighting.
Your brother wants to talk to you.

432
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,441
Page Neela. Tell her
I need her here now.

433
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,010
Here you go.

434
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,814
"Thank you, Tony."
You're welcome, Sarah.

435
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,145
Hey, come on, you can't
be mad at me forever.

436
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,342
Why not?

437
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,250
Because of this.

438
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,853
- What are you doing?
- My sympathetic doctor face.

439
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,121
You look stupid.

440
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,593
No? You know what, you're
making me bring out the big guns.

441
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,701
When somebody's really sick,
and it's very fatal, I say to them:

442
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,359
"Mr. Smith, it's very fatal.

443
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,769
You're very sick, the tumor's
too big for your very tiny little head.

444
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,533
It's fatal, you're
not gonna live.

445
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,062
- Okay, stop.
- You're gonna die."

446
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,883
And then I give them
this face. Then I go:

447
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,275
Stop, stop it.

448
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,242
It's not funny.

449
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,046
- I'm mad at you.
- I know, I'm sorry.

450
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,246
I wanted to tell you.

451
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,120
Why do you have to go?

452
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,050
Because it's the right thing.

453
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,992
Is it because of Neela?

454
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,230
You called her?

455
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:18,871
Well, she was worried about you.

456
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,303
Come on, come on.

457
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,738
- What's happening?
- Free air under the diaphragm.

458
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,505
- Systolic's 90 after two liters.
- Throw in a subclavian, then to the O.R.

459
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,844
- He seemed okay. Where's his stepfather?
- I sent Dawn to find him.

460
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,144
- Thanks for coming.
- It's my job, Ray.

461
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,514
Cordis introducer.

462
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,557
Prime the infuser.

463
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,354
All right.

464
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,588
Hm.

465
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,424
You have a minute?

466
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,500
Yeah, why? What's up?

467
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,903
It was me, I called the medical
board about Edgar Dixon.

468
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,563
You?

469
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,433
Why the hell would you do that?

470
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,408
I heard he was getting his meds
from some doctor at a church.

471
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,571
- I thought it was an unlicensed crackpot.
- Oh, Abby.

472
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,582
- I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.

473
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:09,017
- I thought I was doing the right thing.
- You were, we both were.

474
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,681
Sometimes you do the right thing,
and you still get shafted, don't sweat it.

475
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,794
Hey, Greg, these detectives
would like to talk to you.

476
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,020
About what?

477
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,461
Your involvement with a
patient named Edgar Dixon.

478
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:22,431
- I called Angela, she's on her way down.
- All right, thanks.

479
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,436
Dr. Pratt, is there someplace
we could go talk in private?

480
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,542
Yeah, sure.

481
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,710
Right this way.

482
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,777
Yo, Abby, I've
been looking for you.

483
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,578
That patient you
were asking about?

484
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,380
- Phoned, he left a message.
- Thanks.

485
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,488
Let me guess, your
friend Eddie again?

486
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,285
- What, are you jealous?
- No, I just don't understand...

487
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,825
why you're giving this
guy so much attention.

488
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,895
He's a 60-year-old
man with lung disease.

489
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,259
I'm just trying to help him out.

490
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,635
Hi.

491
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,498
Hi, Kerry.

492
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,505
- Uh, we can talk about this later.
- Or not.

493
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,015
Is everything all right?

494
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,954
Yeah, just a disagreement
about a patient.

495
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,125
Mmm.

496
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,888
Gotcha.

497
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,634
I still can't believe
you're leaving.

498
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,932
Yeah, it feels a little weird.

499
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:38,009
Scary, but, uh, it's exciting.

500
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,546
I'm actually gonna
miss this place.

501
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,716
- You know, I...
- Listen, I just want...

502
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:51,947
- No, no.
- No, go ahead.

503
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,558
- No.
- You go.

504
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,557
Um...

505
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:04,528
I just wanna say that I think
that you've probably seen me...

506
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:12,635
at my best and, um, at my worst.

507
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,145
And even though we didn't
always see eye to eye...

508
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:23,948
you helped me go from a
nurse to a med student...

509
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,254
to a doctor.

510
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,559
To a mom.

511
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,863
- I'm the one who's supposed to be upset.
- I know, sorry. Heh.

512
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,610
You were always there
as a nurse and a doctor.

513
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:58,190
And most importantly, you've
always been here as my friend.

514
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,596
Do you think this happens to the
guys when one of them leaves?

515
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,642
I heard Carter bawled
like a baby when he left.

516
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,147
And I'll miss you.

517
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,881
Thank you.

518
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,992
Now, it's time for us to
take care of ourselves.

519
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,129
You can still hang
out with Tony.

520
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,320
It won't be the same.

521
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,624
No, but it will still be good.

522
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,234
You can go to Tony's place
when I get on your nerves.

523
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,387
Easy, I don't want
the kid living with me.

524
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:47,100
I can stay at your
place sometimes?

525
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,501
If it's okay with your mom.

526
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,075
I am gonna have a
swinging bachelor pad.

527
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:56,614
I'm talking big-screen TV over the Jacuzzi,
trampoline and a shark tank, the works.

528
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,910
Nothing stays the
same forever, Sarah.

529
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,848
That's part of growing up.

530
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,517
Besides, you won't care
about me in a few years anyway.

531
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,955
You'll run off and marry
that horndog character...

532
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,788
and have six kids
and eight cats.

533
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,088
We broke up.

534
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,286
- What?
- Yeah.

535
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,456
Oh. God, you know, I
really never liked that guy.

536
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,192
It was my fault.

537
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,360
He found out I
like Kevin Mclntyre.

538
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,198
Jezebel.

539
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,376
Better get going, kiddo.

540
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,647
Let Tony get back to work.

541
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,819
Hey, hey.

542
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,084
Baby girl.

543
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,139
His vitals have stabilized.
Get him up to O.R. 2.

544
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,542
- I'll call you when he's out of surgery.
- Okay, thanks.

545
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,173
Neela.

546
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,751
- Neela, I need to say something.
- No, you don't.

547
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,253
You did what you thought
was right, I respect that.

548
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,256
No, see, no, that's not it.

549
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,721
Well, what is it?

550
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,157
Uh...

551
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,823
This is probably wrong, I know.

552
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,695
It's the wrong place,
wrong time, but, uh...

553
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,995
- Why didn't somebody page me?
- We handled it.

554
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,563
What happened?

555
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,936
Seems that your patient
has a perforated viscus.

556
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,738
Really? Good thing we didn't
send him home, rock star.

557
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,245
Looks like he needed
observation after all.

558
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,680
It's not a small-bowel
perforation, okay, Tony?

559
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,445
- Has nothing to do with seatbelt sign.
- How'd you figure?

560
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,283
Small bowel doesn't seed the peritoneum
like this. Colonic, maybe diverticular.

561
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,154
Really? Interesting,
tell me more, doctor.

562
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,257
Where are they taking Dennis?

563
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:56,192
- To Surgery, if you really care.
- What's that supposed to mean?

564
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,270
- Sent a nurse to find you 30 minutes ago.
- I was with my son.

565
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,929
Yeah, this one needed you too.

566
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,098
No, you know, I'm sorry.
Uh, he needed a parent.

567
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,642
- I should've called his mother.
- Hey. You're out of line.

568
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:08,804
Neither of them would be here if
Dennis wasn't screwing around.

569
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,143
Dennis wasn't even
driving, Clarke was.

570
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,682
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

571
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:16,384
But did you bother to ask him? No,
you just blamed him from the get-go.

572
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:19,150
- Why didn't he say something?
- Would you have believed him?

573
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,158
He was trying to protect his
brother. That's what big brothers do.

574
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,889
- Dennis is older, should've known better.
- He's 15.

575
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,825
Do you know that he carried Clarke
almost a mile to the road to get help?

576
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,564
So instead of busting his balls,
maybe you should be thanking him.

577
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,675
He probably saved
your son's life.

578
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,936
You know, I don't
think I like your attitude.

579
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,080
I don't like the way
you treat your kid.

580
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,272
Where do you get off
talking to me like this?

581
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,349
Where's your supervisor?

582
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,248
You don't know a damn
thing about me or my family.

583
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,581
No, no, no, that's wrong.

584
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,624
Because I know that Dennis is a good
kid, and I know that you are an asshole.

585
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,261
If I were you, I'd start
to treat him a little better.

586
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,522
Couple of years, he's
gonna be bigger than you.

587
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,824
He's gonna remember
you treated him like crap.

588
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,266
And one day, he is
gonna kick your ass, okay?

589
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,567
You got a valid medical
license, Dr. Pratt?

590
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:11,209
Of course.

591
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,537
A pharmacist's license?

592
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,872
My license allows me
to write prescriptions.

593
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,983
Yeah, write, yeah, but
diverting controlled substances...

594
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,551
to a non-authorized
distributor, that's a felony.

595
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,654
I wasn't diverting anything,
I was treating patients.

596
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,519
- At this illegal clinic of yours?
- Illegal clinic?

597
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,457
All right, fellas, let's not
get carried away here, okay?

598
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,961
I was helping at a church
where most of the congregation...

599
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,862
- doesn't have health insurance.
- Like the man that you killed?

600
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,365
Isn't one of you supposed
to be the good cop?

601
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,066
Ray.

602
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,732
Look, Dr. Weaver, I just spent
the whole day with this great kid...

603
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,742
who saved his
little brother's life.

604
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:50,508
When his stepfather came and started
to belittle him in front of everyone...

605
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,752
He just remind me of
someone I used to know.

606
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,286
Yeah, I was just
coming to say goodbye.

607
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,983
Oh.

608
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,086
I may have done a great
disservice to the world of rock...

609
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,922
keeping you here, but you
could be a great doctor, Ray.

610
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,096
I kind of thought I was.

611
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,425
I'm kidding.

612
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,159
Sort of.

613
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,898
Wow. Um...

614
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,607
Thank you, Dr. Weaver.
Thank you for everything.

615
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,536
So, what do we do now?

616
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,804
Hug? Kiss?

617
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:22,871
Oh, right.

618
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,745
So, what's next, you guys
gonna beat me with a rubber hose?

619
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,443
- What the hell is going on?
- Dr. Pratt is under arrest.

620
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,419
- On what charges?
- Violating the Controlled Substance Act.

621
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,786
- You believe these jokers?
- Had to handcuff him?

622
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,292
- It's a felony charge.
- Come on, you can't do this.

623
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,625
Back off, doc, unless
you wanna go with him.

624
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,107
She's playing with the pets.

625
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:53,644
I'm looking for my camera, then
suddenly, we hear this god-awful scream.

626
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:57,146
And we see this billy goat
has Sammy by the pigtails.

627
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,046
Speak of the devil.

628
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,983
Gracie invited me for beers.

629
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,921
She did?

630
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,728
- Hi, Mr. Owens.
- Evening, Sam.

631
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,830
Don't worry, I'm not
staying for dinner.

632
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,489
- Thanks for the dessert, Gracie.
- Anytime, Bennet.

633
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,159
I baked a blueberry pie,
I'm making fish and chips.

634
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,669
- Night, Sam.
- Need a hand with anything, Mr. Owens?

635
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,831
No, I'm good, thanks.

636
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,233
I was just telling the boys...

637
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,278
about how the goat ate
your pigtails at the petting zoo.

638
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,678
Great. Where's Alex?

639
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,409
He's in his room, he's
doing his homework.

640
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,144
At least, he better be.

641
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,331
Nice shot.

642
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,532
Hey, what are you doing here?

643
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,034
Why didn't you come
back to the hospital?

644
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,570
How'd you find me?

645
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,307
Guy at your hotel
said you might be here.

646
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:00,276
In case you're interested, tests show
your lungs aren't expanding properly.

647
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,708
They've become fibrotic.

648
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,106
Guess I'll have to
switch to menthols.

649
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,887
You didn't have to come here.

650
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,317
Eight ball, corner pocket.

651
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,619
You're not getting enough
oxygen in your blood.

652
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:17,957
You're gonna need an echocardiogram
to check your cardiac function.

653
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,394
Better luck next time, chief.

654
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,202
You need to be
referred to a specialist.

655
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,497
No more doctor stuff.

656
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,610
Well, we need to find out
what's causing this, Eddie.

657
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,237
No, we don't. Abby, listen...

658
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,578
I don't understand why you got the tests
if you weren't going to follow through.

659
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,481
I don't care about
my damn lungs.

660
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:45,752
I didn't keep coming to
see you for health reasons.

661
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,251
Okay, well, then what?
Talk to me, what's going on?

662
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,187
Uh...

663
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,563
I've been taking care
of myself my whole life.

664
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,865
Usually, at the
expense of others.

665
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:07,277
I appreciate your concern...

666
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,849
but I don't deserve it.

667
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,883
You know what? I
shouldn't have come here.

668
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,358
- Abby.
- Look, just stay away from me, okay?

669
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,801
- Let me explain something.
- You don't have to, it's just a mistake.

670
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,305
- I know what you're feeling.
- I don't think you do.

671
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,874
I don't know what I'm feeling.

672
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:41,138
You're right, I didn't need to come
here, and I shouldn't have come.

673
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,872
Abby, I lied to you.

674
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,483
I didn't wanna scare you off.

675
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,879
My name isn't Jackson.

676
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,316
It's Wyczenski.

677
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,319
I'm your father.

678
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,750
Yeah, I talked to
Maggie a while back.

679
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,895
- Probably going on three years...
- No.

680
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,146
I caught up on you
and your brother, Eric.

681
00:34:59,170 --> 00:34:59,793
No, no, no.

682
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,799
- Yeah, before she started screaming.
- This is not happening.

683
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:03,992
Yeah, it is.

684
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,137
She told me you're
working here in Chicago.

685
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,603
No, why are you doing this?

686
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,332
I wanted to see for myself.

687
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,239
- After 30 years?
- Yeah, I, uh...

688
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,971
I wanted to see what sort of
a person you grew up to be.

689
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,447
- Oh, God, I can't do this.
- Took me two years to work up the nerve.

690
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,519
One of the nurses
at the Triage desk.

691
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,985
She pointed you out to
me, and I got cold feet.

692
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,182
- Taxi!
- If you hadn't walked into the bar, I...

693
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,023
I probably would have left
without ever speaking to you.

694
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,691
But when I met you, I
wanted to know more, but I...

695
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,928
I didn't have the guts, because I
thought you'd tell me to go away.

696
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:41,437
Well, guess what, you were
right. Go away, go away.

697
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,165
No, Abby.

698
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,742
Abby, please.

699
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,673
No, and just leave
me alone, all right?

700
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,750
You don't get to
do this. It's not fair.

701
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,021
Hey, Kerry.

702
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,356
- Hey.
- Hey.

703
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,627
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to Pratt.

704
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,327
I'm on my way to bail him out.

705
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,838
Yeah, that's one of those parts of
the job they never tell you about.

706
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,806
Just one of the many parts
that I am not gonna miss.

707
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,110
Look, I never had
the chance to tell you...

708
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:21,469
Luka.

709
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,241
Luka, you know what? I'm
done talking about this, really.

710
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,850
I know, but, hey.

711
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,009
You... You hired me.

712
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,179
I still remember my first day.

713
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,588
An oxygen tank rocketed
through the ER, almost killed me.

714
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,820
Well, no one ever said this
was the safest place to work.

715
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,325
You... You changed my
life by giving me this job.

716
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,030
You may have even saved it.

717
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:56,508
I don't know where I'd be
if I hadn't found this place.

718
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,051
And you taught me a lot.

719
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,315
Thank you.

720
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,825
Come here, you big Croat.

721
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,305
You know what? Don't get up...

722
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:24,932
Don't get caught up
in the politics, all right?

723
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,547
A good hospital is about
people and medicine.

724
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,443
Thank you.

725
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,624
I'll see you around sometime.

726
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,283
Yeah.

727
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,594
Luka.

728
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,635
Take care of this place for me.

729
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,940
I will.

730
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,081
Can you hold it up? Right there.

731
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,926
You can't sweat me up in here.

732
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:35,811
- It's getting late, so I better get going.
- But we don't even work tomorrow.

733
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,109
Yeah, but I'm like Gracie,
and I need my beauty sleep.

734
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:44,723
Well, you could sleep
here tonight if you want.

735
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,821
I mean, it would save
you all that driving.

736
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,020
Yeah, but you have that rule
against workplace fraternization.

737
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,827
Yeah, it's actually more
of a guideline than a rule.

738
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,229
And it's, um...

739
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,463
Applies more to
doctors than to nurses.

740
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,709
- Hm. That's good to know.
- Mm-hm.

741
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,473
And Alex and Gracie
would be okay with this?

742
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,182
Mmm.

743
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,847
Come on.

744
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,279
Here's a two-bedroom on
Lake Shore with a concierge.

745
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,015
I always wanted to live in
a building with a concierge.

746
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,957
- You can't afford a place on Lake Shore.
- It's 3600 a month.

747
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,257
- Like I said.
- Eighteen hundred apiece.

748
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,858
What, are you gonna
split it with the concierge?

749
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,601
You make yourself laugh
there? You like that one?

750
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,029
You're a funny one?

751
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,035
Hold that thought.

752
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,211
Hello?

753
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,806
Hello? SARAH: <i>Tony?</i>

754
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,779
- Sarah?
<i>- I think mom's really sick.</i>

755
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,974
<i>I can't wake her up.</i>

756
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,416
- What, where are you?
<i>- In the car.</i>

757
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,078
Where? Where's the car?

758
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,123
I don't know where we are, Tony,
but you have to do something.

759
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:30,456
- I think she's dying.
<i>- Sarah, Sarah.</i>

760
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,054
Okay.

761
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,819
All right.

762
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,019
Here we go.

763
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,028
All right, one second,
I'll get you out.

764
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:41,496
One second.

765
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,793
Sorry, honey.

766
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,164
Okay, it's okay.

767
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,365
Here we go, we're home.

768
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,911
Hey, hey, just one
sec, okay? One second.

769
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,808
Here we go.

770
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,482
Come on, Luka, pick up.

771
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,745
Hey, it's me.

772
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,153
I'm home, I just
got Joe from Ellen's.

773
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,520
Listen, can you call me
as soon as you get this?

774
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,752
It's kind of a...
It's kind of urgent.

775
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,261
Thanks.

776
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:14,763
Okay, here we go.

777
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,868
I know, I'm sorry.

778
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,937
It's okay, here we go.

779
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,334
Yeah, I know.

780
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:24,669
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

781
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,743
Okay, okay.

782
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,539
You're okay.

783
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,646
Call your husband.

784
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,654
I just did, he's not picking up.

785
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,654
Call him again.
