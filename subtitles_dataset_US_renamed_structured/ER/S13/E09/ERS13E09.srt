1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,237
A glass of a wine and a hot
bath at the end of the day help.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,433
Sounds good to me.

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,546
The water bill,
because I need to...

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,940
You live with someone.

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,907
- We love you.
- Meg, I can't do this anymore.

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,781
There's a little girl.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,286
Curtis Ames was
a patient of mine.

9
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,290
He followed my wife
and child to the park.

10
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,190
Help me protect my family.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,926
My mom used to put it in a trash
bag with chicken broth and Crisco.

12
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,697
Grill it on the barbecue,
you'll never go back.

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,833
I read that brining
keeps the juices in.

14
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,343
Did you take the giblets
out of the marinade?

15
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,142
Take what out of what?

16
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,309
- C-spine is clear.
- We should try to pull off the gravy.

17
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:56,150
All right, I'm gonna take this collar
off. Let us know if anything hurts, okay?

18
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,657
Fried turkey is a religious experience.
- Gross.

19
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,658
You'd rather cook
it in a trash bag?

20
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,390
Americans, so sentimental
about their holidays.

21
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,331
This from the guy that celebrates
Croatian independence...

22
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,336
Croatian State Day, and something
called Patriotic Gratitude Day.

23
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,365
- Oh, no.
- What?

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,405
I have 10 minutes left in my shift
and the transport pager goes off.

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,708
- I'll go.
- No, you can't, you're an intern.

26
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,181
The dispatcher wants to
say "Happy Thanksgiving"?

27
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,412
Yeah, right. I'm
sure that's what it is.

28
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,483
- Jane? Jane.
- Abby.

29
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,888
- You carry the transport pager overnight?
- Uh, yeah.

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,020
Well, it just went off, and I was
thinking maybe you could just take it.

31
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,031
- Mm, no.
- No?

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,170
Why not? Five more minutes, it
would have been your call anyway.

33
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,068
- Sorry, it just doesn't work that way.
- What way?

34
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,834
If the pager goes off during
your shift, you have to go.

35
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,240
Yeah, but I wanna spend
Thanksgiving with my kid.

36
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,880
It's like that story with
the guy hunting dinosaurs.

37
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,610
He strays off path, steps on a butterfly
and the future's ever so different.

38
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,515
- What?
- It's bad karma to mess...

39
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,417
with the universal
order of things.

40
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,559
- Your ace unicycle man, he can go.
- Ray.

41
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,217
- Yeah?
- Take this, I'll owe you.

42
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,418
- I'd love to.
- Great.

43
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,894
I can't. Pratt thinks I'm
losing too much ER time.

44
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,125
- He banned me from transports.
- I just like having you near me.

45
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,428
Surprise. You get me
instead of Morris tonight.

46
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,630
He begged me to switch so he
could spend time with his kids.

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,105
- What's your excuse?
- Henry went to Orlando...

48
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,642
with his grandparents.
I might as well come in.

49
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,144
I love working Thanksgiving.
Everybody's at home...

50
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,748
eating and watching
football. Even the freaks.

51
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,943
Ah, the great American tradition
of sanctioned gluttony. No, thanks.

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,716
I'm not trying to block the run. I'm
just asking, does garden-variety MI...

53
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,825
really need a doc on board?

54
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,986
Miss Lulu Davis, age 12, vomiting
and abdominal pain times two hours.

55
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,258
- Hi, I'm Dr. Figler.
- Lulu, we'll take care of you. I got this.

56
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,231
- I got here first.
- I'm good with kids.

57
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,429
- Are you saying I'm not?
- No. Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

58
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,506
Lulu, you okay?

59
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,908
Oops.

60
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:01,810
- Cranberries.
- Sorry, Jane. Karma sucks.

61
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,585
The book says three hours at
450. And don't forget to baste.

62
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,094
How often?

63
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,393
I don't know. Q-30 minutes?

64
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,536
I'll probably be home
to mash the potatoes.

65
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,663
- Okay, what do I do with the pumpkin?
- Oh, I forgot about the pie.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,106
- Dr. Kovac. You got a minute?
- Yeah. Just a second.

67
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,075
I thought pumpkins
were for Halloween.

68
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,874
Screw the pie. I never really
liked pumpkins, anyway.

69
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,677
- Sure you don't wanna order Chinese?
- No.

70
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,082
But baste. Remember to baste.

71
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,848
- Hey.
- I went to see Curtis Ames yesterday.

72
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,720
He didn't know
about any kid's toy.

73
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,793
Did he admit to following
them to the park?

74
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,122
He didn't know what
I was talking about.

75
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,233
Look, the guy's had a pretty
tough time. He's barely getting by.

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,768
Okay, I realize that, but that's no
excuse for messing with my family.

77
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,235
If you want my opinion...

78
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,308
he's too busy trying to feed and
clothe himself to mess with anyone, doc.

79
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,801
Right.

80
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,414
- You get airsick?
- No.

81
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,950
Claustrophobic?

82
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,816
Maybe you should just
tell me about the patient?

83
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,456
Eighty-eight-year-old
female, anterior MI.

84
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,423
I can't tell you how many
docs freak out at altitude.

85
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,086
I work in an ER. It's
pretty hard to freak me out.

86
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,926
You do okay with heights,
honey? Loud noises?

87
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,659
Yeah, but mice make me
jump on a chair and say "eek."

88
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,596
Danny, meet Dr. Lockhart.

89
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,834
Hi. DANNY: Sit.

90
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:40,838
Don't stand. Don't
disembark till we tell you to.

91
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,108
Keep your headset and
your seatbelt on at all times.

92
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,843
If you need to speak to us...

93
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,022
slide this switch this way
to activate the intercom.

94
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,954
Do not press that button.
That transmits over the radio.

95
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,831
This baby is tight.

96
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,863
- Excuse me?
- First night out...

97
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,799
after two months of upgrades.

98
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,604
Satellite phone, GPS, new hoist.

99
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,505
All the cool toys.

100
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,205
- I'm Jasper, this is Evan.
- Hey.

101
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,707
What'd you say your name was?

102
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,110
- Abby.
- Abby.

103
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:26,718
<i>Come fly with me
Let's float down to Peru</i>

104
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,954
<i>In llama land there's
a one-man band</i>

105
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,067
<i>And he'll toot his flute for you</i>

106
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,602
<i>Come fly with me, Abby</i>

107
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,108
<i>Let's take off in the blue</i>

108
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,395
When I press, when I let go?

109
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,161
- About the same.
- I see.

110
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,034
- I'm thirsty.
- Too bad. You're NPO.

111
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,539
- What's that?
- Nil per os, nothing by mouth.

112
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:20,079
Food or liquids exacerbate or complicate
an obstruction, volvulus or inflammation.

113
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,183
Not to mention increase
aspiration risk during intubation...

114
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,046
should you go to
the O.R. tonight.

115
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,414
Um, I'm sorry I threw up on you.

116
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,088
Oh. I don't mind the fact I had to
shower to get the chunks out of my hair.

117
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,094
I just don't know how I'm gonna
survive a whole shift dressed like this.

118
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,028
I'm gonna order a few tests,
see what's going on in there.

119
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,897
I mean, bunnies, puppy dogs.
I'm, like, breaking out in hives.

120
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,163
Jane, why don't you
let me take it from here?

121
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,234
- Your parents are on their way, right?
- Yeah. Definitely.

122
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,140
I think it's hip. I think it's fetishy. I
think you totally pull this look off.

123
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,712
Shut up, Gates.

124
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,372
Hey, Sam, I need a
CBC on a little girl in 2.

125
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,247
And order up an extra red top if you
can, just in case the blood bank needs it.

126
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,321
- Got it.
- Hey, Alex.

127
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:06,551
Don't you have anything better to do
than hang out with us on Thanksgiving?

128
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,059
If he stayed home, he'd
play video games all night.

129
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,892
I figured I'd bring him in,
make him do community service.

130
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,966
Hey, that's cool, man.

131
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,330
Handing out cookies to
sick people? That's cool.

132
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,972
Could be worse. You could
be one of those sick people.

133
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,507
Four pages in the last 20 minutes?
What's the crisis, Dr. Gates?

134
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,008
Oh, no crisis, just an
incarcerated hernia...

135
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,511
a gluteal abscess, road
rash that needs skin grafting...

136
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,844
embedded drill bit, rule-out
appy on a 12-year-old girl.

137
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,782
- You're making this up.
- I wish I were.

138
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,946
You sure it's not an
excuse to keep me here?

139
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,615
Please. I would never dream
of wasting your time like that.

140
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,286
But really, must you
look so hot all the time?

141
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,332
I mean, even with that ridiculous hat,
I can't concentrate. I can't even talk.

142
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,437
You know, enough of this
harassment. I have work to do.

143
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,865
Are you the team from County?

144
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,204
Yeah. Watch it.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

145
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:02,509
Mom was fine. Cooked a 20-pound
turkey, carved it, then she collapsed.

146
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,550
- We thought she was kidding.
- But then we couldn't wake her up.

147
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,517
- Must have been scary.
- Get the history later. Stay here.

148
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,623
We need to examine your mother.
- Okay.

149
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,123
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Elizabeth Timmons?

150
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,660
Thank heavens. This way.

151
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,331
You didn't say about
her being intubated.

152
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,059
They never tell the whole story.

153
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,534
- Vitals?
- Tachy to 124, sat 92.

154
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,870
- You got a BP?
- Last one was 74 over 38 on dopa.

155
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,911
- Great. What about a EKG?
- Here, Dr. Russo. Thanks for coming.

156
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,707
- Lockhart.
- Place gets backed up...

157
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,009
- when we have a patient like this.
- Sats 82.

158
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,583
She's tombstoning.

159
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,811
- Thrombolytics?
- I gave it. No response.

160
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,924
Okay, a reality check here? Does
this family know how sick she is?

161
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,925
- They know she's having a heart attack.
- She's not breathing...

162
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,587
her blood pressure sucks and
she's not perfusing her brain enough?

163
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,326
- We can't move her. She's unstable.
- The family wants her out.

164
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,869
- She won't make the trip.
- You don't know that.

165
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,941
If she survives the helicopter, she will
die before the family makes it to County.

166
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,106
- What's your point?
- Well...

167
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,048
She's 88 years old. She's
not coming back from this.

168
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,446
Don't you think dying
here with her loved ones...

169
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,019
is better than dying alone
in the ICU at County?

170
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,588
Listen, doctor, our
job is to scoop and run.

171
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:20,454
The longer we stay and jaw about it,
the more unstable this lady's gonna get.

172
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:24,621
Know what? Just give me five minutes.
I'm gonna make sure they understand.

173
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,264
Fifty-two years,
rain or shine...

174
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:35,137
he drives me around the lake on
a tandem bike after Thanksgiving.

175
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,401
- Isn't that sweet? RAY:
You're blind, Mr. Hunter.

176
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,977
Maybe you should let her drive.

177
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,637
That wouldn't work.
I can't carry a tune.

178
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,044
Oh, he drives, I
sing. It's tradition.

179
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,152
Radiology. Call me
when the films get back.

180
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,981
- You got it.
- Ray, help. Need order for sumatriptan.

181
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,420
- Migraines?
- I get one every Thanksgiving.

182
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,322
- It's the stuffing.
- Okay, 20 milligrams, intranasally.

183
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,122
Then why do you eat it?

184
00:09:56,296 --> 00:10:00,392
Because it's amazing. Mom
makes it with bacon and almonds.

185
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,661
Lands me in the hospital
every Thanksgiving.

186
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,667
It's worth it.

187
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,666
Be right back
with your medicine.

188
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,301
Holidays weird me out. The
special foods, little rituals.

189
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,071
- It's not my thing.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,842
When I was a kid, Thanksgiving was
an excuse to stay home and watch TV.

191
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,815
I always figured when I grew
up and had kids of my own...

192
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,923
I'd do the whole family
thing, a big banquet, but...

193
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,585
well, here we are. Me and
Alex, hanging out in the hospital.

194
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,696
Didn't your parents
demand you come home?

195
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,457
No. My mom's in Trinidad
with a new boyfriend.

196
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,263
And my dad's never even heard
of a home-cooked meal, so...

197
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:42,034
Ah, well, at least you got something
hot waiting for you at home.

198
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,042
What?

199
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,542
Missing your cell
phone, perhaps?

200
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,543
What? Yeah. How did you...?

201
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,286
Hematology needed you,
so we called your cell phone...

202
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,425
and you will never
guess who answered.

203
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,920
Surgical med
student Katey Alvaro.

204
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:07,563
- Oh, well, we were studying.
- Right. I mean, well, she couldn't talk.

205
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,432
She was baking you
something. A little treat.

206
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,838
- Any chance you could be wrong?
- Well, yes.

207
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,241
- But based on my experience...
- Well, which is it?

208
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,711
You tell us she won't survive the
trip, now you say you might be wrong.

209
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,181
I know this is hard. I
just think it's important...

210
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,343
- Time's up. Let's go.
- All right, just wait.

211
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,581
Find the clerk, sign the consent,
we'll be at County in 45 minutes.

212
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:34,159
- But she just said that we should...
- It's your mom's only chance.

213
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,989
Okay, uh.

214
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,459
Take her.

215
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,203
- She's gonna die.
- Uh-huh.

216
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,432
I'm doing my best to
facilitate a good death.

217
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,270
- It's not your job.
- Not your call.

218
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,911
Here's how it works. The
referring hospital refers...

219
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,742
the accepting hospital
accepts. We're the delivery men.

220
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,441
- Delivery people.
- You're denying the responsibility...

221
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,520
- that comes with your job.
- I'm not the one who's in denial.

222
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,453
Good death? No such thing. If
you think you can make this...

223
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:08,083
a good experience for that family
you're more arrogant than I thought.

224
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,862
Mom, if you can hear me,
we'll see you in Chicago, okay?

225
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,433
In a few weeks, you're
gonna be a great-grandmother.

226
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,798
Everyone, stay back.

227
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,633
God bless you, Dr. Lockhart.

228
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,713
Systolic's holding above 80.

229
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,547
- Yeah, on 20 mics of dopamine.
- Still counts.

230
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,616
All right. You know, maybe
you were right, maybe she...

231
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,156
Don't say it. Don't say it.

232
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,919
Nothing more painful than
to listen to a lady eat crow.

233
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,497
- I'm not eating crow.
- Which reminds me, I am starving.

234
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,326
- Good idea.
- Turkey, cranberry sauce.

235
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,834
Wife even baked the bread.

236
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,996
- We got a patient here.
- She's fine.

237
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,334
You know, I feel
sorry for your old man.

238
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,840
What's that supposed to mean?

239
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,580
- It's just the turbulence.
- I don't think so.

240
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,246
Charge the defibrillator. Now.

241
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,325
Febrile to 101, vomiting
and mild rebound.

242
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:17,260
- How long this been going on, sweetie?
- It started during the salad.

243
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,457
Salad for Thanksgiving?
Your family's weird.

244
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,899
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- White count?

245
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,896
Pending.

246
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,705
Are those chocolate chip?

247
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,775
- Uh, no.
- Could I have one anyway?

248
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,141
Um, yeah, sure.

249
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,954
- You know, this holiday's a lie.
- Really?

250
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,956
Yeah. The only thing the Pilgrims
shared with the Indians were measles.

251
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,527
- Okay.
- I'm Lulu. Thanks for the cookie.

252
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,289
Yeah.

253
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,729
Hey, you can't eat
that, honey. You're NPO.

254
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,799
Oh, yeah. Nil per os.

255
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,960
It's Thanksgiving
and I can't even eat.

256
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,867
What did I tell you about asking doctors
or nurses before giving away cookies?

257
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,808
Labs are back.

258
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,214
- Our white count's 14. Let's get a CT.
- I'll call the scanner.

259
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,817
All right. We talked to
your mom on the phone.

260
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,682
She gave us permission to give you
a very special x-ray on your tummy.

261
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,657
She didn't want to talk to me?

262
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,594
No, but she said to make
sure we treat you like a VIP.

263
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,561
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

264
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,998
Oh, that's okay.
Alex can wait with me.

265
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,727
Right, Alex?

266
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,028
Yeah.

267
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,669
Clear.

268
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,240
- Still V-fib.
- Damn it.

269
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,379
- She's 88 years old.
- I tried to make that point an hour ago.

270
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,450
- We're committed now.
- Lido's in.

271
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,587
- Another mg of epi.
- She had five rounds.

272
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,746
Yeah, well, let's make it six.

273
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,422
- We never should have brought her up.
- Darling, it's the job.

274
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,687
Spare me the platitudes, okay?

275
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,091
Go again. Go.

276
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,490
Clear.

277
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,793
Nothing.

278
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,467
If the scar shows above my
bikini, I'm suing your asses.

279
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,167
- Need some help here.
- We're in a hospital. Grow up.

280
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,973
- Don't tell me what to do, grandma.
- Grandma? You bubble-headed bitch.

281
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,139
Let's settle down, all
right? What happened?

282
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,182
- She pushed me into the display.
- I fell.

283
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,287
These three were fighting over
a bag at Bovards' midnight sale.

284
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,856
- Come on, let's go.
- Midnight? It's not even 8:00.

285
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,253
The name's just
tradition. It starts at 4 now.

286
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,122
Bendi brioche, 80 percent off.

287
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,764
- Normally, $1800.
- They only did a limited run.

288
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,662
During the scuffle, Mandy
fell into the Nativity display.

289
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,599
- I was pushed.
- Nativity display? It's Thanksgiving.

290
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,035
Yeah, that's when the
Christmas decorations go up.

291
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,471
Impaled by a fiberglass
Star of Bethlehem.

292
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,700
Jane, call Surgery.

293
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,812
With all that's happened,
I can't keep this now.

294
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,505
Oh, that's so sweet, honey.

295
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,379
Give it back, evil
grandma whore.

296
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:26,876
Wow.

297
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,385
This is really sad.

298
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,744
<i>Hello?</i>

299
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:37,227
Hi. I was just calling to say it's
still probably gonna be a while.

300
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,092
<i>You okay?</i>

301
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,367
<i>Abby?</i>

302
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>Abby? You there?</i>

303
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,902
Don't worry, we're taking
good care of your girl.

304
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,742
Are you listening?

305
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,105
<i>Who's that?</i>

306
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,809
You guys are assholes.

307
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:58,349
<i>- Abby?</i>
- Luka, I'll call you when we land.

308
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,542
Hang up the phone.

309
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,388
- You didn't say goodbye.
- Hang up the phone.

310
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,582
Sorry about that. I accidentally
mixed up my channels.

311
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,351
What are we, in
fifth grade here?

312
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,489
<i>Air Medic 6, Dispatch.</i>

313
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,094
- Air Medic 6.
<i>- We have a report of a vehicle...</i>

314
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,100
<i>over the side of Highway
16 at Neosha Ravine.</i>

315
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,261
<i>Are you available?</i>

316
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,103
- Why aren't you answering her?
- We're about to time out.

317
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,770
Pilots are only allowed to
fly for a max of 12 hours.

318
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,280
I've been up for almost 11.

319
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,647
<i>Air Medic 6?</i>

320
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,018
So you're just gonna ignore her?

321
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,454
Don't worry.
Another unit will get it.

322
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,651
Yeah, but we're
not far from Neosha.

323
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:45,960
Tell her where we are.

324
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,959
Don't look to Daddy
for permission.

325
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,660
Just do your job and
tell her where we are.

326
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,367
Dispatch, Air Medic 6, we're
at Highway 12 and county line.

327
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,771
Are we the closest unit?

328
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,970
<i>Air Medic 6, that's affirmative.</i>

329
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,704
Then put us on the call.

330
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,112
<i>Air Medic 6, you're
assigned to the incident.</i>

331
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,683
<i>Who is this?</i>

332
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,313
Abby Lockhart. I'm the doctor
onboard, and we're responding.

333
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,894
Darling, it's the job.

334
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,128
No free air, no fluid. Looks like
the star missed the peritoneum.

335
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,398
The Thanksgiving sales, the
parades, the blockbuster movies.

336
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:31,738
Those are to prime you for bald-faced
commercialism of the holiday season.

337
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,402
Syringe?

338
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,109
Lidocaine, 1 percent.

339
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,342
Your wounds are
superficial. You got lucky.

340
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,576
Yeah, right.

341
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:43,519
By the time I get back to the sale, all
they'll have are bad colors and big sizes.

342
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:47,660
You were impaled while fighting over
a vessel for credit cards and lipstick.

343
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:51,195
Doesn't that sort of kind of
feel like a sign? Wake up.

344
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,157
Ow.

345
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,536
A gram of Ancef, 3-0
silk, and irrigation tray.

346
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,535
Jane, stay and
assist the doctor.

347
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,543
We should be close.

348
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,258
She said vehicle, not bus.

349
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,993
Cheap trick.

350
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,262
How are we supposed
to get down there?

351
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,742
She's alive.

352
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,743
Hang on. WOMAN: Hang on.

353
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,377
- I don't know how to help.
- We're coming to help.

354
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,420
Let go. Let go. We got you.

355
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,326
Well, you stay put,
I'll get her. Don't worry.

356
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,895
Hold on. Hold on.

357
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,967
Stay right there. Hold
on to her. Don't move her.

358
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:42,873
If you're taking that long to find
a pulse, it's not worth looking.

359
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,409
Don't waste time
with resuscitations.

360
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,446
- Help the people you can help.
- I know how to triage, thanks.

361
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,742
Oh! That bus is unstable.

362
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,214
Keep triaging until
the cavalry gets here.

363
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,756
Help. My arm.

364
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,482
- It won't stop.
- All right.

365
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:03,823
- I'm telling you, it won't stop.
- Okay, let me see. Let me see.

366
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,596
Okay, sit down. Sit down.

367
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,293
Keep pressure on this and
keep your arm up, okay?

368
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,904
Hell, we're all gonna
freeze to death out here.

369
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,166
We're gonna get you out
of the cold soon, okay?

370
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,937
- How?
- Help! Please, somebody!

371
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,242
Over here!

372
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,509
- Stay like that. Stay like that.
- Wait! Wait!

373
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:29,177
- Wait! Are more people coming?
- I don't know what to do.

374
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,449
Please, his foot is
pointing the wrong way.

375
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,751
Okay.

376
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,361
- Can you tell me what your name is?
- Matt.

377
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,989
Hi, Matt. I'm
Abby, I'm a doctor.

378
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,693
- Hey, doc.
- No, no, no. Don't move. Don't move.

379
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,771
Could you hold his head? Make
sure he doesn't move his neck.

380
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,100
I can't feel my leg.

381
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,833
Oh, my God.

382
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,343
Can you move your feet at all?
- No.

383
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,980
Okay. HAYLEY: Don't.

384
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,378
I'm gonna find something
to splint your leg with.

385
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,644
Okay. MILO: Help!

386
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,880
Somebody! Somebody help!

387
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,854
Please. Help!

388
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,989
Close your eyes. But stay awake.

389
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,029
Somebody's coming. Mom? Mom?

390
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,023
All right, don't move. I'm
gonna come back there.

391
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,261
Mom, she's here now.
It's gonna be all right.

392
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,839
Hello?

393
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,843
- Are you hurt too?
- No, it's just my mom. Please.

394
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,845
- Hang on. MILO: You
gotta get her to help.

395
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,881
Milo?

396
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,551
- Okay. MILO: Oh,
please, get her out.

397
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,786
I'm Abby. I'm a doctor.

398
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,727
Can you tell me your name?

399
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,490
Melanie. ABBY: Okay.

400
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,893
Melanie, can you move at all?

401
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,507
She's stuck.

402
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,615
- Oh, God.
- All right.

403
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,085
Okay. We're gonna get
you out of here, all right?

404
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,020
Okay. MILO: Come on, let's go.

405
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:16,424
Are you ready? One, two, three.

406
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,838
Is that all my blood?

407
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,572
I don't know.

408
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,109
I don't know where
that blood's coming from.

409
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,136
Come on, fix her. ABBY: Okay.

410
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,622
I can't, uh...

411
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,622
I can't move you now.

412
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,493
Okay, I understand.

413
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,360
Okay.

414
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,901
- You should take Milo out.
- No, I won't go.

415
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,470
Shh. Baby, go with the doctor.
- No!

416
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,441
People are coming
with special equipment.

417
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,134
- They're gonna help us.
- And I'll wait here with her.

418
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:08,645
- Milo, I love you.
- This is gonna help you with the pain.

419
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,579
But I need you to be a
brave boy now, okay?

420
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,886
Please, just get
him off this bus.

421
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,483
No! MELANIE: Go
with the doctor, baby.

422
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,328
- Milo.
- You can be a good helper.

423
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,158
No!

424
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,994
No. ABBY: Come on.

425
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,534
Please, just make
sure he's okay.

426
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,367
- Mom.
- Let's go now. Come on.

427
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,271
- No.
- Let's go. Watch your head.

428
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,223
See? I told you
it wouldn't hurt.

429
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,822
That's my mom. She
won't stop calling me.

430
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,693
You're lucky.

431
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:03,529
My foster mother only keeps me
for the money she gets from the state.

432
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,863
When I started barfing at dinner,
she loaded me into the ambulance...

433
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,531
then went back to her ham.

434
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,273
So she's not coming.

435
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:17,911
- That boy is smitten.
- Boys are easy.

436
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,279
You know, Meg and Sarah
are out of town tonight.

437
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,479
- The liver looks good.
- Which means I have the place to myself.

438
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,783
And why are you telling me this?

439
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,449
Because Meg and I, it's over.

440
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,391
I thought you weren't together.

441
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,964
Well, we weren't. But now, we're
not even not together anymore.

442
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,803
That's fat stranding
a cecal phlegmon.

443
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,405
- She needs O.R.
- I'm gonna call Crenshaw.

444
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,798
Sit down.

445
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:48,170
I have a very important
job for you, okay?

446
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,815
I don't want my mom to be alone.

447
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:54,409
I want you to take that flashlight
and point it wherever I'm working.

448
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,581
Someone's gonna help her, right?

449
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,156
The fire department's
gonna be here soon.

450
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,421
- And they'll get her off the bus?
- Yeah.

451
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,492
Promise?

452
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,097
All right. Don't move, okay?

453
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,328
Just shine that light at me.

454
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,871
Up.

455
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:28,273
Four dead, nine criticals,
14 minor injuries, 11 delayed.

456
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:32,111
The driver had a passenger
manifest and the numbers all match up.

457
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,277
Good job, good job. All
the criticals are off-site?

458
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,787
Does this include the
woman on the bus?

459
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,425
No one's going back on
that bus until it's stabilized.

460
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,185
How long is that gonna take?

461
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,890
The anchors aren't
holding. It could be hours.

462
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,692
- She can't make it that long.
- There's nothing we can do.

463
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,801
We are not gonna
endanger our guys.

464
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,597
- Calm down.
- Hey, nobody's getting back on that bus.

465
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,298
But she promised. She
said you guys would go back.

466
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:59,309
- Oh, yeah? What else you tell him?
- Why don't you back off?

467
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:00,776
No! WRIGHT: Hey. Hey.

468
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,575
No! WRIGHT: Out of the way.

469
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,911
Milo, you... Hey.
WRIGHT: Get that...

470
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,883
Hey! Hey! MILO: No!

471
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,078
- No!
- Milo.

472
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,384
Milo, you cannot get
on that bus right now.

473
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,494
- You said they would get her.
- I know.

474
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,459
- You said they would.
- Okay.

475
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,600
- You said they'd try.
- I know. It's gonna be okay.

476
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,100
Lockhart. Give him
to me. Pass him down.

477
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,437
No. No!

478
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:32,339
Where the hell's those
guys? Go ahead, pick it.

479
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:41,945
Lockhart!

480
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,620
Melanie?

481
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,194
Melanie? Can you hear me?

482
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,230
Milo, is he...?

483
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,202
All right. All right,
everything's gonna be okay.

484
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,671
- This is not okay.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

485
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:07,745
Hey, I need an IV and
a liter of NS in here.

486
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,342
His dad's in Milwaukee.

487
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,711
- Would you please tell him...?
- Okay, Melanie.

488
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,354
Melanie, listen to me.
Help is on the way, all right?

489
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:21,892
Milo likes it if you
break up his toast...

490
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,996
- and scramble them in his eggs.
- Okay.

491
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,031
He'll only let you
comb his hair...

492
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,637
- if he's wearing his Ronaldinho jersey.
- Yeah.

493
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,902
Oh, damn it.

494
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,045
Ah, ah, ah. No, no, no. Melanie.

495
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:47,380
Stay with me. Melanie,
come on, stay with me.

496
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,920
Melanie, tell me some more
about Milo. What does Milo like?

497
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:55,220
He likes to sleep with an
inchworm named Charlie.

498
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:58,694
- Okay, that's good. What else?
- You trying to get us all killed?

499
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,260
I am trying to keep her alive.

500
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,096
- You are out of your mind.
- Well, what are you doing here?

501
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,794
I thought you might need this.

502
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,775
Hi, Katey, it's me. Uh, I
think you have my cell phone?

503
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,183
I wanna come by later and
pick it up, if that's okay. Call me.

504
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,881
Marsupialized the
abscess on your shooter...

505
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,789
sent the "implanted"
chip up to Pathology...

506
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,794
convinced Captain Kangaroo
to stop eating erasers and, uh...

507
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,761
what's the deal
with the new nurse?

508
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,510
What, you mean, Jane? - Yeah.

509
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,766
- What about her?
- Nothing, you know? Just wondering.

510
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,964
- You like her.
- Quiet, you silly infant.

511
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,269
What about Radiology? Yeah,
Alex loves the fluoroscope.

512
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,608
- I went there. Nobody's seen him.
- Okay, can you check MRI?

513
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,547
- The tech lets him man the controls.
- Sam, I got work to do.

514
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,950
Jasmine Chastek, 17, fell down
a couple of steps, positive LOC.

515
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,454
- Hey, I'm Dr. Barnett.
- What happened?

516
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,149
We were doing hits of nitrous
from whipped-cream cans.

517
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,593
- She went overboard and passed out.
- Okay, this should clean up just fine.

518
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,960
Uh, I have to go find Alex.

519
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,624
Teenagers are such idiots.

520
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,941
Push harder.

521
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,806
It's stuck.

522
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,519
Come on.

523
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,657
Good job.

524
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,036
- Okay, I got her. MAN
2: Come on, come on.

525
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,172
There she is.
Let's go. Let's go.

526
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,331
Gotta go.

527
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,400
- Can I have a cookie?
- Yeah, but they really suck.

528
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,730
Oh, yeah? Eh.

529
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,998
- Listen, your mom's looking for you.
- Oh, man. Now I'm in trouble.

530
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,369
No, she'll understand.

531
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,210
No, I mean, everything
I do makes her angry.

532
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,348
Well, sometimes you have
to go the extra mile for a girl.

533
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,176
She'll get it. Trust me.

534
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,045
Lulu's in recovery.
She's doing fine.

535
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,016
Good.

536
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,183
- Go get her.
- Yeah.

537
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,327
Getting a critical victim from the
crash. I've gotta meet the helicopter.

538
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,826
All right.

539
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,657
Don't you need to be
in the ER or something?

540
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,495
- My shift ended hours ago.
- What are you still doing here?

541
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,000
Waiting for you, dummy.

542
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:55,098
Tony, it's gonna be a while, I've
gotta get a sign-out, then I've...

543
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,107
All right, here's the deal. You're
going home with me tonight.

544
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,335
Why is that the deal?

545
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,041
Because there's
nobody at my house...

546
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,176
it's Thanksgiving...

547
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:10,515
and I really, really
wanna make you dinner.

548
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,691
Okay, chocolate cherry.

549
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,131
- Amazing, right?
- Mmm. Wow.

550
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,032
- Looks great to me.
- Hey, Greg.

551
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,231
- Hey, I'm Dr. Greg Pratt.
- Oh, nice to meet you. Courtney Brown.

552
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,933
- Courtney is my producer at Channel 5.
- Oh.

553
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,774
I might be able to hang out here if I
can get my neighbor to let the dog out.

554
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,041
- I'll give her a call.
- Great.

555
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:44,078
- Who is that?
- I just told you who she was.

556
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,725
Come on, now. Hook a brother up.

557
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:51,387
You know what? Your gaydar is
terrible, even for a straight man.

558
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:52,792
Oh.

559
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:58,267
Yeah, well, you have excellent
taste in women, Dr. Weaver.

560
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,064
Of course I do.

561
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,036
Hey, uh...

562
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,675
- can I ask you something personal?
- Maybe.

563
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,277
All right. How, um...?

564
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,783
No, no.

565
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,581
When did you know you were gay?

566
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,425
Are you coming out to me, Greg?

567
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:25,326
No, no, no. I came home and I
found my brother with another guy.

568
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,924
Really?

569
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,438
Yeah. He says he's just
experimenting, that it's only a phase.

570
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:34,967
And what do you think?

571
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:36,969
I don't know.

572
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:40,271
Can a straight guy go
through a gay phase?

573
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,438
I think it's more
likely that he's gay.

574
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,776
Hey, and he's telling you
what he thinks you wanna hear.

575
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,616
Okay, but for today, right...

576
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,315
he's taking some hot girl
to the family Thanksgiving.

577
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:57,451
- If he was gay, why is he doing that?
- I don't know your brother.

578
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:00,292
I mean, I don't know
what's going on in his head.

579
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,627
But I do know that
when I was that age...

580
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:06,533
I brought a lot of boys
home to meet my parents.

581
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,469
- You did?
- Hell, yeah.

582
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,304
I mean, I was 30 before
I faced up to being gay...

583
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,140
but my life got a
lot better once I did.

584
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,996
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

585
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,539
Your transport go okay?

586
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,677
Um, yes.

587
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,836
Be grateful you got
to skip this freak show.

588
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:50,175
It's been a real
madhouse around here.

589
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,579
Just got lucky, I guess.

590
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,447
Hey, Lockhart.

591
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,052
Hurry up and sign this
before I get called out again.

592
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,665
Bye.

593
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,464
And thanks.

594
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,701
You're pretty tough for a girl.

595
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,232
Go to hell.

596
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

597
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,705
Was afraid you
weren't gonna show.

598
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,850
Sorry, Crenshaw
made me do an I and D.

599
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,315
Come on in. I
hope you're hungry.

600
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,753
Couldn't do the
turkey. Made tacos.

601
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:14,593
Homemade salsa, I got these tortillas
from a Salvadorian market on Fulton.

602
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:17,326
- You ever been there?
- I don't think so.

603
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,232
Some wine.

604
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,171
You okay?

605
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,445
- Uh, yeah.
- Here's some more wine.

606
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,115
- Wanna take your jacket off?
- Uh, yeah.

607
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,278
You sure you're cool? If you don't like
Mexican, say the word and, you know.

608
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:43,156
I'm fine. Really. It's just I haven't been
in a situation like this for a long time.

609
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,297
- I know.
- It feels weird standing here...

610
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,455
knowing what we're about to do.

611
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,362
What? Have dinner?

612
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,129
Tony, I wanna be here. I do.

613
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,566
I mean, I've
thought about it a lot.

614
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:58,232
Not creepy a lot, but it's
definitely been on my mind...

615
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:02,642
and I wouldn't want you to be
worried that I don't really wanna...

616
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,346
I'm not worried.

617
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,154
We can take it as
slow as you want.

618
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:18,823
Slow? What's slow?

619
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,398
Hey, stranger. RAY: Hey.

620
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,602
Well, thank you. And
what are you doing here?

621
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,407
- Working.
- Oof, surgeons are such bastards.

622
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,710
Making med students come in
on Thanksgiving? That is really low.

623
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,719
No, actually, it's the bastards in
the ER who scheduled me for this.

624
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,790
- What?
- I'm starting an ER rotation.

625
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,688
Tonight.

626
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,759
Now, see, you said
you were never gonna...

627
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:56,925
Radiology fell through at the
last minute. I got reassigned.

628
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,969
- Don't freak out. I'm not stalking you.
- I can't evaluate you.

629
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,198
- We'll work it out.
- I can't have these...

630
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,638
- We'll work it out.
- Okay.

631
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,542
Hey, Abby, what took you so
long? You were out all night?

632
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,582
Well, you know, sometimes
these things can take hours.

633
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,242
Sure you just weren't having
sundaes with the team?

634
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,948
Last run I did, we burned off
the whole shift at the Plush Horse.

635
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,748
Good for you, Ray.

636
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,292
Well, well, well,
look who's back.

637
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,929
She got to soar over Chicago...

638
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,395
while we dealt with
maggots and colostomy bags.

639
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,000
I guess I must've done
something good in a past life.

640
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:33,263
You look wiped. Transports do
that to you if you're not used to it.

641
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,100
- Want me to get you a coffee?
- No.

642
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,401
Right now, I really
just wanna go home.

643
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,806
No, stay. We just got here.

644
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,641
I missed you guys.

645
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,953
I know. We had no
water or toilet paper.

646
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,620
We looked...

647
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:01,998
Oh, my God.

648
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,634
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.

649
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,507
How many times do I have to tell
you? When you leave the glass...

650
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:22,449
directly on the wood,
it leaves a stain.

651
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,231
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

652
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,732
Let me get my stuff. Then we can
pick up something at the chicken place.

653
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:38,995
Okay.

654
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,835
- What do you got?
- I have a cupcake over here.

655
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,405
Sam, Alex, happy Thanksgiving.

656
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,547
There's some food over
there. Help yourselves.

657
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,013
Wow. Thanks, Luka.

658
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,351
- Tofurky anyone?
- Uh, no.

659
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,819
- I'll try it.
- Are you really a vegan?

660
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,959
Surgeons just shouldn't be
carnivores. It's a known fact.

661
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,820
- Woman, what the hell is that?
- Looks like milk Jell-O.

662
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,865
Mmm. No, coconut
flan, and it is killer.

663
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,392
Oh, hey, Dr. Weaver,
do you remember me?

664
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,595
- Katey Alvaro.
- Hi, Katey. How are you?

665
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,502
I'm good. I started my ER
rotation about an hour ago.

666
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,542
Oh. Yeah, well, I hope Ray's
giving you the lay of the land.

667
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,873
Oh, yeah, he is. Definitely.

668
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,850
All right. How do you stay
so skinny and eat so much?

669
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,918
Look who's talking,
little Skinny Minnie.

670
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,884
Well, it seems like
good genes to me.

671
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:34,082
You wanna come over and watch some
football with me and Kerry tomorrow?

672
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,852
Damn, you're lucky.

673
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:43,395
- I can't believe you made all this.
- Well, maybe I cheated a little.

674
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,569
If anything happens to me,
remember Joe likes strawberries...

675
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,040
- but raspberries give him hives, right?
- What are you talking about?

676
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,873
If you put the fan on in the
bathroom, he doesn't cry in the tub?

677
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:56,207
I know that.

678
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,475
And it's mandatory he
be exposed to everything...

679
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,311
Stevie Wonder
recorded in the '70s?

680
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,614
Dr. Lockhart. That trauma you
choppered in did well in the O.R.

681
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,951
Oh, great. That's great.

682
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:10,789
Yeah, it required over 12 units, but
she's holding her own in Recovery.

683
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,328
Thanks.

684
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,798
Are you okay? How
did that transport go?

685
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:21,737
I didn't know you
got skills like this, doc.

686
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,673
Hey, I have my kid here.
Be quiet with that kind of talk.

687
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:30,076
Hey, it's Thanksgiving.
I'll tell you tomorrow.

688
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:42,790
All right, let's give
a toast to Dr. Kovac.

689
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,520
Or Chef Kovac, as he
wants to be called now.

690
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,255
Hear, hear. Thanks.

691
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:48,952
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers, guys.

692
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,147
Happy Thanksgiving.
