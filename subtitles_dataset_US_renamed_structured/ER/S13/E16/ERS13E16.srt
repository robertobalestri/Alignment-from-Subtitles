00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,170
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,639
Our goal is to enroll
200 donor-recipient pairs.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,041
By mixing and matching, we find
kidneys for almost 50 percent of them.

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:15,148
Ask me again. Ask
me to marry you.

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,281
Grandma, I don't
know what happened...

6
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,255
but if it is what I think, it
scares the hell out of me.

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,951
She's yours, Tony.

8
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,522
Is it possible?

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,802
Oh, crap.

10
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,873
- What time is it?
- Six-fifteen. You let me fall asleep.

11
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,341
I didn't wanna stay over.

12
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,209
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

13
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,874
We agreed it was too soon
for Sarah to deal with this.

14
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,178
Sleep in for another
hour. She won't even know.

15
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,345
Well, when are
you gonna tell her?

16
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,990
Tell her what?

17
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,648
Come on.

18
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,818
- I don't even know if it's true.
- You will be if you do the test.

19
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,157
What am supposed I to
do? "Can I have your DNA?

20
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,800
I wanna find out if I'm your
father"? What if I'm not?

21
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,493
- Don't wanna mess with the kid's head.
- Are you afraid?

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,469
No. Maybe.

23
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:17,873
I don't know. Maybe the actual
biology doesn't matter anyway, huh?

24
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,244
Of course it does.

25
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,479
- Want something to eat before you go?
- No, I'm fine.

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,554
- Some juice? SARAH:
We don't have any.

27
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,921
- I'm sorry. Did we wake you?
- No, I couldn't sleep.

28
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,353
- I'm just leaving.
- You don't have to sneak out.

29
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,523
She's not sneaking
out. She's going to work.

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,536
- And I'm late. I'll page you later?
- Okay.

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,209
- I made coffee.
- Since when do you drink coffee?

32
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,674
Since we ran out of juice.

33
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,602
Give me some.

34
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,010
Sorry, I meant to go
to the store. I just...

35
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,707
You know, if you want me to...

36
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,251
I can do all the cooking and
the shopping and cleaning.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,585
If you do that, when would you do your
homework, talk on the phone and text?

38
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,150
It's called multitasking.

39
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,228
<i>Since it is plainly ludicrous...</i>

40
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:16,234
to page a surgeon at 6:15 for
something as silly as Tylenol...

41
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:20,807
the only conceivable explanation I have
for your call is you have a crush on me.

42
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,035
I'm flattered. Thank
you. Goodbye.

43
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,441
- Who was that?
- This new ICU nurse. She's useless.

44
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,742
Someone needs to
show her the ropes.

45
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,044
Did you say ropes?

46
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,775
Jane, come on. I
have to round soon.

47
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:39,083
FYI, this is my last
night in the call room.

48
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,593
- Prosthetics lab could be fun.
- We're through with hospital kink.

49
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,789
We're staying at
your place next time.

50
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,799
- Whoa, whoa. No, we can't. I've got a...
- I know, I know.

51
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,903
You have no bed.
You sleep on the couch.

52
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,265
Your sink is clogged.

53
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,670
This pathetic I-work-all-the-time-
so-my-place-is-a-rat-hole thing...

54
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,503
is not gonna fly anymore.

55
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,734
What?

56
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,904
Yeah, you're gonna clean up your
apartment and buy a proper bed.

57
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,276
Today.

58
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,477
- Jane, just because you wanna stay at...
- Hey, it's been three months, okay?

59
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,782
Upgrade the sleeping
arrangements, or you will be punished.

60
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,154
- Do you understand?
- Ooh. Yeah.

61
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,794
It's tradition. A symbol.

62
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,126
Yeah, a symbol of the
wedding industrial complex.

63
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,428
No, I'll wear a ring.
I wanna wear a ring.

64
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,869
- You just have to abide by my ring policy.
- Your ring policy?

65
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,301
Yeah, if one of us
loses our wedding ring...

66
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,345
we replace the ring and
give the new ring full status.

67
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,674
You're gonna lose it?

68
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,114
Well, I don't know. Something happens
to the ring and everybody freaks out...

69
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,517
like the marriage is doomed.

70
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,319
But a simple gold
band would be very nice.

71
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,189
Now we're getting somewhere.

72
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,399
So do you think we should
make an announcement...

73
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,527
or just tell people individually
and let it trickle out?

74
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,230
Is it all right if
we wait a while?

75
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,672
- Really? Why?
- You know, when you tell people...

76
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,870
you're getting married, they
start asking a million questions...

77
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:10,711
about a wedding, and
marriage is not about wedding.

78
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,885
Like it's not about ring.

79
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,724
Let's just enjoy this for a
while, the two of us, okay?

80
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,725
That's fine.

81
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,659
A secret engagement will be fun.

82
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,693
Jane, you take the boob rash...

83
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,336
and, Ray, you get the
bounty hunter with the gout.

84
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,369
Dr. Kovac returns.
Nice seeing you again.

85
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,597
- You too.
- Welcome back.

86
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,104
It was weird here without you.

87
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,534
- What's that?
- A rat died in the air vent.

88
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,271
There's a cleaning
crew up there.

89
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,281
Hey, did you really squash
your own hand in a vise?

90
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,249
I mean, because...
Wow, that's...

91
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,412
- Need a doc here.
- Jane, why don't we take this?

92
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,086
Thirty-five-year-old,
uncontrollable seizures.

93
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,629
You. Take the bus. Something
bad's gonna happen on the L today.

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,766
I upped my meds, but
the seizures won't stop.

95
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,368
- Well, you're not seizing now.
- No. Yes. Yes, I am. I...

96
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,130
Two milligrams
of Ativan should...

97
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,969
You're sitting up and talking.
You're not having a seizure.

98
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,973
- Can we not stop here?
- We're about to...

99
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,975
- Can you move me back?
- Just be patient.

100
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,582
- Okay, but move me now, please!
- All right, all right.

101
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,396
Lily's sick, Marquez is out on vacation,
and the rest are doing doubles...

102
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,574
to cover their shifts. This is
why nurses quit. They burn out.

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,300
The shortage just keeps
getting worse. What about Ben?

104
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,707
He was lured to a
hospital in Minneapolis.

105
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,508
New cars for nurses
willing to stay six months.

106
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,345
- You cool with that?
- What, I got left for a Camry?

107
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,249
No, it's a good gig.
I can't blame him.

108
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,020
Anna Hayes, 39, vomiting
and altered mental status.

109
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,684
- Tachy to 120, sats 92 on room air.
- This your mom?

110
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,764
- Yeah, I could barely wake her up.
- Ms. Hayes, I'm Dr. Gates.

111
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,332
- Can you open your eyes?
- Please, just take me home.

112
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,934
No, you need oxygen and fluids.

113
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,933
- Is she gonna be all right?
- I'm fine.

114
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,539
Ma'am, you're not fine. You're severely
dehydrated. We're gonna help you.

115
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,732
Access?

116
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,208
Twenty-gauge in the
right antecub, but it blew.

117
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,710
Sam?

118
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,281
Hey, Trauma 1's
open. I'll be right in.

119
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,917
Hey, Jeff. What's up?

120
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,652
I think we have something
that belongs to you.

121
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,790
Alex, what happened?

122
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,593
Mr. Brewer, let's
get you hooked up.

123
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,730
Yeah, okay. You're
not gonna need that.

124
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,365
- You're not gonna need that.
- No?

125
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,466
No, these are
temporal-lobe seizures, okay?

126
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:44,263
I never have any cardiac
or respiratory symptoms.

127
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,962
We'll hook you up to be safe.

128
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,973
If you haven't noticed, my,
uh, seizures are unusual.

129
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,038
I get hunches, premonitions,
that sort of thing.

130
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,150
- Nothing ever shows up on the monitor.
- I see.

131
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,785
Yeah.

132
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,784
Oh, here comes another one.

133
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,582
I'm sensing...

134
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,223
Bacon and eggs.

135
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,928
There you go.

136
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,588
Okay, so can you just give me the
Ativan, and I'll be out of your hair?

137
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,790
I'm sorry...

138
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,495
but I just think anybody could have
made that prediction, Mr. Brewer.

139
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:21,505
Look, I know that, uh, it looks
like I'm making this stuff up...

140
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,301
just so I can get drugs...

141
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,677
but that's not what's going on,
okay? Can you call my neurologist?

142
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,782
He'll back me up.

143
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,219
Did you get what you want, Alex?

144
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,088
Huh? For a couple of bags of
quarters? You could be in jail right now.

145
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,351
It's not anything like
they're saying, okay?

146
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,985
Officer Greenberg is gonna take you
home. I'm gonna call every half-hour.

147
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,325
You don't answer that
phone, we got a problem.

148
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,195
- Mom, it's not my fault.
- Of course it's not. It never is.

149
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,997
Mom, please, just listen to me.

150
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,834
I have to go back to
work. I'll talk to you tonight.

151
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,876
- Thank you very much, Jeff.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,711
Hey.

153
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,472
What's up with Alex?

154
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,776
He knocked off a
Laundromat near his school.

155
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,652
I'll get better faster
at home, really.

156
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,791
Mom, you're sick,
okay? We're not leaving.

157
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,394
- She hates hospitals.
- Well, but this is County. It's nice here.

158
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,963
You got organic food, in-room
massage. We have ice sculptures.

159
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,394
You're gonna love it here.

160
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:25,062
All right, she needs coags.
She's oozing around the needle.

161
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,569
Pulse up to 125.

162
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,641
When you were 4 years old,
our neighbor fell off that ladder...

163
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,903
and I brought him here.

164
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,569
Mr. Madsen?

165
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,544
Oh, he was such a grouch.

166
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,786
He was always yelling at you and
your brother for playing too loud.

167
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,553
But when you found out he
was sick, you wanted to visit him.

168
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,918
Systolic's only 84.

169
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,187
- She needs access, Gates.
- I'm trying, Sam.

170
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,093
She's clamping down. One
more try and I'll go central.

171
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,597
You stood up on your chair...

172
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,999
and you stuck your favorite
toy turtle in bed with him...

173
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,835
and you said anybody who
was sick needed a toy turtle.

174
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,876
- She's making this up.
- No.

175
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,312
No. I made a lot
of mistakes, son.

176
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,744
But you are the
one thing I got right.

177
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,945
All right, I'm in, Sam.

178
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:15,914
Let's get the fluids up.

179
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,290
You okay?

180
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,954
Yeah.

181
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,698
Good morning,
Neela. Ready to round?

182
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,133
Uh, sorry. Shoot. I need...
I need five more minutes.

183
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,636
I overslept. I never
oversleep. Is that a yoga mat?

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,277
There's an Ashtanga class in the
anesthesia conference room. Check it out.

185
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,209
Nurses' station, five
minutes. I'll see you there.

186
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,313
Hello, good morning. I'm Dr...

187
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,318
- Manish?
- Hi.

188
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,741
This is the doctor I
was telling you about.

189
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,789
I'm Emily. I've
heard a lot about you.

190
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,484
- What are you doing here?
- Uh...

191
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,152
- Well, I was...
- Saving my life.

192
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,125
Well, I was giving a talk about
the paired-exchange program...

193
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,997
at a dialysis center
in Evanston...

194
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,139
He was really impressive.
He gave us all hope.

195
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,899
And there were all
these people there...

196
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:13,069
and they were just waiting
and suffering, and it inspired me.

197
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,177
To donate your kidney? You
run screaming from a blood drive.

198
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,412
Well, I was moved
by their stories.

199
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:25,149
We worked together every day the
past month. How come you said nothing?

200
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,455
Because I thought
that I'd chicken out.

201
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:33,032
I've been on dialysis for six
years, on the UNOS list for five.

202
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:39,036
I'd just about given up when,
boom, Manish walks into my life.

203
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,470
I got tested. It turns
out I'm a good match.

204
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,109
Wow. EMILY: Amazing, right?

205
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,837
It's like right out of a
movie or something.

206
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:52,932
What's your differential?

207
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:55,018
Infectious hepatitis
is the top of my list.

208
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,657
- I sent viral titers.
- Good, what else?

209
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,794
Hepatorenal syndrome,
vascular disorder...

210
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,727
autoimmune and
alcoholic hepatitis.

211
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,833
- But my mom doesn't drink.
- We're running through possibilities.

212
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,904
Here, Luka, Jane's tibia fracture has
compartment syndrome. Ortho's MIA.

213
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,303
What about toxic ingestions?
Acetaminophen, poison mushrooms?

214
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,637
Tox screen's negative,
acetaminophen's zero.

215
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,211
Okay, get a CT and
notify Nephrology and GI.

216
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,905
Sam, come with me.

217
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,573
Is there anyone else
you want to be here?

218
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,551
My other son's at work.

219
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,416
- Don't bother him.
- I think he should be here. Is it close?

220
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,081
He's a repair guy over
at Begley's Appliances.

221
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,886
My mom works there too.

222
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,255
It's just the stomach flu.

223
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,430
- Don't bother Nick.
- It's more serious.

224
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:41,762
Why don't you go out to the front desk?
The clerk will help you call your brother.

225
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,403
It's all right, honey. Go.

226
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,736
- It's out there to the left.
- Thanks.

227
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,844
You're scaring him.

228
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:58,616
You're in acute liver failure,
ma'am. This is a little scary.

229
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,287
Did you hear what I said?
This is serious. You could die.

230
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,488
I heard you.

231
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,625
Do you have any questions?

232
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,934
No.

233
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,567
Manish nearly fainted
when I was drawing blood.

234
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,438
Now he's giving his kidney
to someone he barely just met.

235
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,635
Isn't that strange?

236
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,112
No, everyone goes through some
kind of a mini-life crisis in their 20s.

237
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,719
He's far from family, he's
unattached, he's unsure about career.

238
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,945
He's drifting. He's
looking for purpose.

239
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,818
Some people donate kidneys,
others end up at Jumbo Mart.

240
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,619
- Who are we to judge?
- Neela, what are you doing?

241
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,489
I came down to
the volvulus case.

242
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,996
You're supposed to be covering the
postop floor. Done with those changes?

243
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,657
- Well, not all.
- I'm gonna leave you to work this out.

244
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,804
I'll be in Curtain 3.

245
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,571
- You, upstairs. Shoo.
- Well...

246
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,338
What is this?

247
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,341
A consult note.

248
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,344
- I said black ink today. Only black.
- Oh.

249
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:06,681
- What color is this?
- Ah... Blue. Oops.

250
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,548
Hey, Mayday, how's it going?

251
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,595
Well, my Attending thinks
I'm a complete idiot...

252
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,857
and Crenshaw's back
to being a little bitch.

253
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,194
Most hepatic toxins take a few
days to destroy the liver, right?

254
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:22,691
Yeah.

255
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,997
Theoretically, you
could trash your liver...

256
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,630
by the time you become symptomatic,
the toxins couldn't be detected.

257
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,208
I suppose.

258
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,705
I'll page you later.

259
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,181
Ms. Hayes.

260
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,079
Anna.

261
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,378
Anna.

262
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,816
What's a young woman
with no medical history...

263
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,585
doing with fulminant
liver failure?

264
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,691
Aren't you the doctor?

265
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,628
You've got a family, 40
good years ahead of you...

266
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,133
yet when I told you you
might die, you hardly reacted.

267
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:01,901
Oh, yeah, I guess we all have our
own way of dealing with bad news.

268
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,508
Huh.

269
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,875
You know, I used to be a paramedic
for 10 years before I became a doctor.

270
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,882
Young, healthy patients...

271
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,919
no matter how religious,
mellow, Zen, they were...

272
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,885
they don't wanna die.

273
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,751
Something kicks in. Instinct.

274
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,887
Well, maybe I've just
been too tired to cry.

275
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,259
You seem depressed.

276
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,609
Let's... Let's say someone
wanted to kill themselves...

277
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:40,770
without anyone
knowing it was suicide.

278
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,549
You know, there's a
whole class of chemicals...

279
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,950
that can damage the liver
just days after they're ingested.

280
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,283
Please.

281
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,948
I just wanna go to sleep now.

282
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:59,622
Fuels and solvents found in
refrigerators, dryers, cleaning products...

283
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,167
stuff you'd have access
to every day at your job.

284
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:12,540
Tell me what you took so I can help you.
Your sons deserve to have you around.

285
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,272
- They're all grown up now.
- I know I'm right about this.

286
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:19,886
Propane, kerosene, carbon
tetrachloride, what? Tell me.

287
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,487
I hear if you mix it with
juice, it's got quite a kick.

288
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,565
Everything okay?

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,129
Anna? Anna?

290
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,828
Anna?

291
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,570
Everything's back to
normal with you and Luka?

292
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,906
Uh... I don't know if I'd say
normal, but they're good.

293
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,309
- How's things with you and Katey?
- Uh...

294
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,577
She's great.
They're really great.

295
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:53,811
- But?
- Uh...

296
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,013
- But nothing. She's awesome.
- Our friend's hurt, help.

297
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,557
- Don't move so fast.
- Oh, come on, you're tough.

298
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,537
Don't make me walk.
- You can do it.

299
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,587
- Come on, guys. Give her a break.
- I got her.

300
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,891
- Get a gurney over here.
- Are you a doctor?

301
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,727
- We both are. RAY:
Okay, what happened?

302
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,564
- They were doing a formation.
- Most schools do three layers. We do five.

303
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,571
Tasha fell all the way from the top.
- Wow, a four-layer fall?

304
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,266
I need this kiddo back for
the Great Lakes Regionals.

305
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,412
Okay, Tasha, let's go.

306
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,876
Clear.

307
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,914
Still V-tach, no pulse.

308
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,918
- I have Poison Control on the line.
- All right. Put them on speakerphone.

309
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,247
What's this? SAM: She's on.

310
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,122
Possible carbon tetrachloride overdose,
fulminant liver and kidney failure.

311
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,091
- Why didn't you say anything about this?
- It's just a hunch.

312
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,232
<i>- When did the exposure occur?</i>
- Unclear.

313
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,765
Transaminases in the 2000 range.

314
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,927
It's too late. Nothing to offer
other than supportive measures.

315
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,128
- Nothing to offer?
- No.

316
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,467
If it's carbon tet, the
damage has been done.

317
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,610
<i>That's right. The cell death
is irreversible at this point.</i>

318
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,246
- All right, thanks.
- Epi's in, fourth dose.

319
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,474
Another hundred of
lido, and re-check the K.

320
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,551
- You were withholding patient history?
- I wasn't sure.

321
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,245
Charging to 360.

322
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,445
Where'd her son go?

323
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,819
At the front, trying to
get hold of his brother.

324
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,893
He better find him fast.

325
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,790
All right, clear.

326
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,062
I don't think I could do
something like this for a stranger.

327
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,259
So maybe it bothers
me that you can.

328
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,099
Look, Emily's parents are too old to be
donors. She's getting sicker every day.

329
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,504
- You would have done the same.
- I don't think so.

330
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,973
- You're a better person.
- I'm not a better person.

331
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,945
See, I'd be too worried about
time lost from work, complications.

332
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,574
I don't mean to be negative, but you
have to consider bleeding, infection...

333
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,017
I've considered it.
We've all considered it.

334
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,587
- It's covered.
- Covered?

335
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,986
- Manish.
- Look, it wasn't my intent.

336
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,861
It wasn't why I agreed, but they
offered. They insisted, actually.

337
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,367
- Manish, no.
- Just listen, okay?

338
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:54,166
First I refused, but I started thinking
what $50,000 could do for my family.

339
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,638
I don't wanna hear any more.

340
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,438
Look, when I was 14, my parents
sent me here to live with a distant cousin.

341
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,013
I went to school, learned
English, played baseball...

342
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,673
while my sisters sewed
shirts for $2 in Mumbai.

343
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,182
I understand you feel guilty.

344
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:09,481
Yeah, with $50,000, I could
hire an immigration lawyer...

345
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,521
and get my whole
family over here.

346
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:15,958
My parents could get proper health care,
my sisters could get a proper education.

347
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:20,532
I mean, Emily's family is wealthy, right?
It's no hardship for them, so why not?

348
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,569
Because people do not sell their
body parts in this country, period.

349
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,968
Not to mention that you could put
our transplant program in jeopardy.

350
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,541
- Nobody needs to know.
- But I know, Manish.

351
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:36,072
I don't understand. If you were looking
to clear your conscience, I can't help you.

352
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,548
- I would think you would understand.
- Well, I don't understand.

353
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,553
I don't and, you know, I kind of
resent the assumption that I should.

354
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,720
I can't do this,
Manish. I'm sorry.

355
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,059
No deformities, no step-offs.

356
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,822
We have this cheer. It's
cool. It's called Paper Dolls.

357
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,593
- Yeah, it's our signature formation.
- It's like a college-level routine.

358
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,065
Pulse is in the 120s and
the HemoCue is dropping.

359
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,263
Because she's bleeding into
her belly. We got fluid here.

360
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,841
We've got the All-Cheer Regionals
next week. I've been driving them hard.

361
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,206
The outer fliers have
their hand in this half Y.

362
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,110
- The other grabs hold of the middle flier.
- That's me.

363
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,251
- And the ending is really cute.
- Sounds great.

364
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,683
Liter of warm saline wide
open and call for O-neg.

365
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,720
Make sure Surgery
knows to get down here.

366
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,016
Oh, my God, surgery?

367
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,092
- If we don't have a flier, we are screwed.
- Watch it, girls.

368
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,458
Now, why don't we worry
more about your friend, okay?

369
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,031
I'll get the infuser.

370
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,465
Do you guys have any warm saline?
- There's LR in the oven.

371
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,630
K is 7.2. Amp of D50
and 10 units of insulin.

372
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,240
Nose is bleeding. KOVAC:
The coags are through the roof.

373
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,903
Oh, my God. She
wasn't like this when I left.

374
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,048
Her condition changed quickly.

375
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,912
Without a functioning liver, toxins
start to accumulate in the blood.

376
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,747
She's in an abnormal
heart rhythm...

377
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,651
and she isn't getting enough
blood to her brain and body.

378
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,553
We're doing CPR and
giving her medications...

379
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,319
but she's just not responding.

380
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,793
But can't you just do
something to fix her liver?

381
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,262
Once cells have died,
there's little we can do.

382
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,457
So is this it or what?

383
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,660
We're breathing and
compressing her heart...

384
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,306
but your mother's
body is shutting down.

385
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,143
Anything you guys wanna say?

386
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,807
No, Mom, okay?
This isn't happening.

387
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,143
This can't be happening.

388
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,745
- Please don't go.
- One more round for the kids?

389
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,822
Please don't let her die.

390
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,582
Sam?

391
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:35,260
- All right, clear.
- Whoa, wait a minute. She's got a pulse.

392
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,796
Sinus rhythm.

393
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,837
I don't understand.
Is she dying or not?

394
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,499
Her heart is beating, but her brain
was deprived of oxygen for a long time.

395
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,841
It's very likely that she
suffered serious brain injury.

396
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,346
Wow. She can't even die right.

397
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,714
Her pressure stabilized,
but her crit's still dropping.

398
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,355
- Did I mention I hate cheerleaders?
- I hate clowns.

399
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,856
- I heard Gates was afraid of folk singers.
- Really?

400
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,462
Two plus guarding with rebound on
the left. Could be a splenic rupture.

401
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,189
- Neela, you writing this down?
- Yes, Dr. Crenshaw, I am.

402
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,129
- How do you stand this?
- I don't know.

403
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,030
I'm like a child
coming back for more.

404
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,798
Let's bring her up to whatever O.R. is
open. Dr. Dubenko will meet you there.

405
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:17,535
Girls, Tasha's going to surgery now.
Everyone say goodbye and wish her luck.

406
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,475
I'm really sorry you need
surgery and everything, Tash.

407
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,344
But you should know that we will
have to replace you for All-Cheer.

408
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,713
- Where's my mom?
- Ha-ha-ha.

409
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,548
Hey, she sacrificed her spleen
for you guys. Show some respect.

410
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,158
It's gonna be okay. I'll
explain everything as we go.

411
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,152
- Am I gonna have a big scar?
- Not if we can help it.

412
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,755
Let me tell you something.

413
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:40,060
Don't talk like that.
She's not gonna die.

414
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,723
This is the best idea she's had.

415
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,767
You don't mean that.
This is your mother.

416
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,063
You don't know the first
thing about my mother.

417
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,561
I know she's barely
alive, and you guys

418
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:51,233
should be in there
instead of here fighting.

419
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,410
- Sorry, I just don't care.
- Why do you hate her?

420
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,414
Ever since Dad died, all she
does is try to make us happy.

421
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,018
Happy, right. By gambling
on the Internet all day?

422
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,779
- It helps her relax.
- Shut up.

423
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:08,588
She started with poker. By the
end of the year, she'd lost everything.

424
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,094
- Cars, savings from our dad.
- She has a problem.

425
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:15,098
When they stopped giving her credit,
she took out cards and racked up debt.

426
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,566
Eighty thousand dollars.
We gotta live with that.

427
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,968
- She was trying to get help.
- Stop making excuses for her.

428
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,702
The house is in foreclosure, Evan.
Next week, you're gonna be homeless.

429
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,910
All right, listen, she may be
screwed up, but she's your mother.

430
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,119
That's not good
enough. It's not.

431
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,626
- Can I get your advice on something?
- Yeah, of course.

432
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:47,828
Well, let's say I knew a really nice
person about to do a pretty bad thing...

433
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:52,528
but this bad thing had really good
consequences for a bunch of people.

434
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,635
- You don't need my advice.
- Yes, I do.

435
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:00,974
No, because you have, like, this ethical
alarm system hardwired into your brain.

436
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,742
It makes you a pain in the ass, but
it's one of the best things about you.

437
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,012
But if I tell what I know...

438
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,816
it's gonna mess things up
for a whole bunch of people.

439
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,549
They'll get over it.

440
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,688
- It'll be a major betrayal.
- Ah...

441
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,353
Do the right thing, Neela.
That's all I'm saying.

442
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,663
Is this where I'm
having my operation?

443
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,635
Yep, the O.R.s
are straight ahead.

444
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:28,997
I'm scared.

445
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,109
I know. We're gonna
take good care of you.

446
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,677
My stomach.

447
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,841
We'll get you more pain
medication when we get to preop.

448
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,515
- No, that's not it.
- Is it your mom?

449
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,177
We won't start
until she gets here.

450
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,846
I didn't fall from the
top of the formation.

451
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,451
You didn't?

452
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,027
The other girls, they did this.

453
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,222
They did this to me.

454
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,668
New cheerleaders are forced to submit
to 10 minutes in an equipment closet.

455
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,243
The newbie just takes it while her
teammates do whatever they want.

456
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,541
Tasha got kicked in the stomach
until she started coughing up blood.

457
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,722
I trust the authorities
have been notified?

458
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:12,378
Ray's on it.

459
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,883
Good.

460
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,986
There's something else I
need to talk to you about.

461
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,721
Sure, go ahead.

462
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,416
Can it wait?

463
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,357
- Not really.
- Well, it's gonna have to.

464
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,057
Our cases are completely
backed up. Let's go.

465
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:30,731
Oh, Dr. Kovac, you
really must see this.

466
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:36,100
This is Fred and Brenda.

467
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,073
Neurovascular symptoms
after a handfasting ceremony.

468
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,712
- A what?
- It's a Wiccan wedding.

469
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:45,078
- The guests bound our wrists with cords.
- It's where "tie the knot" comes from.

470
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,276
This is really strong.

471
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,853
Braided to be tough.

472
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,182
Like our marriage bond.

473
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,684
Regular scissors didn't work, and
the knots were too tight to undo.

474
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,090
- I can't feel my fingers.
- I can't move my thumb.

475
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,787
Is a Wiccan ceremony
recognized by the state?

476
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,025
We get married at the courthouse
so I can put Fred on my insurance.

477
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:05,161
They don't recognize us, because
we don't believe in mating for life.

478
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,396
You don't?

479
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:08,412
We're betrothed for
one year and a day.

480
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,634
To be re-evaluated at
the end of that period.

481
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,245
Yeah, well, it does seem like
"till death" is kind of extreme.

482
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,780
Yeah, just
Judeo-Christian bull crap.

483
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,874
I don't think so.

484
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,420
I don't... We're getting married
and all those things are on our minds.

485
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,986
Sorry, it just slipped out.

486
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,563
Uh... Okay.

487
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,925
Well, I guess, um...
All right, what...?

488
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,363
I'll be right back, okay?

489
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,664
What, the first people
we tell are strangers?

490
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,844
- Wiccans?
- I just felt like saying it.

491
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,979
Abby, have you seen
the cheerleading coach?

492
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,809
She's outside
practicing with the girls.

493
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,747
Oops.

494
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:57,617
When the tissues are deprived of oxygen
for a long time, they produce acid...

495
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,385
so we're giving her
medicine for that.

496
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,030
- How long can she live like this?
- Weeks, months. It's hard to tell.

497
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,133
But it's just a
matter of time, right?

498
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,860
I mean, if you wanna
help us, don't prolong this.

499
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,028
Well, she's not suffering.

500
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,464
Evan and I are gonna
have to be responsible.

501
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:18,668
We're the only family she
has. We're alone. It's too much.

502
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,836
I understand. A social
worker will call you.

503
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,346
We have programs,
there's a support group...

504
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,984
Sir, please, we've
been through enough.

505
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,832
She's been having
runs of V-tach.

506
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,529
Forget the lido drip.

507
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,002
What, you want amiodarone?

508
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:51,507
- No. Why prolong the inevitable?
- That's not your call to make.

509
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,306
Oh, come on, Sam. We
both know how this ends.

510
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,176
Why put her boys through it?

511
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,408
She's a full code. We
don't know her injuries.

512
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:01,986
We gave her CPR for 40
minutes. Her brain is fried.

513
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,722
Another run of 10.

514
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:10,561
Sam, your little raver is having
a dystonic reaction to Haldol.

515
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,391
It's cool, go.

516
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,863
Well, the lido's hanging
and the infuser's set.

517
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,094
If she has another
run, start the drip, okay?

518
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,859
Page Dr. Kovac and tell him
his patient in Trauma 1 is coding.

519
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,454
You heard what happened.

520
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,599
My girls are not staying in the
same motel as the football team.

521
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,394
- I need to talk to you.
- How is she?

522
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:23,763
Get off the phone.

523
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,234
I'll call you back.

524
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,067
Tasha's injuries were
not caused by a fall.

525
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,632
What do you mean? I
saw her hit the ground.

526
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,177
She was forced into a closet, and
then she was beaten by the other girls.

527
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:38,442
- What? My girls would never...
- Come on, don't do this.

528
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,943
She knows you know.

529
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,452
It's not what you think.

530
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,487
Tasha's sensitive,
never fit in with the others.

531
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,753
What she's referring to is just
a little team-building exercise.

532
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,454
They ripped open her
spleen. That's not little.

533
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,624
And I definitely wouldn't
consider that team-building.

534
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,862
My girls are regional champions.
They're under a lot of pressure.

535
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,834
<i>Come on, yell, "Go, big blue!"</i>

536
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,099
<i>Go, big blue!</i>

537
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,469
Just save the excuses
for these guys, all right?

538
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,636
<i>Come on, yell, "Go,
big blue!" Go, big blue!</i>

539
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:12,512
Mom, I don't care about the
money. Just please, don't go.

540
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,984
- Another mg of epi.
- Charged to 360, clear.

541
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,482
Okay, resume compressions.

542
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,890
- Why didn't you talk to me?
- Lido isn't gonna change the outcome.

543
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,826
- I thought you'd agree.
- Well, we work together here, Gates.

544
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,489
Clear.

545
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:36,038
- I'll be right back.
- You can't leave in the middle of a code.

546
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,006
- The other kid should be here.
- Gates.

547
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,667
Hey.

548
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:40,869
What do you want?

549
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:43,515
Look, I know you're angry,
and I know you got screwed.

550
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,241
You don't know anything.

551
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,854
I know your dad died and your
mom messed up. It ain't fair.

552
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,182
No, it isn't.

553
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,156
But your mom is dying.

554
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:53,989
And I know you care...

555
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,687
because if you didn't, you wouldn't
be out here sulking in the hall.

556
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:01,197
You go in there and you
forgive your mother right now.

557
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,502
I can't.

558
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:11,371
Nick, you have one shot
at being with your mother...

559
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,273
while she's dying.

560
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,717
Hold compressions.

561
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,918
That's enough.

562
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,439
- Save a cheerleader, save the world.
- I still need to talk to you.

563
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,585
- Make it quick. Manish is on the table.
- That's what it's about.

564
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,813
- Emily paid Manish for his kidney.
- Ridiculous. He knows better.

565
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,980
- It's true, he told me.
- He was screened.

566
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,592
- They would have picked this up.
- Well, they didn't.

567
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,819
Come on.

568
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,987
But it's wrong and could jeopardize
the whole transplant program.

569
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,826
All right. All right, Neela.

570
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,764
All right, well, look. Just as
an exercise, consider this.

571
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:14,304
There are over 65,000 people on
the UNOS list waiting for kidneys.

572
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,671
Can we really rely on voluntary
altruism to solve this problem?

573
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,675
- What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

574
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:24,806
Well, when somebody donates a kidney,
the recipient obviously benefits, right?

575
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,849
Hospitals make money.

576
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,316
Surgeons get paid.

577
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,685
The donor who gives up a kidney
gets flowers and a handshake.

578
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,325
Am I right?

579
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,858
Are you kidding?

580
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,188
So many sick
people, so few organs.

581
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,627
Why not let market forces
sort out the imbalance?

582
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,426
Because people
aren't commodities.

583
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,298
We don't live in a world where it's
right for rich people to buy body parts.

584
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,770
It's legal to rent out your uterus
or to harvest your eggs for money.

585
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,876
You can get paid to donate
sperm. How is this different?

586
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,979
All I know is that a dying girl is
gonna get a new kidney today.

587
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:59,141
And then what happens to the 65,000
others who can't afford to buy one?

588
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,025
Ancef will be ready to run soon.

589
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,689
Quick question.

590
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,388
Why are you doing this?

591
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,965
Excuse me?

592
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,329
Why are you giving
this girl your kidney?

593
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,342
I guess I've been inspired
by the work that we do here.

594
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:28,503
Mm-hm. And you would never
dream of jeopardizing everything...

595
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,377
by doing something stupid
and illegal, would you?

596
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,643
- What are you talking about?
- You know what he's talking about.

597
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,221
Okay.

598
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:49,733
Emily wanted to give me money, but I
turned her down after talking to Neela.

599
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,133
Money was never part of the
reason why I wanted to do any of this.

600
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,307
He's just saying
what you need to hear.

601
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,965
She's made up her mind about me.

602
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:01,079
- I don't know what else to say.
- All right, that's enough.

603
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,408
Neela, let's go scrub.

604
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:04,641
No.

605
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,250
I won't be a part of this.

606
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:10,914
Fine.

607
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:15,220
Shirley, have Crenshaw get me a
surgeon who actually wants to operate.

608
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,885
You can get out of
here, Neela. Now.

609
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:27,403
The tornado was hard to see against
the background, so I painted it black.

610
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,576
I was gonna put some lights in
the bottom, but I ran out of time.

611
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,041
Wow, that should look
really, really cool. Sam.

612
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,840
Yeah, and I fell down the
stairs at school, and it broke.

613
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,846
That's not the only
thing you broke.

614
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:42,078
I know, I broke my tibia and
my fibula. Can you fix it fast?

615
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,985
- I can fix you up in about an hour.
- An hour?

616
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,923
I'll never have time to finish my
tornado before the end of the science fair.

617
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,188
Hey, did you know that casts give
off heat when they're hardening?

618
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,094
No. SAM: Mm-hm.

619
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,998
It's called an exothermic reaction. It
could make a pretty cool science project.

620
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,762
Can you help me make it?

621
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:02,601
Ah, sure. I'll get the stuff.

622
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,005
Sam, can you dispose
of the rest of that Ativan?

623
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,542
- Sure.
- Hi.

624
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,079
- Hey.
- So I talked to your neurologist.

625
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,082
And I got quite an earful
about temporal-lobe epilepsy.

626
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,412
- Yeah.
- Interesting stuff.

627
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:17,681
- Well, I told you I was the real deal.
- Mm-hm.

628
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,291
Well, do you have any last
words of psychic wisdom...

629
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,895
before I medicate you and
sever your ties to the paranormal?

630
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,223
Oh, sure. Um...

631
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,959
Well, I see great things
for you in the year to come...

632
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:34,697
although you will struggle
to balance home and career.

633
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:38,170
- That's it?
- Yeah.

634
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,976
That's the most generic
fortune I've ever heard.

635
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,314
And you should really invite
your dad to the wedding.

636
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,185
I'm just saying.

637
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,630
Gates, can you
explain this, please?

638
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,893
Explain what?

639
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:06,266
Why did you write idiopathic
liver failure on her death certificate?

640
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,430
It should be carbon
tetrachloride ingestion.

641
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,203
Well, she never admitted it straight
out. We don't know what really happened.

642
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,346
You can't withhold information
whenever it suits you.

643
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,312
What she told you needs to
be part of the medical record.

644
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:22,443
If we document suicidality,
then life insurance won't pay.

645
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,753
We say it was natural.
What's the harm?

646
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:27,688
The harm is that it's unethical,
and it's insurance fraud.

647
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,023
Come on, insurance companies
screw people over any chance they get.

648
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,427
Why should those kids be punished
for life because of their mother?

649
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,932
- I'm worried about you.
- Don't worry about me.

650
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,503
No, I'm worried about
your ability to do this job...

651
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,664
and it's too bad because
you're good, but you...

652
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,639
You lie and you
think nothing of it.

653
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,745
It's not lying if we
don't know for sure.

654
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,847
Now, come on. Let their mother
do this one last thing for them.

655
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,689
I'm not gonna let you
lie for them, Gates.

656
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,561
- Hey, Gates, can you sign this discharge?
- Later.

657
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,792
Jane, have you seen Neela?

658
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,802
- Uh, Dubenko sent her home early.
- Oh.

659
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:49,998
I just had to wheel an appy up from
the ER, in case you're wondering.

660
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,536
- Wondering what?
- Why I'm here.

661
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,308
Good night, Jane.

662
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:08,223
King-sized, wrought-iron
frame. The rest is up to you.

663
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,419
Hey, you guys, have
you seen Tony around?

664
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,030
- Not in a while.
- Okay, have a good night.

665
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,033
Do you think I chased
away my father too fast?

666
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,794
No.

667
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,302
Maybe I should have
listened to what he had to say.

668
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,135
- Well, you can call him.
- I tried.

669
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,436
He checked out of his hotel and the
number he gave me is disconnected.

670
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,909
Um, Abby.

671
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,379
Sorry, I just need a minute
to check something, okay?

672
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,479
Hey, Malik, do we still have
the chart on Anna Hayes?

673
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,144
You think I memorize
the name of every patient?

674
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,415
The woman that
died of liver failure?

675
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,959
I forgot to do some paperwork
for the death certificate.

676
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,828
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

677
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,992
Your first day
back, how'd it go?

678
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,933
Just like riding a bike.

679
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,268
Luka, I told Miranda
we'd be home by 8.

680
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,967
Coming.

681
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,945
- Good night.
- See you.

682
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,017
- Hey.
- Hey. How'd it go with your little secret?

683
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,624
Uh, terrible, actually.
Worse than expected...

684
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,283
but our cheerleader did well.

685
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,453
The police are interviewing the
whole squad as well as the coach.

686
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,258
- Good.
- Getting off soon?

687
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,798
- Uh, yeah, thank God.
- Yeah, me too.

688
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,998
Wanna grab a beer?

689
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:31,038
Sounds good, but, um, I've
got some dictations to do.

690
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,508
Okay, another time.

691
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:37,375
Dr. Gates.

692
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:38,778
You're still here.

693
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,013
Yeah, our uncle drove in from
Ann Arbor. He wanted to see her.

694
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,222
I'm sorry for your loss.

695
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,355
You know, I never got to
thank you for everything you did.

696
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,723
It's my job.

697
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,821
You really helped us.

698
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,162
Good night, Nick.

699
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,397
You know, she knew
it was the only way out.

700
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:04,805
It had to look natural so we
could get the insurance money.

701
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,077
I found some old
solvent at the store.

702
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,246
You helped her?

703
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,082
I left out a bottle.

704
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,083
At least she finally
got something right.

705
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,958
Good night, doc.

706
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,270
- Leave me alone.
- No, you can't break and steal things.

707
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,273
You're gonna end up
on the wrong track...

708
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,037
Mom, you're not
in my head, okay?

709
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,580
You don't know what happened.

710
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,117
Alex, come on.

711
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,278
Alex, open this door.

712
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,115
You hear me? Right now.

713
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,090
- Open the door.
- Go away.

714
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,064
I can't go away, I'm your mom.

715
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,425
Come on. Please,
Alex, don't do this to me.

716
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:08,796
Hey. You remember that time
that we made that science project...

717
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,703
for your school? That volcano?

718
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:14,872
And I couldn't get the mix of
baking soda and vinegar right...

719
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,948
and it erupted all
over the living room.

720
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:24,084
What were you? What, 5 or 6?

721
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,835
I know I didn't give you the
most stable childhood, okay?

722
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:43,740
I know you've seen a lot of
crazy stuff, that is mostly my fault.

723
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,677
The only thing I ever wanted
was for you to be happy, Alex.

724
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,046
Okay?

725
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,287
And I don't know
how to give that to you.

726
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:05,096
So please tell me what to do.

727
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,669
I know you're listening
in there, Alex, okay?

728
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,106
I love you.

729
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,114
You know that, right?

730
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,158
- Hi.
- Hi.

731
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,593
You look tired.

732
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,533
- Want a beer?
- Yeah, thanks.

733
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:52,601
I made chili, salad and
cornbread from scratch.

734
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:57,238
I know what your next question
is. My homework's already done.

735
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,548
All right.

736
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,713
No more fast food around here.

737
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,415
Wow, Sarah, this looks great.

738
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,526
Yeah.

739
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:39,449
Leaving so soon?

740
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,957
I guess not. Two.
