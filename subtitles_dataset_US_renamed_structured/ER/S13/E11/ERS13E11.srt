00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,269
You should come to
my bible group sometime.

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,274
Bible group? Okay.

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,937
Do you think I wanna wait for you to
find out that he's jerking you around?

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,050
You're making me think about
the way I want my life to be.

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,879
This is Ben Parker.
He's the new RN.

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,214
- Let me take you out to dinner.
- Like a date?

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,584
We used to run into
homeless kids like this.

9
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,194
- Please, just help Paulie.
- I can't. Paulie's very sick.

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,954
I know your secret name. Mayday.

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,530
And there's a crazy,
angry guy following us?

12
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,064
Listen to me, Ames.

13
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,931
Come near my family
again, I'll kill you.

14
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:52,079
It was kind of fun until the chemo
kid called me Rudolph's skank.

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,585
One of them asked me if
you were Sleepy or Sneezy.

16
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,486
What? I'm an elf, I'm
not a freaking dwarf.

17
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,655
- Oh, my God.
- Nice antlers.

18
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,161
You guys look so cute.
I gotta get my camera.

19
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,571
No, that's okay, really.

20
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:06,930
- Was it fun at least?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,124
Pedes was a war zone.

22
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,102
Heard you lost the pool, sorry.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,607
- That's one hot-looking dwarf you got.
- Know what? I'm an elf, damn it.

24
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,436
Whoa. Oh, hey.

25
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,441
As we commemorate
the birth of Jesus...

26
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,513
I find myself contemplating
the vices I've been guilty of.

27
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,310
And also the virtues...

28
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:28,012
that I, that all of us born in sin and
striving for sanctity should aspire to.

29
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,851
Turning our pride to humility.

30
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,517
Our envy to compassion.

31
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,363
Our anger to mercy.

32
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,995
Our laziness to activity.

33
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,864
Our greed to generosity.

34
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,710
Our gluttony to moderation.

35
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:59,786
And last but not least, our
lust must be turned to...?

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,011
Archie?

37
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,586
Um...

38
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,718
Consummation?

39
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,190
Yeah, no, no, seriously.

40
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:18,237
Our lust must be
turned to purity?

41
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:24,067
Uh... Well, I was looking for
chastity, but talk about purity a little.

42
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:31,010
Well, you know, I've always
taken it to mean purity of spirit...

43
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,710
as opposed to a
literal, corporal purity.

44
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,219
Go on.

45
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,418
Uh... Well, you know, we
all live in the modern world.

46
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,857
Right?

47
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,431
And our virtuousness
shouldn't be locked...

48
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,364
into some antiquated
notion of abstinence.

49
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,904
Should it?

50
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,105
- Shouldn't it?
- So...

51
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,447
You're saying that you
can be sexually active...

52
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,451
and still retain moral purity?

53
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,112
Not just me, sister, if
you know what I'm saying.

54
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,757
Yes. Yeah.

55
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,222
Look, well, no, no.

56
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:17,626
Because what I'm actually saying
is, at the end of the day, it's just...

57
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,559
It's just us in the mirror...

58
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,062
and we're the ones who
determine our own moral value.

59
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:28,404
And to me, that's what
Christmas is all about.

60
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,880
So you're not mad at me anymore?

61
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,745
This is the first time in a
week I've seen you smile.

62
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,155
Well, the holiday spirit is just so
infectious, I couldn't help myself...

63
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,158
and I was waiting
for you to lighten up.

64
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,161
Really?

65
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,321
I was waiting for you.

66
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,599
Don't try to be charming
in that ridiculous outfit.

67
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,136
Who, me? Charming?

68
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:02,999
Back off, Rudolph.

69
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,010
- Be nice.
- You be nice.

70
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,540
Or you're not gonna
get your special present.

71
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,514
What kind of present?

72
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,017
A slightly naughty one.

73
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,315
My favorite kind.

74
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,125
Dr. Kovac?

75
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,351
Sorry. You got a minute?

76
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,018
Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah.

77
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,629
It's about Curtis Ames.

78
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,289
He's filed an order of
protection against you.

79
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,635
- A restraining order.
- That's ridiculous.

80
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,897
Yeah, the judge who
issued it doesn't think so.

81
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,133
- The guy says you threatened to kill him.
- What?

82
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:40,042
Look, you should've let it go, doc.
Now you look like the crazy one.

83
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,190
Rufus Taylor, 35.

84
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,127
Going 60 on Dan Ryan,
crashed into an embankment.

85
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,494
Icicle shattered the
windshield, I couldn't see.

86
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,760
Icicle, huh?

87
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,836
Came out of nowhere.
It was really big.

88
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,030
- Anything hurt, man?
- My stomach.

89
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,799
Trauma 1, let's go. Gates,
what's the RTS on this guy?

90
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,876
- The what?
- RTS. Revised Trauma Score.

91
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,707
It correlates better than
GCS for traumatic brain injury.

92
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,712
- Traumatic brain what?
- You'll be fine, sir.

93
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,009
What's the matter with you?

94
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,052
My shift was over. I couldn't
leave because you weren't here.

95
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,052
Five minutes late. All right,
10 minutes. I'm here, now go.

96
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,885
You have remedial command
of basics. I can't leave you.

97
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,893
I would love to, believe me,
but it wouldn't be right, all right?

98
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,503
Yeah. What are they gonna
say about it now, right?

99
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,644
Hey, merry Christmas, Neela.

100
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,403
- Where have you been?
- On the floor.

101
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,548
- I thought we were rounding.
- What? No.

102
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,183
The Surgery Christmas
Party is the one time of year...

103
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,581
when we can forget
about disease and death...

104
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,914
and celebrate
goodness, kindness.

105
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:59,316
I admit I would prefer black
tie, sashimi and Veuve Clicquot...

106
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,085
but still, it's Christmas.

107
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,421
I love it.

108
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,193
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

109
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,666
Sorry, it's gotta be this punch.

110
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,772
There's nothing even remotely
alcoholic in the punch, Dustin.

111
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,602
Right. Okay. Gotta go.

112
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,911
Neela, I want you to
meet Manish Mehta.

113
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,741
- He's gonna be helping us around here.
- Hi.

114
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,349
Can I get everybody's
attention for a second, please?

115
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,678
Everybody, listen up for a sec.

116
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,115
Thanks.

117
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,257
Listen, it's fitting and
appropriate at this time of charity...

118
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,950
and compassion for me
to be able to announce...

119
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,393
the opening of Chicago's
only paired exchange program.

120
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,260
Yeah.

121
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,196
And as an additional
Yuletide treat...

122
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:44,532
we will be doing our
first kidney swap today.

123
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,339
Why don't we all get back to work
before we crash from the sugar high?

124
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,540
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

125
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,203
Neela. Hi.

126
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,316
Rob, you guys know
each other, right?

127
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,975
Neela Rasgotra, I've
heard a lot about you.

128
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,087
- You have?
- You're the golden girl...

129
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,850
Dubenko created a special
residency spot for. That's memorable.

130
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,156
God, you must
really be something.

131
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,995
Okay, then. It's nice
to meet you, Rob.

132
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,098
No, the pleasure's all mine.

133
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,426
Would you excuse me a minute?

134
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,647
- You went to where Ames works?
- The police wouldn't do anything.

135
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,977
And you threatened to kill him,
and I'm the one who overreacted?

136
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,847
- You think I made this up?
- I think you got carried away.

137
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,817
I went to his work to
stop and scare him.

138
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,115
Mission accomplished.

139
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,849
He's scared. He can have
you arrested if you get near him.

140
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,620
Look, I didn't know
what else to do, okay?

141
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,855
I did it because I love
you, and I love Joe...

142
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,125
and I wasn't gonna let that
asshole keep threatening us, okay?

143
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,364
So it wasn't too geeky, was it?

144
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,475
Geeky? Lord, no. Or God, no.

145
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,476
I mean, no. No, I
enjoyed your Bible group.

146
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,045
They were impressed by you.

147
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,682
Yeah, what you said
was really advanced.

148
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,442
- Really? You think?
- Yeah, I do.

149
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,882
Oh, doughnuts. Ha-ha!

150
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,420
The perks of authority.

151
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,049
No, no, no. What
does this look like?

152
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,722
- Gluttony?
- Gluttony, exactly.

153
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,990
I was just testing you. I'm
gonna save these for the kids.

154
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,067
Lenore Simkins, found down on
the street on 18th and Aberdeen.

155
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,727
Pulse ox is 91, looks like
frostbite on the fingertips.

156
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,407
- Cold out there.
- Hi, Lenore. I'm Dr. Morris.

157
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,339
I'd wish you merry Christmas
but as an employee of County...

158
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,412
I'm duty-bound to respect the
separation of church and state.

159
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,242
Are you kidding?

160
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,440
- Is he kidding?
- I think so.

161
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,079
- Hey.
- Hey.

162
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,088
- Got plans tonight?
- Yeah.

163
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,057
Yeah, me too. With Ray.

164
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,526
That's cool, right?

165
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,927
- It's none of my business.
- Okay.

166
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,567
I just wanted to be sure.

167
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,738
You look annoyed.

168
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:01,272
Well, your friend from Vascular
went in almost 10 minutes ago.

169
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,909
Yeah, I could tell you kind
of aggravated his problem.

170
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,272
What problem?

171
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,175
Rob's got a little
auto-stimulation issue.

172
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:13,345
You know, he can't help tickling
the Elmo, spanking his monkey.

173
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,288
- It's how he got his nickname.
- What nickname?

174
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,885
We call him McCreamy.

175
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,193
McCreamy?

176
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,725
Hey, guys. Sorry about the wait.

177
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,294
It's okay.

178
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,233
God, it was great to
finally meet you, Neela.

179
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,931
I hope we get to
work together soon.

180
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,303
I gotta go.

181
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,209
- How's that, Lenore? Better?
- Mm-hm.

182
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,313
What are you doing
for the holidays?

183
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,580
Besides taking my kid to go
see <i>Return of the Evil Zombies?</i>

184
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,149
Maybe before you go home,
you can let me buy you that drink?

185
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,086
I don't know. I got
presents to wrap.

186
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,037
- Lenore, were you recently hospitalized?
- I was at City of Mercy till last night.

187
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,463
- What for?
- Chest cold.

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,108
Winter's been hard.

189
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,141
How long were you there?

190
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,039
Few days? I'm
not good with time.

191
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,045
Did they release you?

192
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,955
The lady at the hospital said the
ambulance was gonna take me back.

193
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,854
- Back home?
- Don't got one.

194
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,789
I make my own way.

195
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,859
Where'd they drop you off?

196
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,692
They left me in an
alley near 18th Street.

197
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,335
I haven't slept in that
neighborhood in years.

198
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,202
Second unit's infusing now?

199
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,037
I need sterile 10s and a
cordis. He needs central access.

200
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,476
- This is not good. I'll handle this.
- I know how to put in a line, Ray.

201
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,981
Mr. Taylor, we need to do an operation
to stop bleeding in your abdomen.

202
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,349
- Is there someone you want to be here?
- No. You sure this can't wait?

203
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,319
I don't really want
this. Not today.

204
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,718
It's okay, you'll be fine.

205
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,190
It's just, my karma's
not so good right now.

206
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,226
It's not the best time
to go under the knife.

207
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,454
Don't worry, sir.

208
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,122
Here, we treat the naughty as
well as the nice all year round.

209
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,063
We'll take good care of you.

210
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,362
I promise this
is the best thing.

211
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,561
Mayday.

212
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,173
O.R. 2. Dubenko
should be waiting.

213
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,104
Mayday.

214
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,235
Go on, I'll be right up.

215
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,510
- Lizzie's sick.
- We were worried about you.

216
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,315
Lizzie's sick. You need to come.

217
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,754
Your friend? Does she
have what Paulie had?

218
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,417
I don't know. You need to come.

219
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,860
- All right, wait there.
- Pick up the old chart from Records.

220
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,501
- Get the echo from CICU.
- What about the toilet bowls?

221
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,103
- I haven't scrubbed them yet.
- Come with me a minute?

222
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,535
- Oh, thank God.
- Where do you think you're going?

223
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,574
Do you have a toenail extraction
you want me to take notes on?

224
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,008
- Are you too advanced for this?
- If we have problem, spit it out.

225
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,240
- I don't speak bitchy.
- Oh, you seem pretty fluent to me.

226
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:00,285
- Get somebody else, my intern's busy.
- Stop being an idiot, I need Tony's help.

227
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,713
And you too, I've had enough.

228
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,721
Why don't you either
slap each other silly...

229
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,553
or kiss now and
get it over with?

230
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,390
She got bad last night.
Pains everywhere.

231
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,159
Tell me where, I'll
send an ambulance.

232
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,497
- No. I'll take you.
- Doesn't work like that.

233
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,196
Please. You helped Paulie.

234
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,705
You heard about Paulie?

235
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,502
I came back a few days after.

236
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,202
The man at the desk said
he was at the care unit.

237
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,075
That's good, right?

238
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,272
Come on.

239
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,247
If she's sick, she
needs to be in hospital.

240
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,579
She can't walk and she
won't go to a family again.

241
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,016
Teller.

242
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,918
You come. Mayday and you.

243
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,218
- She can't. We can't.
- You have to.

244
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,361
Or else I'm scared
Lizzie's gonna pass.

245
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,886
All right, I'm out of here.

246
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,691
What? No. What? You can't go.

247
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,699
I got no Kovac, no Weaver,
no Pratt. I'm flying without a net.

248
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,361
I'd prefer to be outside of the ER
when it crashes and burns to the ground.

249
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,734
That's what Vegas
oddsmakers say will happen...

250
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,604
the first time you're the
only Attending on the floor.

251
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,941
Melia. What are you doing here?

252
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,878
Daddy.

253
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,544
Daddy?

254
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,050
Great, another one of
Morris's Petri-dish kids.

255
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,712
- What, Morris has kids?
- Four that we know of.

256
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,734
Hope, could you please...
- Right.

257
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:15,320
No, I will take her to the break
room, get her all settled in, come on.

258
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,726
Read her a story or something.

259
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,735
Hey, Morris, it's important.
I need a half-hour.

260
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,426
- Okay.
- It's slow, you can spare...

261
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,163
- Did you just say okay?
- Me, you're trying to leverage.

262
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,465
Him, you just let go?

263
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,303
- You're a Resident, he's an intern.
- I have a date.

264
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,570
So? My daughter's
here, Ray. My daughter.

265
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,182
You don't see me shirking.
Fine, go. I'm already over you.

266
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,408
Hey, Sam. You have a car?

267
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,951
I heard snow, I took the train.

268
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,582
- Truck's in the shop, bro.
- I gotta check on a patient for Neela.

269
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,419
Can I talk to your supervisor?

270
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,292
- Hey, what about Malik? Is he around?
- No, he's not in today.

271
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,592
This is the second time I've
called. Can you ask her to call me?

272
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,598
Sam Taggart.

273
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,133
Mercy said she walked out
on her own, as far as they know.

274
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,468
Some administrator's
gonna get into it.

275
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,611
Looks like they already have.

276
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,139
What? Hey, hey,
hey, where you going?

277
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,805
- She's not ready for transfer.
- You the nurse on this?

278
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,006
We're from Mercy.

279
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,384
- We're gonna take her.
- What?

280
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,114
Supervisor said it was
a misunderstanding.

281
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,482
Are you taking me outside?

282
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,819
No. You're not taking her until
somebody explains what's going on.

283
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,553
A patient ended up in the wrong place.
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

284
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,561
No, you heard the
lady. Turn it around.

285
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,659
- How far is this place?
- Just across the bridge.

286
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,133
Hey, watch it, jerk-off.

287
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,801
I heard you needed a ride.

288
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,651
What does the pancreas do?

289
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:50,313
It makes hormones that help
you process sugar in your blood.

290
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,890
- What are hormones?
- Well...

291
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,653
Whoa, whoa. Okay, okay. You'll
find out about that soon enough.

292
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,524
I was thinking
Dr. Seuss, not Dr. Rosen.

293
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,165
It's okay. I like gross stuff.

294
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,393
Honey, Melia, it is so good to
see you. What are you doing here?

295
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,561
I ran away.

296
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,867
Why, sweetie?

297
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,441
Because of Donald,
Mom's new husband.

298
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,342
He won't let me celebrate Christmas.
He says there's no such thing as Santa.

299
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,615
No. He didn't.

300
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,684
He says there's no
elves, no reindeer...

301
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,343
and Christmas is made up
so people will spend money.

302
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,513
No, that's crazy.

303
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,888
So I decided I would spend
the holiday with my real dad.

304
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,224
That's you.

305
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,532
Crystal meth is
some nasty stuff.

306
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,634
Makes you lie,
makes you paranoid.

307
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,572
I'm clean now.

308
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:48,942
Good for you.

309
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,481
It's too late.

310
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,281
My wife, my kids, moved
away as far as they could.

311
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,593
I messed up so much.

312
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,035
I missed so much
when I was high.

313
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,768
This is where they live.

314
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:26,251
Oliver is 11 now,
and Julia is 9.

315
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,321
They've gone so many years
without hearing from me on Christmas.

316
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,151
Mr. Taylor.

317
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,983
I fully expect this
surgery to be a success.

318
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,324
I know but if you're wrong...

319
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,658
promise me you'll
send them something.

320
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,101
It won't be necessary. But okay.

321
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,003
Thank you. Thank you.

322
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,505
We should call this in.
This girl's really messed up.

323
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,280
If you make anybody come,
we'll just run away someplace else.

324
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,182
It will be fine.

325
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,849
Stop. It's here.

326
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,385
Hurry.

327
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,961
What the hell are we doing?

328
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,667
We're helping kids, Ray.

329
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,632
It's down here.

330
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,068
I love what you've
done with the place.

331
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,536
Follow me.

332
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,972
That's great.

333
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,304
A big old mouse hole.

334
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,845
- Jejunum looks good.
- So does the liver.

335
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,812
Lucien, Victoria's
on the phone again.

336
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,884
Wants to know if you'd like her
to wear blue dress or red dress.

337
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,412
Tell her the blue is nice.

338
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,489
Ileocecal junction's clear.

339
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,652
- Hot date tonight?
- Something like that.

340
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,657
BP is down, 86/40.

341
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,420
Retroperitoneum feels tense.

342
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,063
Bovie to Neela, open it up.

343
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,667
Tachy to 120. DUBENKO:
Hang the blood on the infuser.

344
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,325
Whoa. Suction, now.

345
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,223
He's bleeding out. - Satinsky.

346
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,205
Packing. Keep it coming.
- Five-0 Prolene.

347
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,740
One Castroviejos.

348
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,901
PEA, lost the pulse.
Starting compressions.

349
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,598
Amp of epi and call for blood.

350
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,672
It's too fast,
there's no way to...

351
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,408
Oh, crap, it's here. Sponge
stick times two, let's go.

352
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,785
Five-0 Prolene to me.

353
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,343
Drop pressure.

354
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,013
Up above and below.

355
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,954
Okay, release pressure.

356
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,253
Repair's holding.

357
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,194
Stop CPR.

358
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,566
Normal sinus.

359
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,933
- Good pulse.
- Well, strong work, Dr. Rasgotra.

360
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,872
Once you've seen one supraceliac
aortic tear, you've seen them all.

361
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,545
Don't be scared, it's safe.

362
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,479
Oh, thanks. I feel
so much better now.

363
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,585
Ray, I'm sure you've played
gigs in worse places than this.

364
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:41,982
Oh, God.

365
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,747
Come on.

366
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,925
- Teller's back.
- Who's with him?

367
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,561
You said you'd get Mayday.

368
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,630
It's okay. He
helped save Paulie.

369
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,096
She's diaphoretic.

370
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,600
Please, please, make this go away.
- Yeah, and tachycardic.

371
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,762
Hey, Lizzie, do you
know what day it is?

372
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,267
- It's Christmas. RAY: It's
close enough. She's lucid.

373
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,070
She's pregnant.

374
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,907
She's very pregnant.
The baby's crowning.

375
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,516
I'm sorry. I don't know
how this happened.

376
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,649
Lizzie, give it your
all. Come on, push.

377
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,385
- I can't. GATES: Yes,
you can. Attagirl, come on.

378
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,790
- Attagirl.
- Teller! Teller!

379
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,398
- Who's this baby's father?
- It doesn't have a father.

380
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,125
- Of course it does.
- Lizzie will get the men to help us.

381
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,497
- Ruby, quiet.
- Ray, the shoulder's stuck.

382
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,900
Please get it out. I can't!

383
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,734
- Firm, downward pressure on the head.
- I am. I am.

384
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,412
- Wanna take a shot at it?
- Okay.

385
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,582
All right. Here.

386
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,081
What was she talking
about? What men?

387
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,413
The Greek gives us
food from the restaurant.

388
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,215
The cripple lets us sleep in
the basement when it's cold.

389
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,517
Lizzie takes care of them
and they take care of us.

390
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,125
Okay. All right, here we go.

391
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,399
Here we go. Here we go.

392
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,191
All right. Okay. It's a boy.

393
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,828
It's a boy. It's a boy.

394
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:22,153
Here you go. Okay.

395
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,051
Here you go, okay?
Hold the head.

396
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,092
All right.

397
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,922
There you go.

398
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,063
He's mine?

399
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,803
He's so tiny.

400
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,313
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help.

401
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,676
Teller, get them and run.

402
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,879
You and your baby need
to be seen by a doctor.

403
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,578
- You're a doctor.
- But we can't do what they need here.

404
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,780
- Teller, get them and go.
- It's okay, guys.

405
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,791
- Teller, go.
- Okay, I won't, I won't, I won't.

406
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,952
You guys need to
spend the night in the ER.

407
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,428
You, Lizzie and the
baby. Just the three of you.

408
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,123
Gates, they all need to come.

409
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,131
They look jaundiced,
anemic, they got...

410
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,294
Others can stay. I won't call
foster care or Social Services.

411
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,996
Gates, what are you doing?

412
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,933
- Promise?
- Yeah, promise.

413
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,920
He lost a lot of blood. It could be a while
before we know his neurologic outcome.

414
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,456
I know.

415
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,352
Where are you
spending Christmas?

416
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,998
Oh, I spend the holidays
with my sister every year.

417
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,157
That's sweet. Older or younger?

418
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,199
Both, actually.

419
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,170
Two years older
but stuck at 17...

420
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,468
in a car wreck the night of her
prom. Her boyfriend was drunk.

421
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,544
That's awful.

422
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,213
It could've been worse, though.

423
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,815
She's in an independent
living facility in Evanston.

424
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,951
I see her fairly frequently.

425
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,621
In fact, I gotta get out of here.
We have a nice dinner tonight.

426
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,620
She likes to dress up.

427
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,701
Your oxygen level's back up.

428
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,964
Am I gonna be able to stay here?

429
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:24,008
You're getting better, you don't
really need to be hospitalized anymore.

430
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,702
Is there somewhere
that you'd like to go?

431
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,313
Not the street.

432
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,914
Not tonight.

433
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,975
Got any family?

434
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,553
Well, my parents are in
Gary, Indiana, where I grew up.

435
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,987
But we haven't
talked in a long time.

436
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,354
I don't know if they'd
even recognize me.

437
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,864
I'll be back to check on
you in a little bit, okay?

438
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:47,859
Any word from Mercy?

439
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,433
Not yet.

440
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:52,094
Poor lady's all
alone in the world.

441
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,738
At least we can clean her up...

442
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,034
set her up with new
clothes for Christmas.

443
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,437
I'll see what I can do.

444
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,545
Hey, Sam, Drunk Santa
needs a banana bag...

445
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,180
and a few hours to sleep it off.

446
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,043
Oh, that is such a shame.

447
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,514
Yeah, sloth, sloth, sloth.

448
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,719
Fifteen-year-old,
postpartum, needs stitches...

449
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,289
little newborn baby,
warmer and Pedes consult.

450
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,427
- Where'd you find them?
- We followed a star in the northern sky.

451
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,391
Okay, Trauma 2.

452
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,259
Children's Services is
on their way. I called up.

453
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,960
- You did what?
- You'll be okay, Teller.

454
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,262
You promised.

455
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,460
- Gates.
- What?

456
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:28,574
- You swore you wouldn't force them.
- I got them here, didn't I?

457
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,073
You said we could trust you.

458
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,967
That's... Nice job, Gates.

459
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,781
You from Mercy?

460
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,546
Nurse Taggart? Hillary Lerner.

461
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,815
Is it your policy to dump
destitute patients on the street?

462
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,653
- Why would we do that?
- It's bad for your neighborhood.

463
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,159
- No, there was a mistake with Miss...
- Simkins?

464
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,729
- Lenore Simkins.
- Yes. That's why I sent my people...

465
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,059
I'm not gonna release her...

466
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,828
so you can have a second
chance to make her disappear.

467
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,233
- I don't know what she told you...
- Come with me.

468
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:02,341
You behaved badly, so
here's your lump of coal, okay?

469
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:06,104
You have your boys take Ms. Simkins
to her parents' place in Gary, Indiana.

470
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,746
Gary? That's over an hour away.

471
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,849
You'll pay for the round trip,
and this will never happen again.

472
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,180
Because I ever get wind of a patient
being dumped by your hospital...

473
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,563
I will call the cops
so fast I'm not sure

474
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,949
if you're gonna get
fired or arrested first.

475
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:20,953
Yeah. Got it.

476
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,527
Hey, Lenore. This is Hillary.

477
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:28,259
She's gonna make sure you get
to see your parents for Christmas.

478
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:36,834
We, by which I mean to say
Dr. Gates, promised no foster care.

479
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,375
Well, that would be a mistake.

480
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,206
By law, they need to be placed.

481
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,278
Getting them to give
up the life they have...

482
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,543
- that takes a light touch, Ray.
- Is that what you call lying?

483
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,619
I wasn't gonna take a
chance on losing them.

484
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,482
You turned us into
every bad adult...

485
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,057
- that these kids were ever screwed by.
- That's so sweet and so naive.

486
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,057
I'll send a van to pick
up the other children.

487
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,059
- Good.
- If you pick them up today...

488
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,390
they'll be gone tomorrow.

489
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,055
These kids won't just submit.

490
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,895
Need to be convinced that
they'll be safe and protected.

491
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,559
We'll try to keep them together.

492
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,899
I can't promise they
won't end up in foster care.

493
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,065
- But you'll make sure they're okay, right?
- We always do.

494
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,474
Come on. These kids are smart.
They know that that's not how it goes.

495
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,205
A social worker will follow
up. It's the best I can do.

496
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,749
No, no, no. That's
not good enough.

497
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,212
I can't believe you got
CPS to agree to that.

498
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,050
Actually, it was
Ray's brainstorm.

499
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:27,352
The trick's getting
the kids to accept it.

500
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,089
Teller. Listen.

501
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,589
Child Protective Services...

502
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,859
has arranged for all of you to
live together in a group home.

503
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,526
- You said no foster care.
- Hear us out, Teller...

504
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,365
- Wait, Teller, Teller.
- No, I won't go. You lied!

505
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,941
It's not safe out
there, all right?

506
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,874
We survive. No one hurts us.

507
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,515
What Lizzie's doing, having
sex for money and shelter?

508
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,412
- That's hurting her. Hurting all of you.
- Don't say that!

509
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,019
If you weren't sleeping in
old abandoned buildings...

510
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,418
Paulie would have
never gotten sick.

511
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,490
But you fixed him.

512
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,984
He's getting better.

513
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,287
No, we didn't.

514
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,488
Paulie died.

515
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,797
I'm sorry. I wanted
to tell you his...

516
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,309
His infection was too severe
and we couldn't save him but...

517
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,536
I wanna see him.

518
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,909
I know I lied to you. I'm
not gonna lie anymore.

519
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,415
I don't believe you.

520
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,110
It's not working. The way
you're living is not working.

521
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,813
- You're a smart kid. You can see that.
- Let go, let go.

522
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:34,653
Listen to me. You can't
go on like this anymore.

523
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,833
Teller...

524
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,532
Lizzie agreed to go.

525
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,531
It's the only way she
can keep her baby.

526
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,603
And the rest of us will
just stay with them?

527
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,845
That's right.

528
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,450
And Dr. Gates will come
and visit every two weeks...

529
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,610
and make sure things
are okay, all right?

530
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,123
You need me for anything at any
time, you call me, and I'll be there.

531
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,324
You would do that?

532
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,354
Yeah.

533
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,201
Listen.

534
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,164
Now, I need you to take the social
workers to where the others are.

535
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,037
And let the kids know that
it's okay and safe to come in.

536
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,939
Will you do that?

537
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,878
I'll wait with you
here, Teller. Come on.

538
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,575
Thank you.

539
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:36,379
Well, that went better
than expected, huh?

540
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,612
Yeah?

541
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,281
That kid may not survive
another round of your games.

542
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,826
Come on, I've been
trying to help the kid all day.

543
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,987
Gates, you'll say
anything to seal the deal.

544
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,066
I understand that. I've done that.
But these are messed-up kids.

545
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,135
- You gotta draw the line somewhere.
- And what line is that?

546
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,571
If you're making promises you
have no intention of keeping...

547
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,335
just cut loose.

548
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,911
Minimize the damage, okay?

549
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,616
This isn't just
about the kids, is it?

550
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,719
No, it's not.

551
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:20,396
Hey, how about you give me a
few hours to wrap some presents?

552
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,673
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

553
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,505
This scares me.

554
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,819
What, Ames?

555
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,179
What it's doing to you.

556
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,680
To us.

557
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,821
It took us so long to get here.

558
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,795
All of us.

559
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,993
And the way you're acting, how
it's taking over our whole lives...

560
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:01,004
it makes me scared
we're gonna lose this.

561
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,479
When Jasna and the kids died...

562
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:18,056
I needed to make a change
and I decided to move here.

563
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,858
Made my brother really angry.

564
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,221
He said...

565
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:27,024
He said that I was a coward
and that I was running away.

566
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,196
And it's only recently that I've
come to know that he was wrong.

567
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,971
I wasn't running
away from anything.

568
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,372
I was running to you.

569
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:51,323
And I'll never let
anything take this away.

570
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,746
Did I mention how
hot you look in antlers?

571
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:27,689
- I think she's in here, Santa.
- Ho, ho, ho!

572
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,124
Has anyone seen a little
girl named Melia Simon?

573
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,388
That's her right there.

574
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:37,059
Oh, my reindeer needed a little rest,
so I thought I'd come by and say hi.

575
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,726
How do you do? I'm Santa Claus.

576
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,099
Hi, Santa.

577
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,104
Can't stay long,
very, very busy.

578
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:46,405
Gotta deliver presents to the
whole western hemisphere tonight.

579
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,804
Nice try, Archie.
I know it's you.

580
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:53,246
Archie? Who's Archie?

581
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:57,048
I'm 9 years old. I know
there's no Santa, okay?

582
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,885
You know, you're
a bright girl, Melia.

583
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,526
But you're wrong about that.

584
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,757
It's a fake beard
and a dumb suit.

585
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,993
Don't you know
that there's a rule...

586
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,659
that if millions of kids believe in
the same thing, it becomes real?

587
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,901
- That's not a rule.
- Yeah.

588
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:18,840
Every time you're generous or thoughtful
or help someone who needs help...

589
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,411
that's a little
bit of Santa too.

590
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,842
What are you talking about?

591
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,252
Come on.

592
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:31,188
Santa Claus represents one of
the last remaining bits of magic...

593
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,654
left in this world.

594
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:38,456
Now, I still believe, so
don't spoil it for me, okay?

595
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:40,926
Come on.

596
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,692
Where we going?

597
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,637
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

598
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,174
Wait, it's Santa.

599
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,836
Oh, you were a very,
very nice girl this year.

600
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,641
Top of the nice list.

601
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,808
Would it be all right
if I signed your cast?

602
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,514
Thank you.

603
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,618
To Greta...

604
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,191
Keep on being nice.

605
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,387
Love, Santa.

606
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,064
How'd you know my name?

607
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,564
Come on, I'm Santa Claus, huh?

608
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,794
Merry Christmas.

609
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,736
It's the real Santa, isn't it?

610
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,034
Yeah.

611
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,608
It is.

612
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,582
You lost almost a third
of your blood volume.

613
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,209
Give us a few
days to buff you up.

614
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,714
Plus, I have a present for you.

615
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:44,625
These are for them.

616
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,034
Things were a little touch-and-go
for a while, so I called them.

617
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,740
- How do I explain...?
- It's Christmas.

618
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,171
You don't have to. Trust me.

619
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,841
Hey, princess.

620
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,342
Hey, buddy.

621
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,747
Look at you guys.

622
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,750
You're all grown up.

623
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,400
You getting out of here soon?

624
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,857
I have a cajillion
notes to write.

625
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,891
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

626
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:18,758
- Off to your sister's, I take it?
- Yeah.

627
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,094
It's for you. Merry
Christmas, Neela.

628
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,428
I don't normally do this.

629
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:26,868
Work presents always end up being
something edible and bad for you...

630
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,439
or something impersonal
like organic soap.

631
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,407
Who needs that crap cluttering
up their bathroom anyway?

632
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,069
Oh, loops, wow.

633
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,478
Yeah. That's my very first pair.

634
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,151
Bought them for
myself in med school.

635
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,310
Thank you. It's a lovely gift.

636
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,947
Listen.

637
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:53,566
You're an intern and I'm an Attending,
and there are certain protocols...

638
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:58,227
certain hierarchies
that preclude me from...

639
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,427
Lucien.

640
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,573
Being direct about
this, but it's Christmas...

641
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,641
what the hell, I'm
just gonna say it.

642
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,213
You're a really
good surgeon, Neela.

643
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,012
A few more years
and you could be great.

644
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,082
Thank you.

645
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,990
You're gonna try them on?

646
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,319
I will.

647
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,829
Beautiful.

648
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:36,775
You repeat this conversation to
anyone, and I will deny it. You know that.

649
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,376
What conversation?

650
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,136
Lovely.

651
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:41,712
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

652
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,281
Transplant rounds are at 7.

653
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,762
Thank you. Bye, sweetheart.

654
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,034
Look out, Kriss Kringle.
What's going on, Morris?

655
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,969
Oh, we did okay, Greg.

656
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,540
Just okay?

657
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,372
Either you rocked the house
or you were closed to patients.

658
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,377
No, we just moved
people through.

659
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:18,039
All right, all right. Go
ahead, you can gloat now.

660
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,378
Tell me all about what a
great manager you are.

661
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,351
I saved Jerry, I diagnosed
D.I.D., yadda yadda.

662
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,989
Know what?

663
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,560
I'm gonna go with
humility this time.

664
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,562
For real.

665
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,187
Humili -what?

666
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,432
Hey.

667
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,393
I learned a lot
watching you today.

668
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,405
Yeah, well, I'm
full of it, Hope.

669
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,536
I get it, Archie.

670
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,272
I know you don't believe
half of what you say but...

671
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,075
You know what?

672
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,309
It doesn't really matter.

673
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,749
Because I saw you today.

674
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:03,953
And what I saw was a
guy who's trying to be good.

675
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,597
And...

676
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:09,260
I don't know, that right
there is half the battle.

677
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,138
Have a good holiday.

678
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:15,832
What are you doing?

679
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,534
What?

680
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:23,579
Now. Are you going home?

681
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,149
I thought maybe we could...

682
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,449
Grab a bite, get a
drink, see what happens.

683
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,719
Chastity's always
been overrated.

684
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:41,924
Purity of spirit is what
it's all about, right?

685
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,666
Wait, wait, are you...?

686
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,432
What are you saying?

687
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,641
You know what?

688
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,587
I don't think so.

689
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,393
What?

690
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,926
I hate that I'm saying this.

691
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:20,169
It's like some dorky angel
has taken control of my mouth.

692
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,034
But...

693
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,136
No.

694
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,609
What?

695
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,037
What?

696
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:35,051
It's Christmas, and people
get lonely on Christmas...

697
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,712
and we might do something
that we'd both regret...

698
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:42,417
or could get in the way of a possibly
deeper relationship in the future.

699
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,719
So...

700
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,799
I'm sorry.

701
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:53,402
Hey. Hey.

702
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,131
You stole my suit.

703
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,700
Well, what about you?

704
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,710
Me?

705
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,570
Yes, where are you from...

706
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,546
what are you doing
here, what's your damage?

707
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,420
I spent a couple of
years in the service...

708
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,680
and managed to spend
my time in Okinawa...

709
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,223
which is a hell of a lot better
than being in Iraq or Afghanistan.

710
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,854
Since I've come back,
I work as a traveler.

711
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,725
Yeah, I did that for a while,
but then I got tired of it.

712
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:22,527
So wait, you have
what, a week or so left?

713
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,328
It's supposed to be a week.

714
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,835
But this place seems all right.

715
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,065
It seems like
pretty great people.

716
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,075
I mean, like, what we did for
that lady today, what you did...

717
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,402
That was something.

718
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:39,074
Come on, everyone deserves a
little bit of happiness at Christmastime.

719
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,480
Yeah.

720
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,484
So I called the nursing director,
and I signed on for another month.

721
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:49,617
Really?

722
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,729
Really.

723
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,100
Well.

724
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,731
Merry Christmas, Ben.

725
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,606
Merry Christmas, Samantha.

726
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,435
Idiot.

727
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,441
Moron.

728
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,448
She was right there.

729
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,483
Right there for the fondling,
and you just let her go.

730
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,119
Why? Why?

731
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,688
Why'd you have to be
such a good Christian, huh?

732
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,318
There's no God.
There's no Christmas.

733
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,093
There's no freaking Santa Claus.

734
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:26,706
Merry Christmas.

735
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,807
Holy...
