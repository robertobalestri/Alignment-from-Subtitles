1
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,467
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,871
Neela, say hi to Mae Lee Park.
She's our new surgical med student.

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,705
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- I appreciate you taking the time.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,439
- Oh, it's my pleasure.
- Tell me you're not getting married.

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,948
- If you tell anyone I'll kill you.
- Wedding is on.

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,281
What am I supposed to do? "Can I
have DNA? I wanna find if I'm your father"?

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,787
- What if I'm not?
- I'm gonna send Alex away.

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,686
Mom, I don't wanna stay here.

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,727
Mom, please.

10
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,693
Mom, I'll be better, okay?

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,354
Neela...

12
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,333
No, I'm not buying
that silly excuse.

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,502
You've been cleaning
the room for three hours.

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,308
My patient needs a tele
bed right now. You hear me?

15
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,111
- Thirty-five, 21...
- Hello? Hello?

16
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,311
- What is wrong with the phones?
- Eighty-five.

17
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,854
They're working on
them today. Thirty-three...

18
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:58,993
Hey, Pratt. Pratt. Here's
your new medical student.

19
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,890
- What new medical student?
- Larry Weston, third year, UIC.

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,328
- Yeah, why wasn't I told about this?
- I'm telling you now.

21
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,627
Great, great. Look, Barry, I...

22
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,396
- That's Larry.
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that, man.

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,507
I didn't know you were coming
and I'm getting off soon, so Morris...

24
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:17,042
Uh-uh. Don't look at
me. Forty-one, 21, 55...

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,906
There's a Dr. Gates
working today.

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,243
Find him and tell him Dr. Pratt
said you're gonna be shadowing him.

27
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,907
- Dr. Gates.
- You can't miss him.

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,246
Swarthy, always has
his hands in his pockets.

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,513
- Got it.
- All right.

30
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,180
I always knew you had a cruel streak.
- Hey, Pratt.

31
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,327
Will you sign off on my
thumb-versus-table-saw guy?

32
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,395
- Anyone know who's on surgical
call? MORRIS: I think Neela is. Why?

33
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,828
- Hey, guys. Sam's birthday.
- No reason.

34
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,594
Drinks at Ike's later and
everybody has to sign her card.

35
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,395
Jeez, could you
find a bigger card?

36
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,039
Despite what you've been
told, Ray, size does matter.

37
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,698
Hey, I'm going to get coffee.
Does anybody want one?

38
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,435
- No, it's cool.
- No, I'm good.

39
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,807
You okay, Frank?

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,441
Oh, my back's a
little stiff. It's fine.

41
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,684
- Okay. MORRIS:
Twenty-four, 16, 69...

42
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,055
- Morris, what are you doing?
- It's a well-known medical axiom:

43
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,887
If the ages of all the patients in the ER
add up to a thousand, you can go home.

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,940
- So far, I'm up to 781.
- That for real?

45
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:12,227
I heard your shift is over when
you treat a pirate and his parrot.

46
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,761
Nobody's going
anywhere unless I say so.

47
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,530
And I say, Ray,
infected tummy tuck in 2.

48
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,639
Morris, we got a rig
pulling in any minute.

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,536
And you can go out
and calculate that.

50
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,439
Twenty-five, 29, 81...

51
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,410
Knuckleheads. I'm
surrounded by knuckleheads.

52
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,783
Hey.

53
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,388
Hey, Luka. Sorry,
I really need this.

54
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,150
- Long night last night?
- Sam, could you give me a hand?

55
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,156
Yeah, sure.

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,060
Don't worry. Your caffeine fix will
be waiting for you at the Admit desk.

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,625
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Thanks, Luka.

58
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,634
Alfred Gower, 63.
Blocked G-tube.

59
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,137
Under hospice care for
end-stage esophageal cancer.

60
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,402
- Hospice? Then why is he here?
- It's a G-tube. It's a comfort measure.

61
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,672
- What the hell?
- Been at it since we picked him up.

62
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,281
Ma'am, you need to stop that.

63
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,115
Hear we're going out for
drinks for your birthday.

64
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,982
We don't have to. It's not a
big deal. Know what, lady?

65
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,647
Knock it off or I'll rip that
camera out of your hands.

66
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,622
It's all right. She's with me.

67
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,584
I don't care. You're in our way.

68
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,129
Come on, I'm authorized.
Smile for the camera, birthday girl.

69
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,426
Hey, knock it o...

70
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,540
- Can I help you with something, Morris?
- No, but I can help you with one word:

71
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,275
- Las Vegas.
- Pardon?

72
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:41,046
Okay, two words. It is the hot
venue for destination weddings.

73
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,053
- What? How did you...?
- No, don't worry.

74
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,627
I've been sworn to
secrecy. So Las Vegas.

75
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,764
It has glitz, glamour,
Celine Dion...

76
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,127
Abby and I are not the
glitz-and-glamour type.

77
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,963
There are plenty of cultural
things to do. The Hoover Dam.

78
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,128
Liberace Museum. Nudes on Ice...

79
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,240
Morris, I'm not
talking about this.

80
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,706
And if I were you, I
wouldn't mention it to Abby.

81
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,469
What about for
your bachelor party?

82
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,204
Did I mention the brothels
in Nevada? They're legal.

83
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,078
- What's legal?
- Uh, cockfighting in Louisiana.

84
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,117
Good to know.

85
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,989
- You all right?
- I'm great. Great.

86
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,092
I'd love to have this chat, but
I think I hear Frank calling me.

87
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,320
Yep, there is it.
Frank, what's up?

88
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,128
Uh, hello, I'm Dr...

89
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,960
Lockhart.

90
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,570
- Uh, so you fainted at the...?
- Sun N' Go.

91
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,071
- I was waiting for a tanning bed...
- She passed out. It was awful.

92
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,008
- Did you have breakfast?
- Mm-hm.

93
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,735
Diet soda and two saltines.

94
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,846
That doesn't really
sound like breakfast.

95
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,515
We'll be tan and thin for
spring break if it kills us.

96
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,911
- Yeah.
- You're on your way.

97
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,849
Hey, Sam, can I get 2 liters
of saline and a chem panel?

98
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,319
Sure. Wow, that's some
color you guys got there.

99
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,788
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

100
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,986
Tanning puts you at risk for cancer.
Think about self-tanner or spray-on tans?

101
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,133
You don't wanna have skin like
leather when you're in your 40s.

102
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,268
We're still at an age
where we care how we look.

103
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,629
Mm-hm.

104
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,566
Okay, uh...

105
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,541
We're gonna need to keep you
here while we wait for your labs.

106
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,975
Ouch. I cannot believe we just
got dissed by those walking raisins.

107
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,706
I hope it rains every
day on spring break.

108
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,319
- Oh, happy birthday, by the way.
- Thanks.

109
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,614
Hey, Mr. Gower. We got
a new G-tube in your size.

110
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,622
You can't unclog it?

111
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,785
They tried flushing it but it didn't
work, so a doctor has to replace it.

112
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,362
Let's forget about the G-tube.

113
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,795
I'll buy us all a steak
and a bottle of Cabernet.

114
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,801
That's tempting, but how about I get
you a puréed meal and an Ensure chaser?

115
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,132
Somehow that
doesn't quite make it.

116
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,404
Uh, I didn't get a chance
before, but I'm Diana Moore.

117
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:50,243
- Hi, Sam Taggart. Listen, about earlier...
- Don't worry about it. No problem.

118
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,909
Uh, no, I wanted to say that
even if you are authorized...

119
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,679
you can't get in the
way of us doing our job.

120
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,984
Uh, okay, it won't happen again.

121
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,821
Don't blame Diana. She's
dedicated to her work.

122
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,122
What is that? Patient paparazzi?

123
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:08,164
Yeah, actually, I'm documenting
hospice patients through their deaths.

124
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,866
But I keep mucking it up
by continuing to breathe.

125
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,437
It's all about you, isn't it?

126
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,870
I gotta hang around long
enough to convince her...

127
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,943
- to run away with me to Cabo.
- And I'm holding out for Maui.

128
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,176
- Okay, Maui.
- Well, okay, then.

129
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,112
Sam, do you have someplace
I could stash my stuff...

130
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,774
and maybe upload some photos?

131
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,420
You know what? Let
me check, I'll be back.

132
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,354
Hey, Frank. Can I get a
puréed meal for Trauma 1?

133
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,188
- You're asking me because...?
- Make it mashed potatoes and turkey.

134
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,560
- Somebody's getting bossy in her old age.
- I'm only 28.

135
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,225
Yeah, well, live it up while you
can. You're about to hit the big 3-0.

136
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,870
I'm not afraid of turning 30.

137
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,530
- Morris, I got the G-tube for Mr. Gower.
- Well, I think you should be.

138
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,200
That's when gravity takes over
and everything north turns south.

139
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,244
- What?
- He means you got a small window...

140
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,143
before you go from
miss to ma'am...

141
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:59,116
skinny jeans to relaxed fit, blond
highlights to little black chin hairs.

142
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,926
- Oh, that's so wrong.
- No, really.

143
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,718
You're a smart guy, and I
know Pratt assigned you to me...

144
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,483
but I do my best work alone.

145
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,161
- But I really wanna learn.
- Categorize the charts here.

146
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,661
- You want them by patient name...?
- Surprise me.

147
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,662
Frank, you know
anything about Bluetooth?

148
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,994
- What is a blue tooth?
- I'll take that as a no.

149
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,467
It's my little thing that's broken.
I can't dictate my notes into it.

150
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,732
Get a secretary.

151
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:39,158
- Oh. Hi. Getting coffee.
- Hey, uh. Tea.

152
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,290
Excuse me.

153
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:48,633
- Honey?
- Yeah. What? Um... Sorry. Here.

154
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,494
- You busy?
- Very.

155
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,503
How long you been
working on the project?

156
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,697
About a year.

157
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,706
- I'm gonna go.
- Me too.

158
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,607
- You don't find it a tad morbid?
- Well, yeah.

159
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,875
I mean, it's been known to stop a
few conversations at cocktail parties...

160
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,387
but I'm not really just documenting
the end of somebody's existence.

161
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,549
I'm telling the story of
people's lives, rich with history...

162
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,194
engaged in the
struggle to survive.

163
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,823
- But don't they ever wanna let go?
- Yeah, sometimes.

164
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,899
It could be beautiful
too, you know?

165
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,401
I've seen a lot of
dying in my life...

166
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,873
but it just made
me wanna live more.

167
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,406
What do you mean "dying"?

168
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,572
Name a war or civil unrest
since 1984, I've been there.

169
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,981
Covered it. Somalia, Chechnya,
Tiananmen Square, Iraq.

170
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,489
I can see why you're
a big hit at parties.

171
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,418
Yeah, well, you know what,
when their eyes start to glaze over...

172
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,257
I trot out stories of the
famous fashion photographer...

173
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,331
I worked with in
Paris out of school.

174
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,325
Paris?

175
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,094
Wow, I always
wanted to see Paris.

176
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,236
Eighteen, no responsibilities,
nothing to tie me down.

177
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,772
- You know what I mean.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

178
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,278
I went through this
avant-garde stint for a while.

179
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:12,078
That didn't pay the rent, so
I tried nature photography.

180
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,551
Think models have attitude?

181
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,916
Try working with a moose.

182
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,552
- An exciting life.
- The grass isn't always greener.

183
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,457
- You like photography?
- Oh, no, please.

184
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,628
I'm lucky if I don't put my finger
over the lens on a disposable camera.

185
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,973
I gotta go. Use the room
for as long as you want.

186
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,045
Excuse me, coming
through. Hey, what you got?

187
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,149
Derek Marchak, 32, driver of a
jackknifed truck on the Dan Ryan.

188
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,818
- Where's Mary?
- Good vitals, deep lacs, abdominal pain.

189
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,477
- We'll call her.
- She was with me. She rides with me.

190
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,250
They were cutting her out.
Truck was mangled bad.

191
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,104
I gotta go to her,
she'll be scared.

192
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,770
- I gotta go to her.
- Settle down.

193
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,127
As soon as we find
her, we'll let you know.

194
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,132
Corey Hales, semi versus compact.
Sheared the roof right off the car.

195
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:05,068
- Tachy to 132, systolic 74, sats 94.
- Was he conscious on the scene?

196
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,900
He went apneic
in the rig, GCS 7.

197
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,598
Vincent Hales,
restrained driver.

198
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,768
- Daddy's here. Hang in there.
- Why isn't he boarded and collared?

199
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,505
- He refused. Wanted to be with his boy.
- Not acceptable.

200
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,582
Was walking and
talking with good vitals.

201
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,684
Son was crashing, I
wasn't about to argue.

202
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,725
- He's gonna be okay?
- Sats down to 83.

203
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,087
- Okay, let's move it.
- Lungs clear, breath sounds are equal.

204
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,523
- Let them know we moved Mr. Gower.
- Belly's soft, stable pelvis.

205
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:31,028
- I'll get his arm for you.
- CBC, trauma panel, type and cross.

206
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,194
Got a flash. RAY:
What happened, man?

207
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,924
I don't know. It
was all so fast.

208
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,536
Okay, we need a tox screen
and an ETOH level as well.

209
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,502
- Hi.
- Hey, Mayday.

210
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,201
I got a page. I'm Dr. Rasgotra
from Surgery. Does anything hurt?

211
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,879
Not really. My wife, did
they bring in my wife?

212
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,846
Let us work on you.
- I'll find out.

213
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,612
Alert and oriented. Vitals
good, needs Surgery to sign off.

214
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,219
Lower extremities clear,
no step-offs, no deformities.

215
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,619
- Some nasty knee surgeries.
- Medial meniscus? ACL? Anything?

216
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,558
- Both. Old war wounds, football.
- Oh, yeah? Where'd you play?

217
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:07,030
Bunch of places, Indiana, Ohio.
I was pretty good for a while.

218
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,567
- Can I get you to sign this quick?
- What is it?

219
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,568
Consent to treatment.

220
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,433
We need you to sign before
we can do any labs or tests.

221
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,509
Where it says
patient's signature.

222
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,741
He may have hit his head
harder than we thought.

223
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,144
All right, better get
a scan. Sam, call CT.

224
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,081
Good mechanism for ICH, right?

225
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,312
Yeah, car crashes are
a leading cause of TBI.

226
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,925
- Phone's out. GATES:
Irrigation tray, 4-by-4 of 0 silk.

227
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,754
- Hey.
- Sats only 81.

228
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,190
Does your phone work?

229
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah. BOBECK: No,
I got it, I got it. I'm in.

230
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,062
Are you in pain, Mr. Hales?

231
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,861
Someone take him to Exam 3...

232
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,266
get a C-collar on him, have
a Resident check him out.

233
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,735
- I'm staying with my son.
- Chuny, call for a vent.

234
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,169
She needs to access first.

235
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,276
His pressure is too
low. He's too clamped.

236
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,036
We were driving back from
Ohio. Went to see my parents.

237
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,512
Okay, IO going
into the left tibia.

238
00:11:55,682 --> 00:12:00,052
Okay, run a liter of NS through the
IO, place another one on the other side.

239
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,019
- I'll do a subclavian.
- BP's 76/24.

240
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,124
- What's that mean? ABBY:
His pressure's too low.

241
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,750
- He might be bleeding internally.
- Hey, Sam, is Neela next door?

242
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,124
- Yeah.
- Can you please ask her to come in here?

243
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,961
I got a stab wound to the neck in Triage.
I can't find anybody in a white coat.

244
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,797
- Pratt, you go.
- Pulse is in the 140s.

245
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,633
Push unit's almost in.
Hanging O-neg in the other IO.

246
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,036
Damn, I can't get a flash.

247
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,769
Hypotensive kid with no good
access? Shall I put in a femoral?

248
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,379
Yeah, go ahead.

249
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,542
Hey, I saw him
after the accident.

250
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,878
Eighteen gauge and
a Cordis introducer.

251
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,145
Hey, he was driving
the truck, wasn't he?

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,812
He's the one who caused this.
- We don't know that.

253
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,822
Hey, you. I'm talking to you.

254
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:43,258
Hey, look what you did to my son.
- Mr. Hales, calm down.

255
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,331
- He killed my wife and daughter.
- That kid gonna be all right?

256
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,502
- If you don't control yourself...
- What he's saying, is it true?

257
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,002
- Did I do that? VINCENT:
What am I supposed to do?

258
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,005
You killed my wife and daughter.

259
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,972
Bastard.

260
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,340
Stole the film
off the processor.

261
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,918
- How much in so far?
- Almost 3 liters.

262
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,887
Vitals? MARQUEZ:
Pulse is 138. BP 75/29.

263
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,050
- It's okay, son, you're doing great.
- The fluid's not touching him.

264
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,662
That's because it's not
getting into his circulation.

265
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,526
- SI joint disruption.
- Pelvic fracture. I'll get the T-POD.

266
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:23,659
All the fluid we're running into his lower
extremities is pouring into the fracture.

267
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,396
- He needs access above the break.
- How do I get this on?

268
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,406
- I'll show you.
- Mae Lee?

269
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,545
Dr. Dubenko sent me to observe.
You can do an IO up there?

270
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,682
It's a little trickier to get the
position right, but you can.

271
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,874
Two hundred mics
per kilo of Factor 7A.

272
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,282
All right, I'm in. Running
the blood up here.

273
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,047
He should go upstairs for
angio and then maybe the O.R.

274
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,421
- You mean an operation?
- Perhaps, but he should be okay.

275
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,628
You hear that,
buddy? It's all good.

276
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,302
CT results.

277
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,396
We got word on your wife. She's
being choppered in. Be here soon.

278
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,269
- Did they say how she is?
- Uh, no.

279
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,434
- But I'll get an update.
- Thanks.

280
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,103
Well, good news. Your neck is fine
and your brain looks normal and healthy.

281
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,909
Yeah, I bet.

282
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,909
If I wasn't so damn stupid, my wife
wouldn't be coming in here by chopper.

283
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,111
Kids wouldn't be hurt.

284
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,950
You need to be
observed overnight.

285
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,888
We'll keep you down
here till we find you a bed.

286
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,457
You should rest now,
Mr. Marchak, okay?

287
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,567
So, birthday girl, you
been getting your sexy on...

288
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,261
now that Alex is away at
that fancy boarding school?

289
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,099
It's not fancy, Morris.

290
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,800
I sent my kid there because he
needs help. More than I could give him.

291
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,070
Of course. I'm sorry.

292
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,914
Yeah, but now I feel like I
might've made a mistake.

293
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,279
I've been e-mailing him, I've been
calling him, but he's ignoring me.

294
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,148
No, no, no, you did the
right thing. Alex needed help.

295
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,085
It may take him
some time to adjust...

296
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,657
but don't worry, everything's
gonna turn out fine.

297
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,293
Hope so.

298
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,487
Hey, Frank, any updates on the
chopper with the trucker's wife?

299
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,359
- Negative.
- Any calls for me?

300
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,591
Double negative.

301
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:06,200
Hey, Abby, awesome
save on that boy today.

302
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,534
Oh, thank you, Hope.
You were a big help.

303
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:14,841
So there's something I'd like to
talk to you about if you have a minute.

304
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,984
I don't really right
now, but maybe later?

305
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,676
Sure, no problem.

306
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,845
Yeah, Alex Taggart. No. Has
he gotten any of my messages?

307
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,218
Sam, my pancreatitis
guy needs orthostatics...

308
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,622
- an NG tube and repeat blood gas.
- Yeah, sure.

309
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,888
Give the results to
Kovac. I'm out of here.

310
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,123
Will you just tell him that his
mother called again? Thank you.

311
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,532
- What is this?
- Oh, no, Sam, you don't have to...

312
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,696
"Ten Don'ts Before You Say I Do.

313
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,173
Taffeta or Tulle,
It's Up to You."

314
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,182
- Are you getting married?
- Me? No.

315
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:54,980
It's just... This is wedding research
that I've collected over the years.

316
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,749
It weighs a ton. How long
you been doing research?

317
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,588
- Since I was 10. SAM:
Ten? What's it doing here?

318
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:05,357
Well, someone I know
is getting married...

319
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,659
and I thought she
might like to borrow it...

320
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,827
without getting
angry or hurting me.

321
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,098
I have no idea how to plan a
wedding, when that ever happens to me.

322
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:18,210
Weddings are wonderful
and they're magical and...

323
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,845
Oh.

324
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,778
Oops. So sorry.

325
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,687
Well, I would be honored,
Sam, to help you...

326
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:33,384
when your day comes.

327
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,362
Thanks.

328
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,091
Wow. Tony, I can't believe
you let me do a paracentesis.

329
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,792
Well, my philosophy is 90
percent of learning is doing.

330
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,301
I was wondering, though.

331
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,099
As an intern, don't
you need supervision?

332
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,435
Let's just keep that
between you and me, okay?

333
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,909
Nobody really needs to know
about it. People like Kovac, Pratt.

334
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,412
- Yeah, got it, got it.
- Hey, Neela.

335
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,277
Why don't you go
check on the charts?

336
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,544
Double-check them.
Be thorough. It'll be fun.

337
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,119
- Yeah, cool. Cool.
- Okay?

338
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,949
- Need help?
- Oh, thanks, but we're...

339
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,149
I've got it, Neela. Lucien
wants you to stay down here.

340
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,623
Lucien does?

341
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,464
- So how are things?
- Good.

342
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,069
Sarah spent the weekend
with her grandparents.

343
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,434
It gave me time to think
about everything, you know.

344
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:25,673
I'm gonna talk to her about what Meg
said and the whole paternity-test thing.

345
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,076
- Any idea how she'll take it?
- I don't know.

346
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,081
I'm still having a hard
time with it myself.

347
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,986
If there's anything I can do...

348
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,281
I don't wanna put you
in an awkward position.

349
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,684
I know, but if I can help...

350
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,325
But I don't want you to feel...

351
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,326
like you have to do anything
more than you want to do.

352
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,862
I know, but I mean...
Actually, you know...

353
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,332
I just don't know how I fit in.

354
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,872
Well, I understand, I totally
understand. I'll keep you posted.

355
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,440
- Okay.
- Bye. Bye.

356
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,446
Unrestrained passenger,
prolonged extrication...

357
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,173
blunt trauma to chest. - Abby.

358
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,012
Hypotensive, hypoxic
with respiratory distress.

359
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,016
- Okay, Trauma 2.
- Updated vitals.

360
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,714
BP 90 palp, pulse
120, 89 percent sats.

361
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,018
Is she from the expressway
crash? Mary Marchak?

362
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,320
She needs an airway.

363
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,898
Seven and a half ET tube
with a scope and a curved blade.

364
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,364
Paradoxical chest
movement on the left.

365
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,028
Pulse is thready.

366
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,501
Flail chest, 20 of
etomidate, 120 sux.

367
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,333
Pupils equal and reactive.

368
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,667
<i>Are you okay?</i>

369
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,907
O-2 sat 86 percent.

370
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,539
CBC, trauma panel, Foley,
chest, pelvis and C-spine films.

371
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,048
- How long you had that?
- Didn't know you cared.

372
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,379
I don't. Find me later
and I'll check it out.

373
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,714
Have fun, kids.

374
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,738
The Medivan's right outside.
- Oh, great.

375
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,761
- Because he's really anxious to get home.
- He's a fighter.

376
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,661
Well, doctors gave him three
weeks. It's been three months.

377
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,894
He's also quite a character.
- Yeah.

378
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,561
I wanna make sure he's
set up before I get my things.

379
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,264
- I'll pack it up.
- Thank you.

380
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,909
Thank you, Miss Taggart.
It's been a pleasure.

381
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,745
Till we meet again.

382
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,687
- Cordis introducer.
- Spleen looks good.

383
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:18,120
- Damn it, where's our blood?
- Ten more minutes for cross-match.

384
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,759
Fluid by the liver,
hemopneumothorax on the left.

385
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,225
- You need me?
- Not big enough to cause tamponade.

386
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,888
- Crit 32 percent. NEELA:
Sterile 6s to me and Mae Lee.

387
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,305
- Yes, Sam, I did. NEELA:
Second chest tube and 10 blade.

388
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,062
- Give the first one a chance to work.
- There isn't time.

389
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,638
- Well, we don't have room.
- Hey, hey, hey, wait.

390
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,468
There are too many people
in here and a full ER out there.

391
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,235
- Abby, go clear the board.
- Morris.

392
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,471
Pratt's shift is over,
Kovac is at a meeting.

393
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,478
Someone needs to push charts.
- Fine.

394
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,641
Sam, find me a cell
saver now, please?

395
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,650
Please, what's going on? I
can't see anything. How's Mary?

396
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,792
- Doctors are doing everything they can.
- Is she gonna be okay?

397
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,587
- Found one.
- She has to be okay.

398
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,993
Please, please,
she's my whole life.

399
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,332
Mary, honey, I'm right here.
- Found it.

400
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,780
It's gonna be okay. Hold
on. MORRIS: Ray, set it up.

401
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,000
If this doesn't work,
think about a thoracotomy.

402
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,438
- For blunt trauma?
- Survival's one in 400.

403
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,476
That's because we don't
usually do it until after they arrest.

404
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,978
Make the incision in
the anterior auxiliary line.

405
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,677
- BP 65.
- Could have a cardiac laceration.

406
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,318
No, the scan showed
minimal fluid in the pericardium.

407
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,614
Hold the clamp so it
doesn't go in too far.

408
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,314
Can find it with my finger,
but I can't get the tube in.

409
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,255
Extend the incision.

410
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,985
Here, like this.
Let me show you.

411
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,494
- Scalpel. MARQUEZ:
Heart rate's dropping.

412
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,793
Hang another O-neg and
call the blood bank again.

413
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,493
- Sats, 82.
- Come on, Neela.

414
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,832
She's getting hard to bag.
- Whoa.

415
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,645
Get the Thora-Seal.
She's gonna bleed out.

416
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,868
She's getting blood. Do
the thoracotomy in the O.R.

417
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,979
- She's bradying down.
- She'll die before she gets there.

418
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,809
- This is the only time we have.
- You made your case.

419
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,006
Thoracotomy tray.

420
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,717
- Hey.
- Hey, how was your meeting?

421
00:20:55,888 --> 00:21:00,883
- Oh. Long, boring, unnecessary.
- Sounds fun.

422
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:08,498
- How would you feel about eloping?
- Eloping? What brought that on?

423
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,602
Morris knows we're
getting married.

424
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,103
- You know, I bet Hope told him.
- What? Hope knows?

425
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,763
Mm-hm.

426
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,411
She's got this
bizarre wedding ESP.

427
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,513
Morris suggested we should get
married in Vegas with Celine Dion.

428
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,276
Ha, ha. Well, we need to shut
them down before they tell everybody.

429
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,010
How do we do that?

430
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,984
Beat them with a bag of oranges?

431
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,590
Because I hear it
doesn't leave any marks.

432
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,191
Or we could just talk to them.

433
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,827
- That's much better.
- Okay.

434
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,930
- Bye.
- Bye.

435
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,525
- Hey, Lockhart.
- Hey.

436
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,931
- Ready to play doctor?
- Yeah. Um...

437
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,833
Come on in here.

438
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,034
- Unzip your flight suit.
- Usually, I get dinner first...

439
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,806
Quiet or I'll give you a
rectal just for the hell of it.

440
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,380
Nice bedside manner.

441
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,950
- Did you get a flu shot?
- Yeah.

442
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,556
Good breath sounds, a
few crackles at the base.

443
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,291
Any change in
exercise tolerance?

444
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,164
I get short of breath about
halfway through a lap dance.

445
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,306
Thanks for the visual.

446
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,067
You know, I'm not much
for complaining, but...

447
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,301
But what?

448
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,707
Back in '01 after
the towers fell...

449
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,678
we jumped in my truck, drove
straight through to New York.

450
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,818
We worked the pile
for a couple of weeks.

451
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,385
Not that we found anyone alive.

452
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,688
You think that's
what caused this?

453
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:42,853
Well, we kept working, breathing
in pulverized concrete, glass...

454
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,021
dust particles laced with
benzene, dioxin, asbestos, lead.

455
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,664
Wearing any protective gear?

456
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,100
According to the government
and the EPA, we didn't need any.

457
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,330
Always reliable.

458
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,707
They got a name for
it, Trade Center Cough.

459
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,778
Some of the guys got it, they're
sick. Asthma, lymphoma, leukemia.

460
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,441
One of them died in January.

461
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,174
Sorry.

462
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,753
Pulse ox is okay,
but it could be better.

463
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,947
If I have something...

464
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,058
or if I'm gonna get
something, I wanna know.

465
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,391
I'll order a chest
x-ray and some labs.

466
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:21,695
This is just between us.
Even my wife doesn't know.

467
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,736
I don't wanna be grounded while they dick
around trying to prove a scientific link.

468
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:26,964
Okay.

469
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,404
I'm on till 8. Probably
have the results by then.

470
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,134
Lockhart.

471
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,371
I owe you.

472
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,813
- Okay, here's some light.
- I see the pericardium.

473
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:41,249
- Mayo scissors.
- Give 2 units FFP.

474
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,619
Two-0 silk with a
pledget. I feel a defect.

475
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,317
- Surgery, what's the story?
- Blunt trauma, flail chest.

476
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,429
Hypotensive despite fluid
resuscitation and transfusion.

477
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,623
We hooked up the cell
saver to recycle blood...

478
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,461
while I put in the
second chest tube.

479
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,830
- There's fluid in the...
- Pericardium.

480
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:01,337
I thought there was a ventricular
laceration from a fractured rib...

481
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,566
so we decided to
do a thoracotomy.

482
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:07,179
There was a defect in the ventricle
and now Neela's holding pressure on it.

483
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,838
- Excellent, Mae Lee.
- Wait a minute, that is not exact...

484
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,809
There's surgical
consults in the ER.

485
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,081
Go see to them. I'll do
the repair with Mae Lee.

486
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:17,690
- Yeah, well, I've already got...
- I've got it, Neela. I've got it.

487
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,182
Okay. Visualize the injury...

488
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,522
Self-portrait.

489
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,457
Ovarian cancer.
First time around.

490
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,536
First?

491
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,229
But they say the
third time's a charm.

492
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,834
- I'm sorry.
- And I'm pissed off and annoyed.

493
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,139
Are you in treatment now?

494
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,608
Two more sessions.

495
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,812
At least this time, I
didn't lose my hair.

496
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,046
Yeah, you look great.

497
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,686
I feel fine.

498
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,555
I felt fine when they
first diagnosed me.

499
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,393
Who knew a few days'
bloating was stage four?

500
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:36,231
Yeah, unfortunately, there's
no real reliable screening tool.

501
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,768
Yet.

502
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,100
Just need money and research.

503
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,538
We're still the poor stepchild of
the breast-cancer publicity machine.

504
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,143
All those pink ribbons.

505
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,443
Do you know what color is
associated with ovarian cancer?

506
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,207
Teal.

507
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,785
I mean, what is that?
It's not blue, it's not green.

508
00:25:56,288 --> 00:26:00,749
And I'm guessing that your illness
has something to do with your project.

509
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,960
Yeah, my cancer
was my wake-up call.

510
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:08,134
It made me more
passionate about living...

511
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,599
about doing the things
that make me happy.

512
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,906
Not worrying about
the stupid stuff.

513
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,712
Happy birthday.

514
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,881
What? No.

515
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,213
- What? No, no, I can't take that.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, you can.

516
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,412
Companies give me
free stuff all the time.

517
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,558
Really?

518
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:47,830
- Thank you.
- Use it. It's fun.

519
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,100
- Yeah.
- Point and shoot.

520
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,274
Just remember to
move your finger.

521
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,520
- Odd place for a bee sting.
- I know. I have no idea...

522
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,520
All right, best
not to talk, okay?

523
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,352
Half cc of one
percent lido and epi.

524
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,961
That should make her
tongue nice and numb. All right.

525
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,530
And got it.

526
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,791
Suck on Popsicles till
the swelling goes down.

527
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,493
Next time you go jogging,
keep your mouth closed.

528
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,319
Get all that?

529
00:27:18,343 --> 00:27:20,366
I'll write it up and
add it to your charts.

530
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,371
- How's that going, by the way?
- All done.

531
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:28,003
Except, well, I didn't wanna mention
it, but I found several spelling errors.

532
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,150
Oh. That was just a test to make
sure you were paying attention.

533
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,683
- And you did very well. Bravo, Larry.
- Thanks.

534
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,218
Gates.

535
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:39,119
- I'm not your personal answering service.
- Sorry. Gates.

536
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:43,989
Uh, no, there's no Seymour Butts
here. Hello, Sarah, where are you?

537
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,065
Hey... Oh.

538
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:51,727
- Grandma and Grandpa drop you off?
- Yeah, they say hi.

539
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:55,568
- Look what I got.
- Wow, fancy. Who's gonna pay for it?

540
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,504
Grandma and Grandpa
are paying for it.

541
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,373
They say they'll be able to
keep in touch with me better...

542
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:04,074
and it's gonna be good for emergencies,
because I'll have it and then...

543
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,014
All right, I'm sold, but we're
gonna set up some rules.

544
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,814
Of course we are.

545
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,257
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah, Grandpa let me ride Beauty.

546
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,259
She's the one that's jet black with a
white spot in the middle of her forehead.

547
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,023
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah.

548
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,258
And they told me all
these stories about Mom.

549
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,268
Like when she was my age, she took
Grandpa's car for a ride without asking.

550
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,929
Yeah, well, don't get any ideas.

551
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:32,239
So you think maybe you'd like to
spend a little more time with them?

552
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,243
Sure.

553
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:35,938
Maybe, um...

554
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,541
I don't know, you think you
might wanna live with them?

555
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,952
Well, I don't know. I
mean, my school's here.

556
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:48,389
So I can't really do that.
And all my friends are here.

557
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,584
You're here too.

558
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,323
I mean, why would
I wanna do that?

559
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:59,229
Just asking. Come on, let's
get my stuff, get out of here.

560
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,271
- V-fib.
- Charge the internal paddles.

561
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,106
Tie the suture while
they prepare to defibrillate.

562
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,351
Tie the knot.

563
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,984
- Mae Lee, tie the knot.
- Charged.

564
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,990
Twenty joules.

565
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,895
Clear. Clear!

566
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,058
Uh, still no response.

567
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,899
Mae Lee, tie the knot.

568
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,571
- Out of my way.
- Got it.

569
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,642
Hypocalcemic from
massive transfusion.

570
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,142
She's also hypoxic from
the pulmonary bleed. Clear.

571
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,974
Yeah, got it.

572
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,110
Still no pulse.

573
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,012
She's in pump failure
from cardiac contusion.

574
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,816
Resume internal compressions.

575
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,348
V-fib again.

576
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,188
I don't think we're gonna
get her out of it this time.

577
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:59,024
No, she's coagulopathic,
I can't stop the bleeding.

578
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,928
Thirty joules. Okay, clear.

579
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,208
Stop, stop, stop it. There's
nothing more we can do.

580
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,208
Stop it. It's over. It's over.

581
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,546
Call it, Ray.

582
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:21,478
Okay, time of death, 13:25.

583
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:29,252
Repair of a cardiac laceration is way
beyond a fourth-year medical student.

584
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,420
I did the repair. Mae
Lee put in one stitch.

585
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,293
I was there. I was in a much
better position to assist you.

586
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,163
Learn to share the sandbox.
Mae Lee's here for four weeks.

587
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,600
You've got four years.
You'll get another chance.

588
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,297
This isn't the procedure. Do
you have a problem with me?

589
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,739
Do I have a problem with you?

590
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,244
Look, you're a very talented
surgeon, Neela, but, yeah.

591
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,013
Maybe I've let our
personal friendship...

592
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,276
get in the way of our
professional relationship.

593
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,579
Well, how? What do you mean?

594
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:58,446
I'm the chief and
you're an intern. That's it.

595
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,923
- M... Maybe I've sent off mixed signals...
- No, it seems very clear.

596
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,962
You're angry with me. I don't
understand. Is this about Manish?

597
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,690
I am not angry with you
and this is not about Manish.

598
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,301
It's just... I just think it's time
we reset our dynamic, that's all.

599
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,804
You gonna reset that dead woman
there? Reset her grieving husband?

600
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,034
No, you can't take it personally
when a surgery doesn't go well...

601
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,805
just as I can't make
surgical decisions based...

602
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,778
- Based on what?
- On my personal feelings towards you.

603
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,947
Look, um, we both know
that poor woman didn't die...

604
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,651
because Mae Lee was
in there and you weren't.

605
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:39,958
Her injuries were far too great.
Nothing on this earth could've saved her.

606
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,141
Give it to me straight.

607
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,335
Your blood work was normal.
Your chest x-rays were clear.

608
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,141
But there is some
evidence of sinusitis.

609
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,874
So here are your films
and your test results.

610
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,418
Plus a prescription for azithromycin
and Pulmicort, that's an inhaler.

611
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,249
It should help.

612
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:08,351
- So I'm okay for now.
- Looks like it.

613
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,754
This is a good thing.

614
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,093
There are lots of people who worked
at ground zero and at the landfills.

615
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,170
I mean, how many of them
are walking time bombs?

616
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,499
No good deed goes
unpunished, I guess.

617
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:25,400
- Maybe next time we'll be smarter.
- Maybe now you'll tell your wife.

618
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,877
What? And give her more
ammo to nag me about? Heh, heh.

619
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,844
- Night, Lockhart.
- Good night.

620
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:40,181
Someone from Social Work will be
down to help you with arrangements.

621
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,793
Is there anyone we can call?

622
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,926
No.

623
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,224
It was just the two of us.

624
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,858
We liked it like that.

625
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,462
We never ran out
of things to say.

626
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,369
Even on long stretches of
road that seem to go on for days.

627
00:32:56,541 --> 00:33:00,376
Must be nice to spend that amount
of time with the person you love.

628
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,538
Actually, she was the
brains behind everything.

629
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:09,713
Did all the paperwork, paid
the bills, read the road maps.

630
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,558
I can't tell you how many times
she kept us from getting lost.

631
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,527
Today was gonna be different.

632
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,725
- Different?
- Yeah.

633
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,633
The rain makes her sleepy.

634
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,564
So I told her to take a nap.

635
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,238
I was sure I knew
what exit to take.

636
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:39,142
But the sign wasn't the sign.

637
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,684
I got confused.

638
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,280
I didn't wanna wake her up.

639
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,252
I wanted to do it myself.

640
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,321
Do what?

641
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,154
Read.

642
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:56,095
I wanted to read
the damn exit sign.

643
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,970
Derek...

644
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:00,934
You don't know how to read?

645
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,944
Mary was trying to teach me.

646
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,175
You graduated high
school and went to college?

647
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,952
They just passed me along.

648
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:22,322
Nobody cared long as I could read the
defense and get the ball in the end zone.

649
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,388
Coaches said I was gonna
get drafted first round.

650
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:33,136
I wasn't prepared
for it not to work out.

651
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,104
I'm sorry.

652
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,853
I just wanted to make you proud.

653
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,691
I'm sorry.

654
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,870
- Get.
- Heh, heh.

655
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:16,940
Sarah?

656
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,748
I'll do the dishes after I
do my homework, okay?

657
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:23,218
No, this isn't about the dishes.
Could you come back in here a sec?

658
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,017
I need to talk to
you for a second.

659
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,920
I've been trying to figure
out a way to tell you this...

660
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:34,362
and if I should tell you this.

661
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,196
What?

662
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,702
The night that your mom died...

663
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,174
she told me...

664
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,044
that I'm your father.

665
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,113
My dad's name
was Keith. He died.

666
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:57,915
I know, I know. We all
thought that your dad was Keith.

667
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:02,720
But, um, there's a chance
that that might not be true.

668
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,667
But Mom didn't tell me.
Why wouldn't she tell me?

669
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,565
I don't know, sweetie. She
must have had her reasons.

670
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,639
So are you my dad or not?

671
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,405
Well, there's a simple
test we can take.

672
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,275
It's called a paternity test...

673
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:27,150
and if you want, we
can take it tonight.

674
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,513
Why are you doing this now?

675
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,658
Is this because I don't wanna go
live with Grandma and Grandpa?

676
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,795
- Sarah, I just want...
- You're just trying to get rid of me.

677
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,453
- I want what's best for you.
- No, you're lying.

678
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,362
I know you're lying.
You're lying just like Mom.

679
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,435
She always lied.

680
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,128
- Sarah...
- No, okay?

681
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:51,265
I don't want you to be my
dad and I'm not taking your test.

682
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,739
You know, Morris
might have something.

683
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,150
Maybe we should get
married someplace exotic.

684
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,785
Like where?

685
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:05,856
The beach or the mountains. Why
don't...? We could go to Croatia.

686
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,458
Really?

687
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,617
No one from work
would be able to be there.

688
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,194
Do it. One, two, three, go.

689
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,794
Stop.

690
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,265
Would that be so bad?

691
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,338
Morris, Hope.

692
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:27,843
We need to talk to you.

693
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,981
Who? Us? KOVAC: Look, listen.

694
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:34,313
Abby and I really appreciate
your interest in our engagement...

695
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,216
- It's so exciting, a wedding.
- Hope.

696
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:37,914
Sorry.

697
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,821
And while your planning
is very thoughtful...

698
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,985
it's borderline obsessive.

699
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:49,031
- Oh, we just wanna help.
- Well, next time, just don't help.

700
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:53,531
And don't blab to anybody.
Not us, just no one.

701
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,539
Okay. I mean, if
that's what you want.

702
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,074
- We do.
- We do.

703
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,109
Hey, everybody. Look who's here.

704
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,371
Sam!

705
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,443
Guys.

706
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:08,709
- Look at everybody.
- Let's have a toast, Sam.

707
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:13,621
To Sam, happy
birthday and many more.

708
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,123
Hear, hear.

709
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,535
B-10. You didn't actually mean
to put in "Get Down Tonight."

710
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,136
I like KC and the Sunshine Band.

711
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,533
It's better than the
choice that you made.

712
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,199
Oh, hey, "Woman" by Wolfmother?
That is destined to be a classic.

713
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,606
On what planet?

714
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,405
Now...

715
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:39,946
I know we're
pretending to be normal.

716
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:43,088
And I know we're pretending
that this isn't awkward.

717
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:48,887
- But it's kind of awkward, isn't it?
- Yeah, kind of.

718
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,462
So, what, are we just gonna
say that this never happened?

719
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,794
I know we should
talk about this...

720
00:38:55,967 --> 00:39:00,268
but, uh, these days, I just feel
like my head's gonna explode.

721
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,805
There's just a lot
of stuff going on.

722
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,499
Gates.

723
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,907
I'm trying to figure it out.

724
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,879
I, uh, wanna figure
it out. It's just...

725
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,610
I just need some time.

726
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:19,080
I've been there once before. It
didn't turn out so good for me.

727
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,820
Well, you won't have
to wait long. Okay?

728
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,855
Okay.

729
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,200
- Oh, yes, B-10.
- Somebody make it stop.

730
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,302
- Sam, come and dance with us.
- Please?

731
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,096
All right.

732
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,667
Oh, wait a second,
you guys. Be right back.

733
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,944
Hello? Hey, wait, I can
barely hear you. Hold on.

734
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,776
No, no, no, don't hang
up. Wait a sec, wait a sec.

735
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,716
Alex? Hey, I'm
so glad you called.

736
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,684
I was worried.

737
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,346
Yeah?

738
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,856
Yeah, it is my birthday.

739
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,995
Thank you.

740
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,993
You okay?

741
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:17,146
If the test says you're my
dad, can I stay with you?

742
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,006
Absolutely.

743
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,520
Okay.

744
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,053
You sure?

745
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,886
Is it gonna hurt?

746
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,187
No, we just...

747
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:38,667
We'll take a little
swab of one cheek...

748
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,002
and then send it to the lab...

749
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:46,611
and then they send us
the results in the mail.

750
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,407
That's it?

751
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,215
Mm-hm.

752
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,676
And until then?

753
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,212
Nothing changes.

754
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,923
Of course I'm coming
up this weekend.

755
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:11,198
Yeah.

756
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:15,036
Uh. Well, maybe
what if I brought you...?

757
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,970
Oh, you gotta go?

758
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,372
Okay, time's up. I got it.

759
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,941
I miss you too.

760
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,880
Yeah, thanks for
calling me, okay?

761
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,919
I love you too, baby.

762
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,287
Okay.

763
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,217
Bye.

764
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:46,402
<i>I don't mind If you don't mind</i>

765

<i>Before you jump

767
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,645
So you already got a law degree and
now you're going to medical school?

768
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,911
Yeah, corporate
law wasn't for me.

769
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,614
I wasn't helping anyone. Besides,
I need to be where the action is.

770
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,022
What? What is this?

771
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,594
Come on, you jokers. Get out
on the dance floor, come on.

772
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,460
- No, sorry, no chance.
- Come on, Frank, you know you wanna.

773
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,124
- Larry.
- All right.

00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,602

when I see all these
young people together...

778
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,116
makes me fear for
the future of mankind.

779
