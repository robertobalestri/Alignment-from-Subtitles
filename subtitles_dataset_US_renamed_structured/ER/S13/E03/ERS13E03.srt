1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,939
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,838
Because I'm no
longer chief of staff.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,174
- I need my job back.
- Kovac is gonna offer you the job.

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,942
- We're colleagues, we're contemporaries.
- Hey, no touch.

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,744
I keep thinking
they'll arrest me.

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,944
Oh, stop worrying about it.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,919
- Just focus on Alex.
- He knows his dad is gone.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,286
No, no, no, Gates.
You cannot put in an EJ.

9
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,950
ER said okay on EJ.

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,096
- I told you not to do that.
- You're dead.

11
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,959
Take it easy. All
right, okay, okay.

12
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,794
But you're in my ER now,
so put on the damn coat.

13
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,935
Your new intern?

14
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,773
Resident in-service
exam is Friday.

15
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,433
Practice questions and
instructions are in the packet.

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,205
Shouldn't we learn something
before you start testing us?

17
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,383
It's to get a baseline. We'll
re-test you at the end of the year.

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,542
Um, is there a makeup
date? Friday's my day off.

19
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,482
I volunteer at Big
Sister/Little Sister.

20
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:56,783
Yeah, well, I'm post-call, which
means I volunteer to sleep all day.

21
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,791
Well, too bad.
Conference room, 8 a.m.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,538
- Come on, guys.
- Who else is on?

23
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,861
Weaver is on at 12. Until
then, you're in charge.

24
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,863
- What about Morris?
- He just called.

25
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,127
He's running late, he
said start without him.

26
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,737
For his first shift as an
Attending? Did he say why?

27
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,806
I couldn't understand him. It
was windy and the music was loud.

28
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,966
- Ma'am.
- Windy?

29
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,779
<i>Believe or not,
I'm walking on air</i>

30
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:25,249
<i>I never thought I
could feel so free</i>

31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,981
<i>Flying away on a
wing and a prayer</i>

32
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,988
Rat-bite kid is in Bed C.

33
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,559
Waiting on a shot of
penicillin and a piece of pizza.

34
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,992
- Oh, the surgeon is in.
- I think I left my badge here.

35
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,995
- Are you nervous?
- No, I'm okay.

36
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,999
- Happy rounding.
- First day, don't let them haze you.

37
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,763
The sidewalk was crooked.
I wanna talk to Johnnie.

38
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,065
You're gonna have
to call them back later.

39
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,367
Look, J.Lo, I got 10
minutes left on my card...

40
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,034
and I ain't signing until
I talk to my attorney.

41
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,077
Don't tell me Johnnie
Cochran's dead.

42
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,806
- Give me a break.
- Let me help.

43
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,215
- It's not heavy.
- They found some bad wiring.

44
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,046
The whole place
is like a tinderbox.

45
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,414
Really? Got a light?

46
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,455
James Anderson, shortness
of breath, history of heart failure.

47
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,286
Gave nitro spray
and 40 of Lasix.

48
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,519
The guy's a chronic CHF'er. Forty
won't do the trick, he needs 80.

49
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,927
Protocol says 40. Not that I'd
expect you to know or give a damn.

50
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,467
Picked him up in the hall of his
apartment. Place had some wild stuff.

51
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,867
- Feather boas, stiletto heels.
- One, two, three.

52
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,598
Sounds like your locker.
What meds is he on?

53
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,209
It's on the paramedic
sheet, which is also part of...

54
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,437
Protocol, right.
I smell a theme.

55
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,205
- Eighty of Lasix.
- Unh.

56
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,317
- Sats suck. GATES:
Must have a bad lead.

57
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,816
He does. Look at this,
it's on his chest hair.

58
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,751
Is that part of the...? What
do you call it, protocol?

59
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,388
Isordil, Bumex, glyburide.

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,757
Benzoin for the chest lead.
- Here you go.

61
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,392
All right.

62
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,228
Protonix, Diovan and carvedilol.

63
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,426
Let me help you.

64
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,970
- All right, sats are up.
- Lasix in.

65
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,573
Hey, can you look at me?

66
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,942
- It's good.
- Saved your ass again, Zades.

67
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,613
Hey, where's that famous
sense of humor of yours?

68
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,412
You know, it was
bad enough before.

69
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,349
Now I gotta roll in,
have you play me...

70
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,284
because somebody
gave you a white coat?

71
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:13,120
- What are you so pissed off about?
- I'm on probation for a month.

72
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,695
Limited shifts, no extra runs,
and one wrong move, I'm finished.

73
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,264
What? Those two drunk guys
outside of Ike's press charges?

74
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,767
No, the bar manager filed a complaint,
so chief's gotta make sure I feel it.

75
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,429
- I didn't hear anything about it.
- Well, of course not, you're Mr. Teflon.

76
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,768
- Only now it's Dr. Teflon.
- It's no big deal.

77
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,434
- What's probation, a month...?
- It's my job, man.

78
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,635
My job.

79
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,383
You know, the one good
thing about you working here:

80
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,789
You may just have to listen to
somebody besides yourself once in a while.

81
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,118
And I can't wait to
see those sparks fly.

82
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,356
I'll catch you later, killer.

83
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,531
Well, he didn't mean
"killer" killer. He meant...

84
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,300
You know... All right,
back to work, everyone.

85
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,307
Barack. Barack Obama.

86
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,469
Don't waste my time, put him on.

87
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,749
Benny, your
neighbor's on the phone.

88
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,852
Something about Jim.

89
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,384
Excuse me.

90
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,627
Triage desk.

91
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,933
Uh, no, I'm here for
someone, James Anderson.

92
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,042
They brought him in
an hour ago, I think.

93
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,802
Triage desk.

94
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,639
Thank you.

95
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,381
- Hello, I...
- Fill out this form, sir.

96
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,784
I'm here to see a patient.

97
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,424
Oh, okay.

98
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,786
Then try this one.

99
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,664
Easy, now. We got
enough patients already.

100
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,099
Charity, I got one for you.

101
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm Hope, my name is Hope.

102
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,573
Right, 8-year-old
girl fell off her bike.

103
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,040
Oh, poor little angel.

104
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,468
Hey, think fast.

105
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,477
- Whoa. What's this?
- It's your lucky day.

106
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,276
Residents get to wear
the new transport beeper.

107
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,750
If this thing goes off, I can sign
out my patients and go, right?

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,947
Well, if your Attending, i.e. me,
agrees that the patient is critical...

109
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,355
and needs a physician transport,
then, yes, Ray, you may go.

110
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,859
Sweet, I'm gonna go
check the transpo locker.

111
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,862
- Is Dr. Kovac around?
- Hey, how you doing?

112
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,694
I think Dr. K ran upstairs...

113
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,269
but I'm pretty sure I can help
you with anything you need.

114
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,136
You represent this hospital...

115
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,797
and that's how you approach
people asking for help?

116
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,176
Angela? I was
waiting for you upstairs.

117
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,006
I'm sorry, my train was late.

118
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,616
But I had the lovely
opportunity to meet "Dr. Pratt."

119
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,978
Impressive.

120
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,483
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

121
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,121
<i>What?</i>

122
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,518
Haleh, what the
hell just happened?

123
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,819
I think you got served.

124
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,690
- Greg Pratt, Timmy Rawlins.
- Hey.

125
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,956
He's gonna be filling in for Jerry.
- Really?

126
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,191
In fact, he was Jerry
before Jerry was Jerry.

127
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,562
Wow.

128
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,067
Yeah, back in the mid-'90s.

129
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,000
Got stuck in a rut.
I had to get out.

130
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,367
- Out of the hospital?
- No, out of Chicago.

131
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,908
I lived in the Kalahari for a while,
selling biltong outside of Kakamas.

132
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,707
Then I spent a couple years
mining uranium in the Siberian tundra.

133
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:59,410
Ran into a misunderstanding in Thailand,
that landed me in the Bangkwang prison.

134
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,418
But most of the '90s is still a blur.
- Wow, sounds rugged.

135
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,182
Hell, I'd take Bangkwang
over ER this time of year.

136
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,817
As you know, them new interns will
mess you up worse than Chinese hash.

137
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,361
Ain't that the truth?

138
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,702
It's about the Curtis Ames case.

139
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,236
Risk Management wants
to meet tomorrow at 9 a.m.

140
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,862
Curtis Ames?

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,737
Left-sided paralysis
following an embolic stroke.

142
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,071
You placed a central
line for pneumonia...

143
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,339
and he boarded down
here for three days.

144
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,045
February of '04?

145
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,413
Oh, oh, oh. But I thought
the case had no merit.

146
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,383
Ha. Guy wants his day in court.

147
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,847
But the lawyer said...

148
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,262
It's been a year since my deposition.
- Excuse me.

149
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,291
- Angela from Staff Affairs?
- Ms. Gilliam.

150
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,862
Ms. Gilliam, Dr. Tremons on the
phone, he says his privileges have been...

151
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,795
Tell him the Anesthesia chair
has to keep his ACLS current...

152
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,869
just like every other
physician in this hospital.

153
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,767
Okay. I got you, baby.

154
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:57,867
Look, malpractice suits are a
waste of time and resources...

155
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,481
but it happens to almost
every doctor at some point.

156
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,209
It doesn't reflect on your
abilities as a physician.

157
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,818
See you tomorrow.

158
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,955
Ultrasound confirmed cholecystitis. Hang
a bag of ertapenem, send her to surgery.

159
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,562
I'll give the nursing report.

160
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,427
Scaphoid fracture,
thumb spica in Bed A.

161
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,262
- Discharge with clinic referral.
- No problem.

162
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,099
This one over here?
Curling iron, upper inner thigh.

163
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,332
Dressing and tetanus, and,
uh, send her on her way.

164
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,841
- How do you even know that?
- Don't ask, don't tell.

165
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,003
Pratt, sign Gates
up for some more.

166
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,444
- The man knows how to clear a bed.
- Really?

167
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,313
Why do I have patients with blank charts
and I haven't heard about your CHF guy?

168
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,923
- He's stable. We're waiting on labs.
- His sats are 91. He's hypoxic.

169
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,649
- That was before oxygen and Lasix.
- What's the EKG show?

170
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,020
Nothing to worry about.

171
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,958
This gentleman's here
for James Anderson.

172
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,129
- You family?
- We're business partners.

173
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,029
My name's Cray. Bennett Cray.

174
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,612
All right. Dr. Gates
can take you in.

175
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,332
- But keep me apprised.
- All right.

176
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,303
We're waiting on
some test results...

177
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,033
but, uh, we could use
information on his medical status.

178
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,736
Yes, I can help with
that. I brought in his meds.

179
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,642
Your, uh, mascara's running.

180
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:13,378
Oh. It was a long night.

181
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,683
You round twice a day,
5:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.

182
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,325
In between, you'll cover
floor patients and consults.

183
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,324
And hopefully scrub
in on a few cases?

184
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,962
Sure.

185
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,156
Neela, this is Jill Connelly and
Ken Maser, your fellow interns.

186
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,494
And this is Dr. Crenshaw.

187
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,845
Sweet urine of a
hairless eunuch.

188
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,202
- Dustin?
- No, I don't think so.

189
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,499
What I asked for was
a freaking ginger ale.

190
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,698
Dustin? Dustin?

191
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,174
Dr. Crenshaw is our
new Chief Resident.

192
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,505
Neela Rasgotra.

193
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,514
Put in two years in the ER, then
defected to become a real doctor.

194
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,847
Wow, it took you that long to figure
out you were wasting your time?

195
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,989
- Oh, I don't think of it that way.
- Really?

196
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,851
And why is that?

197
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,183
I developed clinical
and procedural skills.

198
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:02,330
I became proficient at ultrasounds,
central lines, chest tubes, cutdowns.

199
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,494
Wow, you know what worries me?

200
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,873
Maybe all of this is gonna
seem too easy. You think?

201
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,034
Think there's a
chance you might be...

202
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,771
Oh, I don't know.
What's the word, um...

203
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,246
bored by what we do up here?

204
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,343
- I don't think so.
- Good.

205
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,050
Good. Then I think I'll
leave you all to it. Bye.

206
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,056
Someone want to explain to
our international prodigy here...

207
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,421
how we do wound rounds?

208
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,098
Mr. Cray.

209
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,568
Doctor.

210
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,969
His oxygen level is up.
He should be waking soon.

211
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,973
Is there any family
he'd like here?

212
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,135
Uh, just me. That's all.

213
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,314
Just the two of us.

214
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,473
We each come from a long
line of homophobes and bigots.

215
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,914
The closet reflex dies hard.

216
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,956
- How long have you two been together?
- It's been over 15 years now.

217
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,826
We found each other late.

218
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,226
He thought no one'd ever love
him, and I'd already resigned myself...

219
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,764
to being a lonely
old drag queen.

220
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:10,961
In the right light, he looks like
Barbara Stanwyck in <i>The Lady Eve.</i>

221
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,503
Ha. To you, maybe.

222
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,573
Now I look more
like Mrs. Doubtfire.

223
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:19,444
I'll let you two talk, and, uh, I'll be
back as soon as I know anything, okay?

224
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,107
Hey, Luka, can you sign a wrist
x-ray order for the Obama lady?

225
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,844
Sure.

226
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,488
I hear the baby's doing well.

227
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,822
- He's starting to hold his head up.
- Oh, that's great.

228
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,860
We never got to talk about
everything that happened.

229
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,327
It's not your fault, Sam.

230
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,756
If it wasn't for me...

231
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,798
If it wasn't for
you, I'd be dead.

232
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:42,792
How is everything?

233
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,670
It's good. You
know, pretty good.

234
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,637
I, uh...

235
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:52,174
Alex is seeing this shrink
lady, but he's not really into it.

236
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,315
- He likes to keep everything bottled up.
- I meant with you.

237
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,280
I'm fine. Really.

238
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,148
You want me to
try talking to Alex?

239
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,486
No, you've got enough
on your plate, uh...

240
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,354
- but thank you.
- Sam, hey.

241
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,054
Just don't beat yourself up.

242
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,166
You did what you had
to do. It was self-defense.

243
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,061
<i>Born in a poor village
in central Guatemala...</i>

244
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,503
Soledad Guttierrez is an immigrant
who works cleaning houses.

245
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,040
She's had a hard time
adjusting to life in the U.S.

246
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,734
Wow, you really bonded with her.

247
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,175
Felicity, hurry up and
get to the point, will you?

248
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,579
Soledad is worried every day and
prays all the time for her husband...

249
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,845
and 4-year-old son back
in their hometown of...

250
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,648
"Chichicastenango."

251
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:41,193
Oh, sure, I got down to Chichi for
<i>el Día de los Muertos</i> back in '96.

252
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,592
She's thorough,
there's no denying that.

253
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,528
But she's getting older and might not...
- Look, look, look.

254
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,828
I don't need her
whole life story.

255
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,198
Why is she in the ER today?

256
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,942
Well, she had a great uncle
who died of a heart attack.

257
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,544
His wife and children
were left without anyone...

258
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,839
so they had to move
in with her parents...

259
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,778
All right, stop, stop, stop.

260
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,685
What brought her to the ER?

261
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,416
Her heart. It's her heart.

262
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,113
Good, so do you
think it's an MI?

263
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,384
Pericarditis? Dysrhythmia?

264
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,561
Well, she's been unable
to find a suitable church...

265
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,530
so I believe that she feels
so alone in this world...

266
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,638
that her heart is aching for
her family and her homeland.

267
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:30,472
Okay, okay, well, diagnostically,
what you just said is nothing.

268
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,135
- Need a hand here.
- Group home resident, 22 years old.

269
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,215
Release me, you
merchants of destruction!

270
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,907
- You need to stay in bed.
- Morris.

271
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,950
Good to see you.
Glad you could make it.

272
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,587
Oh, the pleasure's all mine.

273
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,447
The home thinks he might
have ingested something.

274
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,924
All right, 10 of
Haldol, 2 of Ativan I.M.

275
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,256
Oh, this is Rodney
King all over again.

276
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,922
- Hey, no pictures in here.
- You ain't fooling nobody.

277
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,728
- Harriet, get back to your bed.
- Obama gonna see this.

278
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,736
How you feeling, Mr. Anderson?

279
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,775
Oh, better.

280
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,308
Tell him he can go.

281
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,948
He's got a show tonight.

282
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,517
We're having a fundraiser for
the Chicago HIV/AIDS Coalition.

283
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,416
And I don't want you
missing it on account of me.

284
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,080
He never misses a show.

285
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,627
Fine. Listen, we
have some test results.

286
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,854
Good news is you did
not have a heart attack.

287
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,033
- Oh, thank God.
- But you're not making urine...

288
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,103
which means your kidneys aren't
working, so you'll have to go on dialysis.

289
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,133
- I don't think so.
- Jim.

290
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,003
- It's pretty urgent.
- I've been to enough doctors already.

291
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,770
Had enough tubes and
machines and treatments.

292
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,505
No, I'm not gonna do it, don't ask me.
- It's okay, Jim.

293
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,707
It's okay.

294
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,181
So, what else can we try?

295
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,717
What are his other options?

296
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,319
His options?

297
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,220
Well, dying. Very soon.

298
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,124
No, it's enough already.

299
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,425
Jim, there's no choice.

300
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,160
Dialysis can substantially
prolong your life.

301
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:07,205
I already got the bad
heart. I'm sick of being sick.

302
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,808
I'm not gonna be some
broken-down cripple.

303
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,808
You're tired, I know that.

304
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,209
- But remember what we always said?
- It's enough.

305
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,383
- Choose more life.
- Whatever's gonna happen.

306
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:21,487
- No matter what, remember? More life.
- I don't wanna do this to you.

307
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,187
You promised.

308
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,529
Okay.

309
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,524
Okay.

310
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,367
But you gotta do
something for me.

311
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,566
Call Lorraine and tell
her what's going on.

312
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,870
- Jim.
- Call her.

313
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,479
Just tell her to bring the boy.

314
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:49,741
I wanna see him.

315
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,379
It's not a good idea.

316
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,181
Don't get into it all.

317
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,879
Don't try to explain it.

318
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,549
Just tell her I wanna see them.

319
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,361
It's been too long.

320
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,396
Please, Benny.

321
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,536
You got to do it.

322
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,832
All right.

323
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,878
His sister and her son.

324
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,710
I've never met them.

325
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,887
So dialysis?

326
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,654
Yeah, let's get him
up as soon as we can.

327
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,553
I'll make the call.

328
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,752
Hmm. He was already 50
by the time he figured it out.

329
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,897
He wanted to tell his family,
but they shut him down.

330
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,696
So he just left.

331
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,998
Disappeared one day.

332
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,603
Found me.

333
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,443
No openings now, but I told
them we could start him down here.

334
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,137
His serum K level is still high.

335
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:59,013
All right, amp of bicarb, 25 grams
of D50, 10 units of regular insulin.

336
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,952
- May I use that phone?
- Sure.

337
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,220
There's one down the
hall if you want privacy.

338
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,761
Thank you.

339
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,759
Oh, excuse me.

340
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,834
Gates, Rheumatology came
down on the polymyositis patient.

341
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,266
- No H and P on the chart.
- Didn't get to it yet.

342
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,497
No, that's not good
enough. Sam, you got this?

343
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,164
You come with me. - All right.

344
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,640
Give me an ETA on the dialysis.

345
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,473
I got enough problems without
you pissing off other departments...

346
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,582
by not keeping
current on your charts.

347
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,617
- Trying to use my time well.
- Not enough. Get that up-to-date.

348
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,448
- Thank God, someone who understands.
- Rough morning, Greg?

349
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,645
I'm glad to have you.

350
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,654
Will you come check
my vertical mattress?

351
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,486
I think I everted
the edges too much.

352
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,630
- Not until he listens to my bronchiolytic.
- Did you try a neb?

353
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,492
Don't worry, I'll show you.

354
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,156
I'm with Dr. Pratt today.

355
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,258
Okay.

356
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,370
I need to present my
barbell-on-the-toe guy.

357
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,869
I can help you with that.

358
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,371
Hey, guys, this is the esteemed
Dr. Weaver in the house, okay?

359
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,171
So take advantage.
Present to her.

360
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,440
Soak up all her
decades of experience.

361
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,709
Decades? What am I, a fossil?

362
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,444
All right, go run and hide.
We'll be there in a minute.

363
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,350
You know what? I'm fine.

364
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,185
I'll push charts, help
clear some beds.

365
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,190
- I hope this isn't awkward.
- What?

366
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,524
- That you and I are equals now?
- I guess.

367
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,689
Hector Rodriguez, 38.
Found on the sidewalk.

368
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,857
Hey, there's Tony. Tony, man.

369
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,970
- Cue Ball, what are you doing here?
- Some misunderstanding.

370
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,400
- History of ETOH.
- We know.

371
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,472
- Did you vomit any blood?
- Not this time.

372
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,304
I was just sleeping and
some skank called 911.

373
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,501
Where do you want him?

374
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,647
- Did you fall?
- Oh, no, no. That's old.

375
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,477
- A junkie rolled me weeks ago.
- Yeah, occupational hazard.

376
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,552
Hope, get this dude to Exam 3.

377
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,485
- I got him. I know him.
- Look for signs of occult trauma.

378
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,386
- Yes, sir, Dr. Pratt.
- I can get him.

379
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,720
You finish that.

380
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,056
Is that the bleeding
heart of Jesus?

381
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,391
Sure is.

382
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,692
Isn't God great?

383
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,431
You ain't so bad
yourself, honey.

384
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:05,407
There were no open spots upstairs,
so we're starting him on dialysis here.

385
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,569
Is that Uncle Jimmy in there?

386
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,416
Hello, uh, Lorraine?

387
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,881
You're the man I
talked to on the phone?

388
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,246
Bennett Cray.

389
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,221
My brother, Harold,
and my son, Brian.

390
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,920
James asked you to call us?

391
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,428
He wanted to see his family.

392
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,089
Now?

393
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,962
Like this?

394
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,927
It's par for the
course, I guess.

395
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,269
He's having ectopy. Runs of six.

396
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,706
Damn it. Get Gates and Pratt
in here. His K's going up again.

397
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,812
Ejection fraction is 10 percent.

398
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,106
What does that mean?

399
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,306
It means his heart's not
pumping well enough.

400
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,145
- He have an advanced directive?
- You mean like a DNR?

401
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,116
No, I talked to the
other doctor about this.

402
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,620
Well, why are you
asking about a DNR?

403
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,952
We need to know how
far he'd want us to go.

404
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,094
- Whatever you can.
- We knew he was sick...

405
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,459
I talked to him, he said he was
having problems with his diabetes...

406
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,964
and some trouble with
his congestive something.

407
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,192
He called you?

408
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,831
Yeah, in June, when I graduated.

409
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,131
What are his chances?

410
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,637
Well, it's possible if we put him on
dialysis, avert a cardiac incident...

411
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,834
Can he take all that?

412
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,070
He's very resilient.

413
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,680
- He's been through a lot.
- He's been sick for years.

414
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,283
He's not the type to wanna
be kept alive on machines.

415
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,182
Well, your brother and I
have discussed these matters.

416
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,117
We need a few
minutes to figure this out.

417
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,190
- Sure.
- Maybe I can be of some help.

418
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,623
Jim and I are good friends. We've
been together for quite a while now.

419
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,956
Thank you, this
is a family matter.

420
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,463
We appreciate all you've done.

421
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,699
We'd like some privacy now.

422
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:43,502
Oh, yes, all right,
I'll just step outside.

423
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,837
QRS complex is widening.

424
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,844
Ready to start the run.
- Wait a minute. Hold on.

425
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,675
Sam?

426
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,218
Where's Gates, and
why is this chart blank?

427
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,014
He goes fast. He probably
fills out the paperwork later.

428
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,488
- You got this guy's meds in your notes?
- Yeah.

429
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,362
Okay.

430
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,021
Amp of calcium chloride.

431
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,190
- We doing this?
- Yeah, in a minute.

432
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,495
Let me give him calcium
to stabilize his heart.

433
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,501
Once we do, we'll
figure out what's next.

434
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,299
Okay.

435
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,698
Hey, Haleh?

436
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:20,643
Pass me a head sheet and Vicodin?
Get him started on something for the pain.

437
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,214
Sorry, we got rid of head
sheets about a year ago...

438
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,477
and we're not allowed to dispense
meds from the ER anymore.

439
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,554
What's a patient supposed to
do if they can't get to a pharmacy?

440
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:34,217
You are preaching to the choir, sister.
I liked it better when you ran the joint.

441
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,830
Charged. Clear.

442
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,827
Still V-fib. Resuming
compressions.

443
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,331
- What happened?
- Amp of epi.

444
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,530
Why isn't he dialyzed?

445
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,370
QRS widened. Gave him
calcium, and now he's crashing.

446
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,910
Is my uncle dying?

447
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,337
What's that alarm?

448
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,575
It's his meds. He gets afternoon
doses of glyburide, Lasix and didge.

449
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,510
What?

450
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:04,248
- Did you say didge?
- Digoxin, 0.25 milligrams.

451
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,358
It's right here.

452
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,586
Can everybody step back for a
minute while we work on him, please?

453
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,458
Charge to 360 again.

454
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,542
You help my brother
with his medication?

455
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,625
Sometimes, yes.

456
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,894
No one said didge.
You showed me Diovan.

457
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,265
- That's what I was told.
- By who, the paramedic?

458
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,904
What does Zadro's sheet say?

459
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,970
Digoxin.

460
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:31,049
- You didn't look at his med bottles?
- We didn't have them yet.

461
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:34,449
He has high levels of intracellular
calcium from the didge...

462
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,782
and I pushed more,
enough to stop his heart.

463
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:40,256
Why? Because you couldn't slow
down enough to read the med sheet right.

464
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,088
Can you tell me what's going on?

465
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:49,261
The drugs we gave him to treat
his QRS has irritated his heart.

466
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,660
Clear. Clear.

467
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,129
No change.

468
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,604
Uh, so, what now?

469
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,969
What else can we do?

470
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,969
Hey, what about Digibind?

471
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,511
Depends on his DNR status.

472
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,512
Have you all come to a decision?

473
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,354
We've decided it's enough now.

474
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,647
It's time to let him go.

475
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,814
- What? No.
- Our brother's an old man.

476
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,823
- He's been sick for a long time.
- No.

477
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,825
- He wants to fight.
- He's got no one.

478
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,759
He has friends.
A support system.

479
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,455
And who's gonna
take care of him?

480
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:20,827
- You?
- I always have.

481
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,024
We're his blood.

482
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,500
We don't think he'd wanna
suffer through all this.

483
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,605
You don't know that.
You don't know him.

484
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,968
- But I do.
- And that was his choice, not ours.

485
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,632
I love him.

486
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,174
I love him.

487
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:40,509
I asked you once politely to go.

488
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,848
You have no part in this.

489
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,863
We can treat your brother with
Digibind. It'll give him a fighting chance.

490
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,364
He's been in arrest for seven
minutes. His heart isn't salvageable.

491
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:58,061
I'm sorry, Mr. Cray, but if
this is what his family wants...

492
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,865
Please, wait.

493
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,500
We'll continue CPR as long as there's
hope for a meaningful recovery, but...

494
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:09,580
You can all come closer
if you'd like to be with him.

495
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,389
Call it in five minutes.

496
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,189
Excuse me.

497
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,992
I'll be right back, okay?

498
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,572
Hey, we caused this to happen.

499
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,367
No, you caused this to happen.

500
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,409
- So give me a shot at fixing it.
- You're never gonna save him.

501
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,705
The family are not the
caretakers. That man is.

502
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,542
No living will, no durable
power. Go with blood relatives.

503
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,584
We have a chance. This
is a teaching hospital.

504
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,415
- Teach me.
- Oh, you wanna learn.

505
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,581
Okay, well, here you
go. That man's gonna die.

506
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:56,092
That's what needs to happen right
now, so forget about the Digibind.

507
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,724
Lidocaine, one more round of epi,
and then you can pronounce him.

508
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,628
Understood?

509
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,050
You need a break?

510
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,618
Sure.

511
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,994
All right, a hundred
of lidocaine.

512
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,461
Get ready for some more epi.

513
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,031
And, uh...

514
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,334
- Ten vials of Digibind.
- Wait. I thought the other doctor said...

515
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,941
Your brother expressed a clear
desire for resuscitation earlier.

516
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,011
This is a fixable condition.
We're gonna give it a go.

517
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:50,809
- Did you discuss this with Pratt?
- Yes, we discussed it.

518
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,692
Am I going blind?

519
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,193
Oh, bless your heart.

520
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,958
First, check the intraocular
pressure with a Tono-Pen.

521
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,464
Um, I'm not sure
how to use that.

522
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,967
All right, I'll be right back.

523
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,970
This is interesting.

524
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,276
So how's the new intern doing?

525
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,275
She's very, uh, devoted.

526
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,638
Diligent, inquisitive, likes
to discover new things.

527
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:25,444
All attributes I like
in a newbie. Unh.

528
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,252
God, you're disgusting.

529
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,289
- Who left this here?
- Ray.

530
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:33,483
Whoa. If I get a page, I got less
than five minutes to get on the roof.

531
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,652
- Where's the Tono-Pen?
- Oh, had two stolen, wound up on eBay.

532
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,661
JAY-CO makes us
lock everything up now.

533
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,830
Syringes, eye drops,
even guaiac developer.

534
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,195
Only Attendings get a key.

535
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,360
I am an Attending.

536
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,205
Make sure you
check under the hood.

537
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,863
Ow!

538
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:55,179
Hey, look, is there any rule
about desk clerks dating doctors?

539
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,339
Shut up, not-Jerry. I got dibs.

540
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,381
Oh, sweet. There's a
pile-up in Northbrook.

541
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,487
I am so out of here.

542
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,025
Let's see what we got.

543
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,164
- Sinus tach at 110.
- Got a pulse with that?

544
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,811
- Strong carotid.
- Excellent.

545
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,925
Cycle the dynamap.

546
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,567
We got him back for now.

547
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,829
Jimmy.

548
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,495
I'm right here, Jimmy.

549
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,072
BP's 105/62.

550
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:25,871
That's good enough for dialysis.
Get the tech back down here.

551
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,271
Mr. Cray? There are
two friends of yours here.

552
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,246
Oh, would you tell them
I'll be out in a minute?

553
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,582
Uh, they work with us.

554
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,396
Our brother was a lot more
screwed up than we realized.

555
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,054
I'm sorry he never told you.

556
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,257
Oh, we knew he was
an oddball, antisocial.

557
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,734
We thought he just fell into some sad,
lonely life. We never realized he was a...

558
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:54,635
Degenerate. LORRAINE: Harold.

559
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,365
He's not a degenerate.

560
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:00,101
His life hasn't been a waste. I know
it'd be easier for you to believe that.

561
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,713
He lied to us for years.

562
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,939
Well, he didn't want to.

563
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,949
He didn't see any other way.

564
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,484
You need to go now.

565
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,053
I'm not going anywhere.

566
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,286
You wanna take
care of him? Fine.

567
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,721
It doesn't have to be like this.

568
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,758
We need another doc.
This guy is crashing.

569
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:20,764
All right, call for a vent, 100
percent, AC 14, tidal volume, 600.

570
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,060
Yo, Cue Ball, what's up?

571
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,415
- Oh, that didn't sound good.
- Pressure dropped to 80.

572
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:32,400
All right, normal saline,
wide open, 5-liter O2.

573
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,069
What is she doing?

574
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,680
I think it's the 23rd Psalm.

575
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,321
He doesn't have a line. - Why?

576
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,180
Will you stop that, please?

577
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,684
His vitals were stable, crit's 32.
His only complaint was shoulder pain.

578
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,289
- The x-ray was negative...
- Did you say shoulder pain?

579
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,688
- Yeah.
- Type and cross four units.

580
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:48,952
What happened?

581
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,996
Alcoholic with distant trauma history
presents shoulder pain and hypotension.

582
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,428
Prep belly for ultrasound.

583
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,473
Hey there. ABBY: Hey.

584
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,370
I thought you said
you were coming alone.

585
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,374
Oh, come on, it's
me, Uncle Archie.

586
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,638
Oh, he's so cute.

587
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:08,974
He looks more like Kovac.

588
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,117
They usually look more like
the father in the beginning.

589
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,946
It's nature's way of
making sure Daddy...

590
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,985
doesn't get insecure
and club us to death.

591
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,352
Can I hold him? Sure,
he wants me to hold him.

592
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:23,491
Whoop, a little spit-up there.
No problem. Oh, a little bit more.

593
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,130
I missed this part with my kids.

594
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,856
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

595
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:29,331
I was going crazy so I
thought I'd take a walk.

596
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,163
I tried paging you.
How's surgery?

597
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,416
Oh, I thought it would be
nice to get back to work...

598
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,234
and distract
myself from stuff...

599
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,342
but my new chief is such a
rectal tissue. It's all misery.

600
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,741
Okay, you better take
him. It's starting to get gross.

601
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,312
- Thanks a lot, Morris.
- Here.

602
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,416
Here you go.

603
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,519
So are you loving motherhood?

604
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:50,554
Yeah, uh, it's bizarre.

605
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,554
- Sore nipples?
- Shut up.

606
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,838
- Oh, I think he's hungry.
- Yeah, maybe.

607
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,764
- Oh, damn it, I've gotta get back.
- Well, thank you for coming.

608
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,333
Well, it's very nice
to see you. Oh.

609
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,337
And nice to see you.

610
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,234
And, uh, call me if
you need anything.

611
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,739
- Okay, I'll be back to work next month.
- Bye.

612
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,173
Okay, I think I
need to feed him.

613
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,539
Yeah, I'm down with that.

614
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,511
Breast-feeding is a natural
thing. Nothing to be ashamed of.

615
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:20,050
- You're not sneaking a peek at my tits.
- Okay.

616
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,188
- Come on, Mr. Rodriguez, wake up.
- Got a 14-gauge in the right wrist.

617
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,262
You got a 14-gauge in? You're
gonna have to teach me that one.

618
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,591
This the ruptured spleen?

619
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,596
Foley's in.

620
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,959
Who's touching my dick?

621
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,626
Not me. That was only
one time, and I was lonely.

622
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,796
It's a catheter, Mr. Rodriguez.

623
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,065
Abdomen is flat.

624
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,708
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.

625
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,275
Hey, angel face.

626
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,571
What's going on?

627
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,806
Yeah, what is going on? I
thought we were going upstairs...

628
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,450
Dr. Gates discovered that
there was internal bleeding.

629
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,643
- Based on Kerr's sign.
- You caught that?

630
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,049
That's my boy.

631
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,123
Everybody knows you be tripping
off some phat laced powder...

632
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,920
Tony's the one you
want pushing that Narcan.

633
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,289
High praise indeed.

634
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,431
Check him out now
with his fancy M.D.

635
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,724
Chest sounds clear.

636
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,125
- What are you doing?
- Examining him.

637
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,298
It's a little crowded. Step
back, write up the H and P.

638
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:15,771
- Well, I can't do that un...
- I will dictate to you.

639
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,142
Chest clear.

640
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,347
Cardiac S1, S2 without
murmur, rub or gallop.

641
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,608
Am I going too fast for you?

642
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,285
Hey, I heard Faith's
guy was crashing.

643
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,786
Her name is Hope.

644
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,254
I think it's okay.

645
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,859
Good, well, we're done in
there. You guys called it?

646
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,189
Uh, no, actually,
the Digibind worked.

647
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,265
- Neela, check a quick rectal.
- I have to do the rectal exam?

648
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,701
Gates, what part of "no
Digibind" did you not get?

649
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,204
It worked. PRATT: So what?

650
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,467
You got his heart back,
but his brain is shot.

651
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,976
Now he'll be comatose for
three weeks until his organs fail.

652
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:57,173
- You don't know that for sure.
- What did you just say to me?

653
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,511
I'm an intern, not an
idiot. Been patching up...

654
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,485
Then maybe next time, you'll know the
difference between Diovan and didge.

655
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,625
If what I'm told doesn't make
sense to me, you got that?

656
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:10,229
I've been in this ER for five years
working my way up as an Attending...

657
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,127
so if you think that you're gonna
spout some crap like that to me...

658
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,098
then we got a lot
more to talk about.

659
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,401
Now get the hell out.

660
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,904
Okay, I was out of line. Can
I check the rapid infuser...?

661
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,667
- Get out of here.
- I'm working.

662
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,004
Not anymore.

663
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,976
- Shift's over.
- Oh, yeah?

664
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,876
- Pressure's stable.
- O.R. is ready.

665
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,643
Sats 92 on 4 liters.

666
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:35,083
Stool is brown, guaiac negative.
- Good.

667
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,655
Let's squeeze in two units,
portable monitor, let's move him up.

668
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,493
Thank you, Jesus.

669
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,477
I thought you were gone.

670
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,805
Working on my charts.

671
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,582
Listen, I know I made a mistake, but that
guy would have needed calcium anyway.

672
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,481
If I had known about the didge,
I'd have used a lower dose.

673
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,849
- Pushed it very slowly.
- I said I was wrong.

674
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,490
What do you want from me?

675
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,320
How about, "I won't ever
again flat-out disregard...

676
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,588
something you tell
me to do or not do"?

677
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,594
He would have
wanted the Digibind.

678
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:22,097
- So what?
- So what? That's gotta matter.

679
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,735
It was a judgment call
that wasn't yours to make.

680
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:28,567
If you can't give weight to my judgment
on a patient that I've been treating...

681
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,208
- What?
- No.

682
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,371
No, no, no, go ahead.
Finish the sentence.

683
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,016
Nope.

684
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,909
Yeah.

685
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,584
From now on, you
chart as you go.

686
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,553
No more of this saving the
paperwork for the end of the day.

687
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:47,535
And next time you don't
do what I tell you to do...

688
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,585
or any other
Attending tells you...

689
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,323
you're gonna find yourself getting
bum rushed right out of this program.

690
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:59,769
- I was wrong from your point of view...
- From my point of view?

691
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:02,100
Because of the Digibind,
that guy has a chance.

692
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:05,836
You really think that you saved
him? Is that what you think?

693
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,609
Oh, then he's gotta
have a corneal reflex.

694
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,912
- No.
- Cold calorics?

695
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,575
Absent.

696
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,346
And negative doll's eyes, right?

697
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,122
That means no
sign of brain activity.

698
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,158
No chance for recovery.

699
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,799
So as your, uh, favorite new mentor,
let me just say, great save, Dr. Gates.

700
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,141
Hey.

701
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,288
How's your first day going?

702
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,185
Guy comes in with a few scrapes,
ends up with a splenectomy.

703
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,018
Well, sounds like a good case.

704
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,787
Yeah, it does sound like one.

705
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,830
I wouldn't know, because
Dr. Crenshaw won't let me scrub in.

706
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,489
Sent me to do dressing changes.

707
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,465
Yeah, he's a stern
taskmaster, that Dusty.

708
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,696
I'm an intern, Lucien.

709
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,931
Nurses do wound changes.

710
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,871
You know what? That's his call.

711
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,170
You assured me this
would be a step up.

712
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,543
Two months ago, I was harvesting
saphenous veins for a CABG procedure.

713
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:19,344
- Now I can't hold a retractor?
- It's only the first day.

714
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,009
Why recruit me if you won't
allow me to do anything?

715
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,349
He's tough, I know that,
but his methods work.

716
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,492
He needs to break you down to
un-learn you of your bad habits.

717
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,922
What am I, a pony?

718
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,722
I don't need to be broken.

719
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:34,161
I'm not gonna learn or un-learn
anything by standing out in the hall.

720
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,631
Neela, you're in a
different culture now.

721
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:41,705
This is how we shake the ER out of
you and build you up again as a surgeon.

722
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,934
Well, does it have
to be so humiliating?

723
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,036
No, it's just much
more effective that way.

724
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,959
Oh.

725
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,958
- I was wondering where you went.
- Yeah, I was taken off the case.

726
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,729
Yes, I thought I
detected some tension.

727
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:18,237
- Where are the Andersons?
- Oh, they won't stay as long as I'm here.

728
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,571
Even Brian.

729
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,406
Well, it's nice
your friends came.

730
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,072
They want me to go to the club.

731
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,014
Do the show.

732
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,381
Well, they're gonna move him to ICU.
We won't know anything for 24 hours.

733
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,253
Maybe you should go.

734
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,259
He's not coming
back from this, is he?

735
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,792
- There's something I should tell you...
- No.

736
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:47,564
You made a mistake, got
something wrong about the didge.

737
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,469
It contributed to
his heart problems.

738
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:54,272
I've been around hospitals
long enough to get that much.

739
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,314
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

740
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,285
You treated him well.

741
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,579
Both of us.

742
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,551
We appreciate it.

743
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,116
Maybe they were right.

744
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,796
Maybe he was ready.

745
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,595
This has been
coming for a long time.

746
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,999
But here's the thing.

747
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,733
As bad as it all may sound,
I belong to a rare tribe...

748
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,345
constitutionally incapable
of giving up on fantasy.

749
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:34,679
If I can get up like a lady and
sell a torch song to a crowd...

750
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:38,017
then I sure as hell can
hold onto the hope...

751
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,524
that maybe, somehow...

752
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,822
Jimmy's gonna be okay.

753
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,429
You make me wish
I were a drag queen.

754
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,160
No.

755
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:56,138
We are all liars,
just like they said.

756
00:37:56,307 --> 00:38:00,540
The makeup, the
wig, the padded dress.

757
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:04,308
All a beautiful lie
we tell ourselves.

758
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,086
But it makes us feel better.

759
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,621
Nothing wrong with that.

760
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,191
No, nothing at all.

761
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,034
Thank you, doctor.

762
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,961
Hope, impacted cerumen
needs a washout in 1...

763
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,834
and migraine lady
needs an H and P...

764
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,875
The abridged version, please.
- -in Curtain 4.

765
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,707
Oh, and hey, uh, you know,
once we're done here...

766
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,372
maybe we could go over
some procedures and stuff.

767
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,212
Help orient you.

768
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,047
Maybe over dinner?

769
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:43,914
You're asking me out?

770
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,884
No, no, I mean, not exactly.

771
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,686
I mean, you know, yeah.

772
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,692
Have you accepted
Jesus in your life?

773
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,726
Jesus in Accounting or...?

774
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:59,227
Oh, yeah, well, sure, yeah.
I mean, I've thought about it.

775
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:01,430
- You haven't, have you?
- Yes, yes, I have.

776
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,700
Jesus is totally cool.

777
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,443
I mean, to me, anyway.

778
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:11,508
You should come to my Bible group
sometime. I think you'd really like it.

779
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,707
Bible group?

780
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,012
- Okay.
- Great.

781
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,587
The next one's Wednesday night.

782
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,657
Bible group.

783
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,425
That's hot, right?

784
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:29,932
Trust me, carrot boy, you ain't
anywhere near tapping that.

785
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,593
You know, if there's
anything you need...

786
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,205
I mean, if I can help make
your adjustment smoother.

787
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,137
- In any way.
- I'll let you know.

788
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,574
Um, things are a bit
complicated right now.

789
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,373
Yeah, for me too.

790
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,039
- But maybe we can get some...?
- Coffee?

791
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,775
- Coffee or something?
- Yeah.

792
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,443
- Sometime?
- Coffee would be good.

793
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:58,794
Okay, then.

794
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,498
- Well...
- Good night.

795
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,800
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, Mom.

796
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,939
I, uh, talked to
Dr. Alice today.

797
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,478
She said you were quiet.

798
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,641
Do you not like her?

799
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,912
Scoot.

800
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:33,658
Now, you've been through a
lot, you know. We both have.

801
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,665
I just wanted you
to have her to talk to.

802
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,698
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

803
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,102
- That's what she's there for.
- No, Mom, I can't.

804
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,476
I saw.

805
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,014
You know, Dad on the
ground, just sleeping.

806
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,345
I saw what you did.

807
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,528
Did you remember the wine?

808
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,961
I knew there was a
reason I let you live here.

809
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,532
So were you the best one there?

810
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,533
How many people did you save?

811
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,672
Did you rock?

812
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:36,119
<i>You're nobody till
somebody loves you</i>

813
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,794
<i>You're nobody till
somebody cares</i>

814
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:53,975
<i>You may be king You may
possess the world and it's gold</i>

815
00:41:54,812 --> 00:42:01,776
<i>But gold won't bring you
happiness When you're growing old</i>

816
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:08,386
<i>The world still is the
same You'll never change it</i>

817
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:17,362
<i>As long as the stars shine above</i>

818
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:25,970
<i>You're nobody till
somebody loves you</i>

819
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:30,312
<i>So find yourself somebody</i>

820
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,649
<i>Get yourself somebody</i>

821
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:41,186
<i>Find yourself somebody to love</i>
