00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,899
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,633
- Nice to meet you.
- Heh, heh. You too.

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,439
- And thank you for the hot dog.
- It's my pleasure.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,977
- This is my brother, Chaz.
- How you doing?

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,083
- You moving in?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,278
Up at First Mission Baptist, Pastor
Watkins does a drug-exchange program.

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,583
What you're doing is dangerous,
okay? Not to mention illegal.

8
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,749
That TV news gal,
Courtney Brown, called again.

9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,555
Oh. Channel 5 Courtney
Brown? What did she want?

10
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,630
She offered me a
job as a reporter.

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,733
It was about time someone
put something worthwhile on TV.

12
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,030
I called you the other night
and a woman answered.

13
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,934
Yeah. I can explain that.

14
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,079
Rise and shine, Mayday.
Too early to be taking a nap.

15
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,738
- Is it morning already?
- Yeah.

16
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,942
Has been for a while.

17
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,816
Crenshaw has been running me ragged.
I've been on since midnight Tuesday.

18
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,321
No wonder you haven't
returned my calls.

19
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,893
Surgery is not for sissies.

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,840
I wanna talk to you about our
mutual groping after the M and M...

21
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,600
Oh, yeah, it was a mistake.

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,244
Yeah.

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,104
You live with someone.

24
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,815
Yes, but not exactly.

25
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,584
And there's a little girl.

26
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,655
Right. Nice kid, not mine.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,186
Her father was my friend.

28
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,952
In the Gulf?

29
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,797
Yup. After we came back,
he couldn't keep it together.

30
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,434
And I always told him that
if something happened...

31
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,366
I would make sure that Sarah
and Meg made it through.

32
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,798
That's a big promise.

33
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,636
I always say go big or go home.

34
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,181
Hello.

35
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:00,549
Gates, your DVT patient is still
waiting on a ride to Oncology.

36
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,384
Nurses started a pool on when
somebody will tap your ascites guy's belly.

37
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,493
All right, I'll go
take care of the...

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,959
The DVT guy first.

39
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,900
Ambulance on its way in.

40
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,538
Stab wound-slash-OD,
nine minutes out.

41
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,537
Wake me up in eight.

42
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,677
Whenever I move my
head, everything spins.

43
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,177
- Mm-hm.
- My nephew says it's a tumor.

44
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,905
Your neuro exam's
normal, ma'am...

45
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,312
so it's not a brain
tumor, it's not a stroke.

46
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,508
Stroke?

47
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,587
This is meclizine. Take one
every eight hours if you get dizzy.

48
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,348
When you run out, fill
this for a month's supply.

49
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,083
I take that to the pharmacy?

50
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,158
- Yes, ma'am.
- And I have to pay?

51
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,490
Yeah, but your insurance
will cover some of it.

52
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,259
- Dr. Pratt?
- There you go. Excuse me.

53
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,833
Ahh.

54
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,867
Yeah?

55
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,931
Mrs. Skinner's BP, 185/100.

56
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,339
- She take the Oretic I gave her?
- Sure, until she used up the samples.

57
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,412
Well, what about
the prescription?

58
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,013
It's $60 for a month's supply.

59
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,845
She's saving up, but hopes her son
will send her a check by Thanksgiving.

60
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,386
You know, I'm going out of my
way to get your people set up right...

61
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,024
you gotta help make sure
they stay on the program.

62
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,287
All I need is an extra 100 grand a year.
That'll cover costs for my congregation.

63
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,193
What? I need to figure out
a way to pay for all this too?

64
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,231
Hey, in for a penny,
in for a pound.

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,062
Who said that? Jesus?

66
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,694
Clemens Daniel III, my bookie.

67
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,235
Don't let me get wet,
Teller, the water burns.

68
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,538
- Gotta make sure they see him.
- Don't leave me.

69
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,079
We'll get in trouble.

70
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,479
Them demons come through
the sewers when it rains.

71
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,153
She's here!

72
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,783
- Bloody Mary.
- Let go. Let go! It's her!

73
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,448
It's okay. You know what to do.

74
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,157
- No, she sees us. It's too late.
- Do it, Paulie.

75
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:54,425
<i>One, two, three, four,
Stay away forevermore</i>

76
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,092
See?

77
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,367
She can't hurt us.

78
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,148
Stab wound to
shoulder, BP, 110/75...

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,289
Let's go, Teller. He's a doctor.

80
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,686
- Did she get Narcan?
- No response.

81
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,359
Teller, we have to go back.

82
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,995
What happened? To
his ear, what happened?

83
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,073
He climbed over a fence.
- Did he fall?

84
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,690
- I'll be good, Ma.
- Probably.

85
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,333
- Did he hit his head?
- Maybe.

86
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,034
We need a gurney, a
backboard and a C-collar.

87
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,635
Page Surgery, ENT.

88
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,469
- I'll come in as soon as I'm done.
- All right. Thanks, Mayday.

89
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,944
There be demons on the Hancock.
You can see them from the lake.

90
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,640
Shut up, Paulie.
They don't know.

91
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,615
Couple of Ativan
to calm him down.

92
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,221
- What do you wanna do about the ear?
- Unasyn, 2 grams.

93
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,014
Try 3. Irrigate
the hell out of it.

94
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,455
- Plastics will do a flap in O.R.
- Sats are good.

95
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,958
Pupils equal and reactive.

96
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,494
Pinpoint pupils. She had Narcan?
- Only 0.8.

97
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,462
All right, let's try 2 milligrams.
Sometimes they need more.

98
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,568
No wounds to the
anterior chest or abdomen.

99
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:05,061
Corneal reflexes are intact.

100
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,570
Chest is clear.

101
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,868
Belly soft, non-tender.

102
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,501
Tachy at 120. DUMAR:
Looks like you got her back.

103
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,739
- Oh, my God.
- Deep breath for me now.

104
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,473
In.

105
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,515
- Out. GATES:
One percent lido...

106
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,153
and update his tetanus.

107
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,017
It's gonna be okay, Paulie.
You're gonna be okay.

108
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,888
The blue lady's here.

109
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,304
Yeah, I was running around
all shift and I never got to it.

110
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,411
I was coming off an overnight,
I figured Gates could handle it.

111
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,572
He didn't and now he
can't. He's in with a trauma.

112
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,217
Well, it's just a paracentesis.
Maybe you could do it.

113
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,752
<i>Look, you're an Attending, you
shouldn't have left this unfinished.</i>

114
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,913
Look, I had
somewhere to be, okay?

115
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,152
What was so important you'd walk
out on a guy who'd been here all night?

116
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,058
Church, all right?

117
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,391
I had to go to church.

118
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,690
Pratt, you're a terrible liar.

119
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,599
Get back here and deal
with this right now, okay?

120
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,031
Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

121
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,700
You chipping in on the
water bill, because I need to...

122
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,744
Hey, Greg.

123
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,579
I thought you were at work.

124
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,946
This your brother?

125
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,519
Yeah.

126
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,190
- Get out of here.
- Greg, listen...

127
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,519
Hey, get the hell out of here.

128
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,363
You too.

129
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,034
By the time I get
back, I want you gone.

130
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,971
Let go. Why you wanna kill me?

131
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,312
- Stop it or she won't come.
- Are we charting this as a John Doe?

132
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,920
- I told you his name's Paulie.
- Paulie what?

133
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,612
Does he have any parents?

134
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,055
His father's locked up
in the tower by the water.

135
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,786
His mom was in the
shelter before she died.

136
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,659
Paulie left so they couldn't
send him to the Foresters.

137
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,231
Foresters?

138
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,301
The fake family that
don't ever love you.

139
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,800
A foster family?

140
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,871
- Where does he live?
- Under.

141
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,505
- Under what?
- How's it here?

142
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:25,407
Altered after a 10-foot
fall. No ID, history unknown.

143
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,844
C-spine and chest are
clear. Lose the collar, will you?

144
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,984
- Head CT films.
- I don't wanna stay here.

145
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,916
- Look. JARVIK:
Another two of Ativan?

146
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,079
No bleed or fracture.
What about drugs?

147
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,157
Tox screen negative
for alcohol, drugs.

148
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,953
- Fever? JARVIK:
Ninety-eight-point-six.

149
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,086
- I don't get why he's so altered.
- Doesn't seem like meningitis.

150
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,189
- Has he been acting differently?
- Since his arm started hurting.

151
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,623
Even before he fell?

152
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,499
- He only fell last night.
- How did he fall?

153
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,605
We was in the building
where nobody lives.

154
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,208
- Paulie got scared because of the bats.
- Bats?

155
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,674
- It could be rabies. Hope, page Kovac.
- Okay.

156
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,007
All right, put an
N95 mask on him.

157
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,878
If he does have rabies, his
saliva is extremely infectious.

158
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,643
I'll check for fractures.

159
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,916
No step-offs or deformities.

160
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,922
Full range of motion
at the elbow and wrist.

161
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,354
See, Paulie?

162
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,995
Told you she'd come.

163
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,235
Lunchtime starts at noon, so
I'll be there with the crew by 11.

164
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,499
You know, Courtney, this
isn't quite what I signed on for.

165
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,543
I thought I'd be reporting
on topical medical issues...

166
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,409
not doing puff pieces on
Botox and unsanitary manicures.

167
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,073
Hey, that one was strong.

168
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,846
People all over Chicago now think
twice before having their cuticles cut.

169
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,216
See you at noon.

170
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,556
This came for you
special delivery.

171
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,588
Baby gift?

172
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,992
Yeah. Yeah.

173
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,032
Charles Hadley, multiple
wounds after a bar fight.

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,032
He passed out on
the couch last night.

175
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,899
- This morning, I couldn't wake him up.
- Look at me, sir.

176
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,098
Pupils equal at 4 millimeters.

177
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,243
- You all right there, ma'am?
- It's nothing.

178
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,039
- We should take a look at it.
- No, no, no, I'm all right.

179
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,908
CBC, chem panel,
blood alcohol...

180
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,845
C-spine, head and facial CT.

181
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,576
Dried blood at the left ear
canal, positive battle sign.

182
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,278
- Have a seat.
- Chest is clear.

183
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,083
Abdomen soft, no
rebound or guarding.

184
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:21,956
- Did he do this?
- No. No.

185
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,960
He didn't know
what he was doing.

186
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,565
Are you saying your
husband hit you, ma'am?

187
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,133
It was an accident.

188
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,032
I was helping him down
on the couch and he slipped.

189
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,433
His elbow knocked me.

190
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,607
Pelvis is stable.

191
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,766
She's gonna need
a facial series.

192
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,471
Dr. Kovac, we've got a pretty
sick little boy in 2, no parents...

193
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,310
- Just keep trying to reach them.
- We think he's homeless.

194
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,382
Neela and Gates
are worried it's rabies.

195
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,491
You're good. I'll be back.

196
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,560
- Rabies?
- He was in a building infested with bats.

197
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,323
- How was the trauma workup?
- CT's negative, but he's altered, ataxic.

198
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,625
A river runs through the city.

199
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,828
On the other side's the good
streets, but we can't get across.

200
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,598
- How's he doing?
- Responsive but not making much sense.

201
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,798
He's not crazy.

202
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,340
The stuff he's
talking about is real.

203
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,407
- You're thinking rabies?
- What else could it be?

204
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,278
Encephalitis from
any number of viruses.

205
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,114
West Nile, Epstein-Barr,
mumps, measles, varicella, CMV.

206
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,018
- He needs a spinal tap.
- Can we do a rabies vaccine in case?

207
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,820
Well, if you're right, it's too late.
So let's first confirm the diagnosis.

208
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,691
The quickest way is with a
skin biopsy. Keep a mask on him.

209
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,698
If we intubate, you'll all need
masks, gloves and goggles.

210
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,859
- Tony, your buddy Cue Ball's leaving.
- What?

211
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,368
- He still needs an x-ray.
- He said he feels fine.

212
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,665
Will you handle this?
I'll be back in a second.

213
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,139
Are you gonna learn
me the hard song now?

214
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,136
Can you hold his
head for me, Teller?

215
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,614
There, you see, I'm just like a vulture.
I'm the guy that gets you out of here.

216
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,378
Cue Ball, where you going?

217
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,055
Home, man. They fixed me up.

218
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,987
Cue Ball. Hey, I knew your
parents, eight ball and highball.

219
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,151
Your lungs sound like
a bag of potato chips.

220
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,795
Oh, come on, it's nachos.

221
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,055
I was just translating.

222
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,133
- I'm taking you back. You need an x-ray.
- No, no. I been here since last night.

223
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,327
I got places to go,
people to see, baby.

224
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,869
Hey, sit down, Pancho.

225
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,564
- We'll wheel you back to Tijuana.
- I ain't Spanish, man.

226
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,903
He's a new volunteer.
We're still training him.

227
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,636
- Gates.
- Oh, here comes your pimp.

228
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,509
- I'm done with this.
- Cue Ball, get back here. Come on.

229
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,746
- Do one x-ray.
- Hey, hey, hey.

230
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,149
- What?
- Why didn't you tap my patient?

231
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,255
I was in trauma. What
was I supposed to do?

232
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,481
What I told you.

233
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,092
So I'm just supposed to
take all your scut, huh?

234
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,490
- Don't turn your back on me.
- I got stuff to do.

235
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,927
The only thing you have
to do is what I tell you.

236
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,190
You don't wanna do this.

237
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,197
- I don't wanna do what?
- Get in my face.

238
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,927
Then stop acting like you
don't hear me when I talk.

239
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:49,939
If you wanna have a job this
afternoon, you better stay where you are.

240
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,083
She can't cry.
There's only one dog.

241
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,414
Can you touch your nose for me?

242
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,617
Paulie, can you hear me?

243
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,555
If you can hear me, can
you touch your nose?

244
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,063
How's he doing?

245
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,972
Intention tremor
with worsening ataxia.

246
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,301
Bit my lip.

247
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,812
Skin biopsy came back
positive for rabies by DFA.

248
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,816
- Rabies is 100 percent fatal.
- Ninety-nine-point-nine percent.

249
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,545
There's a little girl in
Wisconsin, 2004. She survived.

250
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,486
- That was one case.
- We're gonna make it two cases.

251
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,818
- What's this?
<i>- New England Journal of Medicine.</i>

252
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,657
You need to order ketamine, midazolam,
ribavirin, amantadine from the pharmacy.

253
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,162
We're gonna induce a coma?

254
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,596
Titrate the midazolam
to suppress brain activity.

255
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,793
Lets the brain rest while
we administer antivirals.

256
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,167
Also, we need to call Neurology,
he'll need continuous EEG monitoring.

257
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,503
- There are no isolation beds in the
PICU. NEELA: He'll have to stay here.

258
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,837
This guy's taking a nose dive.
- I'm coming.

259
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,777
- Did you notify public health?
- They're bringing in CDC.

260
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,849
Okay, good. So
anyone else exposed...

261
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,852
needs rabies prophylaxis
vaccine and immune globulin.

262
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,785
Our party animal's more disoriented.
Head CT shows a basilar skull fracture.

263
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,019
- Intracranial hemorrhage?
- We got lucky there.

264
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,163
GCS is down from 14 to eight.

265
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,094
- Mr. Hadley, open your eyes.
- He's diaphoretic.

266
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,462
Are the labs back yet?
- No, not yet.

267
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,503
We need to repeat the head
CT, see if there's a delayed bleed.

268
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,471
- Sats dropping.
- Hundred percent non-rebreather.

269
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,543
Dr. Kovac, a guy called a couple
times, didn't leave a message.

270
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,339
- Did you get a name, Frank?
- He wouldn't say.

271
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,040
- Why are you telling me this?
- Thought you'd wanna know.

272
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,652
- It's probably a creditor.
- Great. Thank you. Thank you, Frank.

273
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,849
Doing an Accu-Chek?

274
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,285
He's not a diabetic.

275
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,655
No, but if he's a chronic
alcoholic who's not eating...

276
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,819
he might be hypoglycemic.

277
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,858
- There it is. Blood sugar's 34.
- That's pretty low.

278
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,228
Amp of D50 and
100 mgs of thiamine.

279
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,735
- He's a bigger drinker than we thought.
- He wasn't always this bad.

280
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,704
Advanced liver disease
diminishes his glycogen stores.

281
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,775
His body can't respond
to low blood sugar.

282
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,851
What the hell is going on?

283
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,649
Mr. Hadley, do you
know where you are?

284
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,257
Chicago.

285
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,551
You're in the hospital.

286
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,854
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

287
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,553
It's been a couple of days.

288
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,090
I guess I've been
on a bit of a bender.

289
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,829
Cancel the CT?

290
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,504
Yeah.

291
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,275
- Here.
- The hell is that?

292
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,172
Belly tap for my ascites guy.

293
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:43,214
Send it for a cell count,
culture and cytology.

294
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,278
Whoa. Hope didn't
get that hitting a patient.

295
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,011
Intern.

296
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,716
Why are you even here?

297
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,222
Paracentesis on a pass-on
Gates couldn't handle.

298
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,759
Uh-huh. Welcome
to being an Attending.

299
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,022
Wait, you... You
and Gates didn't...?

300
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,429
You know what, I
don't need to know.

301
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,292
Hey, how's the lip?

302
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,802
Better than your
hand. You hit like a girl.

303
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,031
Yeah, okay.

304
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,301
Look, sorry for blowing
my cool like that.

305
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,036
I was having a terrible
morning, but that's no excuse...

306
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,274
so if you wanna file a grievance
with Human Resources, you can call...

307
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,387
I was there too. It's not the first time I
let something like that get out of hand.

308
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:25,150
Have you tried getting into a
program to help you stop drinking?

309
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,420
Like I wanna hear
everybody else's problems.

310
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,556
What good is a lot of
talking gonna do me?

311
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,896
Not gonna bring my son back.

312
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,398
He died?

313
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,937
As a DUI.

314
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,007
He got his mother's looks. Heh.

315
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,645
And my alcoholism.

316
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,179
What about what
you're doing to your wife?

317
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,986
I don't know why she
hasn't left me before.

318
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,828
It should be... It
should be me, doc.

319
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,025
It should be me that's
dead and not Kenny.

320
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,532
She came here with an injury.

321
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,533
Did you hit her?

322
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,196
- What?
- Did you hit her?

323
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,207
I would never,
never hurt my wife.

324
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,940
But you did.

325
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,680
If it...

326
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,486
If I did...

327
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,489
It wasn't on... It
wasn't on purpose.

328
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,133
I love her.

329
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,702
Check his glucose in an hour.

330
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,164
Wait a minute, I love her.

331
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,436
I'll be back.

332
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,642
Do you think the concussion and
the low blood sugar contributed to this?

333
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:58,841
To what?

334
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,578
Well, I think he'd altered
and he hurt her accidentally.

335
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,813
We have to report it.

336
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:06,255
- If it's nothing, it will get dropped.
- The wife said he never hit her.

337
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,087
- The police will sort it out.
- Hey.

338
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,526
What? What? She's
got a bruised face.

339
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,665
So you wanna put
him in a locked facility?

340
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,529
You heard him, he won't get
any help unless he's forced to.

341
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,830
- It's time someone scared him.
- You might be right about this, but...

342
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,029
Look, let's try this.

343
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,005
You be the Resident, I'll
be the Attending, okay?

344
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,075
Okay.

345
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,876
- Can I help find something, Dr. Pratt?
- What? No.

346
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,782
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are we out of diuretics?

347
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,786
I think there are some
samples over here, but...

348
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,791
Free sample closet.

349
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,395
- Hope, you're a genius.
- Aah! Ha.

350
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,358
I thought...

351
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,231
- Aren't you not working this shift?
- Yeah, that's right.

352
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,803
Oh.

353
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,973
Well, then why are you...?

354
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,305
I'm running a little low on some stuff
for some people I'm helping at church.

355
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,310
Church? I didn't know that
you volunteered at church.

356
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,643
No, this is not gonna be enough.
Do we have anything anywhere else?

357
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,911
- Come on.
- There was a drug rep here earlier.

358
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,987
- Maybe they restocked?
- Drug rep.

359
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:13,149
She even brought pizza. Very
sweet girl from Dayton, Ohio.

360
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,319
My family's originally from
Akron so we had a lot in common.

361
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,762
I think her name was Dora.

362
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,992
Here you go, buddy.

363
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,467
- I'm not hungry.
- It might make you feel better.

364
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:25,969
And this soup is the bomb.

365
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,970
I'm serious, they
call it the bomb soup.

366
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,666
You eat this soup, you're
gonna fart like a cannon.

367
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,846
Ketamine's ready to go
at 2 mgs per kilo per hour...

368
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,642
with ribavirin loading
dose of 33 mgs per kilo.

369
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,183
When's Paulie gonna wake up?

370
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:44,924
I don't know. We're gonna make Paulie
sleep for a while, a couple of weeks.

371
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,582
Hopefully, his body can heal.

372
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,785
Amantadine needs
to be given by mouth.

373
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,688
All right.

374
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,264
Hey, Paulie. Can you hear me?

375
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,492
I need you to take a
little sip of water here.

376
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,198
Rabies are making it hard for
him to swallow. Drop an NG.

377
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,002
That's not why.

378
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,644
It's because Bloody
Mary saw his face.

379
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:10,277
Put a tube down his throat to help
him breathe. Ten of sux, 20 of etomidate.

380
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,146
Pulse ox is only 82.
GATES: Ambu-bag.

381
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,584
Yankauer suction on high.

382
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,589
Teller.

383
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,293
Teller!

384
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,934
What do you know about the
placement of the hernia mesh?

385
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,600
It must be parallel
to the peritoneal sac.

386
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,302
And?

387
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,311
The mesh covers
the abdominal wall...

388
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:52,441
reflects on the iliopubic tract and
covers several centimeters of the psoas.

389
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,449
Paulie can't breathe.
You have to come help.

390
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,952
- Who is that?
- You can't be in here, Teller.

391
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,188
You have to come help.
Paulie can't breathe.

392
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,664
Go back downstairs.
I can't come with you.

393
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,133
You have to.
You're the blue lady.

394
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,832
Please. Please,
just help Paulie.

395
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,235
You need to wake him up.

396
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,341
I can't. Paulie's very sick.

397
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,412
I saw you.

398
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:24,513
That other girl,
she was asleep...

399
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,186
and you woke her up.
You brought her back to life.

400
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,821
That was different.

401
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,286
You can't say no.

402
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,182
You can't.

403
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,454
I know your secret name: Mayday.

404
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,660
And one day...

405
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,541
One day, every day
is gonna be Sunday.

406
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,010
Diuretics, calcium channel
blockers, oral hypoglycemics.

407
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,548
Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories...

408
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,710
proton-pump inhibitors,
beta-agonist inhalers.

409
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,719
Enough meds for 90
percent of your people.

410
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,522
That's fast work.

411
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,253
- How did you manage it?
- Sold my soul to a drug company.

412
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,394
Well, not exactly my
soul. Give me those.

413
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,933
I'll go lock them
up in the closet.

414
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,998
Greg's told me about
what you're doing here.

415
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,106
I'd love to be a part of it.

416
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,539
It's why I took my break
time to help out Dr. Pratt.

417
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,612
- Uh... Are you a med student?
- Hope Bobek.

418
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,579
I'm an intern.

419
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,083
It's the same thing as a first-year
Resident, but they call us interns.

420
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,347
I don't really know why.

421
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:40,684
Oh. I love old
churches like this.

422
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,921
- Do you?
- It's so big.

423
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,224
Yes, it is, isn't it?

424
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,731
It's estimated that between
10 and 20 percent...

425
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,893
of the youth in this
country are obese.

426
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,268
A condition which leads to
increased risk of diabetes...

427
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,068
heart disease,
high cholesterol...

428
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,904
- Lucy's choking!
- Somebody help.

429
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,101
Let's go. MAN: Yeah.

430
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,576
Keep filming.

431
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,377
Hey, sweetie? Honey,
can you breathe?

432
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,315
Can you speak? Okay, here we go.

433
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,723
- All right, I need help here. Look out.
- Kerry, what's happening?

434
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,384
Probably has a piece of
food obstructing her trachea.

435
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,053
Hang in there, Lucy. Here we go.

436
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,192
Oh...

437
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,168
Okay, get me a kitchen knife with
a sharp point and a drinking straw.

438
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,931
Now. Go.

439
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,100
Okay, this is gonna
hurt for a second.

440
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,509
Ready? One, two, three.

441
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,010
Ewww.

442
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,682
Oh, man, that's nasty.

443
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,648
She's cutting her throat.

444
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,286
Disgusting.

445
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,040
- He's still sleeping?
- Yes.

446
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:47,159
He's got peripheral IVs for continuous
sedation and antiviral therapy.

447
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:50,660
He needs a central line if he'll do
blood products and clotting factors.

448
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,491
Central line's too
risky with a DIC.

449
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:55,191
- We have to do something.
- What about saphenous cutdown?

450
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,665
Lily, Betadine.

451
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,930
Thanks for getting here so
fast. Thought we'd lose him.

452
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,130
She had to come.

453
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,368
10 blade, curved hemostat.

454
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,637
- He says I'm the blue lady.
- Ah.

455
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,442
When I was a paramedic, we used
to run into homeless kids like this.

456
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,448
- 3-0 silk.
- Survival.

457
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,178
They'd have to make up
a story about their world.

458
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,686
It helps them get through it.

459
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,187
It's not a story.

460
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,956
It's real.

461
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:26,522
God took a boat across the lake because
he couldn't fight the demons in Chicago.

462
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,131
There were too many of them
and they're always out to hurt you.

463
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,532
Like Bloody Mary?

464
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,839
Demons turn you into
druggies or whores.

465
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,510
One shot my brother
from his black SUV.

466
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,543
- 11 blade.
- What about good spirits?

467
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,706
- Any of those?
- The angels could save you.

468
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,080
They eat the millennium light
and stop the hawk from frostbiting.

469
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,153
So the blue lady can save
you if you're hurt or sick, huh?

470
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,891
She has to.

471
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,356
If you know her secret name.

472
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,187
Triple lumen catheter.

473
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,527
- Teller.
- Look, Ellie.

474
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,362
I told you not to stay.

475
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,231
I told you you'd
get us in trouble.

476
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,429
It's okay.

477
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,836
She's gonna fix Paulie.

478
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,839
Are you leaving?

479
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,949
I've tried to make him get
some help. He won't listen to me.

480
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,175
I've lost a son.

481
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,013
Now it looks like I'll
lose a husband too.

482
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,350
Well, not if you don't want to.

483
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,459
How bad does it have to get
before he realizes there's a problem?

484
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,859
Does he have to doze off with his
cigarette and burn the place down...

485
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,024
- or fall through a glass door?
- Well, alcoholism's a disease.

486
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,865
I mean, maybe the two of us together
can convince him to get some treatment.

487
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,036
I love him. I really do.

488
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,476
And he's a good man.

489
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:54,448
He just can't seem
to get over this.

490
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,580
I think he's starting to understand
that he needs to make some changes.

491
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,166
Okay.

492
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,163
Hemmerdinger's been D/C'd...

493
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,276
Winston is in Radiology
and Barnaby died.

494
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,470
- Now, listen, about the Hadleys...
- Abby.

495
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,842
Look, they love each
other. They're struggling...

496
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,746
- You're defending abuse?
- Don't think that's what happened.

497
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,888
- The guy's an alcoholic.
- Yeah, well, so am I.

498
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,254
I already reported it.
The cops are on their way.

499
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,424
Lucy Mokeler, criked for
upper-airway obstruction.

500
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,624
What happened?

501
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,327
I was doing a stand-up in a
middle-school lunchroom...

502
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,767
and she started choking.

503
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:17,363
I know you probably think that I
wanted to move in here because of this.

504
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,404
You told me that you
wanted to be closer to school.

505
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,699
I did.

506
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,673
I thought maybe we could be
brothers like we talked about last year.

507
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,837
Oh. Oh. So you just didn't
need a little bit more privacy...

508
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,882
than living with the
family could get you, huh?

509
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,752
It's not like that.

510
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,081
You lied to me, and
I'm not cool with that.

511
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,989
- I didn't lie.
- I'm not cool with it.

512
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,457
So, what, Greg?

513
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,994
What, if I'd have told you the truth,
then you would've been cool with it?

514
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,106
You think this is easy for me?

515
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,610
It's not like this has been
going on a long time...

516
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,714
it's just something
that happened.

517
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,913
I don't know, man, it's
like a phase or something.

518
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,937
Tsk.

519
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,197
He's bradying down.
- Mg of atropine.

520
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,035
- Where have you been?
- I was helping Dr. Pratt. Sorry.

521
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,040
Lost the pulse,
starting compressions.

522
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,337
I can do that.

523
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,776
- Call Kovac.
- Amp of epi.

524
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,280
It's hard to bag. There's
a lot of resistance.

525
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,714
- What's the rhythm?
- PEA.

526
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,786
Absent breath
sounds on the left.

527
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,356
Could've had a small pneumo that
converted to tension with intubation.

528
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,824
Still no pulse. GATES:
Looks like V-fib. Charge to 360.

529
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,296
The rabies can damage the
conduction system of the heart.

530
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,458
Charged. GATES: Clear.

531
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,728
There's no change.

532
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,805
The virus is too advanced,
GATES: Hundred of lidocaine.

533
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,967
I don't think he's
gonna make it.

534
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,406
- Hundred of lidocaine.
- Paulie.

535
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,710
Teller!

536
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,540
Clear.

537
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,051
- Hey, wait!
- Come on, let's go.

538
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,746
- Stop it.
- Please, let us help you.

539
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,250
You both need medicine so
you don't get sick like Paulie.

540
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,591
I thought you were gonna save him.
- It's not her, Teller.

541
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,494
She's just a doctor. Tell
him you're not the blue lady.

542
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,000
Please, you could have
what Paulie has. Please.

543
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,440
Neela! We need you inside!

544
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,410
- We got him back.
- What?

545
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,712
The rabies kid. He's got a
rhythm, a pulse and a BP.

546
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,548
That's not possible.

547
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,657
Tony put the pulse ox on his
finger. The kid grabbed his hand.

548
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,156
It's like a miracle, come on.

549
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,657
Hey. You're still here.

550
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,994
Well, I wanted to make
sure that she was okay.

551
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,002
And I got permission from her
parents to air what happened.

552
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,231
- Why?
- Are you kidding me?

553
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,866
If a male doctor pulled that off on
TV, he'd have his own syndication deal.

554
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,171
- Yeah, well...
- No, seriously, Kerry.

555
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,872
I mean, that was... That
was pretty incredible.

556
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,108
I'm still buzzing.

557
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,015
How do you come down
from something like that?

558
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,123
A glass of wine and a hot
bath at the end of the day help.

559
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,589
Mm. Sounds good to me.

560
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,054
All right.

561
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,531
Ketamine is at 2
per kilo per hour?

562
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,189
He's got spontaneous
eye opening.

563
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,632
That's a good sign, but we
need to deepen his coma.

564
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:20,637
Let's double up on the
midazolam drip. I'll check back later.

565
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,903
He's got goose bumps.

566
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,543
I'll go get a warming blanket.

567
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,444
He's putting up a fight.

568
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,549
Still has a long way to go.

569
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,652
Hope's right. It's a
miracle he's alive.

570
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,980
Maybe you are the
blue lady after all.

571
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,923
Well, if I was these kids, I'd
sure as hell wanna believe that.

572
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,219
If you believe in
something hard enough...

573
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,666
What?

574
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:54,438
Well, I've talked myself into things
that weren't true plenty of times.

575
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,909
What sort of things?

576
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,136
I don't know.

577
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:06,149
Like stuff about myself,
my job, people in my life.

578
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,754
Everything seems to be
a lot clearer now, though.

579
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,819
I have something to
do. I'll see you tomorrow?

580
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,930
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

581
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,998
Hey, you never told me
what your secret name was.

582
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,299
You're the one
that gave it to me.

583
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,808
Mayday?

584
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:33,673
Teller must have overheard you.

585
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,313
You never told me what it means.

586
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:47,358
She doesn't wanna press
charges, but the fact is he hit her.

587
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,620
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Just a minute.

588
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,286
- I need to get a statement from the wife.
- That's fine.

589
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,366
- I'm going to Ike's to get some dinner.
- Okay. I'll pick you up there.

590
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:58,234
Listen, before you do that...

591
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,737
there's something else I
need to ask you in private.

592
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,973
You okay, doc?

593
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,013
What is it?

594
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,387
It belongs to my son.
It was sent to me here.

595
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,047
See the initials?

596
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,751
C.A. Curtis Ames. He
was a patient of mine.

597
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,628
I think he's trying
to threaten us.

598
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,560
Maybe he just
wanted to return it.

599
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,834
Look, he followed my
wife and child to the park.

600
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,995
I'd like you to go talk to him.

601
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,409
Help me protect my family.

602
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,445
Okay.

603
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:45,742
Okay. Well, give him four more
ounces and I'll be back in a half hour.

604
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,645
All right, bye.

605
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,388
Cell phones.

606
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,926
- How did we ever survive without them?
- Sorry.

607
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,254
That was my babysitter.

608
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,096
Aren't you a little old
to need a babysitter?

609
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,394
For my baby.

610
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,037
Oh.

611
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,397
Well, aren't you a little
young to have one of those?

612
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,207
- Can I buy you a beer?
- No, thanks. I never touch the stuff.

613
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,480
So...

614
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,879
- A boy or a girl?
- Boy.

615
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,948
- Six months.
- Hmm.

616
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,623
- Ahh.
- Do you have kids?

617
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,260
- Five.
- Five.

618
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,927
Yeah. Boy and girl of my own...

619
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,194
and three stepdaughters.

620
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,231
- Do you live in Chicago?
- Texas.

621
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,430
- Texas?
- Yeah.

622
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,405
- You're a long way from home.
- Yeah.

623
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,238
What are you doing here?

624
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:47,969
Uh... Whew.

625
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:53,483
Well, I came up to see an old
buddy of mine in the hospital.

626
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:58,486
But I walked into the lobby, I
looked around, chickened out.

627
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,257
Why?

628
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,996
Well, you know, I buried a few
friends over the last couple years...

629
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,430
and hospitals make me queasy.

630
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,298
Yeah. Well, me too.

631
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,439
And I work in one.

632
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,638
You're a nurse, huh?

633
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,309
Mm. I used to be a
nurse, but now I'm a doctor.

634
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:23,980
- Really?
- Yeah.

635
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,676
- What's so funny?
- Oh, nothing.

636
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,514
Why are you laughing?

637
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,778
Uh... Heh.

638
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,685
It's just...

639
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:36,552
Well, the only
doctors I ever met...

640
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:41,028
were white-haired old guys with
glasses and necks like turkeys.

641
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,191
I guess I've got that
to look forward to.

642
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,639
- What do you do in Texas?
- Oil.

643
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,333
Tycoon?

644
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,403
Don't I wish.

645
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,877
No, I work the rigs. Machinist.

646
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,982
Ever seen an oil fire?

647
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:01,286
Seen one? Hell, I started one.

648
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,315
Can we have our chips please?

649
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,390
- What are you gonna eat in the movie?
- That's why we got the licorice.

650
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,827
- Think fast, horndog. Think fast.
- Oh.

651
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,159
- Good hands.
- Thanks.

652
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,702
- What do you think of this kid?
- Seems okay.

653
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,367
Polite, kind of quiet.

654
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,338
All the common
traits of a serial killer.

655
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,704
- Can't believe she's gonna be dating.
- Yeah.

656
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,610
Listen, Meg, there's been
something on my mind.

657
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,310
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

658
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:40,347
Yeah, I've been thinking
about moving forward.

659
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,591
I think Sarah's old
enough to accept it now.

660
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,033
In fact, I think it
would make her happy.

661
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,633
What would?

662
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,928
Us making this permanent.

663
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:57,107
- We've danced around it long enough.
- No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

664
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,711
Meg, I can't do this anymore.

665
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,713
Us living together, but
not really living together.

666
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,143
Sleeping with each
other when we need to.

667
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:11,553
It's too easy. It's
like a placeholder.

668
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,159
And I think it's stopping us
from moving on with our lives.

669
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,955
What are you talking
about? This is our lives.

670
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,599
I don't want it to be.

671
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:28,502
We fell into this, Meg. I care about
you and Sarah, but I have to do my thing.

672
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,403
What's her name?

673
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,108
Come on, Meg.

674
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:36,646
What? So you wanna screw some
other girl. It won't be the first time.

675
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,807
They never last.

676
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,150
It's more than that.

677
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:48,590
You think you can keep what
you want and leave the rest?

678
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,861
Be part of our lives, but not commit?
It doesn't work that way, Tony.

679
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:56,297
I've committed fully for a long
time, Meg, and you know that.

680
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,333
We love you.

681
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,902
And you love us.

682
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,841
I know you don't
wanna blow that.

683
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,805
You know Chicago winters
can be pretty tough on asthma.

684
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,646
- You should get a flu shot.
- Ah. I hate needles.

685
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,256
Just come by the ER, I'll do it
myself. I promise I'll be gentle.

686
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,482
- Hey.
- Hey.

687
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:57,022
Luka, this is...
- Eddie. ABBY: Eddie.

688
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:58,754
You the husband?

689
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,762
- We're not married.
- Ah. Gotcha.

690
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,026
- Are you ready to go?
- Yup.

691
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,262
Well, Eddie, it's
nice to meet you.

692
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,031
And remember, flu shot.

693
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,169
Thanks for the advice.

694
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,708
And the company.

695
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,608
- Hey, nice meeting you.
- You too.

696
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:35,033
- Wanna talk about what's bugging you?
- No.

697
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,761
No, you don't wanna talk about
it or no, nothing's bugging you?

698
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,701
Something was,
but I took care of it.

699
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,704
Nothing to worry about.

700
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:45,374
Okay.

701
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,063
Dr. Rasgotra?

702
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,264
Sorry, I must have nodded off.

703
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,977
- You've been working a lot, huh?
- It's becoming up to 30 hours now.

704
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,180
- Do you want me to get you something?
- Oh, no.

705
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,444
I'm fine, thanks.

706
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,115
How is he?

707
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:35,550
He needs to be in a
coma for two weeks...

708
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,590
until increased levels of rabies
antibodies appear in cerebrospinal fluid.

709
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:48,504
And then we'll wean him off sedation,
see if any neurologic function returns.

710
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:54,003
I prayed for him
in church today.

711
00:41:55,947 --> 00:42:01,215
I heard that his friends have a
whole story about demons and spirits.

712
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,885
Who are we to judge, right?

713
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,893
Everybody needs
something to believe in.

714
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,600
I will see you
tomorrow, Dr. Rasgotra.

715
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,031
Good night, Hope.
