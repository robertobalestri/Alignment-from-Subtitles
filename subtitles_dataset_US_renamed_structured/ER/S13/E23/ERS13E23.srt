00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,305
If you wanna stay
with me, you can.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,339
- What are you trying to do?
- Trying to wake you up.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,582
Doesn't anybody
here watch the news?

5
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,086
Homeland Security raised our
threat level to orange this morning.

6
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,350
- What does that mean?
- It's an election year.

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,324
It means there's a severe
risk of terrorist activity...

8
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,224
and the hospital
is on full alert.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,420
Here.

10
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,066
- What is that? FRANK:
Emergency protocols.

11
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,567
Biohazard preparedness
plan, evacuation procedures.

12
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,706
There's your basic
guide to the apocalypse.

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,841
Are we supposed to
do anything differently?

14
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,603
Keep ID handy, report
anything strange or suspicious.

15
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,905
Everything down here
is strange or suspicious.

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,048
Which reminds me,
the new warden is here.

17
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,843
Moretti?

18
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,612
- Oh, lucky you.
- Yeah, right.

19
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:57,224
I heard the ICU nurses used to
take vacation when he was on service.

20
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,415
Can you blame them?

21
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,585
The guy fired half the ICU
Attendings when he took over up there.

22
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,458
Hey, Dr. Moretti.

23
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,030
I wish we could all go.

24
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,229
It's probably better this way.

25
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,934
I'll get my father settled and be back
soon so we can go on that honeymoon.

26
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,305
- I don't need a honeymoon.
- I do.

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,811
Besides, I'd like
to meet your father.

28
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:24,247
And Joe wants to meet
his grandpa. Don't you, Joe?

29
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,646
Unless you don't want
me to meet your family...

30
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,552
because I'm hideously
ugly by Croatian standards.

31
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,255
I'll miss you both.

32
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,659
I already do.

33
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,127
Be good for your mom, okay?

34
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,828
- Bye.
- Bye.

35
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,595
I'll call you when I get there.

36
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,340
Or you could call
me from the airport.

37
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,344
Or when you land in
Frankfurt. Or from the plane.

38
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,114
Say bye to Daddy.

39
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,844
Bye.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,525
He's been sitting
there for 20 minutes.

41
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,358
It's a little creepy,
if you ask me.

42
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,863
The guy's a burnout. That's
why they sent him here.

43
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,366
The ER is the elephant
graveyard for doctors.

44
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,300
- You're an eternal ray of sunshine, Frank.
- Think about it.

45
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,771
Where did they send
Romano after he lost his arm?

46
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,001
Last year, it was
Clemente. Now it's this guy.

47
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,614
Dollars to doughnuts, we find him
hanging in an exam room by July.

48
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,774
- What are you doing here?
- What, you and Kovac split up already?

49
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,452
No, Luka's father got sick.
He had to fly back to Croatia.

50
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,184
- Hope he's not flying today.
- Why?

51
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,655
- Frank.
- What?

52
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,124
- What's going on?
- Need a doc here.

53
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,957
- Uh, what happened?
- Horsing around.

54
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,792
Put it through a
glass coffee table.

55
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,025
- He lost a lot of blood.
- All over my carpet.

56
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,330
Get him a room and clean him up.
- All right, keep this up.

57
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,636
Calder?

58
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,473
That's me.

59
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,584
- Ninety-eight over 56.
- Yeah, I always run a bit low.

60
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,520
Do paramedic
patients stop at Triage?

61
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,250
If they're ambulatory, they can.

62
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,727
What meds are you on?

63
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,990
Enalapril, Lipitor
and glyburide.

64
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,565
You diabetic?

65
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,066
Let's get your blood sugar.

66
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,171
How often is your
Glucometer QA'd?

67
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,774
Every morning at
7 by the day shift.

68
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,003
You ask a lot of questions
for somebody who's in charge.

69
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,510
Well, he's new.

70
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,013
Blood sugar is 128.

71
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,344
- It's been worse.
- It's not so bad.

72
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,180
Once we get you registered...

73
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,517
they'll make you a chart
and a doctor will see you.

74
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,524
- Is that you?
- Oh, no, no.

75
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,355
Not today.

76
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,088
I'm just a fly on the wall.

77
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,357
Ow! ABBY: Oh, sorry.

78
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,694
You're through the fascia
into the extensor muscles.

79
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,531
That one will need layered
closure. Any medical problems?

80
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,366
Yeah, I got a detached retina.

81
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,405
I had a run-in at the local bar.

82
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,202
I got a bad back,
service-related.

83
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,574
- You in the military?
- Army, we did a tour in Iraq together.

84
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,306
I decided to head to a peace
rally, pick up some chicks.

85
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,417
Were you three in combat?
- We were.

86
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,383
- Kyle here drove a desk.
- Hardly, man.

87
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,719
You can tell I'm the brains of this trio.
I was with Intelligence as a translator.

88
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,657
- He taught us how to swear in Arabic.
- Where'd you pick that up?

89
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,957
Some missionary work in Jordan
for two years after high school.

90
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,622
Heh, heh. He's our
"Stormin' Mormon."

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,792
Can you wiggle your fingers?

92
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,097
- Oh, it hurts. MORRIS:
Let's check the volar wounds.

93
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,570
Oh. ABBY: Whoa.

94
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,299
That would be
an arterial injury.

95
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,741
Okay, 4 milligrams
morphine. I'll be right back.

96
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,583
- I got one for you.
- No, thanks.

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,742
It'll be quick. Hand
through a glass table.

98
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,820
- Neurovascular?
- Maybe some tendon damage.

99
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,287
I got Moretti circling around
down here like a turkey vulture.

100
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,327
- Have you heard from Ray?
- He's taking some time off.

101
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,964
He won't return my calls.
I've tried even his parents.

102
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,429
He's not at his apartment.

103
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,366
Heard his band is back in town.
Maybe he's playing rock star again.

104
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,596
- All right, does it hurt when I press?
- No.

105
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,537
All right. How about, uh...?

106
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,676
- How about here?
- Ah, bingo.

107
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,335
It's bearable, though.

108
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,378
What's in your
chem panel, doctor?

109
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,380
Lytes, BUN, creatinine,
calcium, LFTs.

110
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,017
- These are liver-function tests.
- I thought you weren't working today.

111
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,783
Well, you make it very
hard to resist, Mrs. Calder.

112
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,019
You're cute, but he's a flirt.

113
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,122
- Are you ready to present?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,460
This is Dr. Lockhart.
She's my supervisor.

115
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:07,657
Hello.

116
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,063
- Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,137
Type II diabetic with
gastroenteritis and dehydration.

118
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,237
Afebrile, abdomen's benign, and
she's getting fluids and Compazine.

119
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,402
Try Reglan in case it's
gastroparesis and show me the labs.

120
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,138
Okay. ABBY: Nice to meet you.

121
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,977
Excuse me. We
haven't officially met yet.

122
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,381
I'm Kevin Moretti. I'll be
replacing your husband.

123
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,647
- Excuse me?
- No, as chief, only as chief.

124
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,723
Yeah. I'm Abby Lockhart.

125
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,985
Yes. You used to be a nurse.

126
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,650
Yes, I was.

127
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,263
That must give you an
interesting perspective.

128
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,830
Uh, I guess so. Yeah.

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,103
Being married to one of the Attendings
must prove very challenging at times.

130
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,501
Hey, Abby. Could use
some help over here.

131
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,166
We got Saltzman, 27, fell
off a roof with his brother.

132
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,335
Brother-in-law. I
landed right on his back.

133
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,676
I think I knocked the wind out of him.
- What were you doing?

134
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,115
Just putting up
a satellite dish.

135
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,617
How tall was the building?

136
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,853
What, like, two stories?

137
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,584
He refused to be boarded
and collared. He's all yours.

138
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,820
Come on, let's go. Exam 3.

139
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,127
Is, uh, he gonna wake up?

140
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,959
Let's just take
care of you first.

141
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,261
Okay. I need to talk to
him as soon as he does.

142
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,904
Can you give our soldier
guy another four of morphine?

143
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,016
- First dose didn't touch him.
- There was no first dose.

144
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,531
- He's addicted to codeine.
- What?

145
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,803
He's followed at the V.A. They
have to be notified of all ER visits.

146
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,277
His caseworker said he
has a no-narcotic contract.

147
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,382
We can't assess injury
without anesthesia.

148
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,280
What, you want him
backsliding back into addiction?

149
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,476
Do an axillary block.

150
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,145
A nerve block will control
the pain without narcotics.

151
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,451
I know. I was hoping to give our
Resident a chance to figure it out.

152
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,026
- You've done it before?
- Oh, yeah.

153
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,460
I mean, usually it's a
pain team kind of thing...

154
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,829
but it was just a couple
cc's of lido in the axilla, right?

155
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,469
Well, more like 40.

156
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,400
I'll walk you through it.

157
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,137
My husband was a lieutenant
stationed near Mosul.

158
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,402
What unit?

159
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,137
He was a doctor
with the 57th CSH.

160
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,372
He's out now?

161
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:07,179
No, uh, he was killed in country
a little over a year ago by an IED.

162
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,516
Sorry to hear that, ma'am.

163
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:12,949
So, what's the verdict?

164
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,425
There's a partial lac of
the flexor carpi ulnaris.

165
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,756
Needs a volar splint.

166
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,421
Good luck.

167
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,033
Thanks. Maybe I'll
see you at the rally.

168
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,766
Maybe.

169
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,101
And my arm still
hurts like hell, doc.

170
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,830
You gotta give me something.

171
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,338
I got a high tolerance for
pain meds because of my back.

172
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,944
Tolerance or addiction?

173
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,179
We talked to the V.A.

174
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,010
They told us
about your contract.

175
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,446
So, what, they said
I was an addict?

176
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,113
That's crap, man. Look, I was
at Walter Reed for six weeks.

177
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,021
I was supposed to go get
physical therapy, see a pain guy.

178
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,957
But they're so busy
with amputees...

179
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,156
and guys worse off than me
that the wait was like four months.

180
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,131
Got discharged before I
even got an appointment.

181
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,802
- Hey, Neela.
- Hey.

182
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,373
I'm just on my way home.
It's been a long night.

183
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,410
Yeah, well, no one ever told
you to become a surgeon, right?

184
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,308
Well, actually, yes, they did.

185
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,745
A number of people.

186
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,351
Listen, this whole thing is weird
to me. I don't know how to do this.

187
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,647
What? Break up?

188
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,189
Yeah, you know, I know it's
probably over and I deserve it...

189
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,827
but I just wondered if
we could still be friends...

190
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,429
if I could maybe call you
later and we could talk.

191
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,327
Well, I might go to this
rally. Kind of feel like I should.

192
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,334
Gates.

193
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,403
- Mr. Pollard stopped breathing.
- Ah, he's just holding his breath.

194
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,269
- He does that for attention.
- He's been holding his breath 10 minutes.

195
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,710
- I'll try to get ahold of you tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

196
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,794
Okay. Can you
wiggle your fingers?

197
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,004
Hey, Dawn, can I get some bacitracin
and some sterile gauze, please?

198
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,572
Take it easy, sir.

199
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,505
Well, it looks like your
brother-in-law is waking up.

200
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:11,736
Can I talk to him now?

201
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,745
- What the hell?
- Just relax, you're in County Hospital.

202
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,679
You had a little fall, but
you're doing okay now.

203
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,385
- Yeah, I just need a minute with him.
- Go ahead.

204
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,953
In private.

205
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,257
All right, make it
quick. I'll be right back.

206
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,460
- Hey.
- Hey, hey! What's he doing here?

207
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,690
Oh, oh, no. I can explain.

208
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,801
- No, somebody call the cops.
- No, this is not what you think.

209
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,202
Your brother-in-law accidentally landed
on you when you two fell off the roof.

210
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,704
What roof?

211
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,171
He's not my brother-in-law.

212
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,336
He's got a woman tied up in his
apartment. I heard her screaming.

213
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,537
- No, I can explain.
- No!

214
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,876
- He beat me up.
- Explain it to the cops.

215
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,144
Abby, that lady you and Gates
worked? Gave her 2 liters of saline.

216
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,515
- Her pressure's down to 90/65.
- Oh, crap.

217
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,850
Well? I'm listening.

218
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,448
Okay.

219
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,959
Are you familiar with RACK?

220
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,189
Risk-Aware Consensual Kink?

221
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,728
No.

222
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,936
I really need
something for the pain.

223
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,204
We gave you a nerve block.
It should've kicked in by now.

224
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,813
Well, it didn't.
It's killing me.

225
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,042
Know why they named the largest military
hospital in the world after Walter Reed?

226
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,242
No.

227
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,911
Yellow fever was wiping out the troops
during the Spanish-American War...

228
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,320
and Walter Reed was
the one who discovered...

229
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,054
that the disease was being
transmitted by mosquitoes.

230
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:41,258
And he greatly reduced infection
with aggressive insect control.

231
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,596
Of course, everybody ended up
dying of cancer from the pesticides...

232
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,764
but it was a valiant effort.

233
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,499
Excuse us. Can I talk to
you for a second, Morris?

234
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,081
Maybe the injection
didn't get into the sheath.

235
00:11:56,249 --> 00:12:00,016
I drew blood from his hand with
a needle. He didn't even flinch.

236
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,586
- Well, he's a soldier.
- No.

237
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,382
He's lying. He
can't feel his arm.

238
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,355
- No problem with the nerve block.
- Think he's faking?

239
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,791
I think he's either
drug-seeking or he has issues.

240
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,458
- I'll call Psych.
- No, no, no. Not here.

241
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,795
At the V.A. They have better
continuity of care and a good support...

242
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,870
It could be months before he gets an
appointment there. They're overwhelmed.

243
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,372
Then do a hospital-to-hospital
transfer. They'll have to take him today.

244
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,808
Belly's still benign. Could
be an occult infection.

245
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,039
An infection? But I feel so much
better, even my nausea is gone.

246
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,480
With diabetes, there can
often be nerve damage...

247
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:35,315
so you can develop an abdominal
condition without feeling any symptoms.

248
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,547
- She's septic?
- No fever, no white count.

249
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,317
You can't always count on those.

250
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,495
Let's get two sets of blood
cultures, 3.375 of Zosyn...

251
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:46,064
start dopamine at 5 mics,
CT with IV and oral contrast.

252
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,894
- Got it.
- More tests?

253
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,831
Kevin...

254
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,674
Um, you're a bit of a mystery, but
we're gonna figure out what's going on.

255
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:58,573
I came here to get medicine to stop
the vomiting. Been here for six hours.

256
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,681
We can't risk sending you
home with a serious condition.

257
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,909
Oh, it's not serious. Do
you think it could be serious?

258
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,653
Well, I've seen a lot of doctors in here,
but if you think it could be serious...

259
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,190
You're the touchstone, Kevin.

260
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:16,955
Okay.

261
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,191
We're gonna get started on these
right away for you, Mrs. Calder.

262
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,962
You're on top of this, doctor.

263
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,866
Touchstone?
What's that all about?

264
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,041
It's a black, siliceous mineral
used to test the purity of gold.

265
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,039
- The miners used to take...
- Yes, I know.

266
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,269
Then you should take
it as a compliment.

267
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,778
- You might turn out to be gold.
- Fool's gold.

268
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,610
Yeah, pyrite. But only an
expert can tell the difference.

269
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,879
- Who's your boyfriend?
- Um, his name is Paxton.

270
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,886
He came in with his
brother-in-law, I think.

271
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,287
And his name is?

272
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,987
- You know what? I got this, Frank.
- Okay.

273
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,462
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

274
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,794
Hillary Milbauer. So
you saw my boyfriend?

275
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:59,098
I did. And you're the
woman that was tied up?

276
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,904
And gagged and screaming?

277
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,668
That's me.

278
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,176
All right. Okay.

279
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,713
I told you I was just
trying to defend myself.

280
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,474
Then why didn't
you call the cops?

281
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,544
I'm not supposed to run a
business out of my apartment.

282
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,418
- That's her. That's his victim.
- That is my girlfriend.

283
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,990
- Abby, what's going on?
- This is Hillary Milbauer.

284
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,822
These two operate an adult
website out of their apartment.

285
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,055
I already got that part
from Scorsese here.

286
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,995
He broke in and attacked us.

287
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,226
You were screaming. I
was trying to save you.

288
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,426
It's just an act.

289
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,764
It's like erotic
performance art.

290
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,343
Is it possible you misinterpreted
the situation, Mr. Saltzman?

291
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,605
I know what I saw. What he
was doing to her was unnatural.

292
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,045
Unsanitary.

293
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,553
It's still throbbing. You gotta
give me something for the pain.

294
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,589
We're transferring you to the
V.A. Someone there will see you.

295
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,886
I recommend you
speak with a psychiatrist.

296
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,689
You think this is all in my
head? Is that what you think?

297
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,274
I can't get a finger out without
tearing it apart, can you help me?

298
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,857
Yeah. I'll be right back.

299
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,968
Why am I being
punished? It's real, okay?

300
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,298
- My pain's real!
- Vivian loads her own shotgun shells.

301
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,965
My father taught me years ago.
He used to pay me a penny a shell.

302
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,874
- Now I sell custom loads on the Internet.
- I love this country.

303
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,312
- It's wedged in there, right?
- We gotta get the skin out of the spring.

304
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,544
I'm trying to open it. I'm
trying to get the... Look.

305
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,656
Kyle? Kyle? Kyle?

306
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:27,260
Hang on. Kyle, you
need to stay in bed.

307
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,386
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

308
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,395
Kyle. Kyle.

309
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,999
Open the door.

310
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,998
- Can you open it?
- He took my swipe card.

311
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,636
Find another one. Security!

312
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,670
Kyle, Kyle, don't do
this. Come on, man.

313
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,519
- Come on. Stop. KYLE:
Leave me alone, man.

314
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,786
- Kyle, open this door.
- Hey, open the door.

315
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,507
We'll get you something
for the pain. Come on, don't!

316
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,011
- Security!
- Kyle, stop. Please.

317
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,740
Come on, Kyle. Stop!

318
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,208
Sam! Where the hell's that key?

319
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:58,810
Move away from the door.

320
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,715
Nobody knows more
than me about pain.

321
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,498
Move away from the door. - Kyle!

322
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,548
Move, move, come on.
- Watch your head.

323
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,319
Come on, spit it out, spit it out.
- What did he take?

324
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,733
You name it, he took it.

325
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,420
Set up to lavage. Let's go.

326
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,031
No. No! No!

327
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,258
Kyle, Kyle.

328
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,561
Calm down.

329
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,365
- Monitor, Foley, start a line.
- What labs do you want?

330
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,770
Acetaminophen and aspirin levels.
- Don't, please.

331
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:25,434
No, there's no point sending that
now. We'll get a four-hour level.

332
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,444
Foley, alkanalize his urine
and let's put in an Ewald tube.

333
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,447
That's the plan. Just mixing
up nebulized lido for the OG.

334
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,415
No. There's no time for that.

335
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,578
You gonna place an
Ewald without anesthesia?

336
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,523
- The thing is like a garden hose.
- I don't know anything!

337
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,456
- Hard restraints, please.
- Come on.

338
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,223
- Lidocaine neb takes five minutes.
- Yeah, 12 percent of gastric transit time.

339
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,775
Do you want him to get
12 percent poisoned?

340
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,133
Twelve percent of the arrhythmia
and the liver failure? I don't think so.

341
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:53,034
Not when we have time to
get the junk out of his stomach.

342
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,571
Okay, okay, okay. KYLE: No.

343
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,800
Okay, okay. KYLE: No, get off!

344
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,687
- Okay. Okay.
- Get away from me!

345
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,374
- Okay, it's okay.
- Sir, please, we're trying to help you.

346
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,917
Could you put a little muscle
into it, please? All right.

347
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,451
Okay. All right.

348
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,722
Come on, screw the V.A. This
guy needs fentanyl and Versed.

349
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:15,487
Nope. The risk of aspiration is too high
when you try to sedate during lavage.

350
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,721
- Okay.
- We'll intubate, protect his airway.

351
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,957
No, the risk is too
high. It's not worth it.

352
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,226
GI bleeder just
puked a liter of blood.

353
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,269
Okay, put the tube
in and lavage...

354
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,307
until all the pill fragments come
out and until that fluid runs clear.

355
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,069
Please, please, please.

356
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,973
Please.

357
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,352
They tried to save my legs.

358
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,618
But the...

359
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,859
The crush injuries
were too severe.

360
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,491
But it could be a lot worse,
you know? I could be dead.

361
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,637
They're gonna fit
me for prosthetics...

362
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,041
as soon as the flaps heal.

363
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,447
So I guess, in the meantime, I
can pimp out my wheelchair...

364
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,616
maybe put some
flames down the side.

365
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,456
- Ray.
- I'm gonna have a new set of legs.

366
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,564
A cool van.

367
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,065
- Hey, I can park in the good spaces now.
- Ray, stop.

368
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,665
Uh, do you want
something to drink?

369
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,362
I'm gonna get a coffee.

370
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,837
No, thanks.

371
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,306
I'll call your parents,
see if I can get an ETA.

372
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,280
That's great.

373
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,824
Is there anything I can do?

374
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,556
No.

375
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,230
Would you like me to
tell anyone at County?

376
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,834
No.

377
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,428
I really don't want
you to do anything.

378
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,203
You know, I was so worried
about you. I even went to our...

379
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,114
Your apartment.

380
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,222
Well, it's up for a lease if
you wanna move back in.

381
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,428
No ramps.

382
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,768
You know, the night this...

383
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,274
After you left the wedding...

384
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,645
I tried calling you...

385
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,942
because I wanted
to talk. I was hoping...

386
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,847
I know. I know.

387
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,489
I was checking the
message when I got hit.

388
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,794
So I know.

389
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,802
How much bicarb is he getting?

390
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:15,840
Two amps per liter is
quarter normal at 200 per hour.

391
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,500
Okay. Check his urine pH.

392
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,613
I don't get it. What's
going on with this guy?

393
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,478
- Looks like textbook PTSD to me.
- He never saw combat.

394
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,279
- His buddies said. He was an interpreter.
- He saw plenty.

395
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,252
Who do you think translates
during those interrogations?

396
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,955
I seem to have misplaced...

397
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,994
Hello, what's this?

398
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,153
Uh, we had to intubate.

399
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,929
I thought I specifically
told you not to.

400
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,166
Maybe I was using my inner
voice again. That's a bad habit.

401
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,772
He was just losing his gag
reflex. He became hypoxic.

402
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,674
I don't see anything
about hypoxia here.

403
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,142
Well, it was, you know, hectic.

404
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,042
I haven't had a chance
to update the chart.

405
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,814
Do you have any pill fragments?

406
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,849
Yeah. We, uh, did.

407
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,147
Got this.

408
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,356
Not enough.

409
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,222
Gates.

410
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,656
It's Sarah. She
doesn't sound good.

411
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,497
Move away from that,
please. Can I see that?

412
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,897
- Toxic bradycardia.
- We're on it.

413
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,127
Yeah? Are you?

414
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,703
Really? On it?

415
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,670
Because one might argue
that you are in fact underneath it.

416
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,072
If you hadn't dicked
around with the intubation...

417
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,236
you wouldn't be digging your
way out of an overdose right now.

418
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,648
Let me know when
you learn to roll over.

419
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,587
Parents coming to take you home?

420
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,091
My mom's been
here for a few days.

421
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,836
I've never been to Baton Rouge.

422
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,106
Maybe I could come visit you.

423
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,273
Don't.

424
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,746
What?

425
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:06,242
Just don't tell me you're going to
do something when I know you won't.

426
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,183
Why don't you think I
would come visit you?

427
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,789
Because that's what
our relationship is, Neela.

428
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:19,292
You give me hope and
I, like a fool, believe you.

429
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,694
- Ray, that's not true.
- It is true.

430
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,628
I've waited for you.

431
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,066
I trusted you.

432
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,573
I fought for you.

433
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,379
And I even fell
in love with you.

434
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:40,151
But for what? So you could
just keep running back to Gates.

435
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,811
No, I'm not. That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

436
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,513
It's over.

437
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,423
Tony and I are done.

438
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,789
Well, it doesn't really
matter now, does it?

439
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,007
<i>Baby, don't stop.</i>

440
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,927
<i>Oh, yeah. You
like that, don't you?</i>

441
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,011
<i>Am I a bad girl? Do
you wanna spank me?</i>

442
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,486
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna spank
you, bad girl. Oh, yeah.</i>

443
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,717
- What's going on in here?
- I told you it was too loud. Come here.

444
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,733
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
- What are you guys watching?

445
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,127
Oh, it's a website hosted
by a couple of our patients.

446
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,325
- Does that look consensual to you?
- Oh, yeah, that's sensual.

447
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,833
Consensual.

448
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,335
What, did you fail anatomy?

449
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,269
You cannot do that with your
body unless you really want to.

450
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,342
Is that woman in this hospital?
- Abby.

451
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,808
Mrs. Calder, her pressure
dropped to 65 systolic.

452
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,847
- I gave orders for dopamine an hour ago.
- She maxed out at 20 mics.

453
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,711
- She's hypotensive?
- That's impossible.

454
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,688
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

455
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,556
<i>Don't stop, baby.</i> PAXTON:
<i>Yeah, you like that, don't you?</i>

456
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,721
<i>How do you like that?
Is that what you want?</i>

457
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,957
<i>Oh, yeah, baby.
That's good. Don't stop.</i>

458
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,653
<i>Yeah. You like that, don't you?</i>

459
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,565
<i>Am I a bad girl? You
wanna spank me?</i>

460
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:05,864
You are a very bad girl.

461
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,038
And I would love to spank you.
- <i>Spank you.</i>

462
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,802
<i>Oh, yeah, girl.</i> HILARY: <i>Yes!</i>

463
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,569
Hi, Dr. Morris. I didn't
mean to startle you.

464
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:17,649
No, you didn't. I was
looking up something medical.

465
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,922
What's going on?

466
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,028
Sorry I called you at work. I
didn't know what else to do.

467
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,994
- It's okay. Where are your grandparents?
- They're inside.

468
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,895
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Tony.

469
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,091
What's going on?

470
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,863
We're taking Sarah this
weekend, remember?

471
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,564
Yeah. So, what's
with all the boxes?

472
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:47,571
Helen and I think it would be best for
Sarah to spend the summer with us.

473
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,080
That's what you think? Shouldn't
that be something we should talk about?

474
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,587
- I never said I wanted to go.
- Sarah, you love staying with us, huh?

475
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,384
This isn't helping. We're
trying to make it easy for her.

476
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,288
Oh, you think this is easy?
- Jim?

477
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,224
It's okay.

478
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,297
- She doesn't want to go.
- We appreciate everything...

479
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,900
- Let me handle this, Helen, okay?
- You know what? No.

480
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,936
- She's not going with you this weekend.
- Yes, Tony, she is.

481
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,265
You can't make me.

482
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,463
What's this?

483
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,609
It's an emergency
court order for custody.

484
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,472
We heard you hired a lawyer.

485
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,316
I'm calling the police.

486
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,111
All right, let's
mix up Levophed.

487
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,778
Radiology is reading the CT right
now. Why don't you run in another liter?

488
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,150
Is she bleeding?

489
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,315
Repeat crit is 38, stable.

490
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,012
- Could it be anaphylaxis?
- No, no new foods or drugs.

491
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,195
- She doesn't have any skin lesions.
- Let's do early goal-directed therapy.

492
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,393
She needs a central line
with an O2 sat monitor.

493
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,935
Is there anything else
that we can be doing?

494
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,731
- Dr. Moretti?
- I'll be right back.

495
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,465
We could use some help in here.

496
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,111
Man, that guy's a real weirdo.

497
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,973
- Levophed is up.
- Okay, thanks a lot.

498
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,411
No intra-abdominal pathology
whatsoever on the CT.

499
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,448
What? No abscess? - Nope.

500
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,108
- Diverticulitis?
- Nothing.

501
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,805
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

502
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,913
Maybe it's an infection from
another source? Urine? CSF?

503
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,685
Pressure's not moving, sats
are dropping. Wanna intubate?

504
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,319
Yeah, I'll tube her. Abby, you
do the central line, come on.

505
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,796
Hey, Mrs. Calder?
Hang in there, okay?

506
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,086
One percent lidocaine.

507
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,601
- Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.
- I'd wait on that...

508
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,295
Let's get the suction on high.
Somebody check the cuff.

509
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,506
Pressure is up to 110/70.

510
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,213
Oh.

511
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,684
- Am I dying?
- Not anymore.

512
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,683
What'd you give her? Epi?

513
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,882
No. Please. That
would be too easy.

514
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,994
- What did you inject?
- You tell me.

515
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,034
Mr. and Mrs. Riley have
legal custody of the girl.

516
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,039
I've raised her since she was this
big. She's practically my own kid.

517
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,734
Technically, she's not,
and they are the next of kin.

518
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,312
She doesn't wanna go. Go
ask her if she wants to go.

519
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,846
She doesn't have a choice.

520
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,474
You know what? Let's just settle
down. We'll handle this like adults.

521
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,679
- Hold on.
- Hey, this is getting way out of hand.

522
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,585
Settle down, sir.

523
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:16,157
- So you're just gonna let them take her?
- Get yourself a lawyer.

524
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,593
- Try to work something out.
- I have a lawyer.

525
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,834
Can I at least go
say goodbye to her?

526
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,368
- Please?
- Yeah.

527
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,093
Look, it's gonna be
okay. It's gonna be okay.

528
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,752
Don't let them do this.

529
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,797
It's okay, all right?
I'll make sure it's okay.

530
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,435
It's not gonna be for
that long. You'll have fun.

531
00:28:56,602 --> 00:29:00,369
- You'll ride horses. That will be good.
- I don't care about the stupid horses.

532
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,700
I don't wanna go.

533
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,308
I'll come visit you this
weekend, I promise.

534
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,911
This is not permanent. Okay?

535
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,742
Look at me. Look at me.

536
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,585
I love you. I love you more
than anything in this entire world.

537
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,085
Right? Right?

538
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,417
Okay. So I need you
to be strong for me.

539
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:22,655
I need you to go with your grandparents,
but you have to trust me, okay?

540
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,626
All right. And it's not gonna
be for a long time, I promise.

541
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,288
I promise you.

542
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,063
I love you, baby girl.

543
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:43,008
Did you figure it
out yet, Pratt? Huh?

544
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,013
What I gave to Mrs. Calder?

545
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,947
Come on. Think, think, think.

546
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,450
Where is that intern?

547
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,681
The one with the temper problem?
The one who started all this?

548
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,689
What, you mean
Gates? He had to go.

549
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,522
- Go?
- Yeah. Family emergency.

550
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,925
Well, he caused
an emergency here.

551
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,193
He was the primary caregiver and
he dropped the ball from the get-go.

552
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,700
Come on. It was a tough call.

553
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,600
There's enough
blame to go around.

554
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,536
Backing up your
interns? That's good.

555
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,733
Shows maturity which,
based on your record...

556
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,378
I didn't think you were
capable of. Bravo, Pratt.

557
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,036
- Thanks.
- Yup.

558
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,377
There is plenty to go around, all
the way up to the Attending level.

559
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,212
That's why I called
a staff meeting.

560
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,945
It wasn't perfect, but she's
okay. She got good care.

561
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,388
The hell she did.

562
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,720
Let me ask you something. I
mean, what's going on with you?

563
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,899
I mean, you stand around here all
day like some strange peeping Tom...

564
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,231
now all of a sudden,
you're king of the ER.

565
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,997
This is our department, Moretti.

566
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:44,267
I don't care how long you've been
a doctor, you haven't been here.

567
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,503
You haven't
worked with all of us.

568
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:50,615
Gee, I am so sorry that I skipped
my daily dose of testosterone.

569
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,417
We do the best we can
with limited resources.

570
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,913
No. You know, see,
that's where you're wrong.

571
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,251
It is not the resources
that are limited.

572
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,223
It is the minds of the
people working on the floor.

573
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,093
Hydrocortisone.

574
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,430
That's what you gave her.

575
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,767
I would've gotten there if you'd
given me another minute or so.

576
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,113
Neela.

577
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,354
This is Jacy, Ray's mom.

578
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,291
Oh, hello. I'm so sorry.

579
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,295
No. I've heard a lot about you.

580
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,566
Ray and I are good friends.

581
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,899
He said you were the
best roommate he ever had.

582
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,572
Oh, well, that's because I
did all his laundry for him.

583
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:54,009
I used to think sometimes that
was the only reason he came home.

584
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:03,051
I'm gonna take him home now.

585
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,017
I'm gonna...

586
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,223
I'm gonna get him better.

587
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,336
You'll get through
this. I promise.

588
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,843
Thank you, Katey.

589
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,508
You've been wonderful.

590
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,854
You come on down to Baton
Rouge whenever you can get away.

591
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,752
You know I will, ma'am.

592
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,519
Okay.

593
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,962
You're a good person, Katey.

594
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,935
You shut up. Shut up.

595
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,872
- Well, I know you're upset...
- You did this, you selfish bitch.

596
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,978
Nobody else, okay? You did.

597
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,273
So you live with that.

598
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,227
Okay, you're gonna be
a little hoarse for a while.

599
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,453
Yeah.

600
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,063
This is gonna help you
breathe a little easier.

601
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,972
You wanna tell me
why you did this?

602
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,807
Kyle, obviously you're
hurting, man. Let me help you.

603
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,612
You were...

604
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,754
You were shouting in Arabic
when we were trying to help you.

605
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,517
Something about: "Med"...

606
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,828
What does that mean?

607
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,467
"Please don't hurt me.
I've done nothing wrong.

608
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,168
God have mercy."

609
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,142
I must have translated it a
million times in Iraq, man.

610
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,440
Not that it mattered.

611
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,948
They didn't listen to me any more
than they listened to the prisoners.

612
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,186
Who didn't listen to you?

613
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,181
The interrogators.

614
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,959
The interrogators, they...

615
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,929
You saw them beat the prisoners?

616
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:32,662
Beat, burn, other things.

617
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,801
What, you mean torture?

618
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,640
Most of the men they questioned
didn't even know anything.

619
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,742
They were innocent.

620
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,549
I tried to convince the interrogators,
but they didn't believe me.

621
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,082
So they just kept hurting them.

622
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,590
And I just kept
translating their cries.

623
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:57,821
It's not your fault.

624
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,329
We're gonna get you some help.

625
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,859
I don't wanna go
back to the V.A., man.

626
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,663
You're not.

627
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,499
Not right now.

628
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,198
You're gonna stay with
us for a while, okay?

629
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,866
Okay.

630
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,450
NEELA: <i>Hi, it's Neela.</i>

631
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,284
<i>I'm not in, but leave a
message after the tone.</i>

632
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,103
Forgot about this thing.
It might take a while.

633
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,841
Uh, I'll get out here.

634
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,241
What do you see?

635
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,790
I see faces of
every different color.

636
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,360
Men and women, young and old.

637
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,062
We love our country.

638
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,797
We might have gotten
here in different ways...

639
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:27,378
through a family member or a
loved one, through serving in Iraq...

640
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,811
through an evolving sense
not only of right and wrong...

641
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,146
but also the division
between what is justified...

642
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,413
and what can never be explained.

643
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,714
Peace now!

644
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,921
Let's begin at the beginning.

645
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,622
Triage.

646
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:53,002
Three-hour wait for vitals,
eight-to 12-hour wait for a bed.

647
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,538
Well, we push them
through as fast as we can.

648
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,238
We almost pushed Esther
Calder 6 feet under...

649
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,174
but a combination of
blind faith, dumb luck...

650
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:04,874
her resilience and
my attention to detail...

651
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,213
thwarted all the attempts
that we made to kill her.

652
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,946
I triaged her. She
did not wait very long.

653
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,752
She waited two hours
with intense nausea.

654
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,919
Then, after that, another two
hours before she got back to a bed.

655
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:21,396
And then, after that, another
hour before a doctor saw her.

656
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,899
What's that? Like, five
hours? That's not so bad.

657
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,738
It can be better.
It will be better.

658
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:31,769
What if the triage nurse
had standing orders for labs...

659
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,139
IV fluids and antiemetics...

660
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,610
with a patient like this?

661
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,804
What would happen?

662
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,883
The very charming Mrs. Calder
would be brought right back.

663
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,610
She would get relief.

664
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,880
She would be
registered at her bedside.

665
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,149
We would knock four
hours off her stay time...

666
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,226
and we would be on top of her
problems before she crashed.

667
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:51,056
That is a wonderful theory.

668
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:56,329
- You're taking this personally, Sam.
- Yeah. I'm a nurse, I do triage.

669
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,130
I take it personally when
you criticize the job I'm doing.

670
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,966
Good. Okay.

671
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,404
Good. I'd worry
about you if you didn't.

672
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,067
Now the interns.

673
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,772
The peripatetic Dr. Gates...

674
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,580
did an inadequate history.

675
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,185
He ordered tests without
consulting an Attending.

676
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,584
It was busy. That's not unusual.

677
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:21,157
Again, you're arguing that
incompetence and sloppiness are the norm.

678
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:22,794
And that's no way to impress me.

679
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,852
The Resident...

680
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,429
Abby, right?

681
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,932
You assumed that Gates
had done a thorough H & P...

682
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,593
- and he had not.
- It looked like gastroenteritis.

683
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,329
Based on the incomplete H & P...

684
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,940
which he took and you
accepted at face value.

685
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,202
Your intern led you
down the primrose path.

686
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,608
You sold that to the
Attending, Dr. Pratt...

687
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:46,114
and then the three of you
blithely walked Mrs. Calder...

688
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,877
along with you to death's door.

689
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,384
Oh, come on.

690
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,955
Sepsis was a viable diagnosis.

691
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,115
Viable? PRATT: Yeah.

692
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,783
Viable?

693
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:01,333
Nobody took a decent history!

694
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:08,972
Fact: 80 percent of all diagnoses can
be made on the basis of history alone.

695
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,307
But nobody bothered
to talk to the patient.

696
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,208
You knew what meds she
was on now, the easy part.

697
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,246
But what meds was
she on a month ago?

698
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,977
One month ago, she did a two-week
course of high-dose prednisone...

699
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,178
for URI-associated bronchospasm.

700
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,380
The steroids suppressed
her adrenal glands.

701
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:29,550
- She had adrenal insufficiency.
- Fine, but that's a pretty rare condition.

702
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,093
We don't see it that often.

703
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,697
No, you see it. You
just don't recognize it.

704
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,232
We get the point. You
want us to be more careful.

705
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,601
That's a very reductive
version of what I want.

706
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,739
What I want is for us
to live in mortal fear...

707
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,705
of doing something wrong,
of missing something...

708
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,402
and having somebody
else pay the price for that.

709
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,379
And I want us
to use that fear...

710
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,450
to make us better.

711
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:57,014
I am not here because
I need the work.

712
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,020
I'm here because I
wanna save the world.

713
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,628
The way we're gonna do it is to reinvent
the way we practice medicine every day.

714
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,525
Right now, right
here, on the front.

715
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,694
I have another
shift to start, so go.

716
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,307
I've worked here
for a long time.

717
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:31,081
And you might think that this is the
way to motivate people, but it's not.

718
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,590
Thank you for your input.

719
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,562
- Listen, all I'm saying is you...
- I know. I said thank you.

720
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,563
All of you are gonna have to take time
to get used to my management style.

721
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,978
And you are going
to have to take time...

722
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:56,581
to get used to working with a
chief that you're not sleeping with.

723
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,668
WOMAN: It's not political.

724
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,594
It's not about
Republican or Democrat.

725
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:14,199
It's about young
lives lost every day.

726
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,028
Every day.

727
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,534
And knowing when to say
we've done what we could...

728
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,367
and maybe it's time
for us to go home.

729
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,102
Let those people sort
this out for themselves.

730
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,542
That's what my brother
came to think eventually.

731
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,807
- Finish the job!
- Shut up! Let her talk!

732
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,880
And seeing what was going on,
and seeing what the results were...

733
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,146
Get off the stage!

734
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,052
Unfortunately, the letter in which
he expressed that was written...

735
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,715
Neela.

736
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,331
Let's go. Get out of here.

737
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,523
Hurry up.

738
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,008
Get out of the way!

739
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:55,965
Neela!

740
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,869
- Get out of the way!
- Neela!

741
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,946
Neela!
