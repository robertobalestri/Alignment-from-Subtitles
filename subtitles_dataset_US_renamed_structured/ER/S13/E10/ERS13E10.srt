1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,937
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,250
There is no settlement.

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:10,802
We agreed to the meeting as a show of
good faith in case we went back to trial.

4
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:16,176
See the initials? C.A. Curtis Ames.
I think he's trying to threaten us.

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,228
You wanna talk about what's bugging you?
- No.

6
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:21,154
I thought I'd be reporting
on topical medical issues...

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,485
not doing puff pieces on
BOTOX and unsanitary manicures.

8
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,384
Luka, this is...
Eddie. ABBY: Eddie.

9
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,596
- You the husband?
- Oh, my God.

10
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,629
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.

11
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:34,462
Hey, Greg.

12
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:36,632
Can a straight guy go
through a gay phase?

13
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,295
I think it's more
likely that he's gay.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,680
Just what I like to see.

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,342
A brother taking his education
seriously. What you got?

16
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,851
Art History final today.

17
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,149
- We pulled an all-nighter.
- We?

18
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,384
Chaz, do you have an extra
toothbrush I can borrow?

19
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,021
Oh, hi. I'm Nicole.

20
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,960
- This is my brother, Greg.
- Morning.

21
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,694
Nic's my study partner.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,533
- She lives on campus, it got late so...
- Yeah.

23
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:16,370
- I hope we didn't make too much noise.
- No, I didn't hear a thing.

24
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,512
Tongue stuck in bowling
ball, waiting on a drill...

25
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,650
bedbug couple, 1
percent hydrocortisone.

26
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,217
Need an exterminator
too. Those critters are nasty.

27
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,877
Sleep-eater guy wants a
prescription for a padlock.

28
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,047
- For his refrigerator.
- Hey, Ray.

29
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,317
Three's ready for transfer.
How do we do that?

30
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,688
- What about belly pain in 2?
- Bowel obstruction.

31
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,387
You need to fill out a
transfer packet, um...

32
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:41,092
to document the reason for
transfer, and consent for transfer...

33
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,031
and stability for transfer.

34
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,401
If you don't do this, then it's an
EMTALA violation and a big fine.

35
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,600
- All right. Got it.
- So, uh...

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,335
We're okay, right?

37
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,571
Yeah. These look
pretty self-explanatory.

38
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,012
I mean, about keeping
you and me under wraps.

39
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,051
It gets out that we're dating, it
could get weird around here for you.

40
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,051
Oh. For me?

41
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,417
You two make such a cute couple.

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,923
- What? Her and me?
- No, we're not...

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,029
- What should I do...?
- Sorry, you gotta talk to Morris.

44
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,255
I'm due at the station.

45
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,264
- You must be excited about tonight.
- Tonight? What's tonight?

46
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,732
Dr. Weaver's special report
on the Channel 5 news.

47
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,731
Hey, everybody.
This is Ben Parker.

48
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,101
He's a new RN, all the
way in from Savannah.

49
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,606
- Hi, Ben.
- Hello. Hi.

50
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,108
It's nice to meet y'all.

51
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,768
We got ourselves a Southern boy.

52
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,778
- Yeah, a real Georgia peach.
- Hey.

53
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,940
It's his first shift,
let's not scare him.

54
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,149
We need him to
come back tomorrow.

55
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,881
Twenty says Gentle
Ben doesn't last the week.

56
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:39,959
- No, I give him five days.
- Three, and make it 40.

57
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,151
What's up, man?

58
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,559
- Hey, Kerry. You on today?
- Not anymore.

59
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,560
All right. What
am I walking into?

60
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,328
We got slammed at midnight,
but we're under control now.

61
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,337
Good. Hey, hey.

62
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,407
I wanted to say
thanks for the advice...

63
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,009
but I'm happy to let you
know you got it wrong.

64
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,406
- Advice?
- Yeah.

65
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,138
As it turns out, not everyone
who experiments is gay.

66
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,646
Excuse me?

67
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,251
I'm talking about
my brother, Chaz.

68
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,479
It was like he said,
it's just a phase.

69
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,986
- Is that so?
- Yup.

70
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,758
Hey, you remember
that girl he took home?

71
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:16,659
- Mm-hm.
- Well, she spent the night.

72
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,321
My brother's straight.

73
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,462
Gee, Greg, you must be so proud.

74
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,998
What...? No, that's
not what I meant.

75
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,606
What I meant was, uh...

76
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,639
Uh, you know what I meant.

77
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,481
Yeah. And you're not
my only black friend.

78
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,610
Joe, next time, try eating your
apricots, not throwing them.

79
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,449
Hey, do you think this is funny?

80
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,524
So the budget committee
is pressuring you that much?

81
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,993
And girls don't like when
you wear your food. Trust me.

82
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,530
Yeah. They're all
over me about it.

83
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,168
How much do they
want you to cut?

84
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,298
- They want me to cut an Attending.
- What?

85
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,704
- That's crazy.
- Yup.

86
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,707
And this is between
me, you and Joe.

87
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,709
Hey. Hi.

88
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:10,546
What's it like out there? Is it too
cold for Joe to go to the park today?

89
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,711
I can't believe they want you to
cut an Attending. It's ridiculous.

90
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:18,154
How does the budget committee
expect us to do our job when...? Luka.

91
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,660
Hey! Luka.

92
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,097
What is up with you?
You're acting so weird.

93
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,402
You're running out
without shoes and a jacket...

94
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:13,946
I saw a tow truck. I thought my car was
parked on the wrong side of the street.

95
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,380
They don't have alternate-
side-of-the-street parking in Croatia?

96
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,146
Danielle Davis, 13, unresponsive
with vaginal bleeding.

97
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,050
BP, 90/60 in the
field up with a liter.

98
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,657
What happened? HOLLIS:
Found her on the school steps.

99
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,953
Danielle, open
your eyes. Danielle?

100
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,153
- What is it?
- Syncope, trauma with vag bleed.

101
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,527
Or ectopic pregnancy and she's
bleeding out. I'll clear a room.

102
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,933
Hang on, Danielle. We're
gonna take good care of you.

103
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,999
Well, you may
have torn a ligament.

104
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,473
Looks like a case of Boomeritis.

105
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,475
Well, that sounds bad. - Okay.

106
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,343
Mr. Pachecko, remember to
warm up before working out...

107
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,109
and consider taking up
swimming or riding instead.

108
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,787
He's gonna need a knee
immobilizer, crutches and Vicodin.

109
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,987
- "Boomeritis." You come up with that?
- Mm-hm.

110
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,420
Hey, Morris. I need
you to sign off on this.

111
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,157
Probable ACL tear.

112
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,666
- So how's Katey working out?
- Uh, who?

113
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,835
- Katey. Aren't you supervising her?
- Oh, no. No. Not me.

114
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,704
Oh. Hey, is it me or do the med
students keep getting younger every year?

115
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,506
- What is she, like 24?
- Ah, I don't know.

116
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,545
- I've never noticed how hot she is.
- What?

117
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,014
- What?
- I didn't say about her being hot.

118
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,550
- She is hot, but...
- Eh, well...

119
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,712
You have to be certified as an
MICN in order to take radio calls.

120
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,790
But you can use it
to do a status check.

121
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,687
Can somebody get
Ortho on my knee guy?

122
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,555
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- Thank you.

123
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,493
- There's a new course. I'll get details.
- Thank you.

124
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,997
Dawn, is the white count
back on my gallstone guy?

125
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,464
- Ten-point-eight.
- All right.

126
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,194
He needs four of morphine. Here.

127
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,306
- Sure, I'll get to it in a minute.
- Oh, whoa, Hope.

128
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,305
About your
newlyweds with the flu.

129
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:52,845
Why would you prescribe, "Long walks,
holding hands and romantic dinners"?

130
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,711
Oh, I sensed tension in their marriage.
When we're tense or stressed...

131
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,375
our immune systems
weaken, which, as you know...

132
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,614
limits our body's ability to
fight off infections and viruses.

133
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:09,558
I felt if, uh, Andy
and Phyllis...

134
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,689
carved out more time for one another,
they could strengthen their marriage...

135
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,564
thus speeding their recovery
and preventing illnesses.

136
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,236
- Hope, you can't... MAN:
Bitch, it's mine and I want it.

137
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,069
Come on, now. You stole
it and I want it back now.

138
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,234
Sir, you're gonna have
to calm down, okay?

139
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,505
This guy has been acting
up since he got here.

140
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,273
Sir, what are you missing?

141
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,748
When I came in here, I had
a 5-carat ring in my pocket.

142
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,216
And now it's gone.

143
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,252
- And this bitch stole it. Come here!
- Ahh!

144
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,391
Now, give me my ring. - Okay.

145
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,581
Hey.

146
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,421
You shut your pie hole
and you come with me.

147
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,426
- You okay, Hope?
- Yes, thank goodness for Ben.

148
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,758
Yeah, he really took charge.
- Say that again.

149
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,631
Come on, let's
break it up. All right?

150
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,796
Get back to work,
not a big deal. Please.

151
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,575
- I think we got shown up by a murse.
- Huh?

152
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,870
- Male nurse.
- Oh, that's bad.

153
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,175
Yeah, he's pretty
macho, though, huh?

154
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,309
Pupils, 4 millimeters
and reactive.

155
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,785
Contusions and
lacerations to the labia.

156
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,254
CBC, coags, type and cross.

157
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,394
- She was assaulted.
- Pregnancy test is negative.

158
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,121
Okay, let's get her to
CT to rule out brain injury.

159
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,266
I'll check on CT and notify OB.

160
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,762
- C-spine's clear.
- When's she gonna be able to talk?

161
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,769
- I don't know.
- All right.

162
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,339
- Her clothes need to be inventoried.
- Of course.

163
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,306
Okay, let's use Dermabond
to fix this forehead lac.

164
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,276
- She probably hit her head.
- Scanner's ready in 20 minutes.

165
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,814
- Trying to run from who did this.
- Twenty minutes? Not good.

166
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,010
- Surgery is down on your consult.
- I'll get there when I can.

167
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,347
We're okay here. Go.

168
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,256
Hi, this is Dr. Kovac. Put
her on a portable monitor.

169
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,987
Yeah, I've got an unconscious
kid down here, clear the scanner.

170
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,495
There's a Mrs. Arrida
here from the girl's school.

171
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,758
Okay. Okay!

172
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,266
- We're gonna need an evidence bag.
- Sure thing.

173
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,099
I'm the vice principal at
Lakeside. How is Danielle?

174
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,503
Uh, she's not
very well right now.

175
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,137
Oh, my God. KOVAC: Please.

176
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,546
- Do you know what happened?
- No. No one saw anything.

177
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,718
We've never had
anything like this.

178
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,877
Her parents, have
they been notified?

179
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,387
The school nurse called
but had to leave messages.

180
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,717
They need to be here.

181
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,326
Danielle's mother is
here. She works at County.

182
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,257
- What's her name?
- Gilliam.

183
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,854
Angela Gilliam.

184
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,159
What makes you think
this is bowel obstruction?

185
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,236
Abdominal pain, distension, no
bowel movement for three days. Ouch.

186
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,635
No history of abdominal
surgery, no adhesions...

187
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,538
and he's too young for
a colon lesion. Upright.

188
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,073
How's that? That better?

189
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,251
Air-fluid levels,
but no dilated loops.

190
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,716
- Not consistent with obstruction.
- Can't be sure.

191
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,482
You know, sometimes things
aren't always the way they seem.

192
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,216
- About the other night...
- Stop.

193
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,185
It's over. I told Meg it's over.

194
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,594
Maybe for you, but any idiot could
see on her face that it's not over for her.

195
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,898
It's an ileus. The
bowel's asleep.

196
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,063
Doesn't help that he's
been popping Vicodin.

197
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,574
Just give him a laxative
and wait for him to poop.

198
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,874
That's ileus. I-L-E-U-S.

199
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,111
Pulled me out
of a staff meeting.

200
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,756
- What's the emergency?
- There's a patient in Trauma 1.

201
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,620
Okay, let's go. We couldn't
discuss this on the phone?

202
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,228
We don't know what happened.
They found her outside of her school.

203
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,025
Luka, what's going on?

204
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,796
We think she was
sexually assaulted.

205
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,064
- Who?
- CT can take her, Dr. Kovac.

206
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,263
Uh.

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,433
Angela, it's Danielle.

208
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,448
My baby.

209
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,916
My sweet baby girl.

210
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,168
Okay, Trudy, can you explain
to me how this happened?

211
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,142
Wes... That's my boyfriend.
- -he's always talking on his cell.

212
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:24,307
But when I'd ask, "Who you
calling?" he gets all secretive on me.

213
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,476
- Does your old man do that to you?
- No.

214
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,485
- My old man's pretty cool.
- Lucky.

215
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,647
Me and Wes are in
bed and his cell rings...

216
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,156
so I rolled over and
grabbed it before he could.

217
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,759
- It's pretty smart, huh?
- Very.

218
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,790
Wes gets mad, starts chasing me around
the room when I see it's Debbie calling.

219
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,528
- I say, "Who the hell is Debbie?"
- He tells me it's none of my business.

220
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,196
And that's when you decided
to swallow his cell phone.

221
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,831
Okay.

222
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,306
I'm gonna order an x-ray...

223
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,412
and we'll find out if we can
pull it out here in the ER.

224
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,309
If not, you're
gonna need surgery.

225
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,940
It's tiny. I could stick my finger
down my throat to try to barf it up.

226
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,713
- Hey, Abby. Got a sec?
- Hold that thought.

227
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,355
This is Ben Parker, new RN.

228
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,855
- Hi. Abby Lockhart.
- Hi.

229
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,791
- You're the nurse that became a doctor.
- Yeah, guilty as charged.

230
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:12,455
- Got seduced by the dark side, huh?
- I use my powers for good, not evil.

231
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,658
Abby's an R-3 now.

232
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,462
Nice to meet you.

233
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,127
Oh, I forgot.

234
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:22,173
Uh, there's an asthmatic
at triage asking for you.

235
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,238
Hi.

236
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,710
Okay. Uh, I'll be back
when GI gets here.

237
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,674
- What is it?
- You hear that?

238
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,148
It's probably that stupid
bitch, Debbie, calling.

239
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,993
- Sounds pretty wheezy.
- It's been worse.

240
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,532
- How long you been off your medication?
- Since my prescription ran out.

241
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,169
And that was when?

242
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,737
Sixty of prednisone p.o.

243
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,568
- You giving me steroids?
- Yes. Sorry.

244
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,871
But only for five days to
knock down the inflammation.

245
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:03,415
And something tells me that,
uh, you didn't get your flu shot.

246
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,279
I'll add that to the orders.

247
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,509
How's your buddy?

248
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,456
Your friend here at County?
You were gonna visit him?

249
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,455
Better. Yeah, he's doing better.

250
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,923
Good.

251
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,427
- You'd be better if you quit smoking.
- Killjoy.

252
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,435
- You two ever smoke?
- I did but I gave it up.

253
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,904
Miss it?

254
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,539
Hey, you work here too.

255
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,307
- Small world.
- Yeah, hi.

256
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,743
Can I talk to you? I need
you in Trauma 1 now.

257
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,214
Sure. Can I get a chest
x-ray, PA and lateral?

258
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,376
- And I'll be back.
- Yeah, you got it.

259
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:44,422
I need you to do a rape exam on
that girl we brought in this morning.

260
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,889
- She's Angela Gilliam's daughter.
- Oh, God.

261
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,552
- How's Angela?
- Keeping it together. Just barely.

262
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,960
Okay. I'll find you
when I'm done.

263
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,066
Officer Hollis?
You have a minute?

264
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,499
Sure, doc. Maybe we can
get some coffee sometime.

265
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,229
- Can we talk outside?
- Sure.

266
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,685
What do you think? - Maybe.

267
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,741
Don't tell me I don't.
I've read about it.

268
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:03,933
Then you should know...

269
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,601
- Glucoside's negative.
- Thanks.

270
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,974
There are no known
cases of avian flu in the U.S.

271
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,979
Maybe I'm the first.
I demand Tamiflu.

272
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,482
You have no symptoms.
No fever, cough.

273
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,484
I've been in
contact with poultry.

274
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:17,647
You cannot contract avian flu
from eating chicken chow mein.

275
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,087
What caused my diarrhea?

276
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,784
It could be a stomach
virus, food poisoning...

277
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,362
And avian flu virus
does not cause diarrhea.

278
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,998
Viruses mutate, it happens.

279
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,603
Okay, Dawn, get Mrs. Martinelli
two of loperamide, q.i.d., p.r.n.

280
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,035
And dispo her before she
convinces me we have it.

281
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,835
All right. Katey, nice work.

282
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,135
I have a good teacher.

283
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,676
How long you two been dating?

284
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,279
Uh, we're not dating.

285
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,812
You're not?

286
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,007
My bad.

287
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,051
It's all ready.

288
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,382
Thanks, Haleh.

289
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,888
Okay, Danielle.

290
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,887
Let me explain what
we're gonna do. All right?

291
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,724
First, we're gonna put
your feet in these stirrups.

292
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,030
Then I'm gonna examine
you inside with this.

293
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,137
It's called a speculum.

294
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,398
It has a light in it.

295
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:11,567
When the speculum is in, I'm gonna
take some swabs and sweep inside.

296
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:17,240
And then I'm gonna irrigate with water,
and remove that with a syringe. Okay?

297
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,914
Okay.

298
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,554
Can you scooch down towards me?

299
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,620
Little bit more.

300
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,722
All right, here we go.

301
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,175
Sam.

302
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,939
Hey, why did you blab about Katey
and me when I asked you not to?

303
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,709
- What are you talking about?
- Everybody knows, even the patients.

304
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,250
I didn't say anything, I swear.

305
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:55,849
- Ew.
- Oh!

306
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,423
Hell, man. I liked this shirt.

307
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,857
- That's a fag shirt.
- Look, just cut it out, all right? No...

308
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,186
- There's no spitting...
- Incoming!

309
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,662
All right, we gotta get
a mask on this guy now.

310
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,358
Ben. Your friend's
acting up again.

311
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,197
- Yeah, I see that.
- Up yours.

312
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,100
Ew, ew, ew. Who knows
what diseases he has.

313
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,537
Yeah. Don't just stand
there, help me find a mask.

314
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,303
No, I've seen guys like this
bite through masks before.

315
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:19,937
Wow.

316
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,208
Where'd you learn that?

317
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,817
It's a parlor trick I picked
up at Savannah General.

318
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,545
Never seen that one before.

319
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,750
Can I get you some fava
beans and a nice Chianti?

320
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,426
Dr. Morris, um, I need you
to see my patient in Curtain 1.

321
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:41,227
- Yeah, what's the problem?
- Well, he complains of a migraine, but...

322
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,320
- Whoa, whoa. Did you say migraine?
- Yes, but...

323
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,895
Hope, would you drive a Lamborghini to
a Laundromat? Hitch Seabiscuit to a plow?

324
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,771
Have Eddie Van Halen play air guitar?
I'm Dr. Morris. I don't do migraines.

325
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,276
I think it's more than that.

326
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,713
You think?

327
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,841
I don't want a restraining
order. I want him arrested.

328
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,954
I know you're frustrated, but
Ames hasn't done anything illegal.

329
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,590
So he has to hurt my family
before anyone will listen?

330
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,194
I wouldn't worry about this guy. He's
just a sucker, working a crappy job.

331
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,796
If you pursue this, you
might piss him off for real.

332
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:11,987
Piss Ames off?

333
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,861
Look, do yourself a
favor, forget Ames.

334
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,765
He's already
forgotten about you.

335
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,603
- Hey.
- Hey.

336
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,004
The exam evidence for Danielle
is sealed and waiting for signature.

337
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,701
- Just see Haleh.
- Thanks. Take it easy, doc.

338
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,608
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

339
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,215
Did you send Danielle's
cultures to the lab?

340
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,785
Yeah, GC and chlamydia and I
told them to rush the vaginal washing.

341
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,684
Okay. I better get back in.

342
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,125
She's still pretty agitated.

343
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,322
Okay, try a mg of Ativan.

344
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,228
Is your daughter dating anyone?

345
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,732
She's 13.

346
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,268
You'd be surprised how
young they start these days.

347
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,169
Luka, my husband, Paul.

348
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,866
- Hi.
- Dr. Kovac. Was Danielle raped?

349
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,369
Well, the initial results are
negative for the presence of sperm.

350
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,014
Thank God.

351
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,047
But there's something else.

352
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:08,210
Well, it looks like Danielle was
assaulted with a sharp object.

353
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,586
It appears she was, uh, cut...

354
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,023
and penetrated repeatedly
with a razor blade.

355
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,164
- What kind of monster would do this?
- I'm so sorry.

356
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,699
Which one of you two saw
Danielle last this morning?

357
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:26,934
I usually drive her to school but I
had an early meeting, so Paul took her.

358
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,268
- And what time was that?
- About 7:15.

359
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,843
Anyone see you
drop Danielle off?

360
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,941
- I don't know.
- What time did you get to work?

361
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,209
- Okay, do we need to do this now?
- How is that important?

362
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,752
- Mr. Gilliam, let's step outside.
- I'm staying here with my stepdaughter.

363
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,583
Some lunatic cut
up our daughter...

364
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,225
and you're treating my
husband like a suspect?

365
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,224
Mom.

366
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,795
- What's going on?
- Okay, that's enough. Outside.

367
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,262
I can't have you
upsetting my patient.

368
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,459
- That wasn't our intent.
- Paul, listen to me. Listen to me.

369
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,232
The police want to catch whoever
did this to Danielle as much as you do.

370
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:03,103
- Of course, but...
- So just go answer their questions.

371
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,939
And then you can
rejoin your family. Please.

372
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,548
Everything's going to be okay.

373
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,120
I need you to talk to me.

374
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,154
Danielle, honey.

375
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,883
Do you know who hurt you?

376
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,858
Yes.

377
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,565
Then tell me.

378
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,374
I can't.

379
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,909
You'll be mad.

380
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,259
My head hurts
just looking at it.

381
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,997
How did he get it in so deep
without hitting any vital structures?

382
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,038
Managed to stay
outside the brain...

383
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,268
miss the internal carotid,
optic nerve and pituitary.

384
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,505
- Lucky bastard.
- Hey, I heard you guys had a cool case.

385
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,444
- Is that a...?
- Ice pick.

386
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,641
What makes someone
shove an ice pick in?

387
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,842
Ran out of Q-tips?

388
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,783
Hearing voices,
wanted them to shut up.

389
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,514
But I wonder why he didn't
try pulling it out himself.

390
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,024
Said the demons in his
head would get loose if he did.

391
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,356
Hey, is this an ER case?

392
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,690
I'd say Neurosurgery.

393
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,662
- No, ENT.
- Definitely Psych.

394
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,802
I say we page them
all, let them fight.

395
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,300
You don't want in on this?

396
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,373
Nope. Nope, nope, nope. I'm leaving
it all in your capable hands, Archie.

397
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,702
Heh, heh... Whoa!

398
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,902
Nice move for an old dude.

399
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,415
What's up, man? How
did you get back here?

400
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,984
- I got some moves of my own.
- I don't doubt that.

401
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,848
- How was the final?
- It was nothing.

402
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,044
Okay.

403
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,817
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

404
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,153
Is there someplace
a little more private?

405
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,024
Uh... Yeah, come on.

406
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,323
- If this is a bad time, man...
- No, it's all good, man.

407
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,198
So does it have anything
to do with this morning?

408
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,032
Yeah. Kind of, man.

409
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,174
Ha, ha, let me tell
you something, man.

410
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,674
You and I, definitely
brothers. You got good taste.

411
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,074
- The girl is fine.
- Greg, listen. I...

412
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,270
Heads up.

413
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,779
I think I kind of gave
you the impression...

414
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,043
that something happened
between me and her.

415
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,414
- Sure looked like that to me.
- No.

416
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,579
The truth is Nicole
and I are just friends.

417
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:34,193
I like her, and she's cool to
hang out with, but I'm not hitting it.

418
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,852
Mm. That's cool.
That's nothing, trust me.

419
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,497
- Give the girl time if...
- Greg.

420
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,457
I'm gay.

421
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,775
I mean, you said it was just a phase.
You're 18, come on. What do you know?

422
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,174
You just need to meet...

423
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,181
All the talk in the world about chicks
and sports isn't gonna change me.

424
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,995
- You were lying.
- I was lying to myself.

425
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,797
And I'm not gonna do that
anymore, man. This is my life.

426
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,299
- Sorry if it makes you hate me.
- I don't hate you.

427
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,460
Oh, you don't hate me
but can you deal with it?

428
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,696
Are we still cool?

429
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,312
Pratt, can I give your vomiting
guy another five of Compazine?

430
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,504
Look, I can't do this right now.

431
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:32,344
- It's okay, I can do it.
- No, no, I better, um.

432
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,146
Look, I gotta go.

433
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,255
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- It's okay.

434
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,162
I have a bunch of
eighth-graders with gastroenteritis.

435
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:52,169
Potato salad left out
too long in the cafeteria.

436
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,431
How's it going in there?

437
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,542
Surgery's coming down to
rule out intra-abdominal injury.

438
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,111
It seems Danielle knows her
attacker, but won't say who it is.

439
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,907
- Protecting somebody?
- I don't know.

440
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,346
- Well, what does Hollis think?
- Hollis?

441
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,075
Hollis, the cop.

442
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:09,086
That you were talking
to about Danielle.

443
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,190
Uh, he doesn't know much more.

444
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,758
- Your bar buddy's still here.
- Oh, shoot.

445
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,758
- I have my eighth-graders.
- Don't worry.

446
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,191
- I'll take him.
- Thank you.

447
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,355
He's had a couple of
treatments for asthma.

448
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,523
You can send him
home with prednisone.

449
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,193
- I'll have Sam bring in the x-rays.
- Okay.

450
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,472
Hey, doc.

451
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,801
You draw the short straw?

452
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,477
You taking care of me now?

453
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,377
Dr. Lockhart's
with other patients.

454
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,408
I'm only guessing, but you're
not from around here, huh?

455
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,020
No. Croatia.

456
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,722
Long way from home.

457
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,881
Well, this is my home now.

458
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,584
You have some mild wheezing.

459
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,897
First-time visitor myself.

460
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,896
I probably should've
come in spring.

461
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,900
A friend of mine told me
winters could be tough.

462
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,595
No, it's not too bad.

463
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,273
You, uh, planning on
raising your son here?

464
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,813
Abby told me. Congratulations.

465
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,274
You mean Dr. Lockhart.

466
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,817
- Luka, you need these?
- Yeah. Thanks, Sam.

467
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,752
I'm not discussing my
personal life with the patients.

468
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:23,490
Hey, Sam. Five of albuterol
and check on him in 30 minutes.

469
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:28,327
- Have me paged if somebody needs me.
- Listen, doc, if I spoke out of line...

470
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,136
- Hey.
- No, sir. Don't touch, don't touch.

471
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,864
Okay. It's official.

472
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:38,203
- Every department has passed the buck.
- Surgery, Neurosurg, and ENT?

473
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,608
Well, they all claim
it's not their problem.

474
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,271
What are we gonna do?

475
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,112
I say we pull it out. - Huh?

476
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:51,053
Come on. Come on, Let's show those
wusses that the ER's not afraid of a...

477
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,885
Ten-inch ice pick
in a man's skull?

478
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,893
- Nope, nope. Push three of Versed.
- I don't know, it's kind of...

479
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,794
The films show it missed
everything on the way in.

480
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,993
So all we have to do is ease
it out along the same path...

481
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,899
and admit him
for IV antibiotics.

482
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,131
- I know, but what if...?
- Not to mention...

483
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,299
this is a publishable
case report...

484
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,878
for any ambitious med
student, intern or Resident.

485
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,410
- It's not the craziest...
- No.

486
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,914
- He can't walk like that.
- If we don't, he's gonna.

487
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,144
Okay.

488
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,413
Who wants to do it?

489
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,349
- I'll do it.
- Attagirl.

490
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,018
- All right, don't wiggle the handle, Hope.
- I won't.

491
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,426
- Give it one good tug.
- Don't be nervous.

492
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,762
- Relax and pull gentle, but firm.
- Okay.

493
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,403
Oh.

494
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,912
Is there any pain when I press here?
- No.

495
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,179
- How about here?
- Uh-uh.

496
00:25:56,221 --> 00:26:00,090
Okay. I'm gonna need
to take a look inside you.

497
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,956
- They did that.
- I know. I'm checking for other things.

498
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,528
It's okay, honey.

499
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,189
Angela, the detective is asking if
you could step out for a moment.

500
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,427
I need to stay with my daughter.

501
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,865
It's okay, Mom.

502
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,733
You can go.

503
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,171
I want you to.

504
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:21,480
Okay, if that's what you want.

505
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,744
I'm going to see how
deep the cuts are.

506
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,550
They're not bad.

507
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,795
I know.

508
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,799
How do you know
the cuts weren't deep?

509
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:44,993
Honey...

510
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,501
did you do this to yourself?

511
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,210
Please don't tell my mom.

512
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,597
- How many loads hauled today?
- Four.

513
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,293
Boss wants you to get that
load you left in the corner.

514
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,529
Go screw yourself.

515
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,364
Mr. Ames.

516
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,470
- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

517
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,638
I'm working now.
This is not a good time.

518
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,444
I don't care. MAN: Ames!

519
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:35,213
I don't pay you to chitchat.

520
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,152
Is it okay if I, uh, take
my break right now?

521
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,315
Ten minutes.

522
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,398
- You're lying.
- Check time cards if you don't believe.

523
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:48,966
I don't know where you live.

524
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,627
It wasn't you in the park? You
didn't send me my son's toy?

525
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,067
Your initials were on it.

526
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,368
Why are you doing this to me?
You sent the police to my job.

527
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,034
I can't have you doing that.

528
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,874
- This job is all I got left now.
- Stop playing games.

529
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,583
I'm trying to live my life and
make it through one more day.

530
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,346
My family is gone,
my house is gone.

531
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,914
I'm living in my
car. My damn car.

532
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:14,389
- That's not my problem, okay?
- What is it you want from me?

533
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,319
You've been watching my family,
following us. That stops right now.

534
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,659
I would never do
anything to hurt your family.

535
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,430
I know what it's
like to lose one.

536
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:27,329
You do too, right?

537
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:31,668
I heard that you were
married once with kids.

538
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,574
Must be horrible
going through all that.

539
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,504
I gotta get back
to work, all right?

540
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:42,377
Listen to me, Ames. Come
near my family again, I'll kill you.

541
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,475
- I am so sorry. It's all my fault.
- No, no. It was my idea.

542
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:02,268
- Maybe I pulled the handle too hard or...
- No, Hope.

543
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:06,037
You were the only one in the
entire hospital to step up to the plate.

544
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,043
I'm proud of you.

545
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,771
So how is he?

546
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:14,215
The human shish kebab will be fine,
no thanks to that imbecilic stunt of yours.

547
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,548
How were we to know
the handle would break off?

548
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:20,887
Okay. All right, just for fun, let's
pretend that you each had even a modicum...

549
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:25,053
of gray matter that you somehow
managed to fashion into some crude...

550
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,165
rudimentary
semblance of a brain.

551
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:31,667
You would know never pull something
near a vital structure unless in the O.R.

552
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,840
We remove foreign
bodies all the time in the ER.

553
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,499
Pulling a vibrator out of
someone's ass? Not the same.

554
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:41,078
Hey, hey. Dr. Bobek acted under
my supervision and my orders.

555
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:45,581
- Perfect. Half-wit leading the dimwit.
- Look, you obnoxious boor.

556
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,116
The ER works damn hard
for every patient we see.

557
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,655
We acted in this guy's
best interest when no one...

558
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,951
not even Surgery,
would give him time.

559
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,027
Did we do something
that didn't work? Yes.

560
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,959
Fine. It happens sometimes.
I will take full responsibility.

561
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,464
But at least we got off
of our asses and tried.

562
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,297
Well, gold stars
for the ER asses.

563
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,494
Hey!

564
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,273
What is it about your need
to belittle other people?

565
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,605
Does insulting someone
make you feel like a man?

566
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:18,213
Bolster what little
self-esteem you're clinging to?

567
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:25,123
Wow, you know, I can't even begin to
imagine what happened in your life...

568
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,782
to make you the kind of
person everybody hates.

569
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,561
I could kiss you right now.

570
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,062
Really?

571
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,333
Hm.

572
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,636
Now it's gone.

573
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,175
Sorry this took so long.

574
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,214
It's just kind of the
way things work.

575
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:54,182
- Oh, I didn't mind.
- Don't forget to fill your prescription.

576
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,686
And remember to take
the prednisone with food.

577
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,847
Yes, ma'am. If you say so.

578
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,425
And you need to follow up
with your doctor in a week.

579
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,528
Right, um.

580
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,891
- What are your office hours?
- Ha. Um...

581
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,965
I can refer you to
the pulmonary clinic.

582
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,262
- That's all right. I'll work it out.
- Okay.

583
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,500
Hey, hey. Where
did you disappear to?

584
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,504
- Dr. Kovac, I need to talk to you.
- Yeah.

585
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,545
Nowhere. I'll see you later.

586
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,251
He seems like
an interesting guy.

587
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,352
Could use work on
his bedside manner.

588
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,013
Well, it's been a rough day.

589
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,886
Hey, Abby. Weaver's coming on.

590
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,290
Okay. Goodbye, Eddie.

591
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,023
- Take care.
- Good night.

592
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,394
- I miss anything?
- No. She's after the weather.

593
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,127
Timmy, Channel 5. Now.

594
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,034
Nothing more dangerous than
a man in control of the remote.

595
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,266
Pretty easy once you
get the hang of it, huh?

596
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,707
Yeah. I appreciate you
showing me the ropes today.

597
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:58,408
Oh, please. I was once a brash,
overconfident new nurse myself.

598
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,109
I just hope we haven't changed
your mind about County.

599
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,549
No, not yet.

600
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,553
Why don't you let
me buy you a drink...

601
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,454
or take you out to dinner,
just to say thank you?

602
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,993
- You mean like a date?
- Does it sound like a date?

603
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,391
Kind of.

604
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,762
Call it whatever you
want. Just say yes.

605
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,633
Neela. So my
incarcerated hernia guy?

606
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,635
Still in line for the O.R.

607
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,172
- You think he needs a colostomy?
- You know what?

608
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,808
We'll have to wait.

609
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,070
Hey, Ray. You forgot to fill out
the consult request on your CF'er.

610
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,077
Hey, this is
Dr. Rasgotra, I was paged.

611
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:34,311
- Thanks. I'm sorry about that.
- Hey, and you guys gotta knock it off.

612
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,081
I'm talking about Katey.
She's a med student, Ray.

613
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,121
- I'm not evaluating her.
- Doesn't matter.

614
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,455
- I don't want your judgment impaired.
- My judgment is fine.

615
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,187
It's not like it's not
going on here all the time.

616
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,594
As long as I'm
running the floor, it isn't.

617
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:51,100
Tell you what, when it's your
business to know about my love life...

618
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,293
I'll let you know.

619
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,133
Hey, hey! She's on.

620
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,605
Somebody turn up the sound.

621
00:32:56,775 --> 00:33:00,473
<i>Last week, while looking for cans
and bottles in the Dumpster behind me...</i>

622
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,806
Weaver's a real natural.

623
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,109
<i>What they thought was
a child's discarded doll.</i>

624
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,515
Wow, this really
turned out good.

625
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,485
It's only TV.

626
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,647
- You're kidding, right?
- Shh.

627
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,520
Henry just fell asleep.

628
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:17,288
How many patients do
you treat in one ER shift?

629
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,364
- Like, 25, 30 tops?
- I don't know. It depends.

630
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:24,492
Okay, well, on TV, you can reach
a hell of a lot more than 30 people...

631
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,967
and still help them.

632
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,572
No. I mean, it's not the same.

633
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,709
Yeah, well, it still counts.

634
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,236
Oh, my gosh.

635
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,539
I can't believe
it's me up there.

636
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:40,880
Yeah, well, you better get used to
it because you're really very good.

637
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,815
I couldn't have done
it without my producer.

638
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,831
Hey.

639
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,065
Hey. You heading out?

640
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,106
Thank God. It's been a long day.

641
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:08,213
Yeah, this place can suck at times.
Better leave while you can, huh?

642
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,212
You know, Pratt's right.

643
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,545
It's not cool to date a student.

644
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,416
- So this is your business too?
- I'm only saying.

645
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,081
She's nice and
everything, I like her, but...

646
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,749
But what, Neela? What?

647
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,294
Well, nothing. I'm concerned.

648
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,924
Well, thank you. I'm good.

649
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,365
And Katey's good. In
fact, things are going great.

650
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,902
Then I'm happy for you.

651
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,700
- So, what's this really about?
- What?

652
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,434
- Why do you care all of a sudden?
- We're friends, right?

653
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,307
That's what friends do,
talk about each other's lives?

654
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,708
Oh, that's how it is.

655
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:46,215
Okay, friend, how's Gates?

656
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,984
Because you know what? Really
not into playing your games anymore.

657
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,249
- What?
- Do you think I'm gonna hang out...

658
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,917
waiting for you to find out
he's jerking you around?

659
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,290
- Ray.
- Neela, you made your choice.

660
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,263
You can't have it both ways.

661
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:06,098
Miss Gilliam, if you can think
of anything else, give us a call.

662
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,399
- Sure.
- Thank you.

663
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,644
- Is your husband back?
- He'll be back soon.

664
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,514
The police wanted to look
at Danielle's computer...

665
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,243
see if she kept a diary.

666
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:26,149
Angela, I need to tell
you something. Uh...

667
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:32,587
When Danielle was being
examined by surgeons...

668
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:37,793
she told the doctor and the
nurse in the room that she did this.

669
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,028
She cut herself.

670
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,332
That's not possible.

671
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,977
They must've misunderstood her.

672
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,204
Well, she said
she's done it before.

673
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,440
But today, she couldn't
control the bleeding.

674
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,947
She got frightened.

675
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,882
She tried to run home and
that's when they found her.

676
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:59,650
She also said a boy kissed
her before class today.

677
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,292
He tried to reach under her
skirt, she pushed him away...

678
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,453
but she said she
remembered something.

679
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,996
Remembered what?

680
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,964
That's when she went to
the girls' room and cut herself.

681
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,070
Luka, I don't understand.

682
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,136
Angela...

683
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:19,503
Danielle talked about something
that happened to you in Detroit.

684
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,373
Something she witnessed.

685
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,780
Oh, God.

686
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,790
She saw.

687
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:47,601
When Danielle was 9, a man
came to the door of our apartment...

688
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:52,835
said he was doing
repairs in the complex.

689
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:59,508
He wore overalls, carried a
toolbox, so I let him in and, uh...

690
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,379
He raped me.

691
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,693
Danielle was playing outside.

692
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,533
I never thought
she had any idea.

693
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,479
I never told anyone.

694
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,644
Not even Paul.

695
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:43,760
I didn't wanna upset Danielle, I
just wanted to put it all behind me.

696
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,921
What did I do?

697
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,498
- This isn't your fault.
- What did I do?

698
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,097
I was so busy trying
to keep it all together...

699
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,673
I didn't even see what my own
daughter was going through.

700
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,174
You did what you
thought was best.

701
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,014
You were just trying
to protect your family.

702
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,119
Hey, Neela. Neela, wait up.

703
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,628
- Oh, not now. Really, not now.
- Didn't tell you earlier, I'm moving.

704
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:23,257
- Oh, yeah? Where?
- Well, I haven't found a place yet...

705
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,528
I don't have time for this crap.

706
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,172
It's not like I can just
walk out of there tomorrow.

707
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,534
- No?
- No.

708
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,973
Sarah and Meg have had it rough,
and they've come to count on me.

709
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,669
It must feel good
to be the hero.

710
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,509
I promised my buddy that
I would take care of them.

711
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,150
Oh, yeah, right, the promise.

712
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,786
Was sleeping with your
friend's wife part of the deal?

713
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,479
It wasn't about that.
You're not making this easy.

714
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,125
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
realize I was supposed to.

715
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:51,457
All right, look, right or wrong,
yes, Meg and I sometimes...

716
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,189
Out of comfort, or
convenience, or loneliness.

717
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,391
I don't know what.
But it wasn't love.

718
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,628
Enough! Just stop.

719
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:01,295
Stop lying.

720
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,134
You're right. You're right.

721
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:05,834
I haven't been
honest for a long time.

722
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,640
I mean, for 10 years, I've dealt
with people and things in my life...

723
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,306
in a way that I wouldn't
have to get too close.

724
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:16,853
- Now you're gonna tell me it's different.
- Yes. Since I met you, I've been a mess.

725
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,480
You're making me think about
the way I want my life to be.

726
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,751
The way it could be.

727
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,684
I am?

728
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,525
My train's here.

729
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,692
Hey, Chaz. Chaz.
Hey, hey, hey, man.

730
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,452
What are you doing?

731
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,689
- Wait in the car for me, okay?
- Sure.

732
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,857
- Come on, now. You don't have to leave.
- Yeah, I do.

733
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,900
I never said I
wasn't cool with it.

734
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,196
You never said you were.

735
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,275
All right, look. I work on
gay patients all the time.

736
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,570
I work with gay doctors.

737
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,710
When it comes to my own blood,
I just need some time, that's all.

738
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,375
Ha. Some time.

739
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,453
That's funny.

740
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:27,217
- You're more like Dad than you realize.
- No.

741
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,658
It's not coming out like I mean.

742
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,992
I could see when I told
you, you weren't okay with it.

743
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,725
And maybe you'll
never be okay with it.

744
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,731
I sure hope you prove me wrong.

745
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:54,082
So tomorrow, they're taking
Danielle to a private facility.

746
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:57,245
Well, it sounds like she's
getting the help she needs.

747
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:02,360
Yeah. It's gonna take some time,
but I think they'll all get through it.

748
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:06,925
Abby, you asked me
about where I went.

749
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,366
Yes, and you said
something about nowhere.

750
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,832
I went to see Curtis Ames.

751
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,164
The patient who sued you?

752
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:16,672
That guy in the park?
When you lost Joe's toy?

753
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,104
That was Ames.

754
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,773
- How do you know?
- And this morning, he was on our street.

755
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,141
He's been following us.

756
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:28,347
- What?
- I didn't have proof, but today...

757
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,283
- Wait, you didn't say anything?
- No.

758
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:31,855
- I just...
- Luka!

759
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,515
I... I've been walking all
around Chicago with our son.

760
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,321
- I know, I know.
- The babysitter takes him out every day.

761
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,987
And there's a crazy,
angry guy following us?

762
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,190
- But it's over now.
- How do you know that?

763
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,461
- I know because I took care of it.
- How?

764
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,833
Look, hey, let's just go home.
We can talk about it there.

765
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,497
- Abby.
- Taxi!

766
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:53,008
- What are you doing?
- The train is slow. I wanna get home.

767
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,975
Okay.

768
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,510
I can't believe this. I cannot
believe you didn't tell me.

769
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,653
- I didn't want you to worry.
- You didn't want me to worry?

770
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,583
- Yes.
- I thought we were past this.

771
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,815
- Past what?
- This... In our relationship.

772
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,552
This need you have to protect me or
shield me from the hurts of the world.

773
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,696
- Why are you bringing all that now?
- Taxi!

774
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,765
- It's different now. We're different.
- That's what I thought.

775
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:19,737
Look, I know I should've told
you, but this is just about Ames.

776
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,066
- Don't make it about us.
- It is about us.

777
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,376
I'm going. Are you
coming or what?
