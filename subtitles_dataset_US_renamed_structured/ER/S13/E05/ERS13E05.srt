1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,905
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,439
Be back to work next month.

3
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:10,100
- Ray Barnett. I don't think we've met.
- Katey.

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,237
- You two lived together?
- Oh, we were roommates.

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,610
Hope you had benefits.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,511
You don't wanna have anything to
do with me, what about your brother?

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,243
- He'd like to know you, Greg.
- He just met me.

8
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,081
I mean, ain't we brothers?

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:23,780
Curtis Ames?

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,586
Left-sided paralysis
following an embolic stroke.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,026
- But I thought the case had no merit.
- Guy wants his day in court.

12
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,894
It doesn't reflect on your
abilities as a physician.

13
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,236
Skiles has got them working.

14
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,932
And with Ben Wallace,
they're going to the playoffs.

15
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,236
I remember when the NBA
used to mean something.

16
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,380
Oscar Robertson,
yeah. Walt Frazier, yeah.

17
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,778
Now it's all a bunch of
gangsters with tattoos.

18
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,008
And cornrows.

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,674
And slam dunks.

20
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,252
Oh, my, hey, now.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,413
- Healthy set of lungs on that one.
- If I was 20 years younger...

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,081
You'd still be her granddaddy.

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,691
- Is that Dr. Gregory Pratt?
- The one and only.

24
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,957
What are you doing down
here on the South Side?

25
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,760
I heard you bought a
condo on the Gold Coast.

26
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,063
You drive down here in
the Beemer or the Benz?

27
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,105
I walked from my apartment. How
long's your hand been shaking?

28
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,265
- Long as I can remember.
- Been to the doctor?

29
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,707
What for? Lou Sander's
wife was having headaches.

30
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,746
Twenty grand in tests so they
could tell her to take aspirin.

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,383
Lanny Cole checked in the
hospital for a stomachache.

32
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,542
Next day, he checked
out through the morgue.

33
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,585
So, what, nobody
here goes to the doctor?

34
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,949
- Not me.
- Well, you should.

35
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,251
That's right. Dr. Pratt needs
to make them car payments.

36
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,724
Ha-ha-ha.

37
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,954
Seriously, you need
your pressure checked.

38
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,792
- They do that at the drugstore.
- Your sugar, your prostate...

39
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,161
Oh!

40
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,769
I wouldn't let Halle Barry
stick a finger up my ass.

41
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,962
I sure as hell
ain't gonna let you.

42
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,130
I'll see you fools later.

43
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,503
Now, that is what
I'm talking about.

44
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,269
Ooh! MAN 2: Uh-huh.

45
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,471
Greg. Greg.

46
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,013
Chaz, what's up, man?

47
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,276
- What's up? It's been a while.
- Too long. What are you doing here?

48
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,318
I'm waiting for a
friend before class.

49
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,649
- Okay, where'd you wind up at school?
- UIC.

50
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,815
That's good. How's
it going over there?

51
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,427
It's going all right.
I'm running a little late.

52
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,995
Yeah, me too. I
gotta get out of here.

53
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,029
- We should kick it sometime.
- Definitely.

54
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,666
You know where I am. All right?

55
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,359
Cool. Good seeing you, man.

56
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,333
You too. Be safe.

57
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:22,440
You'll probably be home before
me, and Miriam has to leave at 6.

58
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,169
Okay, okay.

59
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,804
Joe, let's review P.E.A. Hm?

60
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,508
Treatable conditions
include hypovolemia...

61
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:36,817
tension pneumothorax,
cardiac tamponade, MI and...

62
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,481
And what's another
cause of P.E.A.?

63
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,683
Huh?

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,022
Reversible etiology of P.E.A.

65
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,357
- Massive pulmonary embolus.
- How could I forget?

66
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,126
- You'll do fine.
- I don't know, my brain is like...

67
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,859
Oh. Sorry.

68
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,199
Sorry. Sorry.

69
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,000
- I have to review this.
- Ten times?

70
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,702
I gave my deposition a year ago. It
looks really bad if I contradict myself.

71
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,642
Didn't do anything
wrong. Tell the truth...

72
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,873
- Okay.
- Sorry.

73
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,353
Who's that, huh?

74
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,049
Wanna go see who's
at the door? Hm?

75
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,824
Who's at the door? It's Miriam.

76
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,725
She's gonna take
you to the park.

77
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,095
Suppose if I can't remember
something, I can run it by the Attending.

78
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,169
But I just don't wanna bug them all
day like I'm a med student or something.

79
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,732
- You okay?
- Ah.

80
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,105
That guy is gonna be
so sympathetic to the jury.

81
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,008
But he doesn't have a
case. You're gonna be fine.

82
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,582
If I lose, they report me
to the national data bank.

83
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,515
It follows me wherever I
go for the rest of my career.

84
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,088
I could be turned down for a job, it
could cut back our income, it can...

85
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,452
- Want me to come to court?
- No, you got a shift.

86
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,027
Well, they've been doing fine
without me for the past couple months.

87
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:53,327
No, it's more important
for you to be at work.

88
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,593
Okay. Good luck.

89
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,266
- Thanks.
- Call me.

90
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,913
The plaintiff's attorney will provoke
you, try to get under your skin.

91
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,245
So you need to stay cool.

92
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,820
If you get defensive, the
jury will turn against you.

93
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,047
- Yeah.
- Keep it brief.

94
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,454
If you elaborate, they'll
think you're evasive.

95
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,118
Don't worry about getting the story
out. I'll ask follow-up questions later.

96
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,426
Right. I'll, uh,
meet you inside.

97
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,530
Mr. Ames, I'm sorry we're here.

98
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,837
I was hoping this
wouldn't have to go to trial.

99
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:18,677
I came in with a cough, and
you sent me out a cripple.

100
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,376
We need to pick a few
boarders from the night shift.

101
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,068
Diverticular abscess awaiting...

102
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,679
Hey, stranger. Welcome back.

103
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,871
Thanks.

104
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,072
I wanna see pictures.

105
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,014
Diverticular abscess
awaiting CT-guided drainage.

106
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,915
- A-fib patient...
- Hey, Abby.

107
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,921
This is embarrassing, but I
never got to wrap your baby gift.

108
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,423
- Oh, that's great.
- Ray.

109
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,623
- Thanks.
- A-fib with rapid ventricular response...

110
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,425
I disposed
Mr. Kerosene to Psych.

111
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,760
He drank kerosene?

112
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,094
More like a high colonic.

113
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,429
Hey, Abby. I'm Tony Gates.

114
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,935
Hi. Didn't you used to be...?

115
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,470
Paramedic. Now I'm an intern.

116
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,301
- Next week, he wants to be a cowboy.
- Astronaut.

117
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,776
I could use some help here.
I got half his tongue on ice.

118
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,278
Oh, man, how'd that happen?

119
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,417
- Wife bit it off.
- Why'd she do that?

120
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,646
She says he talks too much.

121
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,947
All right, come on,
let's put him in Curtain 2.

122
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,589
A liter of saline and a crit.

123
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,780
Ray, you're with me.

124
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,927
Abby, grab some charts,
and, Gates, you're with Abby.

125
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,960
Cunnilingus interruptus.

126
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,567
- They did a grand rounds on it last year.
- Abdominal fullness isn't too bad.

127
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,794
Congratulations on the
bambino. A boy, right?

128
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,062
Yup.

129
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,966
- Can you check a BP?
- Yeah.

130
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,938
Hey, Mr. Dolan,
how are you feeling?

131
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,634
Must be weird coming back, huh?

132
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,903
A little bit.

133
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,240
- Seventy palp.
- Pulsatile abdominal mass.

134
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,212
We better move him.

135
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,842
Sam, this guy is hypotensive.

136
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,851
What? His vitals
were normal at triage.

137
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,252
- Not anymore.
- Add a second line, four of O-neg.

138
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,823
- Labs?
- Dr. Gates?

139
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,359
CBC with platelets, Chem-7,
ProTime, type and cross four.

140
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,464
Good, but add a HemoCue,
EKG, and let's get Surgery on this.

141
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,657
What do you think,
abdominal aortic aneurysm?

142
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,428
- Classic presentation for triple A.
- You think it burst?

143
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,663
No, he'd be dead.
Probably just a steady leak.

144
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,033
You set up for ultrasound?

145
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,142
- Call Radiology for that.
- I'm talking about the ER ultrasound.

146
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,608
That's still out for repair.

147
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,440
- How are we...?
- Radiology brings one.

148
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,809
- How long?
- Depends on how busy they are.

149
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,678
Wow, great to be back.

150
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,876
Pressure's up to
90 with the saline.

151
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,285
All right, looks like he's okay.
I'll call for your ultrasound.

152
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,322
O-neg's here.

153
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,051
So, what's the big guy doing
today? Watching the baby?

154
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,355
No, he's in court.

155
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,195
Mr. Ames, what made
you go to the ER...

156
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:51,861
on February 13th, 2004?

157
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,035
Because I had a cough.

158
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,005
My boss, he brought me in.

159
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,008
I mean, I thought
it was nothing...

160
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:02,274
but he didn't want me working
until I got it checked out.

161
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,683
- How long is the wait?
- Don't talk, please.

162
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,256
How long until I see the doctor?

163
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,392
I don't know. Could be 12 hours.

164
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,391
Twelve hours?

165
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,053
Twelve is good.
We're not that busy.

166
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,392
It's okay, Curtis. I'll
get someone to cover.

167
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,432
No, no, I can work.

168
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,833
How about I just sign in
and I come back later tonight?

169
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,803
You could lose
your place in line.

170
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,702
So I just sit in the
waiting room for 12 hours?

171
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,538
That's how it
works. Be right back.

172
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,784
This seems kind of crazy. How
about I get checked tomorrow?

173
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,922
I need a note you're
not contagious.

174
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,852
I got insurance issues.

175
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,517
Don't give this job away.
I'm gonna be there tomorrow.

176
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,529
<i>Dr. Kovac, when did
you first see Mr. Ames?</i>

177
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,430
I was working at the Admit
desk when he signed in at triage.

178
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,265
How long until I see the doctor?
- It's hard to say.

179
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,270
If you're stable, it
could be up to 12 hours.

180
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,533
Hours?

181
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,743
We have a lot of
sick people here.

182
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,142
Let me just sign in and
I just come back tonight.

183
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm sorry. We can't do that.

184
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,380
So I gotta wait in the
waiting room for 12 hours?

185
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,452
I'll be right back.

186
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,852
This is crazy. I can't do this.

187
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,617
Everything okay, Chuny?

188
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,318
Yeah, he'll settle down.

189
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,463
Do not give the job
away. I will be there.

190
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,930
A lot of patients get
angry about the wait.

191
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,561
Nurse Marquez was able to defuse
the situation before it escalated.

192
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,002
I'm in. You can do the next one.

193
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,733
- Sorry, I...
- Good breath sounds.

194
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,343
You haven't lost your touch.

195
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,445
- BP's 80.
- All right, I need the ultrasound.

196
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,240
They're doing a
rule-out ectopic.

197
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,747
- Where's Surgery?
- Their med student's right there.

198
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,443
Well, that's not doing us
any good. I paged them twice.

199
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,088
Listen, how did it go yesterday?

200
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,622
- How'd what go?
- Court. I heard you had to testify.

201
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,818
It was fine. A lot of questions
about procedure and policy.

202
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,190
But I don't think
they have a case.

203
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,628
Here come the cavalry.

204
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,495
Enlighten me.

205
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,035
Hypotensive pulsatile
abdominal mass.

206
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,866
Say no more. Redline to the O.R.

207
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,200
We're waiting on ultrasound.

208
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,407
- Wrong.
- We're not waiting on ultrasound?

209
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:13,172
Neela, what happens when we wait for
diagnostic tests on a ruptured triple A?

210
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,837
Attempts to
stabilize are fruitless.

211
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,506
Investigations delay therapy,
increase risk of exsanguination.

212
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:18,947
With a 90-percent mortality.

213
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,314
His crit's not so bad, 32.

214
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,546
Meaningless drivel.

215
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,054
- What if it's not triple A?
- Then something else.

216
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,352
Radiology's bringing
over the ultrasound now.

217
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,051
- He'd be dead.
- It'll be seconds.

218
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,163
Zip it, Sparky. Look,
we're admitting him.

219
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,731
- Sparky?
- Let's go.

220
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,634
Did you need me to keep bagging?

221
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,235
Sure, as long as you don't talk.

222
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,463
Oh, by the way, Abby
Lockhart. Lovely to meet you.

223
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,073
Shh.

224
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,035
When did you assume
responsibility for Mr. Ames' care?

225
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,877
The nurse was concerned
about his oxygen level...

226
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,640
so she asked me to see him.

227
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,078
Curtis Ames?

228
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,254
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac.

229
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:05,659
What? What is that?

230
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,236
Uh, low oxygen.

231
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,707
Or just maybe
a dirty fingernail.

232
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,207
Wood stains. They
don't wash off so good.

233
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,346
What kind of work do you do?

234
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,707
Custom carpentry.

235
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,409
Doors, built-in bookshelves,
armoires, you name it.

236
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,919
My father had a wood
shop when I was a kid.

237
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,250
I used to play with the
shavings from the lathe.

238
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,188
I love the smell.

239
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,963
- How did it sound?
- Well, like pneumonia.

240
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,533
- You should be admitted to the hospital.
- Admitted?

241
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,260
Yeah, stay for a couple of days.

242
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,928
No, no, no. I start a
custom remodel today.

243
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,770
Your temp is 102, your
oxygen level is down to 90...

244
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:54,142
and your x-ray shows your right
middle lobe is full of infection.

245
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:59,242
Look, if you wanna get better, we
need to give you IV antibiotics, okay?

246
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:05,217
After he examined you,
then what happened?

247
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,758
He left me with a nurse
who couldn't start an IV.

248
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,927
Okay, this time, I get a flash.

249
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,262
Good. That's good, right?

250
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,496
But it won't thread. I'm sorry.

251
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,435
Keep pressure on this.

252
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,768
I know the drill.

253
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,775
Anyone ever tell you
you have bad veins?

254
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,970
How about just giving
me a shot in the butt?

255
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,672
The antibiotics are ordered IV.

256
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,679
Can I talk to my doctor?

257
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,047
He's with a trauma
patient right now.

258
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,317
How about after he's done?

259
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,117
It could be a while.

260
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,420
Here we go. Fourth
time's a charm.

261
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,865
<i>And how long was it before
Dr. Kovac came to your bedside?</i>

262
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,436
It was more than an hour.

263
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,567
Uh, I saw him
working on a computer.

264
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,041
He was talking to some nurses.

265
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:06,016
Then he had a bagel
with cream cheese.

266
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:10,179
I think it was poppy seed.

267
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,216
And how did that make you feel?

268
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,724
Objection, irrelevant.

269
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,225
On the contrary, Your Honor...

270
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,058
it goes to state of mind
and ability to make decisions.

271
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,291
Overruled. You may answer.

272
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,106
I felt alone.

273
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,036
Forgotten.

274
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,604
Like nobody there
cared about me.

275
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,875
I'm just saying,
he's a frail old man...

276
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,544
who deserves the benefit
of diagnostic confirmation.

277
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:45,590
The patient is now on the
surgical service, not the ER service.

278
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,159
Go downstairs, pull a
cockroach out of someone's ear.

279
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,990
Neela. NEELA:
He's not stable, Abby.

280
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,222
BP's 90 systolic.

281
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,832
Five minutes for an
ultrasound is not gonna kill him.

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,434
I picked up a sterile sleeve.

283
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,399
Why do you insist
on annoying me?

284
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,810
Only take a few minutes.

285
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,798
Ten blade. Want
these two out of my O.R.

286
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,001
- Shirley, call Security.
- All right, all right.

287
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,372
- Dab the bleeders.
- Nice working with you.

288
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,070
Bovie. Stand back.

289
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,724
- Irrigation saline.
- Code red.

290
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,512
Oh, my God!

291
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,384
Unplug the Bovie.

292
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,884
Unplug the Bovie.

293
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,887
And turn off that oxygen
before the whole room goes up.

294
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:26,692
Dr. Kovac, when the
nurses couldn't start an IV...

295
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,801
what action did you take?

296
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,735
I knew I needed to place a
catheter into a deeper vein.

297
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,638
How are you doing?

298
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,970
I didn't know you
ordered acupuncture.

299
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:39,869
I'm Sonya Ames.

300
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,139
Hi, Luka Kovac.

301
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,306
Thanks for taking care of him.

302
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,509
Well, since we can't
get an IV in your arm...

303
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:49,144
I'd like to place a central
line under your collarbone.

304
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,919
That sounds pretty involved.

305
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,390
We need a route to
give IV antibiotics...

306
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,155
or we cannot treat the
pneumonia effectively.

307
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:02,228
I'll numb up your skin and guide
the catheter in at the top of your chest.

308
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,099
There are risks of bleeding,
infection, collapsed lung...

309
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,173
but all of those can be treated.

310
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,910
I gotta think about it.
I gotta think about it.

311
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,604
Wait, no, he doesn't. He...

312
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,680
If you need some
time to consider...

313
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,843
He's just being stubborn. He
hasn't been to a doctor in 20 years.

314
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,852
I never get sick, baby.

315
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,924
You can barely catch your breath,
you've been coughing so much.

316
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,186
It's not that bad, really.

317
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,263
I just want him to get better.
We'll do whatever it takes, okay?

318
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,697
Well, if you want the procedure,
you need to sign this form.

319
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,037
Now, come on, baby,
I've gotta get back to work.

320
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,381
<i>He didn't wanna be in the ER.</i>

321
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,610
He didn't like doctors.

322
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,311
So I felt I needed to
treat him aggressively.

323
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,921
He said it was
the only way to go.

324
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,718
If he left, I was worried he'd get
worse and wouldn't come back.

325
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,588
He told me
complications were rare.

326
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,731
It was no big deal, that
he does these every day.

327
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,890
- His wife works, he's all alone.
- My opinion didn't matter.

328
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,595
If he took pills, he could've died
at home and no one would know.

329
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,731
He gave me and my wife no
other options, no other choices.

330
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,179
We were both
really, really scared.

331
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,088
- Can we grab you a sandwich?
- No, thanks.

332
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,637
Hey, Timmy, uh, is Abby around?

333
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,705
No, no, if she's in
surgery, then don't bother.

334
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,109
It's okay. I'll try later.

335
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,943
Thanks.

336
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,624
Tricuspid regurg.

337
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,624
Ah, the irony. A
bad heart valve.

338
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,559
Left him with right-sided
failure and a big pulsating liver.

339
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,563
- So the mass was his liver?
- Yep.

340
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,032
And the fire saved him
from unnecessary surgery.

341
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,333
A slightly scorched med student and
some burned drapes saved the guy's life.

342
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,838
Lucky guy. Had minor burns.

343
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,670
Excuse me.

344
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,250
Forget how to use that thing?

345
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,983
No, I just...

346
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,712
Didn't wanna be one
of those mothers...

347
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,016
who checks in with the
babysitter every hour.

348
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,421
My babysitter used to
tie me to my high chair.

349
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,891
I'm sure yours is much better.

350
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,555
After your first
dose of antibiotics...

351
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,825
how long were you in the ER?

352
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,163
A long time.

353
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,330
Over three days.

354
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,833
Three days? In the ER?

355
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,008
They said that there were no
other beds in the hospital, so...

356
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,377
Excuse me, I need
to use the bathroom.

357
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,520
- I'll let your nurse know.
- I don't think that I'll be able to...

358
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,919
- I said, I'll let your nurse know.
- It's kind of urgent, please. Plea...

359
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,529
<i>So you stayed in
the hall all that time?</i>

360
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:20,792
<i>They put me in the back at night
so that I could try to get some sleep.</i>

361
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,294
Louie partied a little too hard.

362
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,599
I'd say we're dealing with coke,
PCP and ETOH. Pulled out his line.

363
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,471
- You're gonna need hard restraints.
- I'll rip your head off, I swear.

364
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,545
<i>They kept saying I'd get a
regular room after the first day...</i>

365
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,548
<i>but it never happened.</i>

366
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,046
<i>Nurse? Ahem.</i>

367
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,588
Nurse, I, uh, never
got my breakfast.

368
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,953
You may be NPO.

369
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,887
What is that?

370
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,326
I have to look at your orders.

371
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,730
Where's, uh, Dr. Kovac?

372
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,926
He's not working today.

373
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,568
So who's my doctor, then?

374
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,731
I have to check.

375
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,736
Every 12 hours...

376
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:08,643
an oncoming Resident assumed
responsibility for Mr. Ames' care.

377
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,807
His progress was
discussed. He was improving.

378
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,681
So it was the nurses who
were watching him more closely?

379
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:15,913
Yes.

380
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:21,618
The state recommends an ER
patient-to-nurse ratio of 4-to-1.

381
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:25,788
Yet during Mr. Ames'
stay, the ratio was 8-to-1.

382
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,999
That's eight patients
for every nurse.

383
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,296
How is that possible?

384
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,133
Well, we can't control how
many patients come into the ER.

385
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,834
Dr. Kovac, you know that those
standards are in place for patient safety.

386
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,141
So on a day when the standards
were off by a factor of 100 percent...

387
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,284
did you discuss this with
a hospital administrator?

388
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,613
- No.
- With the director of Nursing?

389
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,222
- No, no, it's not uncommon...
- With a nurse manager?

390
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,621
Look, we're always
short-staffed.

391
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,661
Did you bring this deficiency
to anyone's attention...

392
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,957
or do anything to
address the situation?

393
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,892
It doesn't work like that.

394
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,906
Mariko Shimane, history of
Crohn's disease, vomited blood twice.

395
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,135
Systolic's 88.

396
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,336
Two liters of saline,
type and cross four.

397
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,174
Is there anyone
we can call, Mariko?

398
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,179
- Doctor Derezin.
- From Gastroenterology.

399
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,909
- How about a family member?
- Just me and my son.

400
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,714
- Where is he?
- Oregon.

401
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Sophomore in college.

402
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,648
We can call him.
He'd wanna know.

403
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,087
I'm in the hospital a lot.

404
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,817
Your condition
is pretty serious.

405
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,586
That's what they always say.

406
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,024
Upper GI bleed?

407
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,665
Sure looks like it.

408
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,063
- Hello, Mariko.
- Sorry to bother you, Neil.

409
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,430
That's all right. Any
blood in your stool?

410
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,595
- Yeah.
- She didn't mention that.

411
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,365
- Red blood?
- Yeah.

412
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,032
Endoscopy here or in the GI lab?

413
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,872
Excuse us for a minute.

414
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,215
Dr. Pratt, dude on Line
2 says he's your brother.

415
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,407
Yeah, take a message.

416
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,350
And, Doc Lockhart, Big Daddy
called while you were upstairs.

417
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,887
- Thanks.
- I can't scope her.

418
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,080
Why not?

419
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,024
Crohn's can cause inflammation, erosion
into a vessel along the intestinal tract.

420
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,753
Twenty-five feet
of possibilities.

421
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,592
Not something I can reach.
She needs surgical exploration.

422
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,032
- I'll call the O.R.
- So, what's the good news?

423
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,034
We're gonna move
you to a different room.

424
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,866
It looks like you
need an operation.

425
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,063
Again?

426
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,766
Maybe it's time
to call your son?

427
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,706
He's got midterms, no.

428
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,143
On the afternoon of
his third hospital day...

429
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:25,148
Mr. Ames complained of
numbness in the left hand.

430
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,217
And what was your impression?

431
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,544
How long did it last?

432
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,987
About 10 minutes.

433
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,153
Okay, squeeze my hands.

434
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,730
Okay. Now spread
your fingers like this.

435
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,801
Don't let me close them.

436
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,736
Good.

437
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,464
Well, what do you
think happened?

438
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,233
It could be a number of things.

439
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,604
How's it feel now?
Back to normal?

440
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,240
Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,075
Yeah, I guess so.

442
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,882
The same on both sides?

443
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,420
It's kind of weird.

444
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:04,751
You probably compressed a nerve
while you were resting on your side.

445
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:09,593
I've slept on floors more
comfortable than this bed.

446
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,458
Here, let me take care of that.

447
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,868
Hi, Bed Control?
Yeah, this is Dr. Kovac.

448
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,704
Yeah, I need a med-surge
bed for my patient, please.

449
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,108
And when did the
numbness return?

450
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,542
It was about three hours later.

451
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,777
And was there something
different about this episode?

452
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,787
- Didn't have any feeling for half an hour.
- You're okay now?

453
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,323
It's worse. Went up higher.

454
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,515
Where is Dr. Kovac?

455
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,457
He checked. He
said you were okay.

456
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,290
I'm not okay. I
need to talk to him.

457
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,795
Not right now.

458
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,058
Why? Where is he?

459
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,725
He's taking care of a
patient with a heart attack.

460
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:52,700
Tell him to come and see me.

461
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,966
- When he's through.
- No, no, now.

462
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,006
Mr. Ames, there are
people in this ER...

463
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,577
who are much sicker and
need immediate attention.

464
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,804
Hey.

465
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,211
If he won't come to see
me, then I'm gonna go to him.

466
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,475
Get back in bed.

467
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,812
Something's wrong. I
need to talk to my doctor.

468
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,887
I need you on the
monitor. Frank, help me.

469
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,319
- Take it easy, fella.
- Take it easy?

470
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,391
You people have
ignored me for three days.

471
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,027
No one tells me what's going on.

472
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,095
Nobody gives a damn,
no one will talk to me.

473
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,823
- Mr. Ames, sit down.
- How am I supposed to take it easy?

474
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,367
I am not sitting down until my
doctor does what he's supposed to do.

475
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,868
I need some help here.

476
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,476
- Open your eyes, sir. FRANK:
Let's get a gurney over here.

477
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,940
Mr. Ames? Look at me.

478
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:39,017
Luka, he had a stroke.

479
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,879
Up-going toe.

480
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,489
- CT can take him now.
- Okay, we're on our way.

481
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:49,389
<i>We recognized the stroke,
immediately moved him for monitoring...</i>

482
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,621
<i>and had him to CT
as soon as possible.</i>

483
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,926
From what I remember
is, it was pretty chaotic.

484
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,126
- Why should this guy have a stroke?
- No idea.

485
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,464
Follow my finger, sir.

486
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,572
Sir, look over here. Over here.

487
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,139
Frank, I need a monitored bed.

488
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,401
There aren't any.

489
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,702
Okay, Trauma 2, then.

490
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,209
GSW just took it.

491
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,539
Let's move him to CT.

492
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,478
CT is backed up for a half-hour.
- Where can we put him?

493
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,312
I'll see what I can find.
- Chart, I need his chart.

494
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,613
- I'm looking for it.
- Where's the chart?

495
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,949
I never saw it.

496
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,455
- It's okay, take deep breaths.
- Where's Surgery?

497
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,617
Crenshaw called,
patient's not a candidate...

498
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,592
for anesthesia till
systolic's up to 80.

499
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,459
- All right, tank her up.
- Eight French cordis in femoral.

500
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,225
You know, I have another idea.

501
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,493
Oh, man.

502
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,569
Hey, has anyone
seen a Pocket Doppler?

503
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,729
- Uh, yeah, top drawer by the sink.
- All right.

504
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,499
What about an
intra-aortic balloon?

505
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:36,972
This girl in heart failure?

506
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,509
- No, it's a GI bleed.
- What?

507
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,340
Inflate the balloon
in the chest...

508
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,607
block off the blood
supply to the abdomen.

509
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,250
- No, you can't do that.
- Damn it.

510
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,749
Why not? That's a great idea.

511
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,649
She's not your
patient. Adiós, Gates.

512
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,483
Could be a
publishable case report.

513
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,784
A non-invasive way
to occlude the aorta.

514
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,985
It'll stop the bleeding.
Oh, crap, crap, crap.

515
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,288
What?

516
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,329
Pratt, can you come with me?

517
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,965
Four units of red cells, one
of FFP, a 10-pack of platelets.

518
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,570
We'll be right back.

519
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:09,298
Hey, hey, hey, what is this? Some
kind of post-partum power trip?

520
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,343
- Hey, the aortic balloon will work.
- It's an unproven therapy.

521
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,709
- You'd let her bleed to death?
- No, have the surgeons take her to O.R.

522
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,612
Doesn't look like that's gonna
happen. What's your problem?

523
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:22,016
It cuts off all circulation to the
bowel, liver, kidneys and legs.

524
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,053
Everything could die
from the chest down.

525
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,384
What are we doing in here?

526
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,355
You know, you used
to be such a cowboy.

527
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,688
- Why is this a big deal?
- I don't agree.

528
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,125
Gates thinks it'll work.

529
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,561
Gates is a knucklehead who'd defibrillate
with a car battery and jumper cables.

530
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,794
I am the Attending.
The buck stops here.

531
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,666
So if there's gonna
be a bad outcome...

532
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,739
let Surgery be to blame
for not showing up.

533
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:42,966
So you'd let her die?

534
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,868
No, I just don't wanna be the guy who
kills her with some crazy-ass therapy.

535
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,912
Oh, look, this is
her last chance.

536
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,138
She's pre-arrest.

537
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,149
If her pressure continues to drop
despite massive transfusions...

538
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,048
I would consider...
What are you doing?

539
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,554
I'm pumping. Sorry, my
boobs are about to explode.

540
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,935
When did your wife arrive?

541
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,263
Right after the CAT scan.

542
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,566
By then I could talk
again, you know.

543
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,265
Looks okay.

544
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:22,607
I still can't move
my arm and leg.

545
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:26,218
There's no mass, no
bleeding. That's... That's good.

546
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:28,382
Then, why did he have a stroke?

547
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:32,048
Probably a blood
clot in a brain artery.

548
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:36,161
But, uh, there is
something we can try.

549
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:40,196
What...? What should I do?

550
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:45,869
A medicine called TPA could
probably dissolve the clot.

551
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,440
You're saying that could work?

552
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,602
That I might...? I
can get better, right?

553
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,575
There is some chance of
recovery 30 percent of the time...

554
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:04,121
and, uh, full recovery
10 percent of the time.

555
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,921
We've gotta do something.

556
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,559
What about the side effects?

557
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,570
There's always side effects.

558
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:23,641
Well, there is a 10 percent
chance of, uh, bleeding in the brain...

559
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,505
causing more
disability and death.

560
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,840
Ten percent chance of recovery?

561
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:32,451
There's a 10 percent
chance of death?

562
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:35,019
What if we don't use the drug?

563
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:41,792
There can be some improvement,
uh, with time and physical therapy...

564
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,327
but probably not
a full recovery.

565
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,795
Ah...

566
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,931
Look, look.

567
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:57,202
I've been in this hospital...

568
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:01,814
long enough to know that
if something can go wrong...

569
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,278
it...

570
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:08,852
I don't want it.

571
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,489
And what do you recall...

572
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,821
of Mr. Ames' reaction to
your recommendation of TPA?

573
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,553
I brought in Dr. Saunders,
a neurologist...

574
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,824
to try to explain options
in an objective manner.

575
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,562
The statistics are averages for all
patients, even ones in their 70s and 80s.

576
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,400
Your risk of bleeding is
much less, given your age...

577
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:32,511
and the fact that it's been only 90
minutes since the onset of symptoms.

578
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,475
I don't know.

579
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:40,653
The TPA is your only
shot at complete recovery.

580
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,349
Forget it. I'm not taking it.

581
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,721
Settle down, baby.

582
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:53,491
Look, if it was me,
I'd take the TPA.

583
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,926
If it was you, you'd
be in intensive care...

584
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:03,042
with 10 doctors and nurses watching
your ass every second, day and night.

585
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,232
Curtis.

586
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,844
You wouldn't be getting
the runaround for three days.

587
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:10,779
Not sleeping, not
eating, pissing in a pan.

588
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:15,819
And now I am supposed to trust
you with a medicine that can kill me...

589
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:22,525
when all I've seen since I've
been here is total incompetence?

590
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,130
Mr. Ames, did you
refuse a therapy...

591
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:30,098
that had the potential
to reverse the stroke?

592
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,469
There were no guarantees.

593
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:37,975
Experts have agreed that TPA gave you
the only chance for a complete recovery.

594
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,442
And you didn't want it?

595
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,073
It was, uh, a lot more
complicated than that, really...

596
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,914
Did you refuse a medicine
that could have cured you?

597
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,456
I refused what they were pushing,
and you would have done the same thing.

598
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,795
So you did refuse the cure.

599
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,566
Systolic's only
50 after four units.

600
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,231
All right, hang
another two units.

601
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,310
Uh, I'm above the
diaphragm. Go ahead, inject.

602
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,413
I'm putting in 40 cc's of saline.
Let's hope this damn thing works.

603
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,946
Doc Lock, you got a call.

604
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,913
- Kind of busy right now.
- Balloon is up.

605
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,575
It's your babysitter.

606
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,084
They said it was important.

607
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,278
Pressure's up to 90.

608
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,083
All right, go
ahead. Go, take it.

609
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,419
We're out of the
woods. Mark the time.

610
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,824
Surgeons have one hour to get
her up and fix her or the game is over.

611
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,794
- Hello? SAM: They
should be here any minute.

612
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,593
- What's happening?
- We've got your bleeding controlled...

613
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,168
Is he hungry? Did
you try the stroller?

614
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,217
Thanks for joining us.

615
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,307
What's up with the fluoro? I
thought ER docs had x-ray vision.

616
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,034
Put the phone next to his ear.

617
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,112
Stopped a Crohn's patient from
intra-abdominal exsanguination.

618
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,215
Rather unconventional.
Dare I say, idiotic?

619
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,255
It worked. BP's 122/78.
ABBY <i>If I go there will be trouble</i>

620
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,321
Cross-clamp without
thoracotomy. It's cool.

621
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,854
What's not cool, her kidneys
will be dead in an hour.

622
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,389
- Go, clock's ticking.
- Abby?

623
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,322
It's his favorite song.
Puts him to sleep.

624
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,724
<i>This indecision's bugging me</i>

625
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,808
- Aren't you glad you don't work here?
- She's auditioning for <i>American Idol.</i>

626
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,267
<i>If you don't want me set me free</i>

627
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,164
- Hey, nice work, Abby.
- Thanks.

628
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,306
<i>Exactly whom I'm supposed to be</i>

629
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,975
<i>Don't you know which
clothes even fit me</i>

630
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:24,012
Upstairs, the neurologists
recognized a faint mid-systolic murmur.

631
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,741
What does that mean?

632
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,853
A murmur is from turbulent
blood flow through the heart.

633
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,747
So because of the murmur,
a cardiac echo was ordered...

634
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,585
showing patent foramen ovale.

635
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,661
Do you know what a patent
foramen ovale is, Dr. Kovac?

636
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,263
A small hole between the
upper chambers of the heart.

637
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,730
So that hole could have
allowed a blood clot...

638
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,394
from your subclavian catheter
to pass from the right side...

639
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,563
to the left side of the heart.

640
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,238
And then up to the brain?

641
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,506
It could happen, but
that's extremely rare.

642
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,672
I didn't ask you how
rare it was, Dr. Kovac.

643
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,284
I asked whether a patent
foramen provides a pathway...

644
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,785
for a clot to travel to the
brain and cause a stroke?

645
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,890
- Yes.
- So if you had heard the murmur...

646
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,617
if you had pulled the catheter
when numbness began...

647
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,855
is it possible that you could
have prevented Mr. Ames' stroke?

648
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,226
Objection. Calls
for speculation.

649
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,526
Sustained.

650
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,394
When the numbness began, did
you consider a cardiac source...

651
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:23,406
or did you ignore an important
warning sign of impending stroke?

652
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:24,736
I didn't ignore anything.

653
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,641
I considered what was
probable and acted accordingly.

654
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,214
After Mr. Ames
complained of numbness...

655
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,817
did you then appreciate
his heart murmur?

656
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:36,420
The ER is a noisy place. You
can't always hear subtle murmurs.

657
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,990
Dr. Kovac, I'm not asking you
about the noise level in your ER.

658
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,389
I'm asking, did
you, at any time...

659
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,996
in the three days that
you cared for Mr. Ames...

660
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,132
recognize his heart murmur?

661
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,997
At the time of Mr. Ames' numbness,
there were 47 patients in the ER...

662
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,933
82 in the waiting room.

663
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:56,438
I was taking care of a mother who
was the victim of domestic violence...

664
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,134
nearly beaten to death,
an 8-year-old hit by a car...

665
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,644
- Dr. Kovac.
- And a 53-year-old heart-attack victim.

666
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:06,148
There are always sicker patients in
the ER and it was reasonable to believe...

667
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,082
that Mr. Ames'
numbness could wait.

668
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,812
Order.

669
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,422
Only one can speak at a time.

670
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,118
Your Honor, I move to strike that
tirade be stricken as nonresponsive...

671
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,024
and I request the court
admonish the witness to answer.

672
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,360
Restate the question. And,
doctor, I'm instructing you to answer.

673
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,762
If you had heard the murmur...

674
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,530
is it possible you could
have prevented the stroke?

675
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:27,832
Objection.

676
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,601
Possibility is not the issue.
- Sustained.

677
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:35,873
Dr. Kovac, is it true that you
could have prevented the stroke?

678
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,152
- Well, doctor?
- Counselor, I'm warning you.

679
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,846
No need, I'm done
with this witness.

680
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,622
Scabies family went home...

681
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,354
and Lost Rectal Thermometer
went up to Surgery.

682
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,591
Gates needs you for an
extubation in Trauma 2.

683
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,292
- All right.
- I'm here till 7. Call if you get a break.

684
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,630
Any news from Kovac?

685
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,396
Not yet. CHAZ: Greg.

686
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,040
Hey.

687
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,772
- Am I too early?
- Yeah, just have a seat in triage.

688
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,742
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

689
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,040
It's Abby, right?

690
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,581
Yes. Oh, hi, sorry
about your arms.

691
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,742
It's okay. They fixed
me up pretty good.

692
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,252
Med school wants me to
make a chart for insurance.

693
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,185
Oh, it's no problem, I got it.

694
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,750
- Thank you, Ray.
- Thanks, Ray.

695
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,430
- I guess we can do it in Curtain 4.
- Great.

696
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,624
- Might need a little débridement.
- Go for it.

697
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,599
- So your shift almost over?
- Mm-hm.

698
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,602
They're giving me
two days off to heal.

699
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:38,073
- That's very generous of the surgeons.
- First free night in forever.

700
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,775
Have you been to Rednofive?

701
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,406
Uh, no.

702
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:48,219
They remodeled, and I hear the
DJ on Thursday nights is ridiculous.

703
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,714
You wanna check it out tonight?

704
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,490
Both emergency and
infectious-disease experts agree...

705
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,860
that Dr. Kovac gave
superior treatment...

706
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,763
and above and beyond
the standard of care.

707
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,773
The stroke was a
one-in-a-million complication...

708
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,381
that no one could have
either predicted or prevented.

709
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:23,017
And Dr. Kovac treats the patients
that no other doctor will treat.

710
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:28,117
His ER is the safety net for
millions with no health insurance.

711
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,286
Every day, he is out
there on the front lines...

712
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,126
providing the best
health care possible...

713
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,292
for the people who
need it the most.

714
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,337
If you find against Dr. Kovac...

715
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,303
what message do you send to
other health-care providers like him...

716
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,969
who make that daily struggle
their personal mission?

717
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:54,575
Dr. Kovac could have sent Mr. Ames
home with antibiotic pills, but he didn't.

718
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:58,587
He assumed that Mr. Ames was
unreliable, that he couldn't be trusted...

719
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,923
and so Dr. Kovac took
responsibility for his care.

720
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,087
And then he abandoned
that responsibility...

721
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,165
by subjecting Mr. Ames
to substandard conditions...

722
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:14,068
in an understaffed ER where that man
was shoved into a corner and neglected.

723
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,176
And the warning signs of a
major stroke were ignored...

724
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,245
resulted in a
devastating disability.

725
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,414
Before the stroke, Mr. Ames
was a skilled craftsman.

726
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,219
He supported a
wife and two children.

727
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:33,086
And now, with a paralyzed left arm, loss
of perception in his left visual field...

728
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:36,524
that livelihood has
been taken away.

729
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:43,967
Loss of income, loss of self-esteem,
has resulted in profound stress...

730
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:48,266
and led to a divorce and
separation from his children.

731
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,466
Mr. Ames now lives alone.

732
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:54,571
He's trying to get by on a
disability benefit of $1300 a month.

733
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:59,411
He cannot drive, he sees
his children one day a week...

734
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,349
and he is being
treated for depression.

735
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,121
Your award must fairly
compensate Mr. Ames...

736
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:11,821
for past and ongoing medical
care, for 25 years of lost wages...

737
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,295
and for the pain and
suffering that this man...

738
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:18,403
will experience every
day for the rest of his life.

739
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:23,336
And you wanna make sure that
this part rests against your rib cage...

740
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:26,808
not your armpits,
and then... Oop.

741
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,810
I'm okay. I'm okay.

742
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,007
- You sure those things are safe?
- Yeah, they just need an adjustment.

743
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,642
Or you can go to the
pharmacy and get a new pair.

744
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,345
Good idea.

745
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,013
Careful.

746
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,151
Should we sign you
in as a trauma patient?

747
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,126
I would say yes,
but my shift is over.

748
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,595
Call me if your spleen ruptures.

749
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,528
- Excuse me, hi.
- Hi.

750
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,500
- Is Dr. Pratt around?
- He's with a patient. Can I help you?

751
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,434
He told me he was
gonna be right back.

752
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,472
Will you let him
know Chaz is waiting?

753
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,665
Okay.

754
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,937
- Hey, Neela, you have a minute?
- I have 12 hours. I'm on all night.

755
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,013
- It's about Katey, your med student.
- Ray.

756
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,945
Hey, hey, she asked
me out, all right?

757
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,347
Residents are not allowed
to date their students.

758
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,953
Not my student. Never will be.

759
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,817
She's not doing an ER
elective, it's not against policy.

760
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,618
Well, then, why even ask?

761
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,628
Thanks. Appreciate your help.

762
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,662
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

763
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,322
- Tell Greg I'll call him.
- Okay.

764
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,523
- Hey, Mayday.
- Hello.

765
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,033
- What are you doing here?
- Small bowel obstruction.

766
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,672
Good times. So, uh, how's
the guy who went up in flames?

767
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,899
Minor partial burns to
the chest and abdomen.

768
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,873
You know, I hear
his aorta was just fine.

769
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,378
There's a lesson to be learned
here. Wise men say only fools rush in...

770
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,073
Oh, you missed
a guy called Chaz.

771
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,717
He left?

772
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,713
You were saying?

773
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,517
Hey, Chaz, Chaz, hold up, man.

774
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,922
Sorry about that. I got
caught up with a patient.

775
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,994
It's okay. I gotta go.

776
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,393
Now, come on, man.
Sounded like something serious.

777
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,160
- It's all good.
- Hey.

778
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,595
Things are just not
going so well at home.

779
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,206
Really?

780
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,069
When I wanna
study, it's too noisy.

781
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,711
When I wanna bring my
friends over, Dad won't let me.

782
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,575
I'm always late to class because
the commute takes forever.

783
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,079
What about the dorm?

784
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,717
Costs too much.

785
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,353
When you saw me earlier, I
was looking for apartments.

786
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,490
But they all kind of sucked.

787
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,219
Look, I know this is
gonna sound crazy...

788
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:26,228
but I was thinking, maybe I
could move into your place.

789
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,457
My place?

790
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:33,093
Yeah, your place. I
mean, it's close to campus.

791
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,934
I can get a part-time job
to help you with the rent.

792
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,077
I'm quiet. We'll probably
never even see each other.

793
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:40,303
You're serious?

794
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,641
Ah, Chaz, come on, man.
You know, I got my own style.

795
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,581
Oh, come on.

796
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,620
You say the word, and
I'm gonna clear out for you.

797
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:56,627
And if it doesn't work out,
I'll be gone real fast, man.

798
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,424
Never mind, it's a bad idea.

799
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,168
All right, look...

800
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,404
Let's try it for a month.

801
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:11,299
For real?

802
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,136
Yeah, I'll talk to your mom.

803
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,470
- Thank you.
- All right.

804
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,139
Thank you.

805
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,046
- I'm gonna holler at you.
- All right, man, take it easy.

806
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,615
- Hey. Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah.

807
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,488
So, uh, how was
the first day back?

808
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,529
It was a piece of
cake. Like riding a bike.

809
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,325
Oh, yeah? You
miss your little man?

810
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,092
Yeah, but that's okay.

811
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,498
I'll bond with him again
when I feed him at 11...

812
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,162
and 2 and 5 a.m.

813
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,373
But you know what
was nice about today?

814
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:47,136
For 12 hours, I talked like
a grownup to grownups.

815
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,838
Well, except for when you
had to deal with the surgeons.

816
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,949
Yeah, at least they
don't spit up on you.

817
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,584
Much.

818
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,517
Good night.

819
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:56,985
Try to get some rest.

820
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,181
It's a nice idea.

821
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,891
How long do you
think they'll deliberate?

822
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,495
Shouldn't take more
than a day or two.

823
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,326
Ames' lawyer is
a publicity hound.

824
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,163
The local news is having
a field day trashing County.

825
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:16,172
It'd be good to get you in front of the
press as the doctor found not guilty.

826
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,003
Well, you are very optimistic.

827
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,338
People need to hear
our side of the story...

828
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:24,209
to reassure them that the
County health system works.

829
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:29,985
During that videotape, did you
see the looks on the jury's faces?

830
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:33,655
Doctors get sued for ignoring
and undertreating patients...

831
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,657
not for doing too much.

832
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,853
Plus, you did a
great job on the stand.

833
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,396
I don't think so.

834
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,194
I've been to at least
a hundred trials.

835
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,838
I can tell when a
jury likes the doctor.

836
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,908
He's just another greedy MD
getting rich by overtreating.

837
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,672
- What are you talking about?
- I've read about it.

838
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,841
The drug companies give kickbacks to
doctors who use their expensive drugs.

839
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:03,020
The judge instructed us
not to decide this case...

840
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,053
based on anything
we've heard outside.

841
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:08,625
<i>They neglected this
guy for three days.</i>

842
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,284
<i>His pneumonia was improving.</i>

843
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,522
<i>That doctor used a hand
grenade to kill a mosquito.</i>

844
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,099
<i>To me, that's bad
medical judgment.</i>

845
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,428
<i>You're not a doctor.</i>

846
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,538
<i>We've got to decide this based
on the expert witness definition...</i>

847
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:21,934
<i>of the standard of care.</i>

848
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,439
<i>Well, when you're talking
about County General...</i>

849
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,441
<i>the term "standard
of care" is a joke.</i>

850
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,910
<i>That's right. Kovac
is part of the system.</i>

851
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,808
<i>And we all know
the system sucks.</i>
