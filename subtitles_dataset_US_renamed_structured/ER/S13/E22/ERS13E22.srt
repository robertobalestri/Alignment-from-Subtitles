1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,735
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,377
So you quit your job and
get married in the same week?

3
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,671
I'm a new guy now.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,713
Maybe some of that love
will rub off on all of us here...

5
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:17,681
and help us find someone
as special as you two have.

6
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,783
I got them the honeymoon
suite at the Ritz for a few nights...

7
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,393
but they say they can't
use it on account of Joe.

8
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,688
Oh, it's go time.

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,523
You're a real prick,
you know that?

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,564
- Gates.
- Stop it, Tony.

11
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,703
You know I don't love you.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,667
So that's it?

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,866
- We're done?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,305
Because Ray
couldn't get over you?

15
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,350
Have you seen my other
sock? I just bought these.

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,078
Nobody wears socks in Hawaii.

17
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,850
Oh, I can't believe
it's almost 9:00.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,822
I can't believe
Joe's still asleep.

19
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,928
Couldn't find anyone
to cover your shift?

20
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,291
No, that's the problem
with surprise weddings.

21
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,433
It's hard to plan.

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,969
I'll stop by later.

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,362
I have to tie up some
loose ends with Anspaugh.

24
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,208
You've gotta be kidding me.

25
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,344
What?

26
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:22,112
Married five days and I'm already
getting mail addressed to Mrs. Luka Kovac.

27
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,347
Nice.

28
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,353
You know, being married isn't
gonna change the fact that I don't cook.

29
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,956
Or sew.

30
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,891
Or keep track of your socks.

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,721
Okay, that's fine in Chicago.

32
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,490
But on our honeymoon...

33
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,793
you're gonna be serving
me martinis wearing only this.

34
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,171
You got me a bikini.

35
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:48,298
I'm a liberated modern husband.

36
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,672
And I like to shop.

37
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,052
Abby and Luka are crazy.

38
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:06,159
Who turns down three free nights
in the honeymoon suite at the Ritz?

39
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,692
Hope?

40
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,756
Wow.

41
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,527
Oh, my... Ohhh.

42
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,871
You know, when I was 8, I found
this book in my parents' bedroom:

43
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,509
<i>Sex and the Christian Marriage.</i>

44
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:28,206
And the very first page, it said,
"Orgasms bring a couple closer to God."

45
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,944
So that night at the dinner table, I
asked my parents what an orgasm was.

46
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,014
What did they say?

47
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,713
An orgasm is a very
special kind of prayer.

48
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,859
Which is fine and
actually kind of sweet.

49
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,588
But, like, later that week, I had my
first sleepover at a friend's house.

50
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,062
So her mom asked me
what my bedtime routine is.

51
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:49,067
And I said, "Bath,
toothbrushing, orgasm, sleep."

52
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,602
You did not.

53
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,933
I did. I was never invited back.

54
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,471
Heh. Champagne?
It's 8 in the morning.

55
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,374
I have no sense
of time in this place.

56
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,226
Arch, you gotta be
at work in like an hour.

57
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,247
- Shh. Dirty word.
- What is?

58
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,885
- Work.
- Oh.

59
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,281
Well, I don't have
to be in till 4...

60
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,618
so you go ahead, and then
I'll check us out of the room.

61
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,815
No, no, no.

62
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,484
No, no, we're
staying another night.

63
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,163
Another three nights.

64
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,389
What? That's crazy.

65
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,228
This room must be, like,
a thousand dollars a night.

66
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,760
They comped us.

67
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,071
Why would they do that?

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,904
I guess we're spending so much on
room service, we made it worth their while.

69
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,445
Now, mimosa?

70
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,273
- Mimosa.
- Oh.

71
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,114
Hey.

72
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,757
Damn it.

73
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,951
Hey, hey, Bettina.

74
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,120
Hey, hold on.

75
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,499
All right, all right,
look, look. Heh.

76
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,095
I got it now.

77
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,463
I figured you out.

78
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,865
Figured me out?

79
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,969
You've had it with guys who try to be
cool. You're ready for someone real.

80
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:06,204
- Got someone you wanna set me up with?
- Help me out, okay? I've seen the light.

81
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,144
You're just saying what I
need to hear to go out with you.

82
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,477
No, it's not like that.

83
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,642
Really. Really.

84
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,288
Greg, I like you.

85
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,947
But I have been dating
guys like you for years.

86
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:23,154
You will do whatever it takes to get the
girl, but in the end, it's about the chase.

87
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,995
Bettina, I'm not
like that anymore.

88
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,659
I've changed.

89
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,198
This is it? They closed
the ER for a paint job?

90
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,568
It's only been a few days.

91
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,676
Can't expect a drastic
change overnight.

92
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,506
My point exactly,
Dr. Pratt. See you later.

93
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,910
- I've got Radiology rounds in the ICU.
- Wait.

94
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,483
Pratt, I got a hypotensive
patient here, 87/45.

95
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,262
- What's her baseline? Whoa!
- Dr. Pratt.

96
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,413
She runs low, always has.

97
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,522
Why is it that you
know that and I don't?

98
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,021
She's febrile too, 103.

99
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,057
Okay, any vomiting?
Any coughing?

100
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,387
Just a little belly pain.

101
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,496
I could see my doctor
when I get home.

102
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,743
- Where's home?
- Boston.

103
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,662
We're here for her
physics conference.

104
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,064
I'm gonna cut his eyes
out and send them in a box.

105
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,703
Need some help here.

106
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,204
Sam, liter of saline, monitored
bed. I'll be in as soon as I can.

107
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:11,038
- Can't he just give me an antibiotic?
- We've been in triage nearly three hours.

108
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,045
Sorry. This is how it goes
here. Let me see if there's a bed.

109
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,546
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

110
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,509
Oh, Sam.

111
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,415
Meet my parents, Barb and
Len. They're from Long Island.

112
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,850
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

113
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,389
Hey, Weston, you're up.
This guy needs a chest tube.

114
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,221
- I'll find you guys later.
- Okay, bye.

115
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,219
You must be very proud
of Larry. Have a good tour.

116
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,696
You're even prettier
than he said you were.

117
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,132
We're so happy he
finally found a girlfriend.

118
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,872
Let me out of here.

119
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,747
- Where did they move the ortho stuff?
- I'm sorry for springing my parents...

120
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,751
I am not your
girlfriend. You know that.

121
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,152
Oh, come on.

122
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,421
Sam...

123
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,989
We made out.

124
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,494
At a wedding.

125
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,258
That's what drunk single
people do at weddings.

126
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,696
Doesn't mean we're an item.

127
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,866
Well, I'm not the type to
take sex casually, Sam.

128
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,562
We did not have sex.

129
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,271
- It depends on how you define sex.
- Larry, we did not have sex.

130
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,605
- What, outercourse doesn't count?
- Oh, my God.

131
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,405
What?

132
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,910
- Ace or splint?
- Ace is cool.

133
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,110
Where are all the improvements
you guys did while you were closed?

134
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,220
What? You didn't see
the new admit desk?

135
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,348
Or how about our electrical
outlets? They are a new shade of red.

136
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,360
- All right, how did you hurt your ankle?
- Running all over the hospital...

137
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,020
- with Dr. Moretti.
- Who?

138
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,459
Dr. Moretti, he's
head of the ICU.

139
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,628
- I'm doing a month up there with him.
- Wiggle your toes.

140
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,069
I'm wearing the pager for
the Rapid Response Team.

141
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,141
- The what?
- Moretti's latest invention.

142
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,574
When nurses get a bad feeling
about the patients, they call us, we run.

143
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,114
- Oh, like a code team.
- More like a pre-code team.

144
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,212
Why don't you have the docs
look at your ankle just to be sure?

145
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,982
- As long as it's not Ray.
- Yeah, you got it.

146
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,956
Okay, Morris, you finally
close the deal with Hope or not?

147
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:12,725
Hey, all I can say is this is the first
time I left our hotel room in three days.

148
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,334
- Ha.
- Mostly, we're just praying.

149
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,664
- A lot of special prayers. Huh?
- Heh-heh.

150
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,999
What about you and
our favorite radiologist?

151
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,438
Come on, you gotta
respect a woman's privacy.

152
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,838
You sly dog.

153
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,002
- Anybody see Ray around?
- No, he's late.

154
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,149
He's probably still hung-over.
He was in pretty bad shape.

155
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,012
And, Sam, whoo, baby.

156
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,847
- Wild night, huh?
- Please shut up.

157
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,353
Katey Alvaro's in Curtain
2. She twisted her ankle.

158
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,493
- Doesn't look broken, but take a look.
- I'm on it.

159
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,321
Larry. Hmm.

160
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,463
I'm gonna kill him.

161
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,464
Hey, anybody see our
physicist in Curtain 3?

162
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,193
Yeah, I gotta slow down an
SVT, but she's next for sure.

163
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,371
Excuse me, we're
still waiting for a doctor.

164
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,871
I'm sorry, we're really busy.

165
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,668
How you feeling?

166
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:56,866
Run-down.

167
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,445
I've been working my ass off for six
months prepping for this conference.

168
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,842
Six months?

169
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,540
Try 20 years.

170
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:07,677
You've been working on quantum
processing your entire career.

171
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,878
Quantum processing?

172
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,786
Theory in physics
which says that an atom...

173
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,052
can exist in two
places at the same time.

174
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,492
And I showed that it can
work in a larger matrix.

175
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,394
I have no idea what you just
said, but it sounds impressive.

176
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,035
Yeah, pretty much blew
the lid off the entire field.

177
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,129
I think what you've
got is probably viral.

178
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,865
But I'm gonna send some
blood tests to be safe.

179
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,341
Sam, we're gonna do
dinner at 8 at Osteria Angelo.

180
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,976
Great. Have a good time.

181
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,583
I don't mean to sound like an
uptight mainlander, but I just...

182
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,556
I find it hard to believe that you
can't rent a car with a car seat in it.

183
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,422
Okay. Right, we'll
bring our own.

184
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,393
Yes, <i>mahalo</i> for nothing.

185
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,761
Sophia Van Brummelen, 35,
fell down 15-foot flight of stairs.

186
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,333
Can you tell me your name?

187
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,462
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Roll her on her side.

188
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,402
Please be okay. Let her be okay.

189
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,097
- Abby, need some help here.
- Hello?

190
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,367
What happened?

191
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,011
- She fell down the stairs...
- I wanna hear it from her.

192
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,658
She slipped and fell.

193
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,180
Her head was
bouncing on the stairs.

194
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,284
When she got to the bottom, she
wasn't moving and wasn't talking.

195
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,112
Any medications or allergies?

196
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,914
- No, she's healthy.
- Mice.

197
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,750
Okay, we're gonna
take care of you.

198
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,843
Access? GATES:
18-gauge in the antecube.

199
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,672
- She's seizing.
- Ativan, 2 mgs.

200
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,023
Get Trauma down here.

201
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,427
I need a second line and
50 of mannitol right away.

202
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,932
I've got a dilated stomach with
exaggerated incisura. Call Ultrasound.

203
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,434
- Why?
- Caterpillar sign.

204
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,071
Could be pyloric stenosis.

205
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,231
Pratt, I need an antibiotics
order for our physicist in 3.

206
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,648
Micro called. She's got
gram-positive cocci on the stain.

207
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,172
Probably contaminated. She
looks too good to be septic.

208
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,481
She's still febrile and tachy.

209
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,982
How'd you know how she
looks? You haven't seen her.

210
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,610
Got an obstructed newborn, a
perfed ulcer on his sixth unit of blood...

211
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,314
and my aphasic boxer
dropped his pressure in CT.

212
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,983
Give her 2 grams of ceftriaxone,
and I'll see her as soon as I can, okay?

213
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,029
Guess what. I'm house-sitting
for Luby while they're away.

214
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,328
- Luby?
- Luka and Abby.

215
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,659
You know, like Brangelina,
Bennifer, TomKat?

216
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,305
I hear it's a nice place.

217
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,931
- Abby says it's okay if you sleep over.
- What? Are you for real?

218
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,978
I didn't think it would be right to
have sex in their bed without asking.

219
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,867
Load him with a
gram of Dilantin.

220
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,575
- What's that?
- Medicine to keep her from seizing again.

221
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,310
You wanna be here? Step back.

222
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,615
- More suction.
- Cranked all the way up.

223
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,655
- Nothing's coming out.
- Come on, Gates.

224
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,656
- Can't see crap.
- Sats are down to 86.

225
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,761
- Is that bad?
- Abby, switch with Gates.

226
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,648
I haven't even tried yet.
- Exactly.

227
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,859
- I'm being blamed for equipment failure?
- Don't make this about you, please.

228
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,192
What are you doing?

229
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,531
The tube will allow
us to breathe for her.

230
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,105
Is he mad about the propofol?

231
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,208
Yeah, that or the
thing at the wedding.

232
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,207
- What happened at the wedding?
- Nothing.

233
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,937
Yeah, it's the propofol. He
wants me to kiss the ring.

234
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,048
Well, why don't
you just apologize?

235
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,617
- I have nothing to apologize for.
- Chest tube. Call Respiratory...

236
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,222
Post-op morbidity and mortality
are up 7 percent this year.

237
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,187
- Really? Why?
- I'm gonna find out.

238
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,554
I'm conducting an
internal audit into Post-Op.

239
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,822
I want every med, every
hiccup, meticulously recorded.

240
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,329
Nurses are gonna hate you.

241
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,858
No, they'll hate you. You're
in charge of the investigation.

242
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,226
It's the ER. Trauma call.

243
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,668
Not you, Dusty. I want
you in the PACU unit.

244
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,070
You're not doing consults
till the audit's over.

245
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,176
Aw, boo.

246
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,409
- Hey.
- Hey.

247
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,110
Hey.

248
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,407
Surgery's here, what do you got?

249
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,695
A 35-year-old, fell
down a flight of stairs.

250
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,525
Head trauma, intubated,
FAST negative, labs pending.

251
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,066
Came in altered.
Five-centimeter scalp lac.

252
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,727
- Access? GATES:
Eighteen-gauge times two.

253
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,668
First crit 37,
second one cooking.

254
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,535
- Okay.
- Want me to bag for you?

255
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,040
- No, I got it.
- Bolus is done.

256
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,906
Better run D5
half at 75 an hour.

257
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,445
Don't want a fluid overload
till we know what's going on.

258
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,206
It was a nice wedding.

259
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,941
Thanks.

260
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,017
Sorry I got so crazy.

261
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,156
I think because I knew I was
leaving, I let it all hang out.

262
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,717
I mean, you hardly even know me.
And then I had to go and be like that.

263
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,630
Don't worry about it.

264
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,891
Dr. Morris, your
TPA patient is seizing.

265
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,093
- I'm busy here, find Pratt.
- Don't worry about it. I got it, go.

266
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,465
Mae Lee, call CT. Tell
them we're coming up.

267
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,606
Is there a Megan Strand here?

268
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,105
That's me.

269
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,904
Neighbors heard screaming
in your house this morning.

270
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,307
We were having an argument.

271
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,309
Where the hell
is my ceftriaxone?

272
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,216
No, it's Pratt.

273
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,482
P-R-A-T-T.

274
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,591
Hell, no, I'm not new. Are you?

275
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,920
Just send the stuff down.

276
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,290
I ordered the antibiotics
over an hour ago.

277
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,659
Learned helplessness
is pervasive in the ER.

278
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,599
Can't have a homeschooled
pharmacy tech wag the dog.

279
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,097
You rang?

280
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,605
What's going on? Who are you?

281
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,835
I'm Dr. Kevin Moretti. I'm
the clinical director of the ICU.

282
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,503
We were called because
your wife is deteriorating.

283
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,181
- Talk to me.
- Fever at 103.

284
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,442
Stain showed
gram-positive cocci.

285
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,950
- We thought it was a contaminant.
- Which is stupid.

286
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,488
Katey, set up for a subclavian.
Prime the line and get a CVP monitor.

287
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,455
Draw lactate now, you.

288
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,426
And give me six units of packed
blood cells standing by in the blood bank.

289
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,792
- Who is the Attending on this case?
- Me.

290
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,991
Really? You dropped
the ball, didn't you?

291
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,033
- Excuse me?
- She's septic.

292
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,262
It's obvious. You
should've anticipated this.

293
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,598
She's young, she's
healthy, she had no reason...

294
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,732
She doesn't need a reason. Heh.

295
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,237
A reason. Breathe, please.

296
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,238
Katey, do you see any signs
of impending shock here?

297
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,849
Tachycardia out of proportion with
the fever, widening pulse pressures.

298
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,387
See that? Even a medical student
could see it coming from a mile away.

299
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,320
Must be some
new Attending thing.

300
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,823
We'll take care of your wife.

301
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,292
- I can manage my patients, thank you.
- Really?

302
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,261
Why did one of your nurses
activate my team? Excuse me.

303
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,494
I knew you were getting
slammed. She needed attention.

304
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,502
The Rapid Response Team
doesn't even cover the ER.

305
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,402
If you can't handle cases
like this, maybe we should.

306
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,901
Give me 1 percent
lido. Let's go.

307
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,210
Explain this again, I don't
understand. My wife is healthy.

308
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,541
- Calm down.
- It's okay.

309
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,051
Bacteria could've seeded the bloodstream
through lungs, a cut, intestines.

310
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,915
- Second liter's in.
- Mm-hm.

311
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,887
Goal-directed resuscitation
for septic shock...

312
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,720
is so easy yet so
difficult for you ED types.

313
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:21,986
She's in shock?

314
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,562
- Systolic's only 82.
- That would be a yes.

315
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,098
The key is to preserve
effective tissue perfusion...

316
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,895
while avoiding excess
myocardial oxygen consumption.

317
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,597
Translation: get oxygen to the
body without stressing the heart.

318
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,436
We need CVP monitoring and continuous
central venous sats to keep track of that.

319
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,579
See that? He's learning already.

320
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,443
That requires ICU-level
monitoring. We're too busy here.

321
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,084
- We can't do that.
- Really? You can't?

322
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,583
You can and you will.

323
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,745
- Watch.
- We don't have the nursing capacity.

324
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,413
Patients come in. We stabilize
them, then send them up.

325
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,615
That's how it works.

326
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,284
Yeah, you forgot about that eight
hours that they sit around in triage.

327
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,171
Wait another five to get a bed.

328
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,558
It's not great, okay,
but it's the reality.

329
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,532
Reality is nothing more
than a persistent illusion.

330
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:04,966
Einstein said that.

331
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,462
I'm a physicist.

332
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,575
- Memorized everything he ever wrote.
- See that?

333
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,611
Even more reason not to sit around and
let your organs rot away like rancid meat.

334
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,112
Nobody's organs are rotting.

335
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,944
Free air under the diaphragm.
Probably perfed diverticulum.

336
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,141
What's that mean?

337
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,811
That means an infection in your
intestines has eroded through the wall.

338
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,651
We need to clean,
repair the hole.

339
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,486
Lucien, don't you get tired
of ER docs waiting around...

340
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,220
for the surgeons to come
down and save the day?

341
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:34,424
Give them a break. You know what it's
like. I'm gonna call O.R. to bring her up.

342
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,560
True, I know that we're just monkeys
on a minor planet on an average star...

343
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:42,231
but let's not pretend that
sepsis is beyond our reach.

344
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,810
If you're trying to quote
Hawking, you mangled it.

345
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,847
I think I'm in love. - Allison.

346
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,574
- What are you doing here, Blake?
- Hey, she called me.

347
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
- Hey, whoa, guys.
- You don't get to do this.

348
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,184
- Hey, whoa, come on.
- She wants me here, okay?

349
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,357
Come on. Whoa!

350
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,890
Stay away from my wife!

351
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,656
- Where are you taking her?
- CT scan.

352
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,358
- Can I go too?
- No, you stay here.

353
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,094
Dr. Gates will be with
her the whole time.

354
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,202
Is everything okay?

355
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,869
No, my girlfriend's in a coma.

356
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,206
It's all my fault. So no,
everything is not okay.

357
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,711
All your fault? How's that?

358
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,313
I left my rollerblades
at the top of the stairs.

359
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,386
It's polished concrete.
It's very slippery.

360
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,920
We were fighting
and she tripped.

361
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,056
Did you explain to the cops?

362
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,990
- I'm sure they'll sort it out.
- Yeah.

363
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,326
No, it's been a bad year.

364
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,330
How so?

365
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,436
We moved to Chicago
five months ago for my job.

366
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,372
Ever since, we've
been fighting constantly.

367
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,670
These huge dish-breaking fights.

368
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,336
And we never used to do that.

369
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,078
It's like the city's
changed her.

370
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,885
Well, transitions are hard.

371
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,257
We've been together
ever since college.

372
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,360
Been through a lot.

373
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:13,831
You know, us coming out to
her family and her brother dying.

374
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,930
You think you can make
it through that stuff...

375
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,471
you think you can
make it through anything.

376
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:28,106
Who knew after 15 years
that everything would turn?

377
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,079
So much?

378
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,978
It's scary.

379
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,490
Yeah.

380
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,926
Quantum information
processing, teleportation.

381
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,962
We've been chasing the same
questions since grad school.

382
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,895
Sorry if he feels
threatened by it...

383
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,434
but there are conversations she
can only have with me, vice versa.

384
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,969
But it's only work, right?

385
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,199
Yeah, we're both
married. Happily married.

386
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,601
Can't say that the idea's never crossed my
mind, but Allison and I just really click.

387
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,307
I don't know anybody else, male or
female, who challenges me like she does.

388
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,651
They have this thing.

389
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,988
They're together in the lab all
day, and then she gets home...

390
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,286
and everything's, "Blake
said this, Blake did that."

391
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,655
Something about it
has always felt weird.

392
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,128
He's her work husband.

393
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,428
Yeah, people spend more time
at work than they do at home.

394
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,835
You share experiences,
develop a verbal shorthand.

395
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,565
Of course some
intimacy develops.

396
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,143
The two men in my life,
they don't get each other.

397
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,802
Really? Never would've noticed.

398
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,176
- The O.R. is ready.
- Okay.

399
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,309
Two planets revolving around the
same sun. Collision is inevitable, right?

400
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,286
They try to stay out
of each other's orbits...

401
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,185
to keep the solar
system in order...

402
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,350
but, oh, it's a
useless exercise.

403
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,791
- Disorder rules.
- Oh, yeah.

404
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,261
The universe always
reverts to equilibrium.

405
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,861
I'll see you upstairs, okay?
- Wait.

406
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,436
Honey, I'm sorry. I
went a little crazy.

407
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,834
James.

408
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,635
James.

409
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,936
I want you to do
something for me.

410
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,706
- Am I gonna have a scar?
- The edges came together nicely.

411
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,939
It'll be small.

412
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,675
I have to head back to ICU,
but I wanted to suggest...

413
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,286
that you write this case
up for M and M next week.

414
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,785
What's M and M?

415
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:20,518
It's a conference where we present
our mistakes and learn from them.

416
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,389
- You made a mistake with Allison?
- No.

417
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,393
Will you please
excuse us for a minute?

418
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,028
What are you trying to do?

419
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,225
Trying to wake you up.

420
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,567
Why talk like that in front of a
patient? How does that help anyone?

421
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,231
- Where did you go to medical school?
- Here.

422
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,173
- And your Residency?
- Here.

423
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,573
Mm-hm. Your internship?

424
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,873
Why are you asking?
You know it was here.

425
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,847
Because I think that you have
been lulled into complacency...

426
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,043
by too many years in this place.

427
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,484
You got a problem with
the ER, you talk to Kovac.

428
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,055
No, it's too late for Kovac.

429
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,714
He's the old guard.

430
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,157
I think you could really
turn things around here.

431
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,920
You're really
starting to bore me.

432
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,328
How about you go up and harass your
own department and stay out of mine?

433
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,231
It's always nice to
talk to you, Dr. Pratt.

434
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,702
Will someone make
this jerk disappear?

435
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,705
Who? PRATT: The guy is toxic.

436
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,899
What guy?

437
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,273
Oh, hey, excuse me.

438
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,775
Excuse me. Can you hold up?

439
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,507
- You finish interviewing Megan Strand?
- Yeah.

440
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,380
We're waiting to see if we can
get a statement from Sophia.

441
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,851
That might be a while.

442
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:26,117
But listen, I was talking to Megan
and her affect seems totally appropriate.

443
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,284
The injury matches
her story, and I'm just...

444
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,295
- I'm not getting that abuse vibe.
- Thanks, doc.

445
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,933
Write that in the record.
Helpful if it goes to court.

446
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,693
- Right. Thanks.
- It's how much?

447
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,200
No promotional rate?

448
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,736
What about
frequent-flier programs?

449
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,635
AAA?

450
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,709
Three more nights at the
honeymoon suite. Charge the card.

451
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,277
Don't get snarky, I'm fragile.

452
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,778
Oh. I thought things were
going well with you and Hope.

453
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,382
Yeah, they are. Really well.

454
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,280
Staircase girl has a head bleed.

455
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,419
Frontal parenchymal bleed?

456
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,718
Yeah, less common than sub or
epidural, but consistent with a fall.

457
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,588
Okay, I'll call
Neurosurge, thanks.

458
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,662
Hey, Neela. Hey.

459
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,559
Have you heard
anything from Ray yet?

460
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,461
No, I thought he'd be here.

461
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:11,434
Yeah, well, maybe when the ER
closed, maybe schedules got confusing.

462
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,130
- Yeah.
- I'll try paging him again.

463
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,502
Hey, I hear you're taking
the gastroschisis kid.

464
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,507
I'm about to write
the admission orders.

465
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,737
Operating on adhesions
create new adhesions?

466
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,849
Possibly, but we don't have a
choice if he's acutely obstructed.

467
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,349
All right, I'll keep
him NPO. Thanks.

468
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,852
Hey, I got a snake breeder
with a fang in her leg.

469
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,855
Nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks for the consult.

470
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,792
Hey. What?

471
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,157
What'd I do?

472
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,128
- This is easy for you, isn't it?
- What?

473
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,995
"Did you see my
gastroschisis kid?"

474
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,830
- Like nothing happened.
- You're not...

475
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,529
- How can you be so casual?
- You're the one who broke up.

476
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,174
Meg, Sarah, everything
just rolls right off of you.

477
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,708
Why don't you tell me how
upset you want me to be?

478
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,505
On a scale of one
to 10. A seven?

479
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,545
When you feel
needy, crank it to eight.

480
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,649
Down to five when you
wanna get work done?

481
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,876
Now you're being an ass.

482
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,885
You think this doesn't upset
me, it does. This is painful.

483
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,317
But you want what you want.

484
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,981
We'll figure out how we'll
work without the drama.

485
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,389
But now I realize
something. You like this.

486
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,859
- You want drama.
- Not true.

487
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,726
It is true, no matter how I
act, you're gonna be upset.

488
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:13,957
You know why?

489
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,626
Because that's the only way you can
maintain this stupid narcissistic game.

490
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,474
Wow. I hope that
never happens to us.

491
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,648
They managed to
repair her intestine...

492
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,463
but her blood pressure
dropped very low.

493
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,883
It'll be a while before
we know anything.

494
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,919
Six hours ago, she was giving a
talk in front of hundreds of people.

495
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,260
How did she end up here?

496
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,060
Well, sometimes
things just happen.

497
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,633
There's really no way
to make sense of it.

498
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,633
She's not in pain?

499
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,602
I'll make sure she
has a morphine order.

500
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,500
How is she doing?

501
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,168
Still needs dopa to keep her systolic
above 85. I think she's third-spacing.

502
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,440
She had a touch of DIC,
lost 2 liters in the O.R.

503
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,278
Hey, why didn't you scrub in?

504
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,944
- I wasn't sure that you'd want me to.
- Why wouldn't I?

505
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,612
Oh, men are impossible.

506
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,782
- Listen, Neela, about the...
- Do you think I'm a narcissist?

507
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,919
Well, to a certain
extent, all surgeons are.

508
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,359
Yeah, it's good for the job.

509
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,499
Hey, guys, Mae
Lee's off to the airport.

510
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:24,125
I just wanted to thank you
guys for an amazing experience.

511
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,772
- Goodbye, Mae Lee.
- Yeah, strong work this month, Mae Lee.

512
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,708
It's the ER. One final
consult before you go?

513
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,510
Call me if you're
ever in San Francisco.

514
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,818
Little freak tried to
kiss me at the wedding.

515
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,055
What's she doing
here? Get her to the ICU.

516
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,055
Runs of V-tach. She's
not ready to move.

517
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,285
Come on. It's a
hundred feet of corridor.

518
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,395
Better for her to code
in the ICU instead.

519
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,723
Well, for her or for us?

520
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,900
I'm serious, Neela.
We got five full O.R.'s.

521
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,228
We need to make room. Let's go.

522
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,894
<i>She loves tulips.</i>

523
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,164
Yellow.

524
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,137
No, no, no. White.

525
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,641
White, two dozen white tulips...

526
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,834
Hey, newlyweds.

527
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,003
To be delivered to
Room 1258 at the Ritz.

528
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,671
How's it feel, guys?

529
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,079
You know Morris is staying
in our honeymoon suite?

530
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,879
- What?
- Yep, with Hope.

531
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,419
They won't leave.

532
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,227
Did you wake up
feeling different?

533
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,413
- Not really.
- Yeah.

534
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,081
- Just a little.
- Not that much.

535
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:24,060
Wedding was awesome. Hope that thing
I did didn't make you lose your deposit.

536
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,926
- What thing?
- What? Hey, everyone.

537
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:31,059
In the ER, for the first time,
Mr. and Mrs. Luka Kovac.

538
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:32,732
Yeah, oh, sorry, Abby.

539
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,773
Dr. and Mrs. Luka Kovac.
Doctor and doctor, sorry.

540
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,171
Chief, aren't you supposed
to be in Bora Bora?

541
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,212
Hawaii, and I just attended my
last department-head meeting.

542
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,212
So I'm officially no
longer your chief.

543
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,577
- You're kidding.
- Wow.

544
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,948
It's like your wedding happened
and now everything's changed.

545
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,716
You're married, I'm with Hope,
you're not the chief anymore...

546
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,586
there's new ramps
in the bathroom.

547
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,388
It's a brave new world.
Gates is still a pain in the ass.

548
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,691
- There's something you can count on.
- You done? Had enough?

549
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,027
Tony, there's a lawyer
who needs to talk to you.

550
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,225
Thanks, Dawn.

551
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,564
Hide, Gates. I'll tell
him you went home sick.

552
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,229
I'm going. See you at home.

553
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,806
Okay.

554
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,443
Being married does
feel a little different.

555
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,203
Yeah, it does.

556
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,608
Aw.

557
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,312
Look at that.

558
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:17,975
Lucien. DUBENKO: Hey, Luka.

559
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,484
Abby, I saw the Cheetos bezoar.

560
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,643
Send him home on
MiraLAX, follow up with GI.

561
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,618
- Okay, done.
- Nice wedding, by the way.

562
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,258
I offered to replace the bidet.

563
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:27,753
What bidet?

564
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,124
Abby, your head injury
in Trauma 2 lost her pulse.

565
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,889
Clear.

566
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,334
Still V-fib. Going again.

567
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,025
And clear.

568
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,597
They paged me. What's going on?

569
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,742
Her heart went into
dangerous rhythm.

570
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,188
Oh, my God. MARQUEZ: Epi's in.

571
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,574
All right, back up. Back up.

572
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,339
- Clear.
- Resuming CPR.

573
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,914
- No, no, baby. Don't do this.
- Lidocaine's ready.

574
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,363
Is Neurosurge involved?

575
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,818
There's nothing to evacuate.
Bleed's parenchymal.

576
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,512
You can't leave
me now, you hear?

577
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:57,917
Go ahead, give the lido.

578
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,685
The things that we said,
the way we were, it's not us.

579
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,350
Right?

580
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,931
- You're my rock, always calm.
- Another epi, charge to 360.

581
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,624
When you said Chicago
changed her, what did you mean?

582
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,263
That she's been
testy and paranoid.

583
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,873
- Oh, my God. Please don't.
- Okay, clear.

584
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,066
- Watch out.
- Please clear.

585
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,735
- We have a pulse.
- She's back.

586
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,842
Oh, God. Thank you.

587
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,151
What do you think of this film?

588
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,626
Frontal lobe bleed, no shift.

589
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,691
You think it could be
a preexisting AVM...

590
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,165
exacerbated by the head trauma?

591
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,466
A frontal lobe mass would explain the
personality and the behavioral changes.

592
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,868
You're a romantic, Abby.

593
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,907
- What?
- You don't wanna believe...

594
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,706
that after years of partnership,
they started hating each other.

595
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,142
Call Radiology. If you're
right, she needs angio.

596
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:04,047
The girl's lived with you for 10 years.
Closest thing she's had to a father.

597
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,385
- So that's gotta count for something.
- It does.

598
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,585
Given the situation, you have
equal standing to seek custody.

599
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,697
Equal as her grandparents? Even
though I'm not a blood relative?

600
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,334
Yep, especially if Sarah
wants to stay with you.

601
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,938
Oh. I just thought, because I wasn't
related... This is good. All right, good.

602
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,766
Good, what else? What's next?

603
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,498
The first thing
is talk to Sarah.

604
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,007
- Make sure she wants to stay.
- I know she does.

605
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,045
Twelve-year-olds can be fickle.
I have two adolescents at home.

606
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,613
- Talk to her.
- Then what?

607
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,046
Then call the grandparents
and let them know.

608
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,411
- So that's it?
- That's it.

609
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,712
Okay.

610
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,292
Injecting the cyanoacrylate.

611
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,894
Amazing pick-up, Abby.

612
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,223
What made you think of AVM?

613
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,865
Her girlfriend kept going on...

614
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,228
about how she'd
become a different person.

615
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,001
Lots of couples go through that.

616
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,800
They don't all have arteriovenous
malformations in their brain.

617
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,601
Well, it was just
a hunch, I guess.

618
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,106
And congrats on the wedding.

619
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,908
Strange to be a husband
and wife working together?

620
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,108
Well, it's definitely strange to
have people refer to us that way.

621
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,277
Get used to it. Contrast.

622
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,046
- Are you married?
- Oh, no.

623
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,555
Only people I ever
meet are doctors.

624
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,990
And doctors make crummy
husbands. No offense.

625
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:22,431
I used to think it would be cool to
end up with a composer or an artist...

626
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:26,595
someone that would bring something totally
different to the dinner table, but...

627
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:30,607
You know, it's really nice to go home
to somebody who understands all this.

628
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,267
I can see that.

629
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,778
Look, no more antegrade
opacification of contrast.

630
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,940
- So the embolization worked?
- Yep.

631
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,745
Great. PRATT: Very nice.

632
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,218
What are you doing here?

633
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,192
I just came to check on the patient.
- Wait a minute.

634
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,761
I thought that Morris was
the Attending, so you...

635
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,989
Okay. Thanks, Bettina.

636
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,135
I'm gonna give
Megan the good news.

637
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,964
I was on a break, so I thought
I'd bring you some coffee.

638
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,867
Oh, don't drink coffee.

639
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,534
Well, that's good to know.

640
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,874
Hey, listen, Bettina, I just wanna
hang out with you for a while.

641
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,708
No plans, no games, just me.

642
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,819
And the patient
here on the table.

643
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:19,024
You can stay, but
don't touch anything.

644
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,826
Hospital day 12 for this
72-year-old with a GI bleed.

645
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,793
Vitals stable
overnight, pressure is...

646
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,728
Who's the first person to
measure blood pressure? Anybody?

647
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,869
It was a clergyman in
the year 17-blah-blah-blah.

648
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:35,064
And he took a glass tube and he stuck
it into the carotid artery of a horse.

649
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,972
And he was very surprised to see the
blood rise up into the air about 9 feet.

650
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,170
Why he did this
exactly, I have no idea.

651
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,406
I mean, it's impractical
for human beings.

652
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,346
I'm sure the horse
didn't appreciate it.

653
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,418
Sorry about that. Go
ahead, finish, Katey.

654
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,918
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

655
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,057
Next, we have a 64-year-old presented...
- Hi, we need a room.

656
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,022
This is Allison
Mackenzie, bowel perf.

657
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:57,185
Lost a lot of blood, didn't
tolerate the trip down the hall well.

658
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,490
Tachy's on two pressors.
CVP is only a six.

659
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,531
- Run of V-tach.
- Can I ask you a question?

660
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,434
Why didn't you stabilize the patient in
Post-Op instead of bringing us this mess?

661
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,404
- She got four units of blood and...
- Look, I'm not an idiot.

662
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,406
I knew about the
audit Dubenko's doing.

663
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,068
He doesn't want this
patient. It'll mess up his data.

664
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,680
That's not what's happening.

665
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,373
Rather have her code and
die in the ICU than on his watch.

666
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,019
- Die?
- Yeah, well, we'll try to avoid that.

667
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,054
- Tell Lucien this can't happen again.
- This wasn't his idea.

668
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,142
- Yeah, right.
- I thought she was ready to move.

669
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,519
V-tach.

670
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,724
No pulse.

671
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,055
Starting compression.

672
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,461
Oh, no, this can't be happening.

673
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,431
Charge to 200.
JAMES: No, please.

674
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,093
- Nice job, Neela.
- Just stay focused on the patient.

675
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,467
Clear. JAMES: Please help her.

676
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,939
Someone on the phone
says they gotta talk to you.

677
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,578
- I'm in the middle of a code.
- No, go. Just go.

678
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:50,238
And there's a guy outside begging
to come in to see this patient.

679
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,974
He's not family.
He can't be here.

680
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,949
- You might wanna rethink that.
- What?

681
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,319
She is doing everything she can not
to die. She could use all the support.

682
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,154
- Epi's in.
- Okay, going again.

683
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,920
Clear.

684
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,430
Well, her heart is beating
in a normal rhythm...

685
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,936
but her blood pressure
is still dangerously low.

686
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:15,472
Is there something you can do?

687
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,235
We've maxed out on the
medications. They're not helping.

688
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,845
The part of her brain that
controls blood pressure...

689
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,947
isn't functioning properly.

690
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:24,913
What? Why not?

691
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,450
Because she received
45 minutes of CPR.

692
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,179
Her brain was deprived
of oxygen during that time.

693
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,917
And when that happens, we often
see some degree of neurologic injury.

694
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,323
She walked in here today
with a stomachache...

695
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:39,397
and now you're telling
me her brain is damaged?

696
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:46,128
Look, I don't wanna take away all
hope, but I wanna be realistic here.

697
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:50,799
If she survives, there most
likely will be neurologic deficits.

698
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,670
When will we know?

699
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,609
Well, there's no way to predict.

700
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,444
It's a waiting game
now, I'm afraid.

701
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,810
Sorry.

702
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,818
I see.

703
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,819
You can go.

704
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,526
Please go.

705
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,467
Before she went into surgery,
she asked me to give this to you.

706
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,666
James.

707
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:28,837
I've resented it for so long,
this thing you two have.

708
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,651
Even now, I've gotta
share her with you.

709
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,850
What did he give him?

710
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,154
I don't know.

711
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,957
Data.

712
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,400
Some kind of
treasured lab secret.

713
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,229
Well, how do you know?

714
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,530
Well, you work in
the ICU long enough...

715
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:56,573
you start to recognize these
scenes are frighteningly familiar.

716
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:00,535
They kiss their spouse, the
kids, they say goodbye to friends.

717
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,874
A certain percentage
have a deep, dark secret...

718
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,541
like an illegitimate child or
a secret debt or something.

719
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,846
But occasionally, you
see something like this.

720
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,249
Practicalities.

721
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:13,449
Information that
must be passed on.

722
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:17,027
A computer password or
combo to a safe or something.

723
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,426
Wow, you're pretty jaded.

724
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:23,426
Many long, torturous cases.

725
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:27,130
You know, the human psyche
was not designed to deal with this.

726
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:31,208
Cave dwellers had to deal
with a lot more actual death.

727
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:37,314
But they were not subjected to the slow
and mechanized torture that is the ICU.

728
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,246
Well, why do you do it, then?

729
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,477
To save the salvageable.

730
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,714
And to give the rest
a dignified death.

731
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,518
Just a little low on
dignity these days.

732
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,991
Well, I'd have a hard
time working here.

733
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,498
Surgeons just like to get
in, do their job and get out.

734
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,261
Yeah, well, that's your job.

735
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,634
But we are left to
deal with the dregs.

736
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,832
And it's not pretty.

737
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,944
I just want us all to do better.

738
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,848
I'm sick of seeing people die.

739
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,154
She had an arteriovenous
malformation in the part of her brain...

740
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,587
that's responsible for
mood and personality.

741
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,852
That explains why she
seemed different to you.

742
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,153
And it's fixed now?

743
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:27,026
Yes, the radiologist was able to clot
off the vein using a special kind of glue.

744
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,828
- And she'll go back the way she was?
- That's the hope, yeah.

745
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,000
Did you hear that, baby?

746
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,607
It's all gonna be okay.

747
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,802
She's waking up, so we're gonna
take out her breathing tube now.

748
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,504
NIFs are good, and she's
following commands perfectly.

749
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,809
I'll need you to cough
on the count of three.

750
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:48,215
Ready? One, two, three.

751
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,859
Megan.

752
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,287
I'm sorry.

753
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,592
I am so, so sorry.

754
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,501
I was upset. I just...

755
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:07,738
I didn't mean to push you.

756
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,001
Okay?

757
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,042
Okay.

758
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,182
Chocolate-covered
strawberries, Room 1258.

759
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,799
<i>The room has been
checked out now.</i>

760
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:28,157
- No. No, I haven't checked out.
<i>- That's what I'm telling you.</i>

761
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,693
- There must be some mistake.
- There's not a mistake.

762
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,888
- I checked out of the hotel.
- What? No.

763
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,692
Why? I paid for
three more nights.

764
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,200
I know you did, which is crazy.
I got them to refund your card.

765
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,362
I don't want a
refund. Let's call them.

766
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,063
Archie, stop.

767
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,674
No, look.

768
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:49,338
The flowers, the spa treatments,
it's all lovely, but I don't need it.

769
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,074
- Time to get back to real life.
- I don't want real life.

770
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,912
I like fake life.

771
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,920
Where we wake up and take bubble
baths and eat bonbons for breakfast.

772
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,752
I don't want our crazy
wedding fling to end.

773
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:06,163
Uh... Who said
anything about it ending?

774
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,457
I wasn't sure...

775
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:14,934
Dr. Morris, I have not
done this with anyone...

776
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:19,237
in a long, long time.

777
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:25,180
And it's not because I
haven't had the opportunity.

778
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:31,085
I decided to sleep with you
because it means something.

779
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,217
This isn't a fling.

780
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,697
At least, not for me.

781
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,799
She snapped, she had a lapse.
It's not like she's a chronic abuser.

782
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,444
We don't know that. Even
if we did, it doesn't matter.

783
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,943
Guys, did Ray ever show up?

784
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,581
No. NEELA: Or did he call?

785
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,649
It's not like Megan
was trying to throw her.

786
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,513
Give me a break. She pushed her.

787
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,814
If this didn't happen, Sophia's
AVM wouldn't have been diagnosed.

788
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,423
- Excuse me, is Dr. Pratt still in?
- Nurses' station.

789
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,184
One incident doesn't
make it abuse.

790
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,625
She responded to anger with
violence. That's the definition.

791
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,662
- Dr. Pratt.
- Oh, boy.

792
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,529
- I thought I was done with you already.
- Millicent Lawford.

793
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,964
MI in the ER waiting room.

794
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:21,106
Sat there seven hours
without being triaged.

795
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,207
Gertie Minton. Renal failure.

796
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:27,436
Twelve hours to be seen and
then arrested from hyperkalemia.

797
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,807
Derek Shank.

798
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,542
In the ER three days
without DVT prophylaxis.

799
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:33,775
Died.

800
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:37,946
Died of a PE before
he made it to the floor.

801
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:41,150
- We can do better for these people.
- I get your point, okay?

802
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:42,817
But the problems are systemic.

803
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:47,159
Too many people, not enough resources.
How do you suppose we address that?

804
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:51,394
Well, first, I think we start by not
believing that this is the best we can do.

805
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,465
Because it's not.

806
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:54,697
Right.

807
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,569
These are for you.

808
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,376
Ray?

809
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,020
Ray?

810
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,200
Ray?

811
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,219
So I could totally tell that
Melissa was copying off my paper.

812
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,258
But if I tell on her,
then I'm a snitch.

813
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,522
And if I don't, then I'm,
like, an accomplice, right?

814
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:53,756
Right.

815
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,696
And I know, I know.

816
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,233
She's just cheating herself.

817
00:38:57,402 --> 00:39:01,237
But it still seems like
she wouldn't do that.

818
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:08,239
Yeah, and we learned in chemistry
today how to freebase cocaine.

819
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,041
Really?

820
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,215
Tony, you're totally
not listening to me.

821
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,649
Sarah, when your grandparents
wanted you to move in with them...

822
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,297
I thought that maybe
it was the best thing.

823
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,163
I don't wanna go to
a new school, Tony.

824
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,995
I don't wanna go
and live with them.

825
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,795
Well, I was scared, and I...

826
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:38,433
I just didn't think I had
what it takes to do this.

827
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:43,478
But then when we took
the test, I realized that...

828
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,778
I wished it'd gone the other way,
that I wanted to be your daddy.

829
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,582
I wanted that too.

830
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,927
So...

831
00:39:56,828 --> 00:40:00,697
I work a lot and I'm messy.

832
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,700
I may embarrass you at
father-daughter dances.

833
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,534
But I really love you,
Sarah. You're my family.

834
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,613
And it turns out that...

835
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:22,345
If you wanna stay
with me, you can.

836
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,614
If you... I mean,
if you still want to.

837
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,649
- Hi.
- Hey.

838
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:54,348
- I missed you guys.
- We missed you too.

839
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,020
- Oh.
- How was the shift?

840
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,681
Oh, who cares?

841
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,190
It's done.

842
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,384
No work for two weeks.

843
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,824
The honeymoon starts now.

844
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,728
Mm. Does that mean you're
ready to change into the bikini?

845
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,368
Maybe after Joe goes to bed.

846
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:13,061
Joe, go to bed, now. Heh.

847
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,968
I got him.

848
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:21,007
Sweetie.

849
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,706
Hello?

850
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,403
Hey, Donald, it's Kevin.

851
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:55,603
Yeah.

852
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,715
Look, I'm glad I
caught you. Ahem.

853
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:03,082
Do you remember the thing that
we discussed earlier about the ER?

854
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:07,791
Yeah, well, I can't believe I'm saying
this, but I think I've changed my mind.

855
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,393
I have changed my mind.

856
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,461
I'll do it. Okay, bye.

857
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,269
- Have a good one.
- Oh, good night.

858
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,060
Oh, good night. Good night.

859
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,073
Stay out of the ICU.
That guy's a dick.
