1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,937
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,768
It'd help if you'd
write a letter.

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,103
- All right, what kind of work?
- An EMT.

4
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,304
I'll help your brother out.

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,142
- I just don't know how I fit in.
- Oh, I understand.

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,079
Well, you won't
have to wait long.

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,643
So we're still waiting?

8
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,811
- It's only been a week.
- Okay.

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:24,481
- Well, I sent you a few e-mails.
- Never got any of them.

10
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,593
Where are the groceries?
I gave you $100.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,285
- How much you got?
- I don't know.

12
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,124
Smile for the
camera, birthday girl.

13
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,664
Ovarian cancer.
First time around.

14
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,167
- First?
- But they say the third time's the charm.

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,468
Happy birthday.

16
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,130
I'm gonna send Alex away.

17
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,833
I just can't help but feel
like I'm giving up on him.

18
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,677
We both know that's not true.

19
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,544
It was so smoky I
could barely see.

20
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,546
The flames were eating the
walls like maggots on dead meat.

21
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,289
So where was the little boy?

22
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,557
Well, I looked
everywhere for him...

23
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,219
when they radioed
me to get out...

24
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,590
something told
me to check again.

25
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,995
- Well, was he there?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,897
- Hey, Neela.
- He was behind a dresser.

27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,094
He could barely breathe.

28
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,763
Just about the time I
went to get him: Boom!

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,499
The second floor caved in.

30
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,471
Tony, have you heard this?

31
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,010
Time for you to go to school.

32
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:56,308
Well, it's teacher conferences today,
and me and Mike are having a marathon.

33
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,351
Mike needs to go find a job
and you need to go to Heather's.

34
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,782
Heather's sick.

35
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,219
And I start at Home
Depot tomorrow.

36
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,985
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,220
Great.

38
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,293
You rechecked the K
on your diabetic in 2?

39
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,490
I did. It was 3.6.

40
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,329
- Still ketotic.
- But only one plus now.

41
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,765
Forty-year-old female...

42
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,497
observed syncopal event
with LOC at a travel agency.

43
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,533
Oh, damn.

44
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,507
A and O times three,
pulse 88, resps 26, sat 96.

45
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,943
- Well, listen to you.
- He hasn't hurt you, has he?

46
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,174
I'm fine. I just got dizzy.

47
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,217
All right, I'm Dr. Pratt. We're
gonna take a look at you, okay?

48
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,652
I didn't eat breakfast.
I just got dizzy.

49
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,881
And I wanna go home.

50
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,824
We'll try to make it
quick. Put her in Curtain 2.

51
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,054
- Newbie, you finish up the run sheet.
- No problem.

52
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,897
- Not bad, man.
- Tight, huh?

53
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,192
Very tight.

54
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,291
So this your first day?

55
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,529
Two MIs, a MVC on the Dan Ryan,
and the shift's not even half over.

56
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,174
- How's Dumar treating you?
- He's cool, man, real cool.

57
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,640
He's not giving you a hard time?

58
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,304
He made me stock the
rig and get the coffee...

59
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,176
but it's not like I had to
shine the rims or anything.

60
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,011
Make sure it doesn't
get into schoolwork.

61
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,208
It won't.

62
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,876
Hey. Pratt, you see this?

63
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,580
Kovac is having a mandatory
department dinner next week.

64
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,385
Now, why would I wanna hang
out with you losers on my free time?

65
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,826
Ha-ha. Hey, it's better than the time
Weaver took us to the Olive Plantation.

66
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,523
Ha-ha. I was hugging the toilet for days.
- Okay.

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,929
Too much information.

68
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,002
You met my brother?
It's his first day.

69
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,729
- Hey.
- Hey, congratulations.

70
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,272
- I heard you start today.
- Thanks for everything.

71
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,842
You got it. Be careful,
the ladies love the uniform.

72
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,267
We'll see.

73
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,311
Look. Here, department dinner.

74
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,538
That sounds like fun.

75
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,184
Obviously, you haven't been.

76
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,374
Yeah, beats work.

77
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:42,353
All right. Speaking of which,
Marquez, staple gun lady in 3.

78
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,289
Sam, liter of NS and get
an EKG for the new one in 2.

79
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,190
What's this dinner all about?

80
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,956
Well, after County's lousy
Joint Commission survey...

81
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,260
Kovac probably just
wants to boost morale.

82
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,868
Hmm. Great.

83
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,071
What about emergency
power for the rooms?

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,108
- We're getting to that.
- Bathrooms still aren't ADA-compliant.

85
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,144
Upgrade the nurse call systems
and get automatic fire doors.

86
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,407
- You'll have time when we close.
- Give me another week.

87
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,051
- I gave you a month.
- We're busy.

88
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,242
We're busy every day.

89
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,945
- Soccer player has a positive culture.
- Start Vancomycin.

90
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,715
I haven't even
prepared the staff.

91
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,860
Well, you have the rest
of your shift to do so.

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,492
What about the patients?

93
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,825
We've increased capacity
at the urgent care clinic.

94
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,990
You promised shuttles
to other facilities.

95
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,430
We don't have enough money.

96
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,798
You have no idea what
it's like to be down here.

97
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,667
I covered trauma in
this ER for 20 years.

98
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,342
We're trying to improve
the way it works.

99
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,842
- How long will you shut down?
- As long as it takes.

100
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,639
So we can comply with rules?

101
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,078
Without accreditation,
we can't run this hospital.

102
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,650
- Come on, Donald...
- In 12 hours, we close the ER.

103
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,343
End of story.

104
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,095
You heard what he just
said. We're closing down.

105
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,065
- It's only temporary.
- How do you know?

106
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,228
Old boys run around here, and
now we're having some dinner.

107
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,898
Oh, we have the dinner every few
years. It's just drinks and dancing.

108
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,737
Usually, you can't bring a date.

109
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,243
Maybe I'll bring Wilson.

110
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,744
- The cop?
- Mm-hm.

111
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,974
They say white men
can't jump, but he sure...

112
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,646
Who you bringing?

113
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,585
I don't know.

114
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:26,420
You know, Sam, it's obvious
you got some stuff going on.

115
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,927
You don't need to keep it
all in. Nurses stick together.

116
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,928
No, I honestly, I have...

117
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,294
Don't know who I'd bring.

118
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,266
It's the first time in my
life I've really been alone.

119
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,099
You're kidding me.

120
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,970
No. Now that Alex is out of the house,
I gotta find something to do with myself.

121
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,941
Girl, it's called The Rabbit.

122
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,273
It costs a grip, but
it's worth every dime.

123
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,881
Oh, God.

124
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,951
You'll be saying more
than that. Trust me.

125
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,050
Excuse me. Hold on.

126
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,887
Oh.

127
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,222
Get that look off your face.

128
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,159
How are you?

129
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,699
Mets to the...

130
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,466
Liver, lungs, bones.
Not a Kodak moment.

131
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,705
I'm sorry. Are you
getting chemotherapy?

132
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,468
No, I'm done.

133
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,537
Keep him on the monitor
and call for an ICU bed.

134
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,706
Hi. This is Diana Moore.

135
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,751
She's here for syncope.

136
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,648
History of ovarian cancer.

137
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,985
- I'm Dr. Kovac.
- Not history, Sam.

138
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,648
It's right now.

139
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,021
Metastatic.

140
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,822
End stage.

141
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,761
Doctors need to know that.

142
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,489
You two know each other?

143
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,827
She'd been here before.

144
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,030
Not as a patient.

145
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,866
Diana's a photographer.

146
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,209
She's doing a project
on hospice patients.

147
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,936
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, I remember you.

148
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:55,173
Wow, you've got
pretty bad ascites here.

149
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,840
Your abdominal cavity
is accumulating fluid.

150
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,719
I know what ascites is.

151
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,420
I took a picture of it.
Looks like I'm pregnant.

152
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,185
BP's 92/58.

153
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,953
She's depleted intravascularly.

154
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,859
Okay, run in a liter of NS.

155
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,590
No, no IVs. I told
the paramedics.

156
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,893
I'm DNR.

157
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:20,037
- It's just an IV for rehydration.
- No, I know, I know, okay?

158
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,367
I know how this starts...

159
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,137
and then you get sucked
into the hospital vortex...

160
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,042
and it never ends up well.

161
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,808
The fluids will
make you feel better.

162
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,576
No, listen to me.

163
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,776
No.

164
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,149
No IVs.

165
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:39,919
No blood tests, no
monitors, no medicines.

166
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,252
I'm going to Costa Rica.

167
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,228
What's in Costa Rica?
- The beach.

168
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,732
Sam, give her a liter of
oral rehydration solution.

169
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:57,275
Just stay long enough to show
us you can hold that down, okay?

170
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,037
Okay.

171
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,250
Hey, shouldn't we
drain some of the fluid?

172
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,050
We can't do a paracentesis.

173
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,853
It will help her breathe
easier, make her comfortable.

174
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,785
- You heard her, no blood tests.
- It's a needle in the belly.

175
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,017
It will take you five
minutes. Come on, Luka.

176
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,924
Ray is right. We can't tap
the fluid without checking labs.

177
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,759
She could be anemic,
coagulopathic. Not a good idea.

178
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,766
She doesn't want any treatment,
Sam. So let's respect that.

179
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,632
Your favorite skin popper
won't let me I and D her abscess.

180
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,432
Sign her out AMA
and get her out.

181
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,199
- But she knows you, maybe if...
- No.

182
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,810
We can't keep convincing
if they don't wanna be here.

183
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,947
We can't even take care of
the ones we already have.

184
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,138
Okay, listen up.

185
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,046
Got reassignments for all
of you during the ER closing.

186
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,050
How they just gonna
tell us this today?

187
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,655
Thought I'd prevent this,
but Anspaugh's not budging.

188
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,620
How long we shutting down?
- Not sure.

189
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,625
Great. I'm sure I'll wind up
giving enemas in Geriatrics.

190
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,228
No, you're going to ICU.

191
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,728
Malik to Geriatrics.

192
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,024
Pratt, Family Medicine.

193
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,168
- Abby, you're going to the NICU.
- Oh, I'm not going to the NICU.

194
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,963
Right. I'll fix that.

195
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,406
- Gates goes to Anesthesia.
- What about me?

196
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,974
- You're going to the cafeteria.
- The cafe... What?

197
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,578
Give me a jockey suit
and sit me out on the lawn.

198
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,681
- Do we get to keep the same shifts?
- Get our choice of schedule?

199
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,477
Talk to your supervisors
about shift scheduling.

200
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,677
Are they gonna shut
down the Residency?

201
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,345
These are alternate
rotations until ER opens again.

202
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,583
That's what they told
MLK in Los Angeles.

203
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,886
They're scrambling for
spots in other programs.

204
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,530
Our didactic programs for
the Residents will continue.

205
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,865
For Attendings,
there'll be administrative

206
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,100
duties to help correct
the JC deficiencies.

207
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,261
We'll also be assigned clinical
shifts in the urgent care center.

208
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,737
Great. Med refills,
URIs and back pain.

209
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,603
Yeah. I bet we're
closing for good.

210
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,405
I'm with you. Something stinks,
and it's not the diarrhea in 4.

211
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,207
Who has Johnson?

212
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,508
Oh, I did.

213
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,083
No pneumonia. But are you
aware he has rib fractures?

214
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,514
Yeah. The kid plays rugby.

215
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,882
So guess who's...

216
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,524
Guess who's going
to Family Medicine.

217
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,027
I don't know. Who?

218
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,529
Yours truly.

219
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,757
No nights, no weekends.

220
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,198
Now, maybe you can
come over for some dinner.

221
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,701
We can crack open a bottle.

222
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,203
You know?

223
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,704
Yeah, maybe.

224
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,103
Hey, Betina.

225
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,109
I saw your abstract on
neuroimaging and autism.

226
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,576
Pretty cool stuff.

227
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,079
Paper's coming out in
<i>Neuroscience</i> next month.

228
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,547
Wow, very impressive.

229
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,776
But not surprising...

230
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,821
considering you managed to enroll
such a big cohort of autistic children.

231
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,426
And the way you correlated the MRI
findings with the tissue specimens.

232
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,153
I mean, no one's ever done
that on this scale before.

233
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,321
- You actually read it.
- I sure did.

234
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,491
If you have time to talk
about it more, I'd love to chat.

235
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,432
I'm looking for areas to focus
clinical research in the ER.

236
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,903
I'd be interested in collaborating
with your department.

237
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,838
Oh. Are you free for lunch tomorrow?
- Sounds great.

238
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,502
Okay. Great.

239
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,439
What just happened?

240
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,849
Blunt trauma to the head and
arms. Assaulted with a baseball bat.

241
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,420
- Alert.
- Got it.

242
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,682
Okay, put him in Trauma
1. What happened?

243
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,760
I was at a sci-fi convention, and
some Romulan started beating me. Aah!

244
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,021
Get a c-collar.

245
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,762
He accused us Intergalactic
Rebel Warriors of being inferior.

246
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,831
He was being uppity, because
Romulans are biological cousins to Vulcans.

247
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,529
- Of course.
- Where's your pain?

248
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:13,968
Mostly in my shoulder.

249
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,438
My arm hurts too.

250
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,440
Let's get a line in.
Get him morphine.

251
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,136
And c-spine film to his right
shoulder and left forearm.

252
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,009
It hurts.

253
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,817
Now, you dislocated
your shoulder anteriorly.

254
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:29,279
- Am I gonna die? Ah-haah-haah!
- Not today.

255
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,121
- Have you seen that patient?
- She stumbled off.

256
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,287
- Can you find my doctor?
- I'll send someone.

257
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,796
Today? Next year? During
Cinco de Mayo? When?

258
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,559
- Have you seen Diana?
- Who is that?

259
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,669
- The photographer lady in Curtain 2.
- No.

260
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,464
Sam, where are the glucometers?

261
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,800
They're packed up. They
were supposed to leave one.

262
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,814
- The test strips?
- You're on your own.

263
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,639
I get the Klingons used to
be enemies of the Federation...

264
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,145
- but we have nothing to do with that.
- Move your toes.

265
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,576
Good. You feel me touching your foot?
- Yes.

266
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,220
Never heard of
Intergalactic Rebel Warriors.

267
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,411
What show were you on?

268
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,991
We're still in the conceptual
stage, but we're about to land a deal.

269
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,355
Looks like right anterior
shoulder dislocation.

270
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,552
C-spine is clear.

271
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,062
He got a nightstick
fracture of the left ulna.

272
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,757
Let's get a sugar tong splint.

273
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,835
Let's give him 100 of
propofol for shoulder reduction.

274
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,768
- Propofol?
- Yeah, I just got credentialed to use it.

275
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,307
We try scapular manipulation.
Put it in without knocking him out.

276
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,178
No, reductions are easier
if you have good sedation.

277
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,370
Sedation has risks.

278
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,546
Morris, dispo some
patients out here.

279
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,776
We got a full waiting
area. Come on.

280
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:36,616
Okay. Let's get set up for the propofol.
We'll do the reduction when I get back.

281
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,725
All right. Let's get him prone and
we'll try the scapular manipulation.

282
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,527
What? Morris said he
wants to use sedation.

283
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,029
- He's a kid with a toy.
- The kid's the Attending.

284
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,758
- Even if you're right...
- We'll try.

285
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,403
If it goes in easy, great.
If not, try the propofol.

286
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,471
- Ah-ha-aah.
- Let me roll you over.

287
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,071
Hey.

288
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,542
Been looking all over for you.

289
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,781
I gotta get an airline ticket...

290
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,646
- before the price goes up.
- Come here. Come on, sit down.

291
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,252
Please?

292
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,453
Uh...

293
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,229
Got malaria once.

294
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,123
I didn't feel...

295
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,902
as bad as this.

296
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,435
Look, the fluid in your belly
is compressing your lungs.

297
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,976
If you let us take it off, it will
make it easier for you to breathe.

298
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,740
I just wanna get on the plane.

299
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,373
I understand that.

300
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,384
Okay. But you are
breathless and you're pale.

301
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,986
And flight crews are trained
to spot people just like you.

302
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,186
I'll wear blush.

303
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,531
Paracentesis will only
take a few minutes.

304
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,167
Sam...

305
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,204
I have friends in Costa Rica.

306
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,300
And they're waiting for me.

307
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,438
And it's all planned out.

308
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,041
This is your only
chance to get there.

309
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,782
Come on, trust me on this.

310
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,664
ICU has beds for
our intubated patients.

311
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,062
Only three beds, but
these can go to Telemetry.

312
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,897
We have 11 patients going to medicine.
They can use the GYN floor for overflow.

313
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,403
- What about the waiting room?
- Send to urgent care.

314
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,700
The ER is closing at 8.

315
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,673
How do you say, "This is gonna
hurt" in Intergalactic Rebel Warrior?

316
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,005
Aaah!

317
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,147
- What the hell are you doing?
- He did it.

318
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,249
- What?
- Gates thought to try it this way.

319
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,680
Yeah, and it worked.
No need for propofol.

320
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,821
- Well, who made that call?
- I did.

321
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,821
- His shoulder's back in.
- Not the point. I gave you an order.

322
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,427
So do what a boss does. Take
credit for my resourcefulness.

323
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,653
I'm writing you up.

324
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,427
Because my approach was
better than the Attending?

325
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,964
Go home. You're done.

326
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,106
- You can't send me home.
- You should have thought that before.

327
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,573
- I helped the guy without sedation.
- You went against my orders.

328
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,679
- You're supposed to be a soldier.
- I am.

329
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,610
- A real one.
- Could have fooled me.

330
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:19,217
- You're acting like I killed the guy.
- I am sick of you not taking orders.

331
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,583
Time you got here, you've placed
subclavian line without supervision.

332
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,281
You tapped a VP shunt without
even calling Neurosurgery.

333
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,758
You overrode an Attending to give
Digibind to a guy who was brain-dead.

334
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,952
You keeping score?

335
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:34,294
- Transpose numbers, you falsify charts.
- You sound like a high school girlfriend.

336
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,460
And still you act like
you're God's gift to medicine.

337
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,300
Like you're too good to
seek advice or need help.

338
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,635
You're arrogant and
dangerous, I've had enough.

339
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:43,901
We all have. Go home.

340
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,442
Where's Kovac?

341
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,981
- This is my call, not his.
- Okay.

342
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,450
- What was that about?
- I sent him home.

343
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,951
I tried that once.

344
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,886
Yeah. Well, this time, he's
getting a letter in his file.

345
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,260
So how did you cut your leg?

346
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,330
I was trying to
get the chip out.

347
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,162
What kind of chip?

348
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,733
A neurogenic biomatrix
nanosilicate chip.

349
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,374
The aliens put it there.

350
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,908
And did the aliens do
anything else to you?

351
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,253
Not that I didn't consent to.

352
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,515
Look, they want me to go
back and report my findings.

353
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:33,751
Really?

354
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,521
I'm willing to give a report, but
I don't want them tracking me.

355
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,358
Sam. Can you page Psych...

356
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,794
for a consult, please?

357
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,265
- Katey's already down here.
- Katey?

358
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,844
We're gonna move you to Exam 3
to do the procedure, but you're all set.

359
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,206
One ticket to Costa Rica.

360
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,347
Tomorrow evening, 7:55.

361
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,541
Seat 13B.

362
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,051
You ever been to Costa Rica?

363
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,488
Only on the Discovery Channel.

364
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,226
That's where my dad
bought me my first camera.

365
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,990
My family lived there...

366
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:19,432
when I was 15, for six months.

367
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,000
Real magical.

368
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,533
Very beautiful.

369
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,645
The sunsets, the beaches.

370
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,872
Sounds romantic.

371
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,317
Yeah.

372
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,352
It's where I met Paul.

373
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,985
He was a journalist for the BBC.

374
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,389
The only guy who ever got me.

375
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,658
Is he gonna meet you there?

376
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,963
No.

377
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,604
He died in Baghdad.

378
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:58,670
He was embedded with a Marine
unit, and they drove over an IED.

379
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,540
I'm so sorry.

380
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,511
Sorry.

381
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:03,945
Yeah.

382
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,176
I never had his kid.

383
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,549
What do you think?

384
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,624
We should put her
on a 72-hour hold.

385
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,091
She cut a leg open.
She's a danger to herself.

386
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,457
- She's a crazy bird.
- Heh.

387
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,859
Aren't we all?

388
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,263
My best friend thinks I'm nuts
sitting around waiting for you to call.

389
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,630
Okay. Look, I'm sorry.

390
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,795
No, I'm sorry.

391
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,940
The moment I jump
in the pool, you get out.

392
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,302
Katey, that's not...

393
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,807
Hey, this is Katey Alvaro.
Fourth year on Psych.

394
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,242
Do we have any beds?
WOMAN <i>Let me check.</i>

395
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,211
And I pulled out
my best for you.

396
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,373
Hey, don't get me wrong.

397
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,610
The sex was great.

398
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,447
I'm not talking about the sex.

399
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,751
No, that's great.
I'll bring her right up.

400
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,416
- I should have called you.
- You should have called?

401
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,062
- You dropped off the face of the Earth.
- It was wrong.

402
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,496
No, it was more than wrong. It
was wussy, immature, 10th grade-ish.

403
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,295
You're right.

404
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,629
What happened?

405
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,305
You start dating
Neela or something?

406
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,742
Okay, can we talk about this?

407
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,175
What's there to talk about?

408
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,976
You're stupid, and I'm done.

409
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,022
Did Morris tell you not
to do the procedure?

410
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,352
Well, yes, but scapular manipulation
doesn't pose any real risk.

411
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,083
That's not the point.

412
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,853
I saved the guy
from being sedated.

413
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,463
You were out of line, now
going over his head to me.

414
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,862
My way was better, doesn't
merit being written up.

415
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,196
It does. When an Attending tells
you something, do it or discuss it.

416
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,805
- Come on...
- You'll go home and think about that.

417
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,644
Am I in trouble?

418
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:42,043
Morris, that's one of the
best moves you've ever made.

419
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,546
See? I knew it.

420
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,948
He can't go against me. He shouldn't
be able to go against Residents.

421
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,054
- There was a Resident?
- Leave me out of it.

422
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,213
- Should've stopped him.
- Like he'll listen.

423
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,383
- He doesn't even listen to you.
- I should send you home too.

424
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,993
Okay.

425
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,792
Well, not today.

426
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,628
But I'll do it, Abby.
Don't test me.

427
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,566
- It wasn't life-threatening.
- Doesn't matter.

428
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,735
Morris is the Attending.
It's his decision.

429
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,744
Got my Coltrane.

430
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,913
Margaret Bourke-White books
and a timer for my camera.

431
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,583
Well, you seem at peace. - Yeah.

432
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,886
Why stress this?

433
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,397
My friend's gonna cook.
Drink wine on the beach.

434
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,891
That necessary?

435
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:40,137
Uh... It's a precaution
for the invasive procedure.

436
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,574
I said no blood.

437
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,735
It's just platelets.
Your count's a little low.

438
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,379
I'm still gonna get out of here?

439
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,442
I promise you.

440
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,183
Platelets running.
Belly's prepped.

441
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,050
Lido's drawn up and ready.

442
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,351
I gotta get my film
to my publisher.

443
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,190
And my camera to Yolanda.

444
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,893
Who's Yolanda?

445
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:11,095
This little girl I mentor in
a photography program.

446
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:16,467
Okay, a little sting so you
won't feel the big needle.

447
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,912
- Vitals?
- A little tachy, but BP is good.

448
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,373
Okay.

449
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,418
You're gonna feel
some pressure here.

450
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,248
That's it.

451
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,324
If the bottle fills up, clamp the tubing
before you switch to an empty one.

452
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,930
Yeah, I got it.

453
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:43,627
I need to see if I have
enough miles to upgrade.

454
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,774
Why skimp on
your last plane ride?

455
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,169
She refused the morphine.

456
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,470
Okay. The painful
part is over anyway.

457
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,108
Fluid's bloody.

458
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,113
Just a little. Shouldn't
be a problem.

459
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,479
Oh, I don't know.

460
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,419
I feel weird.

461
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,618
Diana?

462
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,816
Diana, come on.

463
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,825
Systolic's only 84.
Get the crash cart.

464
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,520
- Come on, Diana.
- Sam, she's DNR.

465
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,528
No, no, no. We
talked her into this.

466
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,826
We gotta get her
back to where she was.

467
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,993
- Please?
- No crash cart, no CPR.

468
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,231
Give her a liter of NS and
lower the head of the bed.

469
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,783
BP's 88/45.

470
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,946
Damn it. Urticaria.

471
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,614
- Another liter of NS, DC the platelets.
- Crackles at the bases.

472
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,023
Fifty of Benadryl, and
get on the non-rebreather.

473
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,322
Diana? DIANA: What happened?

474
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,556
You had a bad reaction
to blood products.

475
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,166
Okay, I'll start another line.

476
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,701
No, no, I don't want that.
I don't want any of this.

477
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,532
You dropped your
pressure. No choice.

478
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,503
Yes, I do. Stop.

479
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,309
- We need a way to get in fluids fast.
- No, no.

480
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,810
Listen, this is very serious. Platelet
allergy can be life-threatening.

481
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,415
Especially in your condition.
- Great.

482
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,478
What is it about hospitals?
This is a toxic environment.

483
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,587
Everybody gets worse here.

484
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,383
One-twenty-five of Methylpred
and epi at the bedside.

485
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,889
It's gonna be okay, Diana.

486
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,222
Really? I don't think
I'm gonna be okay.

487
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,092
Want me to start a subclavian?

488
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,665
She's coagulopathic.

489
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,133
Let's give the meds a chance
to kick in, and then reassess.

490
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,401
Hang in there, Diana. We'll
come and check on you soon.

491
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,276
- Sam shouldn't push that.
- It was Diana's chance to get on a plane.

492
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,576
Dr. Kovac, people are
asking about this dinner.

493
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,186
Just tell Marquez to
officially close us the Trauma.

494
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,049
How are we affording
a fancy place?

495
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,088
- It's not Ladokern.
- Don't worry about it.

496
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,352
- Get with a pharmaceutical company?
- We have a lot of work.

497
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,393
Say it isn't so. They're
Satan, trust me.

498
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,464
A 14-year-old with altered mental
status and respiratory distress.

499
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,567
We were walking home.
He said his back hurt.

500
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,068
- He sat down and stopped making sense.
- Please, hmm, mm...

501
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,139
Ray, can I get a hand over here?

502
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,639
- Your friend's name?
- Demitri.

503
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,642
- Your friend have medical problems?
- I don't know.

504
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,473
Demitri? Hey, man.

505
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,444
Wake up, Demitri. Wake up.

506
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,208
One, two, three.

507
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,443
- Sat's only 76.
- You sure it's picking up?

508
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,918
Yeah, we got good waveform.
- All right.

509
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:19,718
We got shallow resps, decreased
at the bases. Throw me the bag.

510
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,087
Does he take any medicine?

511
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,126
We're in orchestra.
We're not friends.

512
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,628
Anybody call his parents?
- Timmy's on it.

513
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,391
Pulse is thready. Tachy at 125.

514
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,467
- You take drugs? TODD:
We don't mess with that.

515
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,263
Did he fall? Did
you get in a fight?

516
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,803
He just passed out.

517
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,235
We gonna need the tube.

518
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,466
- One seven-0 and a MAC-2.
- What do you want?

519
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,510
CBC, trauma panel, tox
screen, type and cross.

520
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,740
Call for a portable chest, and let
Surgery know that they need to come down.

521
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,748
It's not my fault, I swear.

522
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,147
Let's get an ABG.

523
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,118
- Hey.
- Hey.

524
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,353
- You didn't call me back this morning.
- What?

525
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,929
- You didn't call me back.
- Morris is such a bitch.

526
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,090
- What happened?
- He's sending me home.

527
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,167
- What did you do?
- I reduced the shoulder.

528
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,997
- That's what I did.
- I don't get it.

529
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,332
I was trying to do
what was safest, right?

530
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,032
And then he shows up and
he pulls this big power trip.

531
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,507
- So you went against him?
- Not the point.

532
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,110
- It kind of is.
- It kind of isn't. The point...

533
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,943
I don't even
wanna talk about it.

534
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,109
Why don't you just
tell Morris you're sorry?

535
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,309
I'm not sorry.

536
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,511
So, what?

537
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,122
So, what? I'm not a kiss-ass.

538
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,851
- So you wanna get written up?
- He doesn't have the balls.

539
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,051
- Neela.
- What?

540
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,698
You've been ignoring Dr. Crenshaw's
pages. He asked me to read this.

541
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,302
"Get your ass into
the Trauma room now."

542
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,800
- I gotta go.
- Where you going?

543
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,734
- What did you have to say?
- Nothing.

544
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,136
Just go apologize to Morris.

545
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,643
Suction. All right, I'm in.

546
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,803
- Bag him up. MALIK:
Sats in the 70s, Pratt.

547
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,312
Blood gas is ugly.

548
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,972
- PH only 7.02.
- What's happening?

549
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,642
He may have taken something
that's making him acidotic.

550
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,151
There's no gap. Know what?

551
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,983
Listen, Todd. It's very
important you tell us the truth.

552
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:59,489
Did you guys take any pills?

553
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,059
I told you, we were in
orchestra practice all day.

554
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,492
Can't bag him above 80.
PRATT: Because of this.

555
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,256
Yikes. What is that, pneumonia?

556
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,264
It seems unlikely
without a fever.

557
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:10,164
Seven-fifty of ceftriaxone.

558
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,828
It hurts me when you ignore my
pages. Truly, it wounds me to the core.

559
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,397
You rang?

560
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,873
We got a 14-year-old
with hypoxia and this film.

561
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,705
- Pneumonia?
- H & H is back.

562
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,870
- Hemoglobin's 6.2.
- Pulmonary hemorrhage.

563
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,071
What I'm thinking.

564
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,768
History of trauma? - Yeah.

565
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,682
We don't know. His
buddy's not helpful.

566
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:29,014
- I told you, I don't know anything.
- Look, Todd...

567
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,680
if you know something,
you gotta tell us right now.

568
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,891
Hey, hey, Todd. Get back here.

569
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,703
- SonoSite, please.
- A chest tube...

570
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:40,958
Todd.

571
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,431
What did you do to him?

572
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,570
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing, I swear.

573
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,205
Yeah? Then why are you running?

574
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,239
You know your friend could die?

575
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,449
He could?

576
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,044
Yes, did you do
something to him?

577
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,945
I wanted the solo.

578
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,642
What did you do?

579
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,920
I kept praying he'd get sick,
but when that didn't work...

580
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,058
we did this experiment in
chemistry where we used sulfur.

581
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:10,890
I saw what happens when you heated it,
so I figured eating it couldn't be good.

582
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,554
You...

583
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,832
You put it in his food?

584
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,129
Our school orchestra goes to
Milwaukee, and I want to play the solo.

585
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,465
I didn't mean for
all of this to happen.

586
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,001
I'm sorry.

587
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,572
I'm sorry this didn't
go the way we wanted.

588
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,747
Why don't you...

589
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:37,915
just sign me out?

590
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,855
You know that I
have a plane to catch.

591
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:45,930
You can leave, but nothing's changed.
They're not gonna let you on that plane.

592
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,322
But why?

593
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,496
We can send you home.

594
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,762
Hospice can bring
you pain medications.

595
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,803
- No, but I'm not in pain.
- Not right now.

596
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:58,000
Sometimes when people die this
way, they get really uncomfortable.

597
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,942
Well, why can't you do
another paracentesis?

598
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,173
We can't risk you bleeding.

599
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,112
Okay.

600
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:13,050
Why can't I just fall
asleep and not wake up?

601
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,925
You've seen this. It doesn't
always work that way.

602
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,067
The fluid in your body is
gonna continue to build up.

603
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:27,798
And as it does, it'll compress your lungs
and make it harder for you to breathe.

604
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,974
I'll feel like I'm drowning.

605
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,875
We'll not be able to get to
everyone before the ER closes.

606
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,710
What about my headache?

607
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,819
I can't wait till next week.
I've got yeast infections.

608
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:44,650
You'll have to find a doctor somewhere.
We got a list of local clinics here.

609
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,156
- How long will the ER be closed?
- We don't know.

610
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,851
- We need a room.
- We're closed.

611
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,707
- You guys know that
- You gotta take this.

612
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,730
- No. Go to Good Shepherd.
- Listen, it's Dr. Pratt's brother.

613
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,923
Chaz?

614
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,159
He kind of overdid it.

615
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,167
Somebody, I'm
not feeling too good.

616
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,857
- What happened?
- Happy hour overload.

617
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,565
- We need a gurney over here.
- Trauma 2's open.

618
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,835
We got this. Give the
nursing report on Diana.

619
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,672
- We got a bed for her.
- My appendix.

620
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,780
- She's going home.
- Wants to be admitted.

621
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,843
What? To the hospital?

622
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,279
No. She's not dying here.

623
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,850
Sam, just make the call, okay?

624
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,286
Hey, Sam. I got these
kids doing fence-plowing.

625
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,514
What the hell is that?

626
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,126
Knuckleheads run into a
fence and try to break it.

627
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,264
- Do we have time?
- They have to be out of here in an hour.

628
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,454
- Hey, Pratt.
- Yup?

629
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,362
Go to Trauma 2.
Your brother's here.

630
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,796
Yeah, I know. He's working.

631
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,402
- No, he's drunk.
- What?

632
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,563
Demitri's parents just
called. He's got sickle cell.

633
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,032
You're kidding.

634
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,541
At least it makes sense.

635
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,612
Yeah, it means the white
out is acute chest syndrome.

636
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,112
What's that?

637
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,877
Dr. Barnett will explain
everything. Take them upstairs.

638
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,043
- Where you going?
- It's my brother.

639
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,714
All right, let's go.

640
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,887
I just spoke to Dr. Kovac.

641
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,232
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

642
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,400
It's fine, Sam.

643
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,237
No, this isn't what you
want. It's the hospital vortex.

644
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,637
You said it yourself.

645
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,739
Let me take you home.

646
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,244
We'll tell your friends to
meet you there instead.

647
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,545
It's okay. It's okay.

648
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,047
Don't say that. Come on.

649
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,421
Sam, look.

650
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,113
Actually, there is no one, okay?

651
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,191
I just...

652
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,322
I did my thing.

653
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:35,261
My whole life, and I didn't
develop real relationships...

654
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,595
and I don't have any kids.

655
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,438
So...

656
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,437
Okay.

657
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:51,513
But you are still
not doing this here.

658
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,951
Not like this.

659
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,616
Sam, I can't.

660
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,457
Now, look at me. I
can't do this alone.

661
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,498
Pulse ox is dropping.

662
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,466
- Breath sounds equal.
- Chaz, wake up.

663
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,400
- Breathe for us, buddy.
- I have one beer.

664
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,803
Hell, I have four beers,
but 15 shots of tequila?

665
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,842
- It's a paramedic tradition.
- What the hell were you thinking?

666
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,344
- Sat's only 89, he needs a tube.
- No, 15 liters O2 by mask.

667
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,847
- That will not work.
- What are you, frat boys?

668
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,508
You guys see people die from
alcohol poisoning all the time.

669
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,347
- Still got a gag.
- Barely.

670
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,457
Chaz, come on, man. Chaz, hey.

671
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,957
Pratt, his GCS is trending
down, so are his sats.

672
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,619
- We need to tube him.
- Not yet, he's arousable.

673
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,765
- Bro...
- See, look at that, he's talking.

674
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,263
- MAC-2 and an eight-0.
- No.

675
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,766
- You're not putting a tube.
- It's gonna be a mess.

676
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,961
- Extubate him.
- Not putting him on a vent.

677
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,629
Marquez, place an NG.

678
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,799
- We'll evacuate his stomach.
- That's gonna make him vomit.

679
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,535
Chaz, come on. Wake up, man.

680
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,646
He better wake up
or I'll kill you guys.

681
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,782
Hey, come on. Hey, hey.

682
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,210
Hey.

683
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,917
- I'm sorry.
- Sat's up to 92.

684
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,653
Good. That's good.

685
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,658
- Let's put him on a non-rebreather.
- I'll call for a med/surge bed.

686
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,321
This is nice. Heh.

687
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,330
It's very chic.

688
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,333
Here.

689
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,240
Did you do all these?

690
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:30,172
Uh... Yeah, mostly.

691
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,850
Some are some friends.

692
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,686
I thought you had no friends.

693
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:40,417
Well, they're the kind of friends
that you bunk with in Kabul...

694
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:43,653
let you sleep on their
floor in Marrakesh.

695
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,994
I haven't told them.

696
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,528
Diana...

697
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,866
They'll read
about it in the obit.

698
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,207
Bet you underestimate them.

699
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:04,975
That's Paul.

700
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,280
Hmm.

701
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,792
Right before the bomb went off.

702
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,552
I'm sorry.

703
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,190
Here. Let me help you.

704
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,561
I got you.

705
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,738
Sit down.

706
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,106
You know, Sam,
you don't have to...

707
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,449
You don't have to stay. I'm sure
you have family to go home to.

708
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:44,886
Uh... Actually, my son
is away at school, so...

709
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,623
He's been, you know,
having problems.

710
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:50,892
A picture?

711
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,530
- What's that?
- Picture?

712
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:54,961
Yeah.

713
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,761
Yeah, I do.

714
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,840
- There's Alex.
- Ha-ha-ha.

715
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,944
It's an old one, but
he looks the same.

716
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,083
- Well, he's beautiful.
- Thanks.

717
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:20,448
I used to think you had to
choose between family and career.

718
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:24,091
By the time I figured
out you could have both...

719
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,254
it was too late.

720
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,461
I was already sick.

721
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,295
Yeah, well, I got
pregnant at 14.

722
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,465
So by the time I realized
you could have a career...

723
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,940
my kid was in preschool.

724
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,381
So nursing isn't
what you wanted?

725
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,141
Ah.

726
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,513
Actually, I never thought
about what I wanted.

727
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:51,213
Feeding Alex was the reality.

728
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,482
Hmm.

729
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,317
Well...

730
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,667
It's never too late to choose.

731
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,403
You have time.

732
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,207
The room is ready for
Mrs. Sherman on four south.

733
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:16,837
And the surgical step down says
they'll make room for our pertussis kid.

734
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:20,543
You think it's good to put a toddler
in a room with post-op patients?

735
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,211
- No, but it's the only option.
- Dr. Kovac.

736
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,051
- You can't send me out, doc.
- Can you sign this discharge?

737
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,693
We'll give you a taxi
voucher to get to a shelter.

738
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,658
You know what
them shelters are like.

739
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,560
I'm afraid that's all we can
offer. You don't need to stay.

740
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,668
Dr. Barnett, I finished packing
up Trauma 1 and I found this.

741
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:40,169
It's a violin. My patient must've
left it. I'll take care of it. Thanks.

742
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,499
Hey, how's he doing?

743
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,232
We're gonna
monitor him overnight.

744
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,207
Hey, you know, if you get
admitted, you can't be a paramedic.

745
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,279
- Is he for real?
- Afraid so.

746
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,709
- Oh, hell, no.
- It's a joke.

747
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,121
- Sit your ass down.
- Ha-ha-ha.

748
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,043
Oh. What happened?

749
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,182
His first day as an
EMT, got initiated.

750
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,379
Damn traditions.

751
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,887
I'll be up in a sec.

752
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,657
Hey, Betina, Betina.

753
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:11,232
About earlier, I'm sorry
about how I came off.

754
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,395
"How you doing? Maybe
we could have dinner?

755
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,937
Crack open a bottle of wine?"

756
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,076
Yes, yes, yes. But I do wanna
hear about your research.

757
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:21,702
Then you're going to have to
read up like your buddy, Morris.

758
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,212
I'll do that.

759
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,077
But I still wanna take you out.

760
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,910
There's this ER department
dinner next week, Thursday night.

761
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,152
An ER dinner. You're kidding me.

762
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:36,419
And I thought maybe
afterwards, we could get a drink.

763
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,653
In a bar.

764
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,923
In a public spot.

765
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,826
Sounds better.

766
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,101
Come on, what do you say?

767
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,263
Call me.

768
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,445
Hey.

769
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,578
You forgot this?

770
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,213
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

771
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,253
Demitri's still not awake?

772
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,515
Well, he's got a tough
road ahead of him.

773
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,787
But the disease did
this to him, not you.

774
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,624
You sure?

775
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,966
Yeah, I'm positive.

776
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,133
Sulfur doesn't make
you sick. Not like this.

777
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,597
You know you got lucky.

778
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:22,797
I know.

779
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:32,244
Look, when the time is
right, you'll get the solo, okay?

780
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,786
Have you ever
felt, like, jealous?

781
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,480
Wanted something
someone else had?

782
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,657
Sure. Heh.

783
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:50,659
Hey, but in the end, I believe
people get what they deserve.

784
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:56,007
And if you're patient and committed,
then you can get what you want.

785
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,537
Whatever you want.

786
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:04,882
Whether that means a
violin solo, or a better grade.

787
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,282
Or even a girl.

788
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,858
Sarah?

789
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,391
Sarah.

790
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,038
I didn't like <i>Happy Feet.</i>

791
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,575
What? What kind
of a kid are you?

792
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,372
Everybody likes <i>Happy Feet.</i>

793
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,412
Well, I'm not everybody.

794
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,072
- Hey.
- Hey, you're home.

795
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,548
Yeah, I got off early.
Where you guys been?

796
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,182
The video store.

797
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,413
We ran out of movies.

798
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,692
You know, if you
want, you can join us.

799
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,193
- We got a bunch of Jackie Chan movies.
- It's Charlie Chan.

800
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,297
Okay. Charlie Chan.

801
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,366
Sarah, can you give Mike
and I a second to talk?

802
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,866
Sure.

803
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:01,600
What's up?

804
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,742
What's in the Thermos, Mike?

805
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:05,905
I haven't been drinking.

806
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,810
- So, what's in the Thermos?
- I felt like having a bit of orange juice.

807
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,313
- Yeah?
- What's your problem?

808
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,041
- Prove it.
- I don't have to prove.

809
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,880
- You need to relax.
- I need to relax?

810
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,988
You've been
drinking while driving.

811
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,248
- I was not.
- Oh, yeah?

812
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,755
What's gotten into you?

813
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,085
- Give me that.
- No.

814
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,750
Let go.

815
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,985
That's it!

816
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,228
I'm done with you.

817
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,761
Tony.

818
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,304
Come on, Tony.
It was only a little...

819
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,905
You're out. You're moving out.

820
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:37,668
- We just went around the corner.
- Shouldn't let you in.

821
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,311
- What are you doing?
- I fall for this crap every time.

822
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,607
- No, please, Tony. Listen to me.
- I'm done listening too.

823
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,807
You're a drunk. You'll
always be a drunk.

824
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,818
- Come on, Tony.
- Get out of my way.

825
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,582
Look, I'll change, okay?
That's what you want.

826
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,349
How many times
have I heard that?

827
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,322
Tony, what are you doing?
- Stay here.

828
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,791
Tony.

829
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,091
- I got a job.
- Yeah.

830
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,200
And the day the
rent's due, you'll blow it.

831
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,494
- That's not true.
- It's true. It's always true.

832
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:07,161
You know what else?
You weren't a fire chief.

833
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:11,036
You're a captain, got demoted because
none of the guys wanted to go with you.

834
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,144
- You son of a bitch.
- Face facts, old man.

835
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,303
You killed that
rookie, didn't you?

836
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,944
You left him. You left him
burning in that building.

837
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,646
Too out of it to go save him.
Why don't you just face it?

838
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,017
You can't talk to me like that.

839
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,991
You killed him.

840
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,660
You killed your career.

841
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,731
And the only way Mom could
escape you was to die herself.

842
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,199
You did it, Dr. Kovac.

843
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,079
- I don't like this.
- Hey.

844
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,237
It's not all Mercedes
and racquetball.

845
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:57,939
I know that.

846
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:02,144
But I'm beginning to feel like the
politics aren't worth the paycheck.

847
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,618
First, you make me fire Weaver.

848
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,723
Then I spend half my
time in BS meetings.

849
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,590
- I'm flooded with paperwork, and this.
- Well, welcome to management, Luka.

850
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,594
This isn't me.

851
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,057
I'm resigning as chief.

852
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,399
Luka, part of being the
boss is being the bad guy.

853
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,333
I'll leave that to someone else.

854
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,268
I just wanna be a doctor.

855
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,965
Well, good night.
