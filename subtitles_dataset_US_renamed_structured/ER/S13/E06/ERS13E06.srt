1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,271
Have you been to Rednofive?
Do you wanna check it out tonight?

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,078
Maybe I can move
into your place.

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,114
I came in with a cough, and
you sent me out a cripple.

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,774
He had a heart murmur.

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,750
It was reasonable to believe that
Mr. Ames' numbness could wait.

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:24,688
It'd be good to get you in front of the
press as the doctor found not guilty.

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,087
You are very optimistic.

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,032
- I'm sorry.
- I don't wanna be alone.

10
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,292
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:46,106
Well, I'm coming. I'll
be there in a second.

12
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,537
Who is it? RAY: It's Ray.

13
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,138
- What are you doing here?
- You wanted me to look at your TV?

14
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,842
- It's 6:30.
- Well, you work in an hour.

15
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,418
I brought Krispy Kremes.

16
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,654
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just a little out of sorts.

17
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,797
- Look, uh, my cable isn't working.
- Okay, I'll take a look at it.

18
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,091
I'm gonna go and get dressed.

19
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,532
The jury's been out
three days. That's too long.

20
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,106
It's a lot of complicated stuff.

21
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,810
You're gonna be fine.

22
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,543
And remember, we have the
Croatian film festival tonight...

23
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,810
something I know I've
really been looking forward to.

24
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,648
- Maybe it'll take your mind off it.
- That sounds good.

25
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,149
Morning.

26
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:44,388
- How's the weather, Frank?
- Hurricane Up Yours is about to hit.

27
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,568
- What do you want? I'm filing.
- I'm just making small talk.

28
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,726
- How's it going?
- What, am I being punked?

29
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,896
- You never wonder how I'm doing.
- Course I do. How's the family?

30
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,901
My wife has a goiter.

31
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,737
- My kid has a hard time holding a job...
- Yeah, I gotta run.

32
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,210
Hey, what are you doing
later? You wanna hook up?

33
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,076
- Hook up?
- Yeah, prep for the M and M.

34
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,184
Give you a heads-up
before I kick your ass.

35
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,411
It's an educational
exercise, not <i>Survivor.</i>

36
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,022
- Somebody has her panties in a wad.
- Who's talking about my panties?

37
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,024
- Look, I'll try and find you later.
- Women are weird.

38
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,924
No, Neela's weird. Indian
and Brit? Bad combination.

39
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,997
Channel Five wants a photogenic,
well-spoken ER professional...

40
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,225
to do a health piece.

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,424
Anybody interested?

42
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,365
Let's start with "no"
and work from there.

43
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,664
Pretty boy, you in?

44
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,670
- Sorry, bad hair day.
- I'll do it.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,604
You're a newbie.
Put your hand down.

46
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,438
- What about Kovac?
- He's worn out. Gremlin's not sleeping.

47
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,012
- What about you?
- Nobody wants to hear from a nurse.

48
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:38,585
- Guess it's all you, Morris.
- No, me? No, I couldn't possibly.

49
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:42,120
I mean, if you guys
are forcing me, I... Okay.

50
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,282
Lou Smith, head injury, altered,
possible blunt abdominal trauma.

51
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,360
BP, 90, tachycardic.
Clipped by an SUV.

52
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,758
Yeah, I almost redlined it.

53
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,865
Abby's got the driver.
Ray, you're with me.

54
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,467
- Got hit on his Harley. ANGELA:
Luka, I need to talk to you.

55
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,967
My wife wanted
me to get a bicycle.

56
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,797
- She's gonna kill me for this.
- Luka, the jury's got a verdict.

57
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,411
C-spine, chest x-ray and trauma
panel. I'm a little busy right now.

58
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,979
Moving all extremities,
but the sats are borderline.

59
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,739
I told the court we'd be there.

60
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,441
- Fifteen liters O2.
- What's the protocol for intubation?

61
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,338
- Etomidate for sedation...
- Trauma 2.

62
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,321
And succinylcholine
as a paralytic.

63
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,583
Kerry can cover for you.

64
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,819
He's got a head injury. Wouldn't
you wanna use lidocaine first?

65
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,795
Yeah, it reduces the ICP
response to the intubation.

66
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,558
Good, good. ANGELA: Luka.

67
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,634
We have two major
trauma patients coming.

68
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:32,136
- This is important. You need to be there.
- Yeah, one, two, three.

69
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,604
- What are you doing?
- My job.

70
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,777
You gotta talk to Luka.

71
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,684
Knowing Ames' lawyers,
they've already called the press.

72
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,849
Do you know how bad County's
gonna look if he doesn't show up?

73
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,986
Go. I'll make sure he
gets there, I promise.

74
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,194
- Hang a liter of saline.
- Luka, I just talked to Angela.

75
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,665
- You should go.
- Why?

76
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,134
So people who don't
understand what we do here...

77
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,499
can pass judgment on me?

78
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,200
Think about how it reflects on
the department if you don't show up.

79
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,141
- Gram of Ancef.
- I think you already asked for that.

80
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,537
It's hanging.

81
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,615
Let me take over from here.

82
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,113
- What in the hell?
- Chuny, get Maintenance down here.

83
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,885
He's gonna need a portable
monitor for CT anyway.

84
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,460
Hook him up and let's roll.

85
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,798
Hey, Luka, I've
been through this.

86
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,367
Five years ago, I had a
patient with a runny nose...

87
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,163
who I sent home with meningitis.

88
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,331
I was sure the jury was
gonna nail me. They didn't.

89
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,045
Look, I'm telling
you as your friend...

90
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,511
hiding out here is sending
the wrong message.

91
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,741
Is that what you wanna do?
- Open the saline.

92
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,818
I was trying to get to Union
Station to pick up my wife.

93
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,010
Can somebody call her?

94
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,181
Why don't we just concentrate on
getting you better right now, okay?

95
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,856
- You gonna be okay without me?
- We're fine. Just go.

96
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,773
Excuse me. I'm
looking for Dr. Morris.

97
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,273
Mrs. Paik. Hi.
Hi, how's it going?

98
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,880
She's a premed student,
wanted a tour of the hospital.

99
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,708
- Why am I here, Archie?
- Shh.

100
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,010
- Five hundred cc's. PRATT:
Another liter, wide open.

101
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,709
Toss me the Betadine.

102
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,788
Ah. CBC, trauma panel,
type and cross for six.

103
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,355
I'll prime the infuser.

104
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,253
- It says "Helen."
- That's my wife.

105
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,192
Can you put that on speaker?
- <i>Hello? Garrett?</i>

106
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,458
- Mrs. Palsey?
<i>- Who the hell is this?</i>

107
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,693
All right, we need
to start a second line.

108
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,305
- This is Dr. Lockhart.
<i>- Who? Garrett, are you still at work?</i>

109
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,032
<i>Is that why you didn't pick
me up at the train station?</i>

110
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,040
- Honey, I'm in the hospital.
<i>- The what?</i>

111
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,372
Haleh, you do the Foley.

112
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,538
- Mr. Garrett, you'll feel a stick.
- Mrs. Palsey, are you driving?

113
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,311
<i>No, my daughter's driving, thanks
to Mr. Undependable not being here.</i>

114
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,149
All right, call for a portable
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

115
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,950
Mrs. Palsey, your husband's
been in an accident.

116
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,993
You need to get to County
General. He's been seriously injured.

117
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,326
<i>Oh, my God. He's what?
I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

118
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,558
This is Dawn Archer.

119
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,134
She moved from New
Orleans. Used to work at Charity.

120
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,135
- What's up, Dawn? I'm Ray.
- Katey.

121
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,797
- I'm Neela. I work in Surgery.
- Neela, check this out.

122
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,239
- She's busy.
- There's enough of her to go around.

123
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,505
Let's do a FAST scan and
we'll reassess. All right, what?

124
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,273
Fifteen-year-old, everted ankle.

125
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,349
- Mighty glad to meet you.
- And?

126
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,850
Well, it looks pretty
angulated, don't you think?

127
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,820
- Well, that's terrible, but I'm not Ortho.
- Oh, sorry, I got confused.

128
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,817
Want me to get the SonoSite?

129
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,259
Gates, we're really busy over here.
- I'll get it.

130
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,422
Might I suggest you
start off with an x-ray?

131
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,193
- Brilliant idea. Thank you.
- You guys got it from here?

132
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,802
- We've gotta go.
- I'll call you after the ultrasound.

133
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,837
Can someone wheel
her to X-ray, please?

134
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,440
Dawn, it's all you.

135
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,337
Dawn, meet Josie Weller.

136
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,502
Delightful to meet you. I've been
so looking forward to this day.

137
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,875
We're going to
Radiology, not Disneyland.

138
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,141
Marvelous squared.

139
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,548
Josie goes to Mountain View. It's
a school for kids with special needs.

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,815
You know you can take the Red
Line to Roosevelt and hop on the 12?

141
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,983
You have to walk, but the whole
thing should take half an hour...

142
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,685
unless you're a slow walker
and you miss your connection.

143
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,195
- Know why she goes to this school?
- I study French.

144
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,389
I'm just an aide...

145
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,128
but they all have some sort
of developmental disorder.

146
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,830
You have wonderful pecs.

147
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,477
Why do you hide them under
that unflattering white coat?

148
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:37,173
- Do a tox screen after the film, okay?
- No problem.

149
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,820
Glad you made it.

150
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,665
Are we going to win, Daddy?

151
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:59,170
So... Of course we're gonna win.
We didn't come this far for nothing.

152
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,745
All right? All right.

153
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,347
Okay.

154
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,950
I'm bagging at a rate of
16. Somebody call for a vent.

155
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,712
- Having trouble getting another
IV. PRATT: Throw in a femoral.

156
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,755
- What about a sternal intraosseous line?
- We don't have those.

157
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,451
We do. We got them three weeks ago.
- Army uses them a lot in Iraq.

158
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,186
Five hundred cc's out.

159
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,797
- You guys have the ultrasound?
- Yeah, but we need it.

160
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,730
- HemoCue's 8.5.
- Okay, bleeding into the chest.

161
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,428
And the cool thing is, Abby's
prepped the chest for me.

162
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,267
- What have you got?
- Still 80 systolic.

163
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,775
- I'm doing a central line here.
- Don't bother. Let me try this.

164
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,072
Wait a minute. Uh, no, no...

165
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,446
Got it. Run the saline.

166
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,141
- Hook up the Thora-Seal.
- I don't think that's the way...

167
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,115
- Nice.
- Very nice.

168
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,754
Wow, ultrasound to Neela.

169
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,755
I'm missing an esophageal
resection to respond to your call.

170
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,654
- I'd appreciate the bullet now.
- Okay.

171
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,658
A 50-year-old driver
versus motorcycle.

172
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,297
Hypotensive with pneumothorax
and fluid in Morrison's.

173
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:01,060
O-neg's running through a sternal IO.
Chest tube secure and ready for the O.R.

174
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,793
Let's pack up and take him up.

175
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,768
Fine, but then I want you to
get back to the ER for consults.

176
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,601
Yeah, well, I wanna
scrub in on this one.

177
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,242
I'm sorry?

178
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,503
That's at the discretion
of the Chief Resident.

179
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,274
That's me, who, having considered your
request, answers with a resounding no.

180
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,078
I want you to stay here with your
ER buddies and cover ER consults.

181
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,551
Now, <i>bystro, bystro.</i>

182
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,852
- Oh, gosh. Poor Neela.
- Is she why you haven't called me?

183
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,996
What are you talking
about? I've been busy.

184
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,187
It's okay.

185
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,993
A few "who's your daddy's?"
doesn't make us a couple.

186
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:39,167
No worries. It was
good. Just not that good.

187
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,433
And what in the hell is
that supposed to mean?

188
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,837
You have to move your hips.

189
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,649
You're not touring
with the Grateful Dead.

190
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,801
I move my hips.

191
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,038
Then move them to Admit.

192
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,479
We've got two GSWs and an
antifreeze ingestion coming in.

193
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,710
Look, I can't afford to
close a Trauma room.

194
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:56,050
- Have you had a problem there before?
- A shootout a few months back.

195
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,884
God knows what
got hit in the walls.

196
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,686
I'm gonna need to check the
panel box and open the wall.

197
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,056
Well, do what you have to do.

198
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,293
- Do it quickly.
- Get down.

199
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,042
- Something going on in here?
- No.

200
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,237
No, Benny got jacked and
passed out. I'm just sewing him up.

201
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,473
And this is funny why?

202
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:26,377
Uh, he was... He was
talking in his sleep.

203
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,715
Yeah, told a real zinger too.
- Oh.

204
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,848
These two rabbits
walk into a bar and, uh...

205
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,627
Okay, she's gone.

206
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,071
Whoa, whoa. Watch
the cuticles, all right?

207
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,503
Last time, I was bleeding
like a hemorrhoid.

208
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:52,075
We got a displaced fibular fracture.
Needs reduction under fluoro.

209
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,443
- You gonna sedate her for that?
- Yeah, set up for ketamine and Versed.

210
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,775
You got it.

211
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,919
So how's it going here?
You like everybody?

212
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,180
- Everyone seems really friendly.
- Happy birthday.

213
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,154
Even the patients.

214
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,791
All rise.

215
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:21,436
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- Yes, we have, Your Honor.

216
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,782
"In the matter of
<i>Ames v. Kovac...</i>

217
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:37,049
docket 06CH75255...

218
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,715
we, the jury, find in
favor of the defendant."

219
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,728
Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen, for your service.

220
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,493
The jury may now be excused.

221
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,532
Two units of O-neg,
three of type-specific...

222
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,530
and barely keeping
his systolic above 80.

223
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,498
- HemoCue?
- Dropped from 12 to 8.3.

224
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,037
- We're ready for you, Dr. Dubenko.
- That's my cue.

225
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,263
You need some help?

226
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,136
Isn't there something
you should be doing?

227
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,301
Well, not if you
require my assistance.

228
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,378
All right, then. Scrub in.

229
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,517
Fifteen-year-old female,
twisted her ankle during gym.

230
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,381
Displaced fibular fracture,
post-reduction films look good.

231
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,646
Dispo?

232
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,347
Home after casting with
pain meds and, uh, crutches.

233
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,186
Sounds good.
Follow up with Ortho.

234
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,352
There's one more thing. I just
got off the phone with her school.

235
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,225
- She has Asperger's syndrome.
- And?

236
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,231
And she's a little sexually
forward for her age.

237
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,336
- I'm guessing that that's her.
- Yeah.

238
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,404
You see that sometimes
with Asperger's.

239
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,065
I was thinking about giving her condom
ed. and starting her on Depo-Provera.

240
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,142
Depo? That may be
a little too proactive.

241
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,473
She's a teenager, but
mentally, she's a kid.

242
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,742
- I don't know if she can take hormones.
- I don't need no wheelchair.

243
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,752
- Hospital policy for all our patients.
- Let go, Morris. Stop touching me.

244
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:19,052
Uh, well, before you start any
form of hormonal birth control...

245
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,887
check an ICON and do a pelvic.

246
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,029
Call me when you're
ready. I'll supervise.

247
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,756
Hey, Kerry. Can you do me
a favor and see my guy in 4?

248
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,401
He's been here 14 hours for
a pre-employment physical.

249
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,934
Doesn't have a primary-care doc?

250
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,329
Classic misuse of the ER.

251
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:37,443
Dr. Lockhart. Five pages in 45
minutes. I hope someone's dying.

252
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,375
- Stab wound to the right shoulder.
- Get Rasgotra.

253
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,606
I'm scrubbing in on an
esophageal jejunostomy.

254
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,842
Well, hold up. Neela's
in the O.R. with an MVC.

255
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,921
- No, Neela's here, covering consults.
- No, Neela's in the O.R.

256
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,255
- Are you trying to irritate me?
- Well, you make it so easy.

257
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,087
Take a bigger
bite. Don't be shy.

258
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,795
My wife is going to be pissed.

259
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,233
You were hit by a
car. It's not your fault.

260
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,933
The only times I've seen her mad
were the day I brought the Harley home...

261
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,270
and the day we met.

262
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,643
- The day you met?
- Yeah. She's a photographer.

263
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:20,809
She was in the park shooting
this <i>Chicago Magazine</i> thing...

264
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,456
and I kept getting
in the picture.

265
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,787
- Intentionally?
- No, no.

266
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,453
Not at first, but when I
saw it was getting to her...

267
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,293
I kept doing it.

268
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:37,927
And I told her I'd stop if
she'd give me her number.

269
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,266
- Well, I guess that worked.
- Yeah.

270
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,969
Six months later, we were
engaged, looking at houses.

271
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,510
That's sweet.

272
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,672
I'm gonna check on my hemophiliac.
Make sure you evert the edges.

273
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,317
- Okay.
- You know, we had some...

274
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,455
We've been through
some tough times...

275
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,788
but she got us through them.

276
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,688
- It's nice to have someone like that.
- Yeah.

277
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,022
Lou Smith, came in as an
MVC. Hit on his motorcycle.

278
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,996
- He should've taken the train.
- Who's taking care of him?

279
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,634
- I wish I was.
- Why the delivery?

280
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,099
We could see this on the PACS.

281
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,363
Come on, it's an
excuse to see me, right?

282
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,337
Uh, wrong. Look at this.

283
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,607
- Oh, man.
- Those are brain mets.

284
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,146
- What's his primary cancer?
- Cancer? He came in as trauma.

285
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,285
Ventricles look good. No midline
shift, no edema. Sounds like...

286
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,886
My husband's Garrett
Palsey. He was brought in.

287
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,319
Hi, I'm Abby Lockhart. I
worked on your husband.

288
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,619
- What does that mean?
- Mom, it means she treated him.

289
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,355
- Let me see if he's still in surgery.
- Please, he needs me there with him.

290
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,056
Another round of platelets
and FFP. More lap pads.

291
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:43,397
He's oozing around the
packing. Think it's retroperitoneal?

292
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,734
Yeah, probably. Hold
pressure over the portal triad.

293
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,964
Clamp.

294
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,633
- This is the Pringle maneuver, right?
- Yes, but nobody...

295
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,370
No one calls it that anymore.

296
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,340
Dr. Crenshaw.

297
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,984
Was I unclear when I
assigned you to consults?

298
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,243
No? Do I speak too fast?

299
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:03,253
Or is it that I accidentally lapsed
into Aramaic, as I am prone to do?

300
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,857
- No, I...
- Then explain what you're doing here...

301
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,187
instead of seeing any
of the eight consults...

302
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,091
currently waiting
on you in the ER.

303
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,926
You didn't mention you were
covering the ER, Dr. Rasgotra.

304
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,591
I'm sorry. I was here, he
was unstable, and I thought...

305
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,067
You don't think. You're
years away from thinking.

306
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,934
If I tell you to do consults,
that is not a suggestion.

307
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:24,168
That is an order.
Do you understand?

308
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,369
- Pulse is dropping, 61.
- Give her a break.

309
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,981
Patient's crashing. I
needed another pair of hands.

310
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,340
I lost an excellent
esophageal jejunostomy...

311
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,076
because I had to
clean up her mess.

312
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,686
Plenty to go around here.

313
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:38,086
Mobilize the left triangular
ligament for me, will you?

314
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,427
He's still in surgery, but
I can bring you upstairs.

315
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,858
Did they say how he's doing?

316
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,056
I'm sure they'll give
us an update up there.

317
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,292
Frank, page me if my
pediatrician calls again.

318
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,993
Do I look like your girl Friday?

319
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,431
- Hey, you're not in jail.
- Not this time, Frank.

320
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,304
I just got off the phone
with Angela. Congratulations.

321
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,412
- Thanks for the pep talk.
- That's great news, Luka.

322
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,775
Morris owes me 50 bucks.

323
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,645
- He swore you were going down.
- I'm not going anywhere.

324
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,814
I knew you would win. I
prayed on it, Dr. Kovac.

325
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,319
Well, it worked. Thanks.
How are your patients?

326
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,960
Our motorcycle guy, Mr. Smith, is
thirsty. Could I give him some ice chips?

327
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,219
Yup, that's a good idea.

328
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,829
He's gonna need more than
ice chips. Look at his scan.

329
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,297
I called his oncologist at Huntington.
Brain mets from pancreatic cancer.

330
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,835
- Is he in treatment?
- He failed rescue chemotherapy.

331
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,336
From what this scan shows,
he belongs in a hospice.

332
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,772
- What about radiation?
- For metastatic pancreatic cancer?

333
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,503
Hospice can probably help
him enjoy his remaining time.

334
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,013
- Which is just about up.
- Dr. Kovac.

335
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,482
- I'll talk to his family.
- I am the family.

336
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,680
- This is his wife, Mrs. Smith.
- It's spread, hasn't it?

337
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,419
- Uh, can we go over here?
- Has it spread?

338
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,826
- Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.
- It's in his brain.

339
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,363
Oh, I thought we had a couple
of years, maybe even more.

340
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:01,135
We were supposed to go
on a bike tour in Provence.

341
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,331
I'm sorry, Mrs. Smith.

342
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,072
Well, I guess, uh, this
was supposed to happen.

343
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,642
Wow. I think that it's
best that it comes from me.

344
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,844
I think that I should
be the one to tell him.

345
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,182
We'll give you some time.

346
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,382
When you're ready, I could
come in and answer any questions.

347
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,027
Mr. Gallagher, your
slit-lamp exam was negative.

348
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,629
There is nothing in your eye.

349
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,557
It still hurts.

350
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,394
Well, maybe because
you keep rubbing it.

351
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,662
Maybe you're missing something.
I'd like to see an eye specialist.

352
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,237
Your eye will be fine.

353
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,568
This doesn't warrant an
Ophthalmology consult.

354
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,835
Doctor, the electrician
is ready to see you.

355
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,071
- Give him a gram of acetaminophen.
- What are you "gramming" about?

356
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,478
I got crap in my eye. I
wanna see the doctor.

357
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,550
We can fix it, but it's
gonna take a week.

358
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,243
How much will
it cost for a rush?

359
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,389
It's not the money. I
gotta wait for parts.

360
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,887
I don't think you understand.

361
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,391
If we shut down the Trauma,
patients get diverted to other ERs...

362
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,756
and there'll be longer
transport times and...

363
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,592
Hey. MAN: Did
someone say Chante?

364
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:00,824
Just give me a minute.

365
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,565
- Chante.
- Morris, what the hell are you doing?

366
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,730
My eyebrows. The
camera picks up everything.

367
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,899
- Get out.
- Dr. Weaver, please. I just need...

368
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,740
There's a rectal prolapse in Curtain
2 with your name on it. Now go.

369
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,575
Leave me a little
powder. I tend to shine.

370
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,772
Just go.

371
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,351
- So Josie's ankle will be fine?
- A month in a cast and she's good to go.

372
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,714
I told you, dear.

373
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
He thought she was gonna
need a wheelchair or something.

374
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,025
- No, none of that.
- Tony's very good for a neophyte.

375
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,595
- May I speak with you a second, please?
- Yeah, sure.

376
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,757
I'd like to talk to you about
your daughter. She's, uh... She...

377
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,671
- How do I say this?
- She got naked again?

378
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,603
- So it wasn't just me?
- Isn't he adorable?

379
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,207
Her condition makes her
act like that. It's no big deal.

380
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,938
This is a big deal. Have
you talked about birth control?

381
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,380
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're her father.

382
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,746
- The school will handle it.
- It's not their job.

383
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,821
Her school's different.
That's why we sent her there.

384
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,891
Look, Mr. Weller, I realize
this is a difficult conversation.

385
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,960
You think birth control's
the answer to...?

386
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,596
- Honey.
- Josie's a pretty girl.

387
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,995
Smart, open. If she takes her
clothes off in front of the wrong guy...

388
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,997
Josie likes Hilary
Duff and MySpace.

389
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,225
I'm sure she does...

390
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:14,464
but Josie doesn't have the same
ability to say no like other kids.

391
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,415
Thank you, Lucien,
for letting me scrub in.

392
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,683
I wish it ended better,
but I appreciate...

393
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:25,707
Listen to me.

394
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,620
Dr. Crenshaw is your
chief, and he owns you.

395
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,519
He owns you.

396
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,091
As smart as you think
you are, that guy is smarter.

397
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,922
You'll start
respecting that today.

398
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,264
And if you ever play me like
that again, ever run to Daddy...

399
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:43,334
when you don't like Mommy's rules,
you will be done here, do you hear me?

400
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,534
This is your only warning.

401
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,537
Now, Mr. Palsey's
family is waiting. Go.

402
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,533
Go.

403
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,025
This is Mr. Palsey's wife and
daughter. This is Dr. Rasgotra.

404
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,569
How's Garrett? Is he all right?

405
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,400
Well, when we opened
your husband's abdomen...

406
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,304
we found it full of blood.

407
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:28,311
- But you can fix that?
- The accident tore the vena cava.

408
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:34,410
We tried to repair it for over an
hour, but he was bleeding too fast.

409
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,322
Okay. Okay, so, what
happened to my father?

410
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,795
Mrs. Palsey, he died.

411
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,597
Oh, God.

412
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,501
- Oh, God.
- We made every effort.

413
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,271
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

414
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,542
Okay. It's all right. I got her, I
got her. Back up. Mrs. Palsey?

415
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,743
Mrs. Palsey?

416
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,949
Mrs. Palsey?

417
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,593
- Mrs. Palsey? Mrs. Palsey?
- She should be waking up by now.

418
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,593
- Pulse ox only 91. PRATT:
I'll bag her through this.

419
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,391
- She's okay, right? PRATT:
She needs time to come around.

420
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,726
Systolic's down to 88.

421
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,028
Does your mother suffer
from a heart condition?

422
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,226
- No.
- High cholesterol?

423
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,702
- What are you talking about?
- Look at the monitor.

424
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,637
- ST elevation, T wave inversion.
- The leads must be reversed.

425
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,311
Nothing wrong with the
leads. Looks like a massive MI.

426
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,879
- CBC, lytes and troponins.
- MI? I know what that is.

427
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,913
My mother can't be
having a heart attack.

428
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,641
She's 45. No risk factors.

429
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,650
Charging to 360. Clear.

430
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,414
- No change.
- All right, amp of epi.

431
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,651
Neela, pick up the pace.
A hundred per minute.

432
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,591
- Is she on any medications?
- No. What's happening?

433
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,164
Your mom's heart's
in a dangerous rhythm.

434
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,805
Shock again after five cycles.

435
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:58,836
Okay, have lido ready. Acute LV
dysfunction after a sudden tragic event.

436
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,236
- This is broken-heart syndrome.
- I read about that. Never seen a case.

437
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,741
Stress cardiomyopathy
from the catecholamine surge.

438
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,347
- No cardiac risk factors. It all fits.
- You want the lidocaine?

439
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,746
Yeah, all right, 7-5, MAC
2. Someone call Cardiology.

440
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,943
All right, so we're
gonna give you a shot.

441
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,315
- I don't like shots.
- Josie, it's gonna be fine.

442
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,754
Yeah, it'll pinch a little at
first, but it's gonna protect you.

443
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,986
Did you know the Blue Line goes
from O'Hare to Irving Park Road?

444
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:26,360
Jump off and take the 80 towards
the lake. It'll drop you at Sheridan.

445
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,627
We're talking about something
very serious now, hon. Pay attention.

446
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,863
So you're gonna have to come
back every three months for a shot.

447
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,439
And I'm gonna give you some
education on condom use.

448
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,666
For when we have sex.

449
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,539
No, not when we have
sex, when you have sex.

450
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,943
That doesn't mean you're
old enough or ready...

451
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,551
but when the time comes, I just
wanna make sure you're prepared, okay?

452
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,153
Can I get a pen and
paper and take notes?

453
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,023
Just no props or diagrams.

454
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,058
- What the hell is Morris doing?
- Not his job, that's for sure.

455
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,455
Here we see firsthand...

456
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,688
the effect of overexuberant
Halloween-candy consumption.

457
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,730
Little Luke here has
a bowel obstruction.

458
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,129
Too much taffy gummed
up the works, right?

459
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,237
We're gonna stick this
tube in his stomach.

460
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,531
- He's not moving air.
- Point-3 epi sub-Q.

461
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,505
Continuous albuterol,
intubation tray. Call RT.

462
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,304
Hey, you guys are in the way.

463
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:15,346
I'm just warning parents so
people don't abuse the ER system.

464
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,983
Overeating Halloween candy
is not draining the system.

465
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,881
- This is.
- Can you explain the patient's condition?

466
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,386
Asthmatic. He got laid
off. No job, no insurance.

467
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,853
Hey, I got more stuff.

468
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,425
Instead of costing his
insurance company 10 bucks...

469
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:31,689
taxpayers will spend tens of thousands
of dollars taking care of him in the ER.

470
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,890
You're a proponent of
a national health plan?

471
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,228
If we had one, this guy
would be home with his kids...

472
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,098
instead of
fighting for his life.

473
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,906
That was gold.

474
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:44,271
- What's her name?
- Dr. Judas.

475
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,873
Three-sixty again. Clear.

476
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,109
- Asystole. NEELA: V-fib.
Another 50 of lidocaine.

477
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:56,722
- Let's try amiodarone.
- Neela, she's in asystole.

478
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,915
All right, let's try one
more round of epi.

479
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,115
No, please don't stop.

480
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,761
Syndrome causes a
transient ventricular weakness.

481
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,261
It's temporary. It's
reversible. She'll get better.

482
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:08,094
- We've been flogging her for 20 minutes.
- Epi's in.

483
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,566
- Husband just died.
- Please don't give up.

484
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,762
She's had five rounds.
She's not responding.

485
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,134
All right, hold compressions.

486
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,277
- Oh, God. Mom.
- Neela, stop.

487
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,623
Back in sinus.

488
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,041
You sign them out?

489
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,814
No. Mr. Smith? SMITH: Hey.

490
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,450
You got a great team here, doc.

491
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,177
Do you have any questions
you want me to answer or...?

492
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,687
No, I'm just praying
my Harley still runs.

493
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:08,294
Dr. Kovac, I'd like to sign those
papers you were talking about.

494
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,089
Yeah, sure. Uh,
right over there.

495
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,459
Give us a second, please.

496
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,932
You didn't tell your husband
about the brain mets?

497
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,663
No, he thinks the chemo
worked. Let's leave it at that.

498
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,364
I don't lie to patients.

499
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,873
Look, when he was first
diagnosed, he shut down.

500
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,205
For the past six months,
he's been living it up.

501
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,814
He's been taking tango
lessons and scuba lessons.

502
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,474
And we are going to
France in December.

503
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,552
He has the right
to know the truth.

504
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,053
- Why spend his last months in fear?
- Dr. Kovac?

505
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,056
I mean, if he just has a little
hope, at least there can be...

506
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,026
- There's still chance for a miracle.
- Ray, put them back in the room, please.

507
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:47,291
We wouldn't even be here if it
wasn't for that stupid car accident.

508
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,401
Mrs. Smith, I'm giving
you a second chance.

509
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:53,402
You're gonna tell him now or I'll
tell him when I come back, okay?

510
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,240
- Mr. Ames.
- You were celebrating.

511
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,075
In court today. You
were celebrating.

512
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:07,413
Mr. Ames, we were just happy
that the case was over, that's all.

513
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,420
You were happy that you got
over. Isn't that what you really mean?

514
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,219
Look, I have patients.

515
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,261
I was a patient.
Don't you remember?

516
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,661
Mr. Ames, you
shouldn't be back here.

517
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,193
Isn't this where the
sick come to get healthy?

518
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,066
- Because I wanna get healthy.
- Hey, do you need some help here?

519
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,607
- Do these people know what you did?
- It's under control. It's okay.

520
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:34,269
I came in here with a
cough, and I went out like this.

521
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,006
I gave you the best
treatment possible.

522
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:40,448
While I was having a
stroke, you ignored me.

523
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,848
- Mr. Ames, that's...
- You ignored me.

524
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,853
- You did.
- You should go. You should...

525
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,047
Go where?

526
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,524
- Where am I gonna go?
- Security.

527
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,455
If you had let me go
home in the first place...

528
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,030
then none of this
would've happened in the...

529
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,191
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to...

530
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,701
I want you to give
me my life back.

531
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,636
- Just give me my life back.
- Come on, get up. Get up.

532
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:08,577
Give it back.
Give it back to me.

533
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,411
Stop. Get off.

534
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,450
Get him off.

535
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,367
Mr. Ames?

536
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,040
Mr. Ames, wait up.

537
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:39,042
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

538
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,570
You wanna make sure I'm okay?

539
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:46,210
No, I'm not okay.
I'm not okay at all.

540
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,552
See, when you came in
the court this morning...

541
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,886
I was telling my
kids about justice.

542
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,619
They were looking at
that lady with the scales.

543
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,890
And I said that justice
was gonna be done today.

544
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,461
But I don't think it was.

545
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,399
I know you don't
feel that way, but...

546
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,200
Look, I just wanna
hear it from you...

547
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:14,039
without the filters of
lawyers or judges, anybody.

548
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,308
Did you give me the
best possible care?

549
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:25,219
At any given moment, I'm
responsible for 40 acute patients.

550
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,327
We try our best to watch everyone.
It's hard. We're... We're not gods.

551
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,264
So you feel you
paid attention to me?

552
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,932
I followed your progress,
examined you once a shift.

553
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,298
Your wife and I were
in constant contact.

554
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,666
You talked to my wife?

555
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,405
Listen, the stress of something
like this can cause you...

556
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,068
No, no, no, you don't
understand. Don't understand.

557
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,443
After the stroke, I
came home one day...

558
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,585
and all of her stuff was gone.

559
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,687
Same with the kids.

560
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,256
So I called her sister, I
checked the machine.

561
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:05,629
Finally, I get an e-mail telling
me that this was too much.

562
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,631
This. Me.

563
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,635
Pursuing you, pursuing
this. It was too much.

564
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,701
She thought that, uh...

565
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,971
That nothing was
gonna ever come of this...

566
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:23,343
and that if I
couldn't move on...

567
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,144
then she was gonna have
to move on without me.

568
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,121
Eighteen years, and she
leaves me in an e-mail.

569
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:36,394
I figured that I'd just
win this, you know?

570
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:40,293
I'd win this case and I
would send that e-mail back...

571
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,492
and then she'd come back home.

572
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:50,172
There are people who
can help you. Groups.

573
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:56,474
But I don't want any help.

574
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:01,380
I want things back
the way they were.

575
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,186
I wanna work. And it wasn't
some government check.

576
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:12,153
- I build things. That's what I do.
- I know.

577
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:18,596
But I just don't
know how to fix this.

578
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,069
How do I fix this?

579
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,376
I'm sorry, I have to get back.

580
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:36,713
- No, I got it. I understand.
- Look, if you need anything...

581
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,457
Curtis. My name is Curtis.

582
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,094
Of course. Curtis.

583
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,890
If you need anything,
give me call, okay?

584
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,472
If a laparotomy is indicated to
rule out a life-threatening condition...

585
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,736
the procedure doesn't
become unnecessary...

586
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,812
just because the
condition is ruled out.

587
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,778
You lost me.

588
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:07,113
Well, the ER keeps accusing us of
performing unnecessary surgery...

589
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,413
but we believed the
guy had a triple A.

590
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,057
- If we waited, he'd die.
- He didn't have a triple A.

591
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,420
Given his symptoms, we would've
been right 90 percent of the time.

592
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,622
- Then surgery would have saved his life.
- Good. Do it like that.

593
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:22,233
- Okay, your turn.
- I'm fine. I know how to do this.

594
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,993
I'll just pull some articles.

595
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,297
If you're not prepared, the Attendings
are gonna have you on a spit.

596
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,271
- Let me take a look. Give it.
- No, I'll be fine. Hey.

597
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,139
You're gonna see my
secret winning strategy.

598
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,643
My spelling is awful, huh?

599
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,284
- Tony...
- Worse than awful, my...

600
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,785
My syntax and my grammar and...

601
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:47,119
- Yeah, but how do you...?
- I'm a little dyslexic.

602
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:52,459
I've learned to work around it,
and most of the time, it's fine.

603
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:53,655
Hi. NEELA: Hi.

604
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,630
- We're having girls' night out.
- You in?

605
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,961
- I'm busy.
- I'm free.

606
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,764
- Preparing for the M and M.
- Go out with the girls.

607
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:02,169
- Tony, we...
- We'll talk about this later.

608
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,703
Maybe it's a good thing
that you talked to him.

609
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,107
Yeah, he just feels alone.

610
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,045
Dr. Kovac, we still need to
break the news to Mr. Smith.

611
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,151
- She didn't tell him?
- She's sticking to her guns.

612
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,323
Okay, uh, go ahead and
sign out. I gotta do this.

613
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,483
Wait a minute, though.
We have tickets to <i>Ig...</i>

614
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,654
Yes, in an hour.

615
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,992
Well, we can just do
it some other night.

616
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,726
- You're canceling?
- Oh, my God, you're disappointed.

617
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,334
No, I guess I just have to go
to Ike Ryan's with everybody.

618
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,169
I'll come pick you up.

619
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,639
How's it going?

620
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,875
Hey, I'm ready to get out of
here, doc. How's my CT look?

621
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:50,751
Well, uh, the good news
is, there is no skull fracture.

622
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,892
- There's no hemorrhage.
- Thank God.

623
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,687
I don't know if
my wife told you...

624
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,388
but three years ago, I was
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

625
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,534
I don't have time for
some brain injury too.

626
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,527
- I got trips to take, friends to see.
- Yeah, sounds like fun.

627
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:10,267
Yeah, my wife and I, we're
going to Provence for the holidays.

628
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,537
Might even go to Paris, eat
some Grand Marnier crepes...

629
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,341
and some of the best
Bordeaux we can find.

630
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,512
Well, I don't wanna stand
in the way of your plans.

631
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:22,710
Uh...

632
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,551
All you have to do is sign these papers
and I'll start you on new medications.

633
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:29,718
You can explain them to my
wife. She handles all the medicines.

634
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,886
No problem. Can we talk?

635
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,904
Oh, my God, thank
you. Thank you so much.

636
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,405
He cannot ride the Harley.

637
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:47,068
- Okay, but what about the trip?
- You better rent a car and do the driving.

638
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,077
He could have
seizures or a stroke.

639
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,649
I wanna make sure I'm not
setting someone up to get hurt.

640
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,978
Okay, I promise.

641
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,316
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thank you.

642
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,219
- Provence is beautiful.
- Thank you.

643
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,260
- How's your promotion going?
- I'm hanging in there.

644
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,923
Still got a few knuckleheads
I gotta beat into shape...

645
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,932
but other than
that, it's all right.

646
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,266
- Are they showing you respect?
- You know how it is.

647
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:18,740
They do what they do.
We keep pushing through it.

648
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,175
To pushing through it.

649
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,017
To pushing through it.

650
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,122
You'd better get that.

651
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,526
No, no, no, it's probably
a Jehovah's Witness.

652
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:44,095
- They're very persistent.
- Yeah.

653
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,761
- Save my spot, okay?
- Mm-hm.

654
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,942
All right, hold on.

655
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,615
Ah...

656
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,308
What you doing here?
Now's not a good time.

657
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,852
It's Thursday. You said I
could move in on Thursday.

658
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,853
No, no, I said Friday,
tomorrow, <i>mañana.</i>

659
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,958
No, you said I could
move in on Thursday.

660
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,185
- I said Fri... WOMAN:
Hey, what's up?

661
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,852
- Oh. My bad.
- Who's this?

662
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,464
- This is my brother Chaz.
- Hey.

663
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,160
- How you doing?
- Hey. You, uh, moving in?

664
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,670
Yeah, but he's supposed
to move in Friday.

665
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,206
<i>Thursday.</i>

666
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,037
Oh, Greg, you cannot let
him sit out there in the hallway.

667
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:30,842
- Come on in. Are you hungry?
- I'm 18. I'm always hungry.

668
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:34,850
- Betina, come on. BETINA:
So, what can I get you?

669
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,748
Okay, okay, okay.

670
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,826
I would shag...

671
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,756
I don't know. I guess
I would shag Pratt.

672
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,231
I knew you had the fever.

673
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,202
And shoot Morris.
Do us all a favor.

674
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,207
I think you're a little
too hard on Dr. Morris.

675
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,039
I mean, he has potential.

676
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:07,344
Apparently, Morris is in the
process of bringing God into his life.

677
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,953
Dr. Weaver, is that you on TV?

678
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,521
<i>Is not draining the system.</i>

679
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,884
It is.

680
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,583
- Turn it up, turn it up.
- Turn it up, turn it up.

681
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,888
Oh, the camera really
does show everything.

682
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,074
- Look at you.
- My hair looks like crap.

683
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,361
Kerry, you look good.

684
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,092
Is that Morris? - Morris?

685
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,974
You okay?

686
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,576
Bad day. And the nights are...

687
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,643
I've been having these dreams.

688
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,245
About Michael?

689
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,811
No, Gates.

690
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,751
Oh. Heh.

691
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:49,987
- It's stupid. It's my frigging hormones.
- It's not stupid. It's human.

692
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,995
And he's cute and he's nice.

693
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,565
And you can't just
sit and mourn forever.

694
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,230
Yeah, but it's only
been six months.

695
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,604
That's longer than
you were married.

696
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:06,936
- You always thought I rushed into it.
- Well, Michael was a great guy.

697
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:11,105
You were just young
and impetuous...

698
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,451
and I don't think he'd want
you to put your life on hold.

699
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,914
I know. You're right.

700
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,127
So, what exactly are
these dreams you're having?

701
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,628
Oh, your average intubation.

702
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:31,133
- Extubation. Re-intubation.
- Okay, I get it.

703
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,600
- Why don't you call him?
- Oh, God, no.

704
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,433
No, come on. You
better do it quick.

705
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:39,100
One of these girls is gonna
shag, shoot or marry him.

706
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,810
Well, we are studying
for the M and M together.

707
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,109
Excuse me.

708
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,616
Could you set my friend
up with some tequila?

709
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,210
Well.

710
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,353
Hey. GATES: Hey.

711
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:58,485
- What are you up to?
- Answering e-mail. What's up?

712
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:01,462
- Sarah got an A on her English paper.
- That's great.

713
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:06,333
She had to write an essay on who
she'd most like to have dinner with.

714
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,301
Guess who she picked.

715
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,398
Me, of course.

716
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:15,704
Gandhi? Madame Curie?

717
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,107
Keith.

718
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:24,884
- She wants to ask him why he died.
- Let me see that.

719
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,820
Every time I think she's
gotten over losing her father...

720
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,986
- This isn't bad.
- You think?

721
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,591
Yeah, she wants to know
why he fought in that war...

722
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,498
and why did he have to leave
before she got to know him.

723
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,366
These are good questions.

724
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,871
All right, all right, all
right. Call him, call him.

725
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,447
- Who is it?
- It's Ray, isn't it?

726
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,550
Are you mad? It's somebody
I met at a conference.

727
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,654
Then hit those digits, sister.

728
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,950
I miss him, T.

729
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,286
- Me too.
- You do?

730
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,930
Yeah.

731
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,956
Yeah, every day.

732
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,401
Tony, my computer crashed again.

733
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,302
In fact, yesterday I
went by our old school.

734
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,568
I thought about all the
touch football we used to play.

735
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,713
You mean how he used
to burn you all the time?

736
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,209
Yeah. In his dreams.

737
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,911
Well, he did get the girl, huh?

738
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,924
Yeah, he sure did.

739
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,155
- Hello?
- Uh, is Tony there?

740
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,755
I'm sorry, he's a little busy
right now. Can I take a message?

741
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,456
Never mind.

742
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,460
- It's a bung number.
- You wanna try it again?

743
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,764
- No, I'm good.
- Is it Gates?

744
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,700
Wait, wait, wait. Let's
get back to the game.

745
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,778
- Okay, Abby, shag, shoot or...?
- Not me, though.

746
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:32,610
You just don't wanna talk.
