00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,871
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,371
You got one week, Mike, one.

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:11,535
I want you to know, I really appreciate
it. You won't even know I'm there.

4
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:15,240
- There's just a lot of stuff going on.
- Gates?

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,975
But I wanna sort it out.
I'm trying to sort it out.

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,382
I just need a bit of time.

7
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:24,821
I work on gay patients all the
time. I work with gay doctors.

8
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,824
Greg, you're more like
Dad than you realize.

9
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,519
No.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,532
- It's not coming out like I mean.
- I sure hope someday you prove me wrong.

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,967
- Are you my dad or not?
- There's a simple test we can take.

12
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:43,270
It's called a paternity
test and if you want...

13
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,476
we can take it tonight.

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,215
- I'm in pain, I've been here three hours.
- I'm sorry, we're very busy.

15
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,152
- You haven't done crap.
- I'll try to...

16
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,157
- You said that an hour ago, bitch.
- I'm doing the best I can.

17
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,726
So why don't you
just settle down?

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,556
- No, you settle down.
- Oh!

19
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,099
Okay. So, what went wrong?

20
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,835
- She didn't stay calm.
- Her tone was threatening.

21
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,341
She needed to keep her distance.

22
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,804
You okay?

23
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,351
All right, good.

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,014
So let's review the key points
of managing assaultive behavior.

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,754
I made coffee.

26
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,795
Thanks.

27
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,903
Is this your history project?

28
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,766
- No, I'm paying the bills.
- Huh?

29
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,035
- You've been late three months in a row.
- Sarah...

30
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,075
I don't want them
turning off electricity.

31
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,703
- Is that my checkbook?
- I make them out, you still have to sign.

32
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,713
Sweetie, I know
you're trying to help...

33
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,045
- Morning.
- Hey.

34
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,950
- Nice outfit.
- Job interview.

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,717
- What kind of job?
- Executive assistant.

36
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,883
That's a fancy name
for answering the phone.

37
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,556
Maybe he can help with the rent.

38
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,127
We have $90 to get
us through the week.

39
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,174
Look, if this thing comes through,
I'll be out of your hair in no time.

40
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,077
- Yeah, right.
- Hey.

41
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,908
All right, shredded
wheat or cornflakes?

42
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,441
- So how you been?
- I've been all right.

43
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,943
Hey, how about those Cubs, huh?

44
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,750
Catch that game
last night? Some win.

45
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,492
No.

46
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,453
All right. Uh...

47
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,096
Okay, so you invite me to
breakfast to talk about baseball.

48
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,196
No, it's something else.

49
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,472
I wanna fix things.

50
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,771
- Neck.
- Ha!

51
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,379
Knee. LITCHMAN: Good.

52
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,948
- Nuts.
- Good, good.

53
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,849
Now, remember the goal
is to defuse violent behavior.

54
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,957
This training is
just a last resort.

55
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,816
- Next.
- Come on, Sam, go, go. Woo-hoo!

56
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,725
Kick his ass, Sam. - Let's go.

57
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,728
You ready? Hm-hm-hm.

58
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,956
Nose.

59
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,633
Come on, you can
do better than that.

60
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:23,930
Nuts.

61
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,140
- Show me some strength.
- I just don't wanna hurt you.

62
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,833
I've got enough
padding on to stop a tank.

63
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,473
Come on. ALL: Neck.

64
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,408
I'm worried about you, Sam.

65
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,049
Bad guys will rip a little
lady like you to shreds.

66
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,980
- Oh, really? You think?
- Yeah, I know.

67
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,744
Knee.

68
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,247
Aah! ALL: Whoa!

69
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,997
Look, I've been
thinking about it a lot.

70
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,829
I let you down. I know that.

71
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,904
It doesn't matter
what you wanna do...

72
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,841
or how you wanna
live, I'm still your brother.

73
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,080
See, when I pushed
you away, I messed up.

74
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,851
But I can do better.
I think we both can.

75
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,415
Look, it's just like
when you moved in.

76
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,425
You know, you could've
been a little bit more honest.

77
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,689
You could've told me what
was really going on with you.

78
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,358
I didn't know how to tell you.

79
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,701
What, are you on some
12-step program or something?

80
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,066
No, man, it's just...

81
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,136
I spent too many years
pushing people away.

82
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,273
I don't wanna do that anymore.

83
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,714
That mean you gonna
be talking to Dad?

84
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,553
Let me work my way up to it.

85
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,783
I'll give you that.

86
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,628
- It's been five days.
- So?

87
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,827
So? Fever without
source freaks me out.

88
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,427
- It's a virus.
- Yeah.

89
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,164
Or it could be a serious
infection that we're missing.

90
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,333
Look, he's playing well,
he's eating. Joe's not sick.

91
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,173
Well, I'm gonna check
this just to make sure.

92
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,837
- Abby.
- What?

93
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,849
What? I got a little urine
sample this morning, so?

94
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,509
Dr. Kovac.

95
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,154
- Bad CHF, Trauma 2.
- Okay.

96
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,225
- Class over already?
- It ended a little early.

97
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,619
You're being silly.

98
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,528
If this were someone else's
baby, you'd tell them not to worry.

99
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,997
All right, you're right.

100
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,369
He probably just caught my cold.

101
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,512
Hey, Timmy. You're back.

102
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,624
- And better than ever.
- Can you send this for a UA?

103
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,623
- Which patient?
- John Doe.

104
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,352
All right. I got it.

105
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,957
Officer Litchman needs a room.

106
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,566
Curtain 2, and hold for a chart.

107
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,236
Nice move. We were
supposed to be off till noon.

108
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,167
- Sorry.
- Whoa.

109
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,205
Dislocated patella.
How did that happen?

110
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,539
He was teaching the
Assaultive Behavior class.

111
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,580
Nurse here got a little
carried away. Kicks like a mule.

112
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,912
- You said to bring it on.
- I wasn't expecting Bruce Lee.

113
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,218
- So how long is this gonna take?
- Normally? All day.

114
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,756
But I'll try to get you
out in less than an hour.

115
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,325
Yeah, right.

116
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,019
I'll bet you a doughnut I can.

117
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,825
Heh. Man, you sure know
how to get a cop excited.

118
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,765
- Crackles to the apex.
- Forty of Lasix.

119
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,269
It feels like I'm drowning.

120
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,102
Ever have fluid in your
lungs? A heart attack?

121
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,710
High blood pressure
and high cholesterol.

122
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,814
Can someone call my dad?

123
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,850
"Rutley and Son Heating
and Air Conditioning."

124
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,783
- Your dad still works?
- No, he lives with me.

125
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,947
I moved my office home
so I can look after him.

126
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,218
BP's 195/120.

127
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,261
- Okay, nitro drip at 40 mics.
- What meds you on?

128
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,358
Nothing, nothing
for your pressure?

129
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,262
- Cholesterol?
- Ran out.

130
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,801
- How long ago?
- Long time.

131
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,962
Please call my dad.
He's expecting me.

132
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,233
Twelve-lead's here.

133
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,400
What about your doctor?
Who's your doctor?

134
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,307
His name's on my insurance
card. I'll see him tomorrow.

135
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,211
You're in congestive heart failure.
You need to be admitted to the ICU.

136
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,911
I'm fine. It's my dad
I'm worried about.

137
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,156
I was really bummed out
about the way we left things.

138
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,327
Hey, man, I'm glad you
came down to meet me.

139
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,053
You know, if you ever need
anything, I'm here for you.

140
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,925
Actually, I could use a favor.

141
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:49,160
I'm applying for a job and it'd help if
you could write a letter or something.

142
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,806
- All right, what kind of work?
- An EMT with the fire department.

143
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,498
- Really?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,509
Money's good, flexible
hours. Perfect for a student.

145
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:02,137
- An EMT, huh?
- What's wrong with that?

146
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,511
They're not the most
open-minded individuals...

147
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,312
if you know what I mean.

148
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,677
Yeah.

149
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,255
I mean, it's definitely a "don't
ask, don't tell" type of situation.

150
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,519
I mean, if you're gonna fit in,
you gotta just be one of the boys.

151
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,855
I know how to handle it.

152
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,329
And if it works out, who knows?
Maybe I'll think about med school.

153
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,794
- Don't do it, man.
- Really? I see what you do.

154
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,494
It's good work.

155
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,601
Really? So you're thinking
about Emergency Medicine, huh?

156
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,970
Oh, hell, no. Plastic Surgery.

157
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,703
If I'm gonna put in all that
work, I need to make some coin.

158
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,383
No. The swabs were
sent in three weeks ago.

159
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:43,614
Anthony Gates, Sarah
Riley. Yes, I can hold.

160
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,282
- Hey, trauma coming in?
- Crohn's fistula.

161
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,224
- Paternity results never came back.
- How's Sarah holding up?

162
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,728
She's all right. She
doesn't wanna talk about it.

163
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,832
- Must be on her mind.
- She's moving on.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,663
Today, she finds my
checkbook. Pays all my bills.

165
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,668
Oh, really? Maybe
she can become a CPA.

166
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:02,468
When I was 12, I stood in line all
day for the <i>Return of the Jedi</i> premiere.

167
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,406
That's all I want her to do.

168
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,546
- Be a <i>Star Wars</i> nerd?
- No, be a kid.

169
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,410
No. They didn't
come in the mail.

170
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,075
I didn't get them in the mail. Can
you just tell me over the phone?

171
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,654
- Gates.
- Fine, send them again.

172
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,757
- You okay? We'll catch up later?
- Yeah.

173
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,984
- ICU said one hour.
- We're going to the cath lab.

174
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,858
- Is he stable enough?
- Well, we'll stay with him.

175
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,262
If they can open up an artery,
maybe it will reverse his heart failure.

176
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,827
- My dad?
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,698
We called him. He's on his way.

178
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,433
I got 50,000 in mutual
funds at First National.

179
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,667
Okay.

180
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:40,075
- See if his BUN and creatinine are back.
- Got it.

181
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,942
Hey, Gates. GATES: Hmm?

182
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,914
Who do you know at the CFD in
the Paramedic Training Program?

183
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,109
Everyone.

184
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:49,120
- Any of them actually like you?
- I'm popular everywhere I go.

185
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,554
Need to check postreduction
film before he leaves.

186
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,886
- Going to the roach coach.
- She owes me coffee.

187
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,052
What? You owe me a doughnut.

188
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,623
So let's say I had a friend
who wanted to be an EMT.

189
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,634
Oh, very tough. Very
competitive, a lot of applicants.

190
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,738
- It's my brother.
- Your brother?

191
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,373
Family? Why didn't you say so?

192
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,304
- I'll be his hook.
- His what?

193
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,773
In City Fire, you need someone
on the inside to help you move up.

194
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,881
I'll help your brother
out. No worries.

195
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,813
From now on, I'm his rabbi.

196
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,222
- What makes you think I'm buying?
- Least you can do.

197
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,053
- After you destroyed my knee.
- Oh. It's not even broken.

198
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,991
The kneecap just
slipped out of place.

199
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,927
- So where did you learn moves like that?
- In high school.

200
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,396
That's a hell of a PE class.

201
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,661
Yeah. A little Muay
Thai, some Krav. Whoa!

202
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,971
Yeah, I had to learn
to protect myself.

203
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,472
From mean football players
who wanted a date to the prom?

204
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,635
Ha-ha. No. The metal-heads who
wanted a quickie behind the Dairy Queen.

205
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,680
Ha-ha. Damn. You know,
you're full of surprises.

206
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,041
Sam.

207
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,348
Move, move, move.

208
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,930
- How's your guy?
- Good vitals.

209
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,502
- What about the driver?
- Ask Bardelli.

210
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,070
- Neck pain?
- Ahem. Nope.

211
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,604
- Do not move.
- I'm okay. Aah!

212
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,901
God, I put my knee out again.

213
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,099
Easy, fella.

214
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,236
Is he altered?

215
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,415
- Kind of hard to tell.
- Let's get him on a board.

216
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,452
- Hey, Sam, open up a trauma room.
- Got it.

217
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,554
Came out of nowhere.
You think he's drunk?

218
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,189
- Don't know. PRATT:
One, two, three.

219
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,091
Sir, what's your name?
Do you speak English?

220
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:40,089
- Gotta assume he's altered.
- Pupils equal and reactive.

221
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,292
Hey, guys?

222
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,528
Let's start with a trauma
panel and C-spine.

223
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,967
Can you unlock the door?

224
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,608
- I'll tape his head down.
- Just unlock the damn door.

225
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,301
- Whoa. What's the matter?
- Something's moving in there.

226
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,437
- Two more victims.
- Oh, man.

227
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:58,449
Looks like we've got an adult male
and a little boy, both unconscious.

228
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,389
Excuse me. How much longer?

229
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,579
Well, your son's
still up in the cath lab.

230
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:06,720
So it will be a while?

231
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,225
It's hard to say.

232
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,887
- Should I wait right here?
- Let's get a cup of coffee, Mr. Rutley.

233
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,661
- We can try 1.25 of IV enalapril.
- Okay.

234
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,326
Is that you, Danny?

235
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,561
Yeah, I'm Dr. Kovac.

236
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,672
- Hi.
- Wayne Rutley, what is all this?

237
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,643
During the cath, the fluid
in his lungs got worse.

238
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,642
So we had to put a
tube down his throat.

239
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,180
- Are you having any pain?
- Sir, he can't talk with the tube in.

240
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,181
- Are you a relative?
- A home health aide.

241
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,684
- Is this a heart attack?
- It's a cardiomyopathy.

242
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,413
- A what?
- His heart is squeezing very weakly.

243
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,751
He's young. He's
got a good heart.

244
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,952
He's had untreated high
blood pressure for a long time.

245
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,860
Well, he's always working.
He never gets to a doctor.

246
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,705
Has he been short
of breath lately?

247
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,926
I just met him today.

248
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,867
Danny calls an agency when
he goes out to bid on a job.

249
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,438
He thinks I need a babysitter.

250
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,475
His eyesight's not so good
and he has memory problems.

251
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,476
Were they aluminum ducts?

252
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,279
I told you. You need
galvanized sheet metal.

253
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,281
Tight wheezing. He's
barely moving air.

254
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,113
Trauma 1, let's
get Gates on this.

255
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,449
Head lac, good vitals. - Okay.

256
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,821
Little guy's concussed. GCS 14.

257
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,827
Okay, good. Exam
2, both of them.

258
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,059
- Might take longer this time.
- Some of the others look pretty bad.

259
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,829
Hey. Next time we
go out, I'm driving.

260
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,909
Does anybody know
what language this is?

261
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,704
- Sounds like Farsi, maybe?
- Kid needs a line.

262
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,246
- Grab a Buretrol from Trauma.
- Ahem.

263
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,478
Take slow, deep breaths, okay?
Give the medicine a chance to work.

264
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,985
Hey, Bards. Captain
Mahoney still with 43s?

265
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,091
- Had pancakes with him this morning.
- Have him check his e-mail.

266
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,092
- You picking up shifts?
- No, it's about an EMT applicant.

267
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,254
Captain Mahoney's on the EMT
selection committee. Key player.

268
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,093
Hey, Pratt. What am I missing?

269
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,360
Tight asthma. He might
be biting plastic soon.

270
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,697
- Everyone else is stable.
- Dr. Kovac.

271
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,933
V-fib. Paddles are charged.

272
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,166
What happened?

273
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,940
Clear.

274
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,141
Normal sinus.

275
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,679
- Got a pulse.
- Thank God.

276
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,452
- Is your son married?
- He never met the right girl.

277
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,030
- And your wife?
- She passed in '82.

278
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,030
You're doing better, Danny.

279
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,299
Open your eyes.

280
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,534
Ninety over sixty-five.

281
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,906
Up the dopamine.

282
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,044
Hang in there, pal.

283
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,115
Hang in there.

284
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,224
- More cricoid.
- Sats are dropping, pull out.

285
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,883
- Cords are way anterior.
- He's getting harder to bag.

286
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,426
Ah.

287
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,592
- Sam.
- Kid's starting to open his eyes.

288
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,596
Okay, good. Look, I
need an ET view now.

289
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:00,995
All right. Be right there.

290
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,399
- Head CT's clear on flower guy.
- Oh, good news.

291
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,339
- You need a Farsi translator?
- Oh, yeah.

292
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,343
He's got a head injury,
so he might be disoriented.

293
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,516
He doesn't speak Farsi. I
think that's Armenian, sorry.

294
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,487
Any Armenian nurses up there?

295
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,590
Hey, that's him.

296
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,703
- Hey, how do you know this guy?
- He saved us.

297
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,998
And where's my brother?

298
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,972
Oh! Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

299
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,040
- Julio, it's me, Tomás.
- Step back.

300
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,008
- Move it to the right.
- Is that better?

301
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,307
- No.
- He has asthma.

302
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,541
- We figured that part out.
- They're brothers.

303
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,719
- Ahem. So how'd this happen?
- We were going to the drugstore.

304
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,878
He couldn't walk.
Then he couldn't talk.

305
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,389
The guy with the flowers threw us
in the back and drove to the hospital.

306
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,528
So Yakov over there
is the Good Samaritan.

307
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,821
Damn it, bag him up.

308
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,288
- He dropped his spray if you need it.
- Okay.

309
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,331
Come on, there's a
better place to wait.

310
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,664
- I wanna stay with my brother.
- We'll be back in a few minutes.

311
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:14,137
- You wanna try fiber optic?
- Nope, I want Sam.

312
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,367
- Got a guy who's not breathing.
- I can wait.

313
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,272
I'll be there soon.

314
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,076
Got everything.

315
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,840
- Pulse ox, 89.
- Sats are good enough to tube, huh?

316
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,076
No, I want a cushion.
Let's get him up to 95.

317
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,480
All right, we'll wait.

318
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,524
There's a little, tiny camera
at the end of this tube.

319
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,421
- You're all set.
- Slow down, Lily.

320
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,494
He's got a long
expiratory phase.

321
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,688
Hey, I can get a copy of last
year's EMT exam for your brother.

322
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,766
- Good.
- We're up to 92.

323
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,697
Grab an end-tidal
detector, will you?

324
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,770
We'll find out who's
doing the interview.

325
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,101
Find out his hobbies, his favorite
sports teams, stuff like that.

326
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,435
- Okay. GATES: All
right. We're up to 95.

327
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,203
All right, cool.

328
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,310
Is it okay if I do this?

329
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,273
I'll give you one shot.

330
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,281
- All right.
- You need a laryngoscope?

331
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,510
- Yeah.
- No.

332
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,779
Watch the screen and
pass it through the cords.

333
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,617
- All right, I knew that.
- All right, come on, let's go.

334
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,926
All right.

335
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,223
Taste buds.

336
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:12,823
Tonsils.

337
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,797
Epiglottis and
the promised land.

338
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,404
- Straight shot through the cords.
- All right, bingo.

339
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,303
Stopping short of the
carina, and bag him.

340
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,842
- Nice.
- Looks like Kovac could use a hand.

341
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,138
Oh, yeah. Not so good.

342
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,044
All right, thanks for letting me do this.
This was a good thing for me to learn.

343
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,552
V-fib. KOVAC: Take
over compressions?

344
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,846
No problem.

345
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,484
Another amp of epi, charge to 360.
- Good.

346
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,991
Shock him. It worked before.

347
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,651
Clear.

348
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,462
Still in fib.

349
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:50,296
- We're not making much progress here.
- What's that supposed to mean?

350
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,337
His heart is too weak. It's not
responding to our medicine.

351
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,135
- But you're not giving up?
- No, no, we're not giving up.

352
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,438
I just need you to understand
that it's not looking good.

353
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,080
You're saying he could die?

354
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:06,112
- It's a possibility, sir.
- Oh, he's my son.

355
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,820
He's my little boy.

356
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,479
Don't leave me, Danny.

357
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,956
- Call the social worker.
- Don't leave me.

358
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,463
Don't leave me.

359
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,170
- I'm in pain, I've been here for hours.
- Sorry.

360
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,771
You haven't done crap for me.

361
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,966
- Ho-ho-ho. Don't start that again.
- Look where it got me last time.

362
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,771
All the docs are busy. I
need an order for IV sedation.

363
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,143
- Can't you pop it in?
- Without painkillers?

364
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,148
I've been shot
before. I can handle it.

365
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,946
I think a doctor should do it.

366
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,520
Come on, Sam. Don't be a wimp.

367
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,350
Just pop this back
in place so we...

368
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,288
Aah! Aah.

369
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,218
Hey.

370
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,353
Hey, tough guy. Wake up.

371
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,428
Asystole.

372
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,964
Resuming compressions.

373
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,408
Mr. Rutley, it's
been 45 minutes.

374
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:06,512
- Should a cardiologist see him?
- They'd do the same thing.

375
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,073
It's too late.

376
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,845
No.

377
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,021
- No, no. KOVAC: Look,
we're gonna stop now.

378
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,678
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,080
Danny.

380
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,983
Danny.

381
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,184
Oh, my God.

382
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,764
Oh, my God.

383
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,197
What am I gonna do?

384
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,270
Sir, there's a social worker
here that will help you.

385
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,906
How could this happen?

386
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:39,477
How could this happen?
How could this happen?

387
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,280
I'll do the coroner's paperwork.

388
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,420
I'll make sure
he's taken care of.

389
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,604
- Tidal volume, 700. AC of 10.
- Okay.

390
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,438
How's the x-ray look? Good?

391
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,637
Well, he might have
a small pneumo.

392
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,976
- Call Radiology for a wet read.
- Okay.

393
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,517
- How long's he gonna sleep?
- Um, might be a while.

394
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,917
After he wakes up,
we can go home?

395
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,820
You know what? He's gonna
have to be here for a couple days.

396
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,289
Can I stay with him?

397
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,089
- Yeah, but you have to go home at night.
- By myself?

398
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,696
No, we're calling your parents.

399
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,460
No. It's just us.

400
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,467
Ever since Mom died,
Julio's my guardian.

401
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,929
You don't have
any aunts or uncles?

402
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,767
Okay, we'll figure it out. And
you can hang out here for now.

403
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,641
- All right?
- Good.

404
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,045
I'm staying with you, J.
I'm gonna stay right here.

405
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,550
Hey, tough guy. Wake up.

406
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,486
- You need a doctor?
- No, he just vagalled.

407
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,684
- I'll check his vitals.
- Abby, urine's clean on John Doe.

408
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:02,885
Great.

409
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,792
No leuks, no
nitrates. Thank you.

410
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,957
Hey, Timmy? Repeat
knee on Litchman.

411
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,464
Okay, wait. How does a 10-day
cruise turn into two months?

412
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,301
- Heh-heh-heh. Gracie will fill you in.
- Yeah, she's not talking.

413
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,498
Okay.

414
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,839
After we docked in Singapore, I
showed her some of my old haunts.

415
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,743
Climbed the temples of Penang,
cycled the Quang Ninh coast.

416
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,814
Elephant-trekked
through the Ratanakiri.

417
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,008
- Elephants?
- Yeah.

418
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,017
We got hung up at the
Cambodian border...

419
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:31,555
and we'd still be there if Gracie
hadn't tapped into her 401K.

420
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,852
Well, that's too
much information.

421
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,359
Hey, Miranda. How's he doing?

422
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:41,056
One-oh-two? Well, did
you give him a Tyleno...?

423
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,257
Okay.

424
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,528
Well, call me
after his nap. Bye.

425
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,605
No relatives, no
long-term-care insurance.

426
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,868
Guy worked all day, took care
of his dad, but didn't plan for this.

427
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,070
Take-home lesson? Don't assume
that you're gonna outlive your dad.

428
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,045
Abby, Pratt says you need
Social Work for your asthma kid.

429
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,445
Thanks.

430
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,179
Gates, don't get too busy. There's a
guy out in the lobby looking for you.

431
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:10,226
- Hey, I thought we could grab lunch.
- I got five minutes.

432
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,758
How did the interview go?

433
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,365
- Not so great.
- Not so great.

434
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,728
- You didn't get the job, right?
- No.

435
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,236
- What happened?
- Well... What?

436
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:24,070
I don't know anything about
Word. And what the hell's Excel?

437
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,973
So it wasn't a good fit.

438
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,944
Since when do you need a
computer to do a day's work, right?

439
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,606
What about Chuck Mooney's
construction company?

440
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,808
He sold it.

441
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,079
What about, what's his name?
Your friend, Billy Prior's restaurant?

442
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,588
Turned it into a yoga studio.

443
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,624
- Something will come up, hopefully.
- Yeah.

444
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,992
Actually, you could help me out
tonight. I don't want Sarah cooking.

445
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:49,431
Why don't you go to the grocery
store, get some groceries?

446
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:52,299
- And cook dinner tonight.
- No, no, I can't take your money.

447
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,406
You used to love to
cook at the firehouse.

448
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,666
- Yeah.
- You love cooking.

449
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,434
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

450
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,079
I could do a chicken pot pie.

451
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,805
- Maybe a London Broil.
- Yeah, yeah.

452
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:05,076
- The boys always liked my London Broil.
- Surprise me, surprise me.

453
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,417
Patients are in the hall, Abby.

454
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,620
Water pipe burst.

455
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,632
Okay.

456
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,931
Rose Nichols?

457
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,435
That's me.

458
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,835
Ahem. Hello.

459
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,301
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

460
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,105
- Let's see, fever and a cough.
- For almost a week.

461
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,477
- Okay, how are you feeling?
- I'm a little under the weather.

462
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,673
Yeah.

463
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,217
Well, there's a lot of
colds going around.

464
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,686
And sometimes it takes a couple
of weeks, but kids usually get over it.

465
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,186
Eighty-one?

466
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,792
Could mean we're not
getting a proper signal.

467
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,491
Let me see.

468
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,343
- Uh-oh.
- What?

469
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,008
Sounds like pneumonia. And
her oxygen level is really low.

470
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,675
So I think we're gonna
have to admit you.

471
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,516
Everyone said she was fine,
but I knew it was more than a cold.

472
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,023
Okay, he's clear for discharge.

473
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,157
- How are the boys?
- Oh, they're doing well.

474
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,072
- What?
- He's asking you for a date.

475
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:38,943
Oh. Well, repeat the head
CT. I think he's still altered.

476
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,451
I didn't know you were here.
- Yeah, just got here.

477
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,388
- There's lots of trauma today.
- I heard.

478
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,894
Hey, the guys from my old band
are playing this Saturday night at Exit.

479
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,964
I might be on call.

480
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,396
- So we're still waiting?
- It's only been a week.

481
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,197
Okay. I'm gonna go clear
some of these beds, all right?

482
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,237
- Okay.
- See you.

483
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,237
Sarah?

484
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,945
- Have you seen Tony?
- Well, I can look around.

485
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:18,084
- No, I'll wait.
- Okay.

486
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,221
Or maybe you can help me.

487
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,381
Sure.

488
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,221
It's kind of personal.

489
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,893
Okay. Come on.

490
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,464
I need a vaccine.

491
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,965
- Which one?
- HPV.

492
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:39,196
- It prevents cervical cancer.
- Right.

493
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,643
But the school nurse gives it and
you need your parents' permission...

494
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,608
or your grandparents'
permission.

495
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,078
They wouldn't understand.

496
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,943
- Does Tony know about this?
- Not yet.

497
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,944
- Are you gonna tell him?
- No.

498
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,817
It's private.

499
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,517
It's okay. I mean,
you can tell him.

500
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,120
If you want to.

501
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,123
Why didn't you go
to your pediatrician?

502
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,301
He only takes
care of little kids.

503
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,441
Besides, I think I need
a new doctor anyway.

504
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,269
Do you know a good GYN?

505
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,243
So you can't place him?

506
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,639
Best I can hope for is a
crappy nursing home...

507
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,806
that'll accept $100
a day from Medicaid.

508
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,816
Not sick enough for a nursing
home. He needs assisted living.

509
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,648
Medicaid nor Medicare will
cover that, he can't afford it.

510
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:32,724
- The son's assets?
- They'll be tied up in probate for a year.

511
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,827
I've tried three board-and-cares.
They want cash, today.

512
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,987
Greedy bastards. But
we got a bigger problem.

513
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,328
I'm not sure he's competent to
consent to nursing-home placement.

514
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,629
Didn't seem that altered.

515
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,999
His Alzheimer's gets
worse as the day goes on.

516
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,333
Sundowning.

517
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,568
We need someone with durable
power for his health-care decisions.

518
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,008
The son had it. Lot of
good that does us now.

519
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,739
We're scrambling to get an
emergency State Guardian.

520
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,544
Hey, any luck finding a
foster home for Tomás?

521
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,847
Piece of cake compared to this.
- Dr. Pratt?

522
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,853
You called for a wet read?

523
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:08,391
Yes, I did. A possible
pneumo. Excuse me, please.

524
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,663
Haven't seen you in a few weeks.

525
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,392
I was doing an invasive
fellowship in Dallas.

526
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,537
- For six months.
- Really?

527
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:22,197
- Well, I sent you a few e-mails.
- Never got any of them.

528
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:26,869
- You must've changed your address.
- I've had the same address for years.

529
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,708
So you think there's
some pathology here?

530
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,213
Palpitations. Like your
heart's skipping a beat?

531
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,686
- More like it races. Every now and then.
- Ray, can I get you to look at a knee?

532
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,518
- Yeah, excuse me.
- It's happening.

533
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,055
- I'll get the crash cart.
- My chest is gonna explode.

534
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,255
- Got a pulse, a hundred of lido.
- Anything surgical?

535
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,128
Stable V-tach.

536
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,432
- Responding to lidocaine.
- Ahh. That's better.

537
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,097
I guess you won't be needing me.

538
00:27:56,275 --> 00:28:00,406
Milligram a minute.
Titrate up, p.r.n. ectopy.

539
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:01,705
- Hey.
- Hey.

540
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,044
- I left a consult on your asthma guy.
- Thanks.

541
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,152
- Did you know Sarah's here?
- Huh?

542
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,811
- She's asking for the HPV vaccine.
- You're kidding me.

543
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,390
- Does that mean...?
- No, we didn't get that far.

544
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,223
She wants the world to
know how grown up she is.

545
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,422
I wouldn't worry about it. It's
just a phase that girls go through.

546
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,499
- Gates.
- Coming.

547
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:22,930
Good luck.

548
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,799
Thanks for your help. I'll hold.

549
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:31,000
We got a Guardian assigned and
two nursing homes to choose from.

550
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,769
- Great, thank you.
- Thanks.

551
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,107
Think he'll be able
to decide which one?

552
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,010
Well, let's hope so.

553
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,348
Hello, Mr. Rutley.

554
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,653
Hello. When am I leaving?

555
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,262
Well, that's what we're
here to talk to you about.

556
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,023
Well, what's
there to talk about?

557
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,997
We found a couple of places
that can take you tonight.

558
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,831
- Well, what kind of places?
- Convalescent homes.

559
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,870
Oh. I have a home.

560
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,100
Well, you're gonna need help
now, getting around, meals.

561
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,208
I have help. I have meals.

562
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,972
We eat dinner at 7.

563
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,708
Someone ought to call Danny,
tell him I'm gonna be late.

564
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:27,323
Wayne, you know about Danny.

565
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,827
Remember?

566
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,401
Sure. He went out to
bid on a job this morning.

567
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,839
He ought to be home by now.

568
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,351
Wayne, you know, Danny
was in this hospital today.

569
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,855
What, Danny?

570
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,890
No. Danny's not sick.

571
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,221
He had a heart problem.

572
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,896
I...

573
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,959
Nobody told me
anything about that.

574
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,597
His heart stopped beating.

575
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,068
We worked on him
for over an hour.

576
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,273
Where is he?

577
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,604
Uh...

578
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,745
He's better now?

579
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,419
He died, Wayne.

580
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,291
Danny's dead.

581
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,889
No. No.

582
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,890
No, I don't believe
it. It's not possible.

583
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:39,037
Where is he? I wanna
see him, where is he?

584
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:42,402
- He's in the morgue, Mr. Rutley.
- What?

585
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,304
Take me there.

586
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,542
Take me there.

587
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,577
Take me to my son.

588
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,076
Please?

589
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,744
Please, I wanna see
him, I need to see him.

590
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,448
I wanna say goodbye.

591
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:06,364
The CDC recommends starting
the HPV vaccine when you're 11.

592
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,762
All right, we need
to talk about this.

593
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,266
Okay, let's talk.

594
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:14,429
- HPV is a sexually transmitted...
- I'm not having sex, okay?

595
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,608
But when I do, I
wanna be responsible.

596
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,368
Even if I said
yes, your grand...

597
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,843
Okay, do you realize
how stupid this is, though?

598
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,573
I'm old enough to go and
get birth control on my own.

599
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,016
But you won't let me go and get
a vaccine that could save my life.

600
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,213
- Sarah, you're 12 years old.
- Yeah, I know.

601
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,189
- What's the rush?
- I'm not rushing.

602
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,124
But I can't help it if I'm
growing up now, can I?

603
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,696
Need you to fill out transfer
papers for Mr. Rutley.

604
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,060
I'll be there in a second.

605
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,099
Can we continue
this at home? Please?

606
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,534
- So I can't get it now?
- Not today.

607
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:49,171
That's so unfair.

608
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,637
All right. We got you
five days off work.

609
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,112
I have a self-defense seminar
tomorrow. Wanna fill in?

610
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,881
Oh, crap. V-tach again.

611
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,576
- It's the third time.
- I need Ray.

612
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,450
I'm on lidocaine and amiodarone.
Shouldn't I be in the ICU?

613
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,784
Hey.

614
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,759
- Have you been faking this whole time?
- No, I had an itch.

615
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,158
What's going on, Sam?

616
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,925
- What are you doing?
- Is it his heart?

617
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,762
No, it's his finger.

618
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,561
Ah.

619
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,643
- Uh-oh. V-tach again.
- Sam?

620
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:29,577
- It's a shockable rhythm.
- Shockable?

621
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,148
No.

622
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,945
- Clear.
- No. Aah!

623
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,018
- Crazy bitch.
- Yeah, you're the crazy one.

624
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,658
- Sam, have you lost your mind?
- Come on, it was only 10 joules.

625
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:40,952
Really?

626
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,220
Oh! Huh.

627
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,863
Yeah, I guess that's not so bad.

628
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,437
It's called a
negative Mach band.

629
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:56,006
Looks like something's there,
but it's not. It doesn't even exist.

630
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,267
Wow.

631
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,935
It's a retinal phenomenon. The
eye is fooled at a light-dark junction.

632
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,341
Always something new to learn.

633
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,676
I'm glad you're back,
thanks for the help.

634
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,182
Hey, hey, hey.

635
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:10,186
How about we grab some
dinner sometime after work?

636
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,120
Maybe. Call me.

637
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,517
Danny?

638
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:18,494
Pick up the phone, son. If you
can hear me, pick up the phone.

639
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,790
Are you...?

640
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,661
- Is this one yours?
- Yeah, yeah.

641
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,995
I don't like leaving
messages on the machine.

642
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,660
Let's get you back to your room.

643
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,068
I need to call my son.
He doesn't know I'm here.

644
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,400
Please.

645
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,408
Guys.

646
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:36,412
Guys, hey, hey,
hey. Knock it off.

647
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,415
I am sorry. I am upset.

648
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,712
My brother. He totaled my van.

649
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,822
Yes, but aren't you
happy that he's okay?

650
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,925
Without van, my
business is dead.

651
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:50,221
- All because he drives like madman.
- Sir, he saved someone's life.

652
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,727
Yeah.

653
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,495
What are you talking about?

654
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:00,038
He was speeding because he
had a sick patient in the back.

655
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,219
I am sorry. I didn't understand.

656
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,062
- Hey, Pratt?
- Yeah?

657
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,229
- I need you to sign the discharge.
- All right.

658
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,739
- Got any questions, man?
- Yeah, can I go out on crutches?

659
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,106
- Ha.
- Hospital policy. Wheelchair is safer.

660
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,848
- Oh, all right, I'll make an exception.
- All right.

661
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,651
Ah. Hey, Joe.

662
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,326
Hey, how are you
feeling? I miss you. Hello.

663
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,327
His temp's down, but
he didn't want the bottle.

664
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,091
- Oh, my God, look how big he's getting.
- Yeah.

665
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,259
- Hey, you need me to stay?
- No, thanks, have a good night.

666
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,132
Shh, shh.

667
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,939
- Hey, Sam, is Exam 2 open?
- Yeah.

668
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,944
Look, this is where
Mommy works. Look.

669
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,377
- Greg, I need a favor.
- Okay.

670
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,346
You taking me home?

671
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,420
You're going to a nursing home.

672
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,114
Heh. No. Those
places are for old folks.

673
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,285
- That's where you're gonna live.
- No, I told you, I live with my son.

674
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,167
- Mr. Rutley.
- Hmm?

675
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,837
I spoke to your son.

676
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,000
Hmm. Is he picking me up?

677
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,606
He wants you at the new place.

678
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,806
He does? Is he gonna be there?

679
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,715
I'm sure he'll find a way.

680
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:59,889
- So we can have dinner together.
- If that's what you want.

681
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,856
Well, I guess it's okay.

682
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,658
Tell him I won't start
eating till he gets there.

683
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,822
Hey, Luka. I'll
be right with you.

684
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,737
Well, all right, officer.
You are on your own.

685
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,633
Thanks, Sam. You've been great.

686
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,708
Ha-ha. Your day might have
been better if you never met me.

687
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,367
I'm not so sure about that.

688
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,810
- I hope I see you around.
- Yeah.

689
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,581
- You need a pen?
- Uh...

690
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,816
Yeah. Now, see...

691
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:38,888
"Rutley and Son. Since 1959."

692
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,699
Thank you.

693
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,360
When we started, it was just me.

694
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:52,705
Oh. Now, Danny's got
four guys working for him.

695
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,173
He's a good kid. Hmm.

696
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,772
I'm a lucky guy.

697
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,917
Take care, Mr. Rutley.

698
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,424
- You okay?
- Yeah.

699
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,122
Are you still in touch
with your father?

700
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,270
Not since I was 3. You?

701
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,600
He's in Croatia. I haven't
been there in a long time.

702
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:27,502
- Hey, what's for dinner?
- Spaghetti.

703
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,878
There's more in the pot.

704
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,720
- I'll go shopping after dinner, okay?
- Oh, I don't think so.

705
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,322
- We have to eat.
- Come on, Sarah.

706
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,991
- I know what you're doing.
- What?

707
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:43,060
- Cooking, shopping, paying bills, clean...
- Somebody has to.

708
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:46,323
I want you to be a kid. Please,
just enjoy being a kid, okay?

709
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,295
Right, I forgot.

710
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,402
I'm supposed to text my friends
and hang out at the mall, right?

711
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,004
- What's wrong with that?
- I like taking care of the house.

712
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,012
- Just let me do it.
- When you become older...

713
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,018
you'll have plenty of
responsibility. Trust me.

714
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:02,681
Hey, smells pretty good in here.

715
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,008
What is that...?

716
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,414
Where are the groceries, Mike?

717
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,350
Oh, shoot.

718
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,819
I knew I forgot something.

719
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,088
All right. Sarah, go
do your homework.

720
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,627
- I'm not finished yet.
- Now.

721
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,260
- I gave you a hundred dollars.
- I know.

722
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,161
- How much you got left?
- I don't know.

723
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,426
Give me your wallet.

724
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,627
- Tony...
- Give me your wallet.

725
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,205
Six bucks? Six bucks.

726
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:36,110
Well, it was Lou Sanders' birthday
and so I bought a couple rounds.

727
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,855
- No otitis, no pharyngitis, no nothing.
- You sure?

728
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,357
Yeah, I'm sure. This is the
healthiest kid I've seen in a long time.

729
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,155
- Really?
- Really.

730
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,093
Really.

731
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:54,964
Okay.

732
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,728
Well, you know, the babysitter
was in the neighborhood.

733
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,633
And she was worried, so I
thought I'd get a second opinion.

734
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,205
I see.

735
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,034
Thank you.

736
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,042
- There's Daddy. Say hi.
- Hey.

737
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,681
- What's he doing here?
- Um...

738
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,917
It's a warm night, I thought we
could all take a walk to the pier.

739
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,685
Nice. I'm gonna go grab my coat.

740
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:27,427
I guess his urine
tested negative?

741
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,397
Pratt doesn't think
he needs a CBC?

742
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,096
No.

743
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,063
I know you think
I'm acting crazy.

744
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,541
No, I think you're acting like
a mother. A slightly crazy one.

745
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,910
- Did you dispo the Alzheimer's dad?
- Yeah.

746
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:46,183
Poor guy.

747
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,253
- So sad.
- No, he's lucky.

748
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,445
What?

749
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,683
He doesn't have to remember
losing a son every day.

750
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:55,883
Hey.

751
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,669
Hi.

752
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,797
Yeah.

753
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,464
You gonna keep a job if
everything sends you to the bar?

754
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:13,144
- I don't need that kind of job.
- You need something.

755
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,610
I am a firefighter. I rush
into burning buildings.

756
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,908
I axe my way through
roofs that are collapsing.

757
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,415
I save people's lives.
And now some snotty kid...

758
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,646
is trying to tell me how to make
coffee? How to answer his phone?

759
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:27,314
Send me back to the copy room
because I made a smudge on his page?

760
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,393
It's not right.

761
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,893
For 35 years, every time I
thought it was gonna be different...

762
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,729
I could always count
on you to screw up.

763
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,066
- I had a bad day.
- Yeah, yeah, it's always something.

764
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,300
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

765
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,740
You don't know. Well...

766
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,615
You can't live here.

767
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,019
I'm family. I'm your father.

768
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:02,453
That what you think?

769
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:08,364
Oh, screw you, you
little bastard. Screw you.

770
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:11,093
I worked my ass off for
you and for your mother.

771
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:15,468
I admit I may not be the best at
home stuff, but I supported my family.

772
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,270
I paid for your braces, for your books,
and for your mother's fancy clothes...

773
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,710
and I never got a moment's
thanks from either one of you.

774
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,644
Well, you may not like me...

775
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,150
but you owe me, you
ungrateful little prick.

776
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,394
Sarah?

777
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,661
Sarah?

778
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,863
What?

779
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,508
Take those off.

780
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:57,073
So we didn't get a chance
to finish. Do you wanna talk?

781
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,018
Here.

782
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:06,289
- When did this come?
- Two weeks ago.

783
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,030
I was kind of hoping
that you were my dad.

784
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:23,232
But maybe there's still a
way I can live with you?

785
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,610
We'll see.

786
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,080
We'll see what we can do.
