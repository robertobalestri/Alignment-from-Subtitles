1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,971
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,459
- About the other night...
- Stop.

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,071
It's over. I told Meg it's over.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,343
Maybe for you, but any idiot could
see from the look on her face...

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,714
that it's not over for her.

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,309
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,158
So I called the Nursing Director
and I signed on for another month.

8
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,347
Huh. Well...

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,489
Enough meds for ninety
percent of your people.

10
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,354
You can fill this for
a month's supply.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,257
<i>While looking for
cans and bottles...</i>

12
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,865
- I can't believe it's me up there.
- Yeah, well, you better get used to it.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,264
I couldn't have done
it without my producer.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,007
<i>No, and it's too early to tell who
might've been responsible for the attack.</i>

15
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,009
<i>Obviously, we will do...</i>

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,011
Ugh. I can't even look at her.

17
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,843
You don't think
she's a role model?

18
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,679
Not for me, but
she's impressive.

19
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,845
Yeah, if Shaquita needs a role
model, she can turn on <i>Oprah.</i>

20
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,014
What if she wants to
be secretary of state?

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,455
Well, then, she can look
up Madeleine Albright.

22
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,288
Come on, Henry. I'm
gonna get you dressed.

23
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,173
Here we go. Would
you mind getting that?

24
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,529
Sure. WEAVER: That's my boy.

25
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,569
Kerry Weaver's residence.
May I ask who's calling?

26
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,706
It's a news director.

27
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,845
From Miami.

28
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,070
Hello?

29
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:24,843
Are you crazy? What would I do
with two iPods and three Xboxes?

30
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,146
Fine, fine. Have your
fraud department call me.

31
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,345
What happened?

32
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,184
My credit card was
declined this morning.

33
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,417
It's time to dial back
on that escort service.

34
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,585
That's what you get
for being a big spender.

35
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,094
No, since I bought the
Beemer, I'm on a tight budget.

36
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,356
That explains the pants.

37
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,831
Hey, Sam, can you check
a sat on my bronchiolitic?

38
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,526
- No problem.
- Thanks.

39
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,194
Do you need any help?

40
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,830
Uh, actually, I need to move
some stuff to my new place...

41
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,533
and I hear you have a truck.

42
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,346
Yeah, I only help people
move if they promise to feed me.

43
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,004
We can work that out.

44
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,118
Hey, everybody. Over here. Whoa!

45
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,709
This is Sarah.

46
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,115
Hey, Sarah. SARAH: Hi.

47
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,552
- Cool hat.
- I like your necklace.

48
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,057
Thank you. My kid gave it to me.

49
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,717
He's about your age.

50
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,419
Hey.

51
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,724
She's shadowing me today.

52
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,298
You didn't clear that with me.

53
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,596
- I talked to Kovac and Weaver about it.
- But you didn't talk to me.

54
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,904
You must be that guy that's
always riding Uncle Tony.

55
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,201
- You know, like a bull in heat?
- Shh!

56
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,744
So, what else does
Uncle Tony say about me?

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,242
The rest I'm not allowed to say.

58
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,541
Make sure she signs
a confidentiality form.

59
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,381
And if she gets hurt,
she's your responsibility.

60
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,546
Understood, Uncle Tony?

61
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,555
Aye, aye, captain.

62
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,056
Kerry, this is huge.

63
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,390
You know how hard it is to
get your own morning show?

64
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,759
It's not my own show. I'd
just be the health reporter.

65
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,060
And get full-time, with
your own daily segment.

66
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,761
It's flattering,
but I'm a doctor.

67
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,430
Who just got demoted from a
hospital she worked at for over 10 years.

68
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,772
I love medicine. I've never
pictured myself doing anything else.

69
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,106
You'd still be able to do
that on your own show.

70
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,612
Will you stop saying that?

71
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,274
I'm not leaving Chicago,
I'm not leaving my friends...

72
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,682
and I'm not pulling
Henry out of his preschool.

73
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,947
You can find another preschool.

74
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,648
Yvonne Devilliere, 37,
tripped and fell on the sidewalk.

75
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,436
- My leg just gave out.
- Any LOC?

76
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,656
- Negative.
- I don't know what happened.

77
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,924
- I gotta take this.
- Forehead contusion and knee abrasion.

78
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,432
- Need to clear her neck, let's roll.
- This is hers.

79
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,832
- Do you know where you are?
- I know I'm not home.

80
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,439
Kerry, it's Miami.
You've got to consider it.

81
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,973
- When does the station want an answer?
- By tomorrow.

82
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,441
Better start thinking about it.
- I already have.

83
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,943
I'm not doing it.

84
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,947
C-spine X at Trauma 2. Let's go.

85
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,823
Kerry, we're talking "Miami"
Miami. South Beach, Miami.

86
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,293
C-spine's clear.

87
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,990
- Get-naked-at-the-Delano Miami.
- Take her off the board.

88
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,498
Is my sketchbook here?

89
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,829
Yeah, it's in the corner.

90
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,026
Ready?

91
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,503
Can't steal my 15 minutes
and then punt them away.

92
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:00,834
Not now, Morris.

93
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,532
- Are you an artist?
- A painter.

94
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,549
- Open your mouth, please.
- There we go.

95
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:09,046
No intraoral trauma
or dental fractures.

96
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,515
Glucose is 295.

97
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,847
- Do you have diabetes?
- My sugar's always high.

98
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,819
- I'm supposed to watch my diet.
- Are you on any medications?

99
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,720
Clindamycin for my foot.

100
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,225
Chronic infection at the
base of the second toe...

101
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,885
with some
surrounding cellulitis.

102
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,361
Does this hurt?

103
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,365
I've been limping for
a while, but I'm fine.

104
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,935
Okay, let's get a foot
series and culture the wound.

105
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,162
Okay.

106
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,567
Kerry. Kerry.

107
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,763
Listen, listen.

108
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:37,672
You could be the next
Judge Judy, Dr. Phil. No, Ellen.

109
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,177
- Go clear some patients, Morris.
- Well, come...

110
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:44,011
This is the big leagues, Weaver.
The majors, take your swing.

111
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,208
- Looks bad.
- Yeah.

112
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,378
Hurt her ankle during dance
class. Waiting on surgical consult.

113
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,217
- A surgical consult?
- Yeah.

114
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,018
Her fiancÃ© fell on her.

115
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,093
You okay, honey?

116
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,359
Good luck.

117
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,554
- Hey.
- Hey.

118
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,425
- Remember Sarah?
- Hi, Sarah.

119
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,570
- She'll be shadowing me.
- Got your message.

120
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,262
You're gonna have fun.

121
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,464
Where does your belly hurt?
- All over.

122
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,405
That's good bowel sounds.

123
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,307
- FAST exam was negative.
- She doesn't look like a whore.

124
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,975
- Excuse me?
- Sarah.

125
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,742
- She just call me a...
- A whore. She called you a whore.

126
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,579
- Nobody called you a whore.
- Mom did.

127
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,721
- Sarah.
- Well, your mom's mistaken.

128
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,315
- You calling my mom a liar?
- You wanna go home?

129
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:26,818
Let's get a CT scan, shall we?

130
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,063
Hey, did you see my
infected G-tube in 3?

131
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,257
I'm about to go and check on
him. That tosser called me a whore.

132
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,902
- She seems so sweet.
- I've never been called a whore.

133
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,935
Did she say dirty
whore or filthy whore?

134
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,437
- Is there a difference?
- Depends on the whore.

135
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,668
Edgar Dixon, vomited blood,
passed out in the hardware store.

136
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,107
Pressure was 80 palp.

137
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,076
Type and cross
four. Call for O-neg.

138
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,742
Pulse is 105.

139
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,241
- Did you call my wife?
- Sir, be still.

140
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,552
It's Thursday. She's
at the hairdresser.

141
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,087
We called her, she's on her way.
- First bag is in.

142
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,280
HemoCue's 12.4.

143
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,484
Okay, forget the O-neg. Twenty
of IV famotidine, 10 of Reglan.

144
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,653
Another liter of saline, wide
open. Sir, have you had belly pain?

145
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,389
I felt nauseous today.

146
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,659
- Ever had an ulcer?
- No.

147
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,302
- Drink much alcohol?
- Not a drop.

148
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,768
- Belly's benign.
- Who's your doctor?

149
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,600
I don't really have one.

150
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,901
Are you on any medication?

151
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,270
Something from the
drugstore for arthritis.

152
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,609
- Ibuprofen? Naproxen?
- I don't know.

153
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,250
Some arthritis medications
can cause an ulcer.

154
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,676
- Is that serious?
- Keeps bleeding, could be.

155
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,446
- Hey, Sam.
- What's up?

156
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,784
- You have a guest.
- Go ahead.

157
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,494
Says she's family, drove
all the way from Dallas.

158
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,393
Oh, no. Thank you, Haleh.

159
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,098
Grandma?

160
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,304
Don't tell me we're out
of Compazine again.

161
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,967
Pharmacy's coming
to restock. Try Tigan.

162
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,669
Good idea.

163
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,605
Listen, I just heard
about your job offer.

164
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,843
No, don't worry, I'm
not moving to Miami.

165
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,687
- You're not considering it?
- No. I like it here.

166
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:07,658
We may have our occasional gunplay,
but at least we're helping people.

167
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't need to tell you
January is budget month.

168
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,229
They're asking me
to make some cuts.

169
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,997
They want me to
lose an Attending.

170
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,870
Well, maybe we can
send Morris to Miami.

171
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,071
Morris' salary won't do it.

172
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,181
I need to cut at
least 200 grand.

173
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,011
Well, the only people who
make that much are you and...

174
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,846
You're kidding, right?

175
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:42,189
- Kerry, I have to cut costs somewhere.
- You're firing me?

176
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,526
- And since you have this opportunity...
- And this is how you tell me?

177
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,668
There is no good way.

178
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,368
It's unbelievable.

179
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,769
Kerry, you've been
doing this for a long time...

180
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,738
and I know it is
not for me to say...

181
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,879
but lately, it seems
like you've had enough.

182
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,165
- What?
- Most of the time...

183
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,339
you're out doing news.

184
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,745
Yeah, I do those
stories on my days off.

185
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,250
Excuse me, I need some Unasyn.

186
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,751
I'm sorry, my hands are tied.

187
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,890
- I was just trying to...
- To do what?

188
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,389
To do the right thing
or do the easy thing?

189
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,751
Kerry, I'm not happy about this.

190
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:16,953
You know what?

191
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,897
When they were gonna fire
you, I stepped up, I took the fall.

192
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,893
That's the only reason I
ended up back in the ER.

193
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,097
And that's the only
reason that you're still here.

194
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,415
Blood count's holding at 30, which
means you don't have ongoing loss.

195
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:43,079
We were in Atlantic City last
weekend and he started getting ill then.

196
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,122
I knew he should've
gone to the doctor.

197
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,725
Honey, you were right, I know.

198
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,453
Could have an ulcer or
a tear in the esophagus...

199
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,758
We're gonna admit you, have a
specialist look at you to make sure.

200
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,163
Do you wanna come and
fill out some paperwork?

201
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,667
I'll be right back, honey.

202
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,603
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

203
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,834
- This is the first you've heard of it?
- He just told me.

204
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,444
- Oh, I can't believe this.
- Just let it go, Haleh.

205
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,012
Let what go?

206
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,274
Your guy is firing Dr. Weaver.

207
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,950
Mrs. Dixon, I'll meet you
at that desk over there.

208
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,817
- Okay.
- He's what?

209
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,083
Budget cut.

210
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,324
I don't care if you
have a job offer.

211
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,462
You are the best
Attending in this place.

212
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,155
- What do you mean, another job offer?
- In Miami.

213
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,698
- Plain films on Yvonne's foot.
- Kerry.

214
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,496
- Oh, man.
- What's going on?

215
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,196
This is bad. I
gotta deal with this.

216
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,305
I know. I'll talk to him.

217
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,479
I looked at your x-ray...

218
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:49,555
and turns out, you have an infection in
the bones of your second and third toes.

219
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,214
Osteomyelitis, what else is new?

220
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,621
You knew about this?

221
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,318
I cut my foot.

222
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,464
The clindamycin's
supposed to clear it up.

223
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:58,991
Well, it isn't working...

224
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,657
and based on your increased
pain, it's getting worse.

225
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,827
So I give the antibiotics
a few more weeks.

226
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,802
Your diabetes has decreased
the blood supply to your toes...

227
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,669
so the antibiotics
aren't working.

228
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,208
What are you saying?

229
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,545
Surgery's your only
chance for a cure.

230
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,203
Surgery?

231
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,746
Partial amputation.

232
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,547
You want permission
to cut off my foot?

233
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,550
Not your whole
foot, but two toes.

234
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,346
No.

235
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:28,393
Look, if you don't do this, the
infection could spread and you could die.

236
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,688
I'll take my chances.

237
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,025
Mrs. Devilliere.

238
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:38,331
I am walking out
of here on both feet.

239
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:39,870
Hm.

240
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,069
Get out of my way.

241
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,272
They just kicked you out
of the retirement home?

242
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,346
Nobody cares about the elderly.

243
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,881
Did you get in a fight
with your boyfriend?

244
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,044
Which one?

245
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,415
It was a horticultural
infraction.

246
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,682
A what?

247
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,382
They didn't like my garden.

248
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,050
Why?

249
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,453
What were you planting?

250
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,725
The usual.

251
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,959
- Lavender, basil...
- Grandma.

252
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,727
Maybe a little cannabis.

253
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,600
- You were growing weed?
- It's medicinal.

254
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,206
You don't have glaucoma.

255
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,275
Guess why, sweetie.

256
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,604
I can't believe you.
You're 75 years old.

257
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,407
You're lucky they
didn't throw you in jail.

258
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,311
Then I could visit your mother.

259
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,113
She gets out next week.

260
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:31,248
- Identity theft. It's a victimless crime.
- No, it's not.

261
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,589
You're right.

262
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,457
Well, she married
this nice electrician.

263
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,103
Sweet Mexican guy, Pablo.

264
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,436
Well, maybe fifth
time's a charm.

265
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:52,007
Look, Sam, I know we
have drama, but we're family.

266
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,408
So how long are
you staying, Gracie?

267
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,245
Just till you throw me
out, not a bit longer.

268
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,523
Okay, Mr. Richmond, we'll see you
next week for your suture removal.

269
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,597
You're still here.

270
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,294
The bus is slow.

271
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,304
I thought maybe you were
having second thoughts.

272
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,336
I know this is a difficult
decision, but the surgery doesn't...

273
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,472
I'm tired of losing things.

274
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:37,450
I have lost my husband, my
house, the city where I grew up in.

275
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,726
Damn storm took it all.

276
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,158
You're from New Orleans.

277
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,028
You couldn't tell from my
bright smile and stunning glow?

278
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,497
Is that how you got injured?

279
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,970
Everybody begged us to leave...

280
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,738
but we thought it
would pass over...

281
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,542
like Ivan and all the
other ones before that.

282
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,544
When it finally hit...

283
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,488
my husband, Duane, and I went up
to the attic and broke through the roof.

284
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,989
A boat finally got us and
took us to the 610 overpass.

285
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,689
That's when I realized
my foot was cut.

286
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,529
Something in the flood
waters must've hit it.

287
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,030
It's surgery.

288
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,700
It's scary, but you don't
have to die from this.

289
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,073
Too many tough choices.

290
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,377
I'm afraid to make
the wrong decision.

291
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,716
Then let me help you
make the right one.

292
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,885
Will you trust me?

293
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,583
I guess I ain't got a choice.

294
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,795
You never said it was Weaver.
You have to fight for her.

295
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,832
- I did, but I have to make decisions.
- Why didn't you tell me?

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,299
- It's not your concern.
- That is like your mantra.

297
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,904
- What's that mean?
- Never mind.

298
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,006
She's one of the best
doctors on the floor.

299
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,733
I know that, but she's also
one of the most expensive.

300
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,346
Look, this is the job, and I
don't like it any more than you do.

301
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,243
Eighty-four-year-old
with shingles.

302
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,117
Stop it, you freak.

303
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,381
Lenny Rivers, got punched by
a passerby, fell on his tailbone.

304
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,254
- Okay?
- Analgesics, doughnut pillow, discharge.

305
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,659
Whoa, what about x-rays? I
gotta file for a disability claim.

306
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,128
You're not supposed to talk.

307
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,459
Go and order the films.

308
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,601
- Can I get a Percocet?
- Yeah, but you may need to be patient.

309
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,371
GI lab can take him at 4.

310
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,531
Okay, let's send
off a repeat CBC.

311
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,609
Ben, you got the Narcotics keys?

312
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,975
Oh, my bad, I meant to
leave them on the Admit desk.

313
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,611
The pressure's down to 70
systolic. Open up the saline.

314
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,275
Okay, put him in Trendelenberg.

315
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,614
Two units of packed
cells, and get Pratt here.

316
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,156
- He's gonna need a second line.
- Yeah, intubation tray.

317
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,962
- Dawn's from New Orleans too.
- What part?

318
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,894
Seventh ward by
the Florida Canal.

319
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,125
I used to work at
Charity. What about you?

320
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,794
Ninth, over near Jackson
Barracks. But I was born at Charity.

321
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,202
- You need to sign here too.
- You've been back?

322
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,206
I'm not ready.

323
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,237
Are you sure I need this?

324
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,847
Oh, yeah. The infection's deep into
the bone of the second and third toe.

325
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,076
Removing them is the
only way to prevent spread.

326
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,379
How long have you
been a surgeon?

327
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,182
Almost 15 years.

328
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,317
Dr. Dubenko's one of our best.

329
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,060
And how many
surgeries have you done?

330
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,719
Ten thousand.

331
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,831
What about toes? How many toes?

332
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,229
- I've done a lot of toes.
- He's good.

333
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,370
- You working all night?
- I beg your pardon?

334
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,437
- You seem a little tired.
- No, I'm fine.

335
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,700
I slept in my own bed last night.
You have nothing to worry about.

336
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,777
Can we have one of those
mirrors so I can watch my operation?

337
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,345
Oh, no, no. You're
gonna be fast asleep.

338
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,176
Dr. Weaver said I
didn't have to go under.

339
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,874
That's what Dr. Weaver said?

340
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,282
Just give us a sec.

341
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,127
Why would you tell her
she could be awake?

342
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,058
She barely agreed
to the surgery.

343
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,893
- Just give her an epidural.
- Anesthesia is better.

344
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,365
She's afraid of the dark.
She's a Katrina victim.

345
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,130
My heart goes out to her,
but epidural can drop her BP.

346
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,398
But general
anesthesia isn't risk-free.

347
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,872
- It's more efficient.
- Okay, cut the crap, Lucien.

348
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,135
You don't want her awake...

349
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,711
because you don't wanna
answer a bunch of questions.

350
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,214
I'll go up with her, I'll handle
her, she won't get in your way.

351
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,875
Okay.

352
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,044
Second unit is in.

353
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,781
Well, hang a third. Sats
are up to 90, call for a vent.

354
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,949
I already did. Somebody
get his wife here.

355
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,062
- Talk to me, Ray.
- Upper GI bleed, systolic of 60.

356
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,788
Second IV is in,
ready for blood.

357
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,490
- Has he had ulcers?
- We couldn't get a good history.

358
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,762
I know this guy. Was he here last week?
- No, first time to County.

359
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,406
Wait, how long has he been here?
- An hour and a half.

360
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,735
He's just getting a second IV?
- He was stable.

361
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,743
- No GI bleed is stable.
- Hematemesis only once, crit was...

362
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,575
The guy needed therapy. Why
wasn't an Attending involved?

363
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,240
- Abby and I both agreed...
- You're both Residents, Ray.

364
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,441
Get Abby in here now.

365
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,611
Call the blood bank, stay
ahead four units, and get FFP.

366
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,555
- I'll fire up the rapid infuser.
- You should've anticipated this.

367
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,759
- How long will the surgery take?
- About two hours.

368
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,331
Can you sign out marshmallow
girl so she can get out?

369
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,594
- Lucien, I'll be up in a minute.
- I know you will, Kerry.

370
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,795
Now, what's his problem?

371
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,039
Control freak. You okay?

372
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,473
- It's hard seeing folks from back home.
- Did your whole family come up?

373
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,773
- My aunt let eight of us move in.
- Eight? Wow, that must be hard.

374
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,611
Some moved back to make
sure their houses weren't seized.

375
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,116
The rest never wanna go back.

376
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,117
No, there's no
way that that's me.

377
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,485
Well, where did you
ship two iBooks to?

378
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,125
See, I don't even live there.

379
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,557
Is he still trying to work
out his credit problem?

380
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,287
Mine took years.

381
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,159
Come on. Go ahead, Gracie.

382
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,130
It says you're gonna
live a long time.

383
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,166
My family lives
well into their 90s.

384
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,033
Come on, look in there, and
tell me something I don't know.

385
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,471
- It says you're gonna be very wealthy.
- That's what I'm talking about.

386
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:33,204
Hey, Sam, Curtain 3 needs bilateral
leg ultrasounds to rule out DVT.

387
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,645
Okay. Come on, Gracie,
I'll put you in the break room.

388
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,016
Hey, Gracie. Am I
gonna have good luck?

389
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,315
We'll see.

390
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,151
Call me at 8.

391
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,922
I love that woman.

392
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,321
He's not even your
type, Grandma.

393
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,261
Well, you know what they say.

394
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,493
- Once you go black...
- Grandma.

395
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,762
You still living at
the same place?

396
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,737
We were living at this house
where I was working part-time...

397
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,206
but it wasn't really the
best environment for Alex...

398
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,175
so we just moved.

399
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,870
Is he still playing soccer?

400
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,540
Mm-hm. Indoor now. He's
the best left wing on the team.

401
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,345
How are his grades?

402
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,216
A's and B's. He's doing amazing.

403
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,688
Sweetie, that's great.
I'm proud of him.

404
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,152
Of both of you.

405
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,025
Thanks, Grandma.
That means a lot to me.

406
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,388
- How's my Xbox 360?
- What are you talking about?

407
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,625
Your little klepto of
a son is now a felon.

408
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,533
He stole my credit card number and
has been having stuff sent to your house.

409
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,206
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like the Last Comic Standing?

410
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,243
I bet you that necklace
you have on is mine too.

411
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,547
- Amp of epi is in.
- No, he needs volume, not epi.

412
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:44,877
Edgar?

413
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,486
What's wrong with
him? What's going on?

414
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,747
- Six units in so far.
- Getting harder to bag.

415
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,323
I just went to the cafeteria.
They said he was fine.

416
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,323
He's in pulmonary edema.

417
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,827
- What's going on? He was stable.
- Your husband doesn't have a doctor?

418
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,592
Not a regular one.
Is he gonna be okay?

419
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,895
- So, what, no past history, no meds?
- Renuvium, he's on Renuvium.

420
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,266
Mrs. Dixon called home.
Her son read the name.

421
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,067
Where would he
get Renuvium from?

422
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,232
At some church clinic
on the South Side.

423
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,743
- What church?
- First Mission Baptist on Calumet.

424
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,575
What, they got a doctor there?

425
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,081
Oh, I don't know.
I wasn't with him.

426
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,809
Oh, God.

427
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,188
Units 11 and 12 are running.
- And three of FFP.

428
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,157
- Run the platelets here.
- Try more volume?

429
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,454
- Maybe GI can scope him.
- Not without a pulse.

430
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,457
- What's our rhythm?
- Asystole.

431
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,031
Edgar, honey, please.
Please, be okay.

432
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,295
- Another four units, push another epi.
- He had five rounds of meds.

433
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,302
- Try an intra-aortic balloon?
- Too late.

434
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,465
Let's check a HemoCue,
PT/PTT, see where we are.

435
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,132
Pratt. Pratt, it's time to stop.

436
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,745
- No.
- No, don't you stop.

437
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,142
This is a reversible condition.
- Not anymore.

438
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,982
Forty-two minutes. We're
not gonna get him back.

439
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,179
You know she's right, okay?

440
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,755
Nobody's called it yet.

441
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,152
Please.

442
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,384
Please, keep going.

443
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,084
Please.

444
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,995
Time of death, 16:48.

445
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,402
No.

446
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,674
Oh, darling.

447
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,782
- I won't feel anything?
- Not with the spinal anesthetic.

448
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,790
Especially since
it's me who placed it.

449
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,257
Do you want a pulsed lavage?

450
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,193
Three liters, polymyxin
all in one bag, please.

451
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,563
I was in New Orleans once. I
became addicted to beignets.

452
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,204
Cafe Du Monde's
my favorite spot.

453
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,203
Where are you from? - London.

454
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,865
Really? I spent a
year in college there.

455
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,035
- Power setup?
- Micro E set with sagittal saw.

456
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,443
Grabbing to get rid
of the diseased bone.

457
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,243
Still plan to scrub in on
the robotic prostatectomy?

458
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,909
I certainly am, as
soon as we finish here.

459
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,485
You should check out
this new machine, Kerry.

460
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,715
Unbelievable.

461
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,485
Ensures perfect
nerve-sparing technology.

462
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,994
All for the low, low
price of 1.5 million.

463
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,791
The budget committee
approved that?

464
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,957
Yeah, they finally cut
us a break this year.

465
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,261
Culture tubes?

466
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,960
Aerobic and anaerobic, please.

467
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,332
Zosyn infusing.

468
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,166
Bovie?

469
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:22,631
Good.

470
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,676
Now, isolate the
neurovascular bundle.

471
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,808
What does that mean?

472
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,846
They're protecting
the nerves and arteries.

473
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,677
BP, 80 systolic.

474
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,787
- What's happening?
- One liter saline bolus...

475
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,788
- and get her head down. WEAVER:
Is this a reaction to the spinal?

476
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,197
Don't think so. BP
dropped after the antibiotic.

477
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,591
- Anaphylaxis?
- Could be an allergy to penicillin.

478
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,196
Sats are dropping, 88 percent.

479
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,363
What do we do?

480
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,968
I must've seen three or
400 patients at that church.

481
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,503
Didn't even remember the guy.

482
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,811
This is our fault.

483
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:06,885
Couldn't this have happened if he got
the drug through a regular prescription?

484
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,155
I don't know.

485
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,493
I have to go talk to her.

486
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,300
You're gonna tell her that
we're the ones from the church?

487
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,668
I'm not gonna bring you into it.

488
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,544
But I'll let her know I was
the one running the clinic.

489
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:45,346
Yvonne, we're gonna sedate you
and place a tube to help you breathe.

490
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,685
No, I'm not going under.

491
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,403
Etomidate's going in. - Honey.

492
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,555
You're not getting
enough oxygen.

493
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,494
When they left me on that
bridge, I woke up in the darkness.

494
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,759
Listen, Yvonne.

495
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,201
Sats only 81.

496
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,400
- What are you doing?
- Getting IV epinephrine.

497
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,842
- She's anaphylaxing. NEELA:
I can hear the wheezing here.

498
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,172
Ari can manage an airway.

499
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,180
No, her hypoxia's
worsening. She needs this.

500
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,373
Hard to bag.

501
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,590
We only ever give
IV epi for a full arrest.

502
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,606
Then you're about to
learn something new.

503
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,190
- Are you kidding me?
- Dr. Weaver, stop.

504
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,588
Pushing 2 cc's one to 10,000.

505
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,024
This should buy time to
do controlled intubation.

506
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,027
With all due respect,
this is my O.R.

507
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,962
I don't care. I lost my
job to pay for your robot.

508
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,692
I care about this patient.

509
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,803
Easier to bag. Heart
rate's coming down.

510
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,606
- Sats are up to 95. Go for it, Ari.
- Looks like the epi worked.

511
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,936
You just got very
lucky, Dr. Weaver.

512
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,602
None of this looks
like healthy tissue.

513
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,044
You're absolutely
right. It's into the tarsal.

514
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,979
So, what are we gonna do?

515
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,210
- She needs a BKA.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

516
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,252
You're not gonna
amputate below the knee.

517
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,947
Lucien, I promised her that
she wouldn't lose the foot.

518
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,615
The MRI was fine.

519
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,387
MRI was three weeks old.
- And it's progressed.

520
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,224
Prep for BKA. Let's
move the drapes.

521
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,231
No, can't you just take the
toes and give her six weeks...?

522
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,461
She's diabetic with vascular
disease, Kerry. She'd never heal.

523
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,502
Get me the Zimmer saw.

524
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,131
I love Italian food.

525
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,243
When I was in Venice,
they had this joint...

526
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,174
had the best fettuccini
you ever tasted.

527
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,611
Well, there's no
gnocchi like my gnocchi.

528
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,081
So maybe we can go to
the movies this Saturday.

529
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,585
There's a cool space movie, but it's
supposed to be good for adults too.

530
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,418
- See if I'm working.
- You're not. Just made the schedule.

531
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,355
Cool. Then it's a date.

532
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,261
Grandma?

533
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,698
Hi, Alex. Look at you.

534
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,463
So grown up. MORRIS: Hey.

535
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,506
Hey. Come here,
you little Artful Dodger.

536
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,166
- Alex, what the hell is going on?
- What?

537
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,870
- Did you steal from Dr. Morris?
- No. Why?

538
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,811
Where'd you get your Xbox from?

539
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:53,111
Well, um, Mr. Elliot
bought it for me.

540
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,719
Did he buy me this necklace too?

541
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,549
No, I bought you that necklace.

542
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,651
- Alex, you come here.
- What?

543
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,796
Now, don't give me
any attitude, Mr. Man.

544
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,295
If this was 20 years ago...

545
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:10,027
I could knock you back to China
and not have Social Services on me.

546
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,899
So I'm gonna ask you
one time and one time only.

547
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,801
Did you steal Dr. Morris'
credit card? Yes or no?

548
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,304
Gracie, just...

549
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,405
I, um... No, don't stammer.

550
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,813
Don't stutter and
look me in the eye.

551
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,290
Did you or did you not
steal his credit card?

552
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,816
I'm sorry, okay?

553
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,552
No, don't you say sorry to me.

554
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,890
You say sorry to Dr. Morris.

555
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,157
You know better.

556
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,892
I'm sorry, Dr. Morris, for
stealing your credit card.

557
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,098
Well, all right.

558
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,733
We'll figure it out.

559
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,772
You can start paying
me back in installments.

560
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,504
- Fine.
- Alex, why would you do that?

561
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:59,842
- Hey.
- No, you work, and I'll get him.

562
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:05,283
Hey, Nelson Wilcox, 39, vomiting and
abdominal pain, hypotensive after a liter.

563
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,925
Sam. We need you.

564
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,890
Morris, I don't even
know what to say.

565
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,238
What about my necklace?

566
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,697
- Vitals?
- 92/58, pulse is 97.

567
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,061
- I'm Dr. Kovac, where does it hurt?
- My stomach.

568
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,466
We were getting fitted for snowboard
boots. He started feeling queasy.

569
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,697
Get him on a monitor
and start a second line.

570
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,569
He's got pancreatitis
from gallstones.

571
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,573
He's supposed to have
surgery next month.

572
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,379
CBC, Chem-7, LFTs,
lipase and calcium.

573
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,779
He's been feeling good, so we
planned this trip to the Rockies.

574
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,974
Call my dad.

575
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,122
He turns 40 in February.
We got 15 people coming.

576
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,484
Don't forget a D-stick.
Check for hyperglycemia.

577
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,650
- But he's gonna be all right, isn't he?
- Systolic's down to 78.

578
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,556
All right, another
liter, wide open.

579
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:44,753
Hold on, lungs are wet.

580
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,957
- He's in failure or third spacing.
- Either way, he's hypotensive.

581
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,466
He needs volume. You
wanna try albumin, 25 percent?

582
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,571
- That won't work. ABBY:
I've seen Weaver do it.

583
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:55,640
- IV's blown and veins are crap.
- Sterile sixes and cordis to me.

584
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,173
Gonna throw in a subclavian.

585
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,470
He ate this huge plate
of waffles yesterday.

586
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:02,114
- I mean, I told him not to do it.
- Abdomen's tense.

587
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,147
I'll get the ultrasound
and call Surgery.

588
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,841
We don't know what
we're dealing with.

589
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,316
I think we have an idea.

590
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,748
If it's acute pancreatitis...

591
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,322
first-line management is
supportive care, not surgery.

592
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,753
They need to be involved.

593
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,929
- Got a flash.
- Sat's dropping, 82.

594
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,896
Mr. Wilcox?

595
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,637
Mr. Wilcox?

596
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,601
You told her you
were the doctor?

597
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:34,269
And that I prescribed
the Renuvium.

598
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,472
And she's okay with that?

599
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,549
Well, she understands
it was a mistake...

600
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,549
and she's trying to
digest what's happened.

601
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,212
- You've gotta talk to Pastor Watkins.
- Oh, yeah. We're shutting it down.

602
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,447
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

603
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,719
I can't leave my post. You have
to page Dr. Gates from the desk.

604
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,328
- Come on, there's 50 people there.
- I don't care...

605
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,828
It's okay. She's with me.

606
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,991
- What's he protecting, Fort Knox?
- I didn't know you were coming.

607
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:59,229
I was in the neighborhood.
Wanted to see how she was doing.

608
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,634
- You having fun, huh?
- Yeah, it's been great.

609
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,141
We treated this mime guy
and a lady who broke her ankle.

610
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,972
Cool, babe.

611
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,805
- So this is where you work, huh?
- Yeah, this is it.

612
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,308
You wanna see the
trauma rooms back there?

613
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,817
- Yeah.
- Come.

614
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,580
- Is your girlfriend there?
- Meg.

615
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,192
- Or is she out buying Ikea furniture?
- We're not gonna do this right now.

616
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,157
Oh, no. Now is the perfect time.

617
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,927
Let me show you the
break room so Tony...

618
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,496
No, Sarah.

619
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,691
- Tony has to clear a few things up.
- You're drunk.

620
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:33,430
You were gonna walk out
and move in with that little bitch?

621
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,937
- Meg.
- You're a liar.

622
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,076
Sarah, he's done
nothing but lie to us.

623
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,006
All he ever does is lie.
- Mom, don't.

624
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,840
Oh, speak of the bitch.

625
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,380
- Don't walk away from me!
- Meg.

626
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,177
- No, you need to hear this.
- No, I don't think I do.

627
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,410
Mom, stop it.

628
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,054
- I did everything for him.
- Meg.

629
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,553
- I straightened him out.
- Meg.

630
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,282
When he was a mess, when
he was just a useless vet.

631
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:57,520
I used my husband's insurance
money to put him through medical school.

632
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,628
You don't get to have
him, do you hear me?

633
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,769
- You don't get to take him from us.
- Meg!

634
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,543
- Where's Kovac?
- Trauma 2.

635
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,484
- Increase the peep.
- I can't, I'll give him a pneumo.

636
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,710
PVCs. Hundred of lido.

637
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,378
He's okay, isn't he?
I mean, he's okay.

638
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,048
His oxygen is low, and it's causing
his heart to beat in an abnormal rhythm.

639
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,454
Pulse ox, 78.

640
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:29,720
He's not dying, is he?

641
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,626
Luka, Surgery orders
some million-dollar toy...

642
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,358
- and I'm expensive? We need to talk.
- Not right now.

643
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,560
- V-tach.
- No pulse, starting compressions.

644
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,738
- Charging to 200.
- What do you got?

645
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:42,739
Acute pancreatitis,
hypotensive despite 6 liters.

646
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,171
What's happening?

647
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,868
- What's happening?
- Okay, clear.

648
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,569
Get back, get back.

649
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,714
Will somebody talk to me?

650
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,407
He's in cardiac arrest,
so you have to stand back.

651
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,418
- Is he bleeding from somewhere?
- His crit's stable.

652
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,250
- Has Surgery been here?
- They wanna observe in the ICU.

653
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,423
Get them back in,
18-gauge spinal needle...

654
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,050
connector tubing
and a manometer.

655
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,594
- We don't have time for that.
- What are you doing?

656
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,765
Checking for abdominal
compartment syndrome.

657
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,924
He's got arrhythmia.
Focus on the heart.

658
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,936
His BP sucks because the abdominal
pressure's crushing the vena cava.

659
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:16,234
Can't ventilate, because his
belly's compressing his lungs.

660
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,502
Okay, hold compressions.

661
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,121
Forty-two centimeters.

662
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,322
More than enough to
cause end-organ damage.

663
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,027
Okay, resume
compressions. Ten blade.

664
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,757
- Ma'am, what's your name?
- Marnie.

665
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,426
Your husband's pancreatitis is causing
swelling of all the abdominal organs.

666
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,436
- Another 50 of lido.
- Pushing it.

667
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:51,600
He doesn't need cardiac meds,
he needs to be decompressed.

668
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,473
Luka, you know I'm right.

669
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,309
Uh!

670
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,952
Pickup, sew set.

671
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,490
Retract the superficial layers.

672
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,553
- I'm doing CPR.
- He won't need it after this.

673
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,170
Back in sinus with a pulse.

674
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,509
Saline and sterile towels.

675
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,274
I still got a few
tricks up my sleeve.

676
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,647
I can't lose you, T.

677
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,656
This ain't just
the booze, is it?

678
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,263
You can't walk out on
us. We're your family.

679
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,454
Family?

680
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,157
What you did there, you
call that family? I work here.

681
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,270
You've been avoiding me.
What did you want me to do?

682
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,803
Move on.

683
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,837
You don't love me anymore.

684
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,910
Not the way you want me to.

685
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,681
- I'll change.
- You can't.

686
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,013
It's not about that.
You can't change.

687
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,353
You'd rather be
with that little bitch?

688
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:14,391
Back off. She has
nothing to do with this.

689
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,187
She has everything
to do with this.

690
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,987
All right.

691
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,796
I'll tell you one
last time, Meg.

692
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,525
I'm sorry, but it is over.

693
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,135
You don't care about Sarah?

694
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,402
Of course I do.

695
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:34,307
Well, I mean, do you not
wanna see her anymore?

696
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,581
I never said that, Meg.

697
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,452
Because...

698
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,589
that's what's gonna
happen if you do this.

699
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,855
You would hurt her
just to get back at me?

700
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,165
You're a damn liar.

701
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,831
You prick. Damn you.

702
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,833
- Prick!
- Knock it off.

703
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,430
Listen... You listen to me, Meg.

704
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,767
There's nothing you can do
to keep me away from Sarah.

705
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,272
Do you understand that?

706
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,741
Do you understand that?

707
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,010
Hey, it's cold out here.

708
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,212
You should come back in.

709
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,053
I hate her.

710
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,887
You don't mean that.

711
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,931
She's crazy. That's
why Tony's leaving.

712
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,726
No, he loves you.

713
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,495
You know that won't ever change.

714
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,533
Can I ask you a favor?

715
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,141
Sure.

716
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,444
Find somebody else.

717
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,112
- Sorry?
- He doesn't love you.

718
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,910
He's just having sex with you.

719
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,519
- Sarah...
- That's what he does.

720
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,013
But he always comes back to us.

721
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,916
When we opened you, we
learned that the infection had spread.

722
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,680
We had to do the amputation.

723
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,191
I should've never trusted you.

724
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:33,998
With the new prosthetic leg,
you'll have complete mobility.

725
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,772
Every time I make
a choice, it's wrong.

726
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,465
This was the right thing to do.

727
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,439
My husband and I
were on that bridge...

728
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:53,214
for 27 hours...

729
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:57,152
before a helicopter came
and took us to the Superdome.

730
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:04,390
And when the buses came,
there was only one seat.

731
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,725
I didn't wanna
go, but he insisted.

732
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,332
And I took that seat.

733
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,004
I left him there.

734
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:24,307
It was about a week later when I
found out he died in that stadium.

735
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:28,150
It's not your fault.

736
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,887
I know.

737
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,485
It's God's.

738
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:39,831
Why did he do
this, take it all away?

739
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:42,433
He didn't take it
all, you're still alive.

740
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,531
You're getting another chance.

741
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,232
For what? What
am I gonna do now?

742
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,436
You're gonna...

743
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:55,770
You're gonna accept this,
and you're gonna go on.

744
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,144
Go home, paint.

745
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:05,146
Find a way to use this gift to make
sure people never forget what happened.

746
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,928
They can't forget.

747
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,932
You won't let them.

748
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:20,733
All right, Dr. Pratt, arsenic
overdose has an ICU bed.

749
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,238
All right, call Hematology.
He'll need chelation.

750
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,967
Just the man I wanna see.

751
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,645
Did you work on a
Edgar Dixon today?

752
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,804
Yeah. Why? What's up?

753
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,474
- He was getting Renuvium illegally.
- Yeah, so I heard.

754
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,154
Apparently, First Mission
Baptist is dispensing meds...

755
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,256
without a pharmacy license.

756
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,951
- I'll need his medical records.
- Yeah, but the family's not gonna sue.

757
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:45,325
It's for the State Medical Board.
There's gonna be an investigation.

758
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,467
- Angela, how's it going?
- Okay, just following up a record of...

759
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,795
I meant you, your
daughter. How's Danielle?

760
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,302
Oh, she's better. Thanks, Luka.

761
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,435
For everything.

762
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,242
Hey, Dr. Kovac. Can I
talk to you for a minute?

763
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,673
Yeah.

764
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,438
In private?

765
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,814
- This is nice, Sammy.
- Thanks.

766
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,085
You remember when
we lived in that trailer?

767
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,660
You guys lived in a trailer?

768
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,764
- It was a mobile home.
- That's uppity for "trailer."

769
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,230
- Go unlock the door.
- Sure.

770
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,927
Where you from, Ben?

771
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,163
I'm from Georgia. Town
called Richmond Hill.

772
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,000
I had a boyfriend
once in Chatham.

773
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,541
He dumped me. I
swear it was for his sister.

774
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:34,713
My grandma has lots of stories
about her antics with men.

775
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,178
Oh, I'm not scaring you, am I?

776
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:41,046
You are one of the sanest guys
that Sam has ever been with.

777
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,053
We're just friends, Gracie.

778
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,850
Yeah, that's what
Angelina and Brad said.

779
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,192
Hey.

780
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,726
Do your homework, brush
your teeth and go to bed.

781
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,695
Tomorrow, we talk
about the new rules.

782
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,994
Go. ALEX: All right.

783
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,772
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

784
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,735
You owe me dinner, right?

785
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,673
I'm so sorry, I forgot.

786
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:11,807
Okay, we finish unloading, and
then I will order us pizza, or we could...

787
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,282
I've got a better idea.

788
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,235
I'm glad we got past
the awkward part.

789
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,500
Yeah.

790
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,173
You need a pharmacy
license to dispense meds.

791
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,544
Your insurance covers
you only in the hospital.

792
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,710
I know. I was
trying to give back.

793
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,880
It's a felony,
Pratt. A man died.

794
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,422
- The hell was I thinking?
- I don't know.

795
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,528
This goes against
everything you've learned.

796
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,864
You okay, man?

797
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,609
I don't know what to do.

798
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,341
Were you the only one involved?

799
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,819
Yeah, yeah. It was just me.

800
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,716
Good. That's good.

801
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,653
I'll talk to Angela,
see what I can do.

802
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,727
Take a minute, okay?

803
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,675
All right. See you guys later.

804
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,004
Dr. Weaver, I need an
Attending order for Vanco.

805
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,170
Yeah, can you sign off
on my retinal detachment?

806
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,373
- Mm-hm.
- Okay. Thank you.

807
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,344
Kerry. Kerry, we need to talk.

808
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,854
- Oh, it's okay. I'm fine.
- No. Hey, I made a mistake.

809
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,254
What I said before... You
know how it is in this job.

810
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:02,985
I shouldn't give
in to the pressure.

811
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,959
I'm gonna find budget
cuts somewhere else.

812
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,620
There's no way we're losing you.

813
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,529
Thanks, but I resign.

814
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:13,596
- You what?
- I can't, I mean...

815
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:19,938
I've trained Residents, I've
saved lives, I even ran this place.

816
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,977
I loved it.

817
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:26,709
And I've probably gotten more
than I've given, but now it's time to go.

818
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,347
- Dr. Weaver, what are you saying?
- Kerry.

819
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,788
It's easy here.

820
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:37,292
It's comfortable, but that doesn't
mean it's the right thing to stay, sweetie.

821
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,896
Are you gonna go to Florida?

822
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:43,694
Yeah, I mean,
after Sandy died, I...

823
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,430
I thought I got over it. I
thought I moved on, but I...

824
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,641
I felt stuck, like
I'm treading water.

825
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,538
And it's taken a few years...

826
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,341
but now, I'm finally
ready to move forward.

827
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,983
So...

828
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:04,086
if you're ever in Miami, turn on
Channel 6, that's where you'll find me.

829
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:09,218
And if I'm not there, I'll be
on the beach with my son.

830
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,321
Kerry, wait.

831
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,227
Kerry. Kerry.

832
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,992
Please. Hey.

833
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,862
Luka, we're all right.

834
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,899
We're fine.
