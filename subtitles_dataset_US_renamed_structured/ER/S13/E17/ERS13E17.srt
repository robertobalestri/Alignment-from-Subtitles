1
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,137
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,868
Alex, what happened?

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,478
No, you can't break and
steal things. You know that.

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,309
Are you sending me to live
with Grandma and Grandpa?

5
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,916
It's not who I am anymore.

6
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,950
No, it's okay. It's no big deal.

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,417
I won't be a part of this.

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,113
Have Crenshaw get me a
surgeon who wants to operate.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,589
Leaving so soon?

10
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,853
Did your drunk ass hit that kid?

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,827
Look, you talk about raising
K.J. to be honest, right?

12
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,331
My dad's going away, isn't he?

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,264
A secret engagement
would be fun.

14
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,411
When was the last time
you actually went to Mass?

15
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,813
Look, that doesn't
matter. It's a tradition.

16
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,818
- Not mine.
- Well, churches are beautiful.

17
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,512
And a little bit creepy.

18
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,920
I don't hear you
making any suggestions.

19
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,822
Well, the only thing
I know for sure...

20
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,155
is that I don't want it...

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,362
to even remotely
resemble my first wedding.

22
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,899
Okay. Where was
your first wedding?

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,765
In his parents' backyard. You?

24
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,566
A church.

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,334
Uh, did you wear
tulle or taffeta?

26
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,071
What do you know about tulle or
taffeta? Are you going soft on me?

27
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,010
I read about them
online. Look, wait.

28
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,514
Tell you what, why don't
you plan the wedding...

29
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,848
and I'll plan the really important
stuff, like the honeymoon?

30
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,955
- Okay.
- Okay?

31
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,849
She needs dÃ©bridement
and IV antibiotics.

32
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,927
Admit to Surgery.
We'll do it in the O.R.

33
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,122
Ma'am, we're going to admit you
so we can fix these bedsores, okay?

34
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,563
May I present the esteemed
Dr. Neela Rasgotra?

35
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,704
Say hi to Mae Lee Park. She's
our new surgical med student.

36
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,896
- Nice to meet you.
- Heard a lot about you.

37
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,905
- Great. All good, I hope.
- More or less.

38
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,409
We left out the part about you
being our unwanted ER stepchild.

39
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,046
- I'm Ray Barnett.
- Pleasure.

40
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,739
Mae Lee published a paper
with Dr. Zimmer up at UCSF.

41
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,908
I jumped at the
opportunity to snap her up.

42
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,377
Anyhow, that pretty much
concludes our official tour.

43
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,524
I so appreciate
your taking the time.

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,852
Oh, it's my pleasure.

45
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,961
We should probably
get out of here.

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,960
I need to sign off
on my obstructed CF.

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,361
I've never seen a
transduodenal choledochostomy.

48
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,127
Yeah, me neither. Sounds cool.

49
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,702
I didn't know we were
getting a new sub-I.

50
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,363
Really? I'm shocked
you weren't notified.

51
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,033
Bring that up at your next plebe
rally. Add it to your list of demands.

52
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,705
- Where do you work?
- Connie's Cakes.

53
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,875
Place is like <i>Temptation Island.</i>
Cakes as far as the eye can see.

54
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,920
- My hips could not cope with that.
- You're telling me, sister.

55
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,751
What's the deal with wedding
cakes? They're so expensive.

56
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,950
I saw one that cost $2000.

57
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,756
Can you put a price on the
most special day of your life?

58
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,724
Well, what if it sucks?

59
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,566
That's what the tasting's for.

60
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,224
Okay. Hope, what's your plan?

61
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,964
Observe for a couple hours.

62
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,402
If no rebound, Benadryl
and a course of pred.

63
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,701
Great. Let's write a scrip for a
couple of extra EpiPens just in case.

64
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,276
Twenty-three, we'll be ready.

65
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,606
- Did you sign off on my food allergy?
- Yup.

66
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,975
I need one on my bumsicle.

67
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,310
We got choppers coming
in. Two minutes out.

68
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,579
Family crashed in the blizzard. They
were trapped in their car for two days.

69
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,291
Devin Paxon, 40, hip fixed
in flexion, probably dislocated.

70
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,156
Pulse, 86. BP,
90/60. Sats, good.

71
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,493
EKG, x-rays of pelvis, right
hip, femur, C-spine and chest.

72
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,760
Charlotte, baby? We're okay.

73
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:22,994
You just be brave.

74
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,450
Come on, talk to me, baby.

75
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,838
Charlotte, 10. Scalp lac,
dehydrated and hypothermic, but alert.

76
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,135
BP, 85 systolic.

77
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,438
Charlotte, we're gonna get you
warmed up and feeling better, okay?

78
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,979
Bair Hugger, heated saline
and warm, humidified O2.

79
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,878
Hey, Dad's definitely
more critical.

80
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,643
Julius Paxon, 45.

81
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,620
Hypothermic. Bradycardic,
in the 40s. BP, in the 70s.

82
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,280
No sign of major trauma.

83
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:49,829
All right. EKG, monitor, chem panel,
CK, CBC, Foley and a portable chest.

84
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,726
How you doing,
Lockhart? You miss me?

85
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,730
No. Can't say that I did.

86
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,137
I marked your initials on
the back of all the tags.

87
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,068
I can keep track
of my own clothes.

88
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,141
Not you. I don't
know those other kids.

89
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,468
This is really gonna suck.

90
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,977
If you keep
saying that, it will.

91
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:11,642
Come on. They got a good
soccer team, indoor pool. Huh?

92
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,486
Hey.

93
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:21,318
It's only a couple hours away.
I'm gonna visit every weekend.

94
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,527
Yeah, like that should help.

95
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,041
- Got more saline.
- Good. He's lost his shivering response.

96
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,275
Pupils are sluggish but reactive.
They were out there for two days?

97
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,785
Trapped in the car after they veered
off the road, skidded into a ditch.

98
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,618
The road, it's supposed to be closed
for the winter. Shawnee National Forest.

99
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,453
Shawnee? That's far.

100
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,062
- You were the closest open to trauma.
- How we doing?

101
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,221
I was driving when
the blizzard hit.

102
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,562
We were lost. I couldn't see.

103
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,637
Hip looks dislocated. Other than
that, cold and a few abrasions.

104
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,558
Pulse, 90. BP, 95/60. DEVIN:
Please, you have to find Spencer.

105
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,906
- Sats are good.
- Okay, four more of morphine.

106
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,868
Hope, talk to me.

107
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,708
She's just a little dehydrated,
BP holding at 85 systolic.

108
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,816
It doesn't look too bad.
How do we proceed?

109
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,975
CBC, C-spine, chest
x-ray and a rectal temp.

110
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,245
Good. Make that happen.

111
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,150
Hey, your name
is Charlotte, right?

112
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,586
I know it seems scary,
but we're gonna fix you up.

113
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,090
Your mom and your dad too.

114
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,591
What about Spencer?

115
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,194
- Who's Spencer?
- Her 14-year-old brother.

116
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,889
- He's still out there.
- What, is he on another chopper?

117
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,898
No. He went to look
for help last night.

118
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,129
That's how we found them.
Kid set fires close to the location.

119
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,898
We followed the smoke to
the family. No sign of the boy.

120
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,407
Please, you have to
go and get Spencer.

121
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,711
Sats are dropping, only 83.

122
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,314
Okay, please tell Mr. Morales...

123
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:53,715
that there are things that he can
buy that won't get, uh, stuck up there.

124
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,288
You know, with a wide
base or a string attached.

125
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,255
My Spanish definitely
ain't that good.

126
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,263
No. Okay, just get
me a translator, please.

127
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,802
Hey, Morris. Do you
still use that travel agent?

128
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,410
Angie? Yeah, she's the best.
You gonna go somewhere?

129
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,240
- Need to get away from the cold.
- I'll get you her number.

130
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,848
Sam, my ankle guy is
waiting for his posterior splint.

131
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,348
Do I look like a magician?

132
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,577
When it's done, you'll
be the first to know.

133
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,746
Tread lightly, my friend. She's
been barking since she got here.

134
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,154
I can hear you, Frank.
What, do you want some too?

135
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,089
Sam. Hey, hey.

136
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,958
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

137
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:44,671
I am gonna send Alex away
to a school for at-risk teens.

138
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,670
You know, emotional
problems and stuff.

139
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,968
It might be good.
He's dealt with a lot.

140
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,508
Yeah.

141
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,270
Hey.

142
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,117
I just can't help but feel
like I'm giving up on him.

143
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,946
We both know that's not true.

144
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,850
- Yeah. ZADRO:
A little help here.

145
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,993
Mario Dunston, 42, single
GSW to the left chest.

146
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,650
How are you doing, sir?

147
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,989
It hurts really bad
when I breathe.

148
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,461
Pulse ox, 92 on 5 liters.

149
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,328
Tachy at 120, BP at
100 palp, had four of MS.

150
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,470
- How's the other dude?
- Got another guy.

151
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,231
Call X-ray for a portable and
set me up for a chest tube.

152
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,635
Morris, Trauma 2. Hey, Dawn.

153
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,006
Donnie Moore, 17, GSW, entrance
through the right temple, no exit.

154
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,147
Tubed him for agonal resps.

155
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,079
Donnie? Donnie?

156
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,809
Purposeful hand movement.

157
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,477
Okay, hold CT and an O.R.

158
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,021
This guy may have a chance.

159
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,319
- Thanks for lending us your truck, Tony.
- Yup.

160
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,463
- We'll see you later tonight. Bye.
- I shouldn't be too late.

161
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,766
What are you doing? Let
your grandmother sit in front.

162
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,698
It's fine. Makes me feel
like I'm being chauffeured.

163
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,701
Be good. Don't
steal any paintings.

164
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,998
Don't kill any patients.

165
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,664
I'm allowed one a day.

166
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,207
One.

167
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,510
Okay, curved Kelly.

168
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,876
HemoCue is 14.2.

169
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,952
Need to ask you a
few questions, Mario.

170
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,213
I'm a little preoccupied, man.

171
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,108
What beef you got with
your Two-Niner buddy?

172
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,556
What you sweating me for?

173
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,694
I didn't do nothing
but get shot.

174
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,795
Y'all get out there
and arrest somebody.

175
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,191
You got anybody in mind?

176
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,923
How should I
know? Y'all the cops.

177
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,467
All right, guys, come on. Let us
work. He's not going anywhere.

178
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,762
Thanks.

179
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,405
That was for me, not you.

180
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,406
Thirty-two French
on a vascular clamp.

181
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,544
- How many times you been shot?
- This makes eight.

182
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,411
0 silk on a driver.

183
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,417
- Only 200 cc's out.
- Okay.

184
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,577
Looks like you didn't bag a
main vein. You're one lucky guy.

185
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,647
Yeah, I'm what
they call black Irish.

186
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,652
He's having ectopy.

187
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,590
Yeah, QRS is wide.
What's his temp?

188
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,786
Down to 84.

189
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,254
What's happening?

190
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:52,824
He's vasodilating...

191
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:57,095
which means the colder blood from
his extremities is lowering his core temp.

192
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,329
Charlotte, honey?

193
00:08:58,772 --> 00:08:59,899
I'm okay, Mom.

194
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,034
That's my good girl.

195
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,943
Don't worry, they're
gonna find your brother.

196
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,580
We're all gonna be okay.

197
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,114
I can't get this hip back in place.
- Let me try.

198
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,842
Wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on.

199
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,788
- Ah, I got it.
- He's at V-fib.

200
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,117
- All right, start CPR.
- Charge to 200.

201
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,783
Okay. Charging.

202
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,456
Clear.

203
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,630
- No change.
- What are they doing?

204
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,792
Your mom's asleep
so they could fix her hip.

205
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,960
And they're trying to
help your dad's heart.

206
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,628
Clear.

207
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,799
Still V-fib. Charge to 300.

208
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:35,998
Dad.

209
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,304
All right, let's move
her out into the hallway.

210
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,276
Come on. We gotta let them work.

211
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,507
No, I wanna stay. Dad!

212
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,480
Clear.

213
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,646
No change. One milligram of epi.

214
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,585
He can't stay in
V-fib for much longer.

215
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,314
Clear.

216
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,655
Mario Dunston.
Street name is Monster.

217
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,800
Got out of Stateville
a few weeks ago.

218
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,525
He's a real O.G., huh?

219
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,964
Did 20 years.

220
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,197
Gang-related shooting.
He left a kid paralyzed.

221
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,002
Hell, if he remains stable,
you guys can talk to him soon.

222
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,907
- How is he doing?
- Still 250 cc's out.

223
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:17,016
You collapsed a lung, minor bleeding.
Should take about three days to heal.

224
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,812
The cops need to ask
you some questions.

225
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,854
What for? I ain't
got any answers.

226
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,083
You just did 20 years. You
cooperate, maybe they'll be lenient.

227
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,386
Lenient?

228
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,029
What they need to be
lenient for? I didn't do nothing.

229
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,222
Well, then tell them who did it.

230
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,827
I didn't see who did it.

231
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,867
Oh, you were just an
innocent bystander?

232
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,369
Yeah, okay,
Monster. Suit yourself.

233
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,737
Name is Mario. Or Mr. Dunston.

234
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,207
Whichever you prefer.

235
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,777
Morris.

236
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,538
What's up?

237
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,248
You need anything?

238
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,544
No, I'm straight.

239
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,021
Is he gonna be all right?

240
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,047
I don't know.

241
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,561
Sam, could you give us
a hand in here, please?

242
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,482
Junior?

243
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,889
Junior! Junior.

244
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,255
Hey!

245
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,990
- Junior, you all right, man?
- You're gonna pull your chest tube out.

246
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,896
Sam, call Security. What
the hell are you doing, man?

247
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,067
Come on. Get Security now!

248
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,229
Let me go. That's my son!

249
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,500
Junior! Junior!

250
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,769
That's my son. Junior!

251
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,440
Is he all right?

252
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,415
They found him unconscious
at the bottom of some stairs.

253
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,283
Not far from where
they found you.

254
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,616
Is he all right?

255
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,759
We won't know for
sure until he's had a CT.

256
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,451
He took a pretty
hard blow to the head.

257
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,596
You still have absolutely
no idea what happened?

258
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,957
- Damn it.
- V-fib again.

259
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,396
Anything I can do?

260
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,628
- Charge to 360.
- Come on, Donnie.

261
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,067
Charged.

262
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,434
- Blew a pupil.
- Clear.

263
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,137
Okay, another amp of epi.

264
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,438
Why is this patient
in brain-stem failure?

265
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,106
Multiple hematomas pushed the uncus
across the free edge of the tentorium...

266
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,481
compressing the brain stem,
knocking out his vegetative functions.

267
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,984
Charged.

268
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,914
- This guy's a goner.
- Clear.

269
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,320
Okay, another
round. Charge to 360.

270
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,191
Clear.

271
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,330
Okay, that's it.

272
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,395
Clear the room and have Social
Work try to contact the family.

273
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,337
Gates, call it.

274
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,569
Time of death, 11:12 a.m.

275
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,926
- How does it feel?
- Throbby.

276
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,459
That will go away.

277
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,292
Can I get you anything?
Hot chocolate or some Jell-O?

278
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,161
Is my dad gonna die?

279
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:27,269
You know, there's some great
doctors working very hard right now...

280
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,306
to make sure that
doesn't happen.

281
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,639
You just need to try and
think positive thoughts.

282
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,278
You are a tough
little girl. I can tell.

283
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,975
Films look good, Mrs. Paxon.
Your hip is back in place.

284
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,814
Thanks. It feels much better.

285
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,512
Hi, baby. Are you okay?

286
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,713
She's good.

287
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,156
We're gonna need your consent
for a procedure on your husband.

288
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,660
- What procedure?
- There's a problem with his heart.

289
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,024
Oh, my God.

290
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,564
Charlie, baby, Mommy
will be right back.

291
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,326
Your husband's heart has
stopped from being too cold.

292
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,528
We need to perform
a thoracotomy.

293
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,729
What is that?

294
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,034
It's a procedure where
we cut open his chest...

295
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,370
and pour warm water
directly onto his heart.

296
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,412
That sounds dangerous.
Is there another way?

297
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,059
It's not standard, but it's the
fastest way to get his temperature up.

298
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,551
That's why we need your consent.

299
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,187
I don't know. I...

300
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,852
Maybe we could wait until
he wakes up and then...

301
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,357
The risk of dying from hypothermia
could probably be greater.

302
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,721
Well, I can't do this.

303
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,331
Mrs. Paxon. We cannot do
this without your permission.

304
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,434
What would your husband
want? Is he a fighter?

305
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,433
Yes. Yes, he is.

306
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,094
Then sign the consent.

307
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,569
- Hey.
- Hey there. Haven't seen you.

308
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,039
Yeah, I've been buried.

309
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,735
Yeah, me too, I'm
knackered. Lunch later?

310
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,676
Kovac has me on scut patrol
and this board looks chock-full.

311
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,283
- Maybe after your shift?
- Yeah, I'll drive you home.

312
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,214
Hey, Neela. They
need you in Trauma 1.

313
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,116
I'm on my way.
I'll see you later?

314
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:51,621
Hey. Angie's number. I gave her the
heads-up, she's expecting your call.

315
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,953
- Thanks, Archie.
- Said she had family-resort hookups.

316
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,030
Fun for the gremlin, swimming
with dolphins, water slides.

317
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,224
We might not be
bringing gremlin.

318
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,304
Oh, a little kick-start for
the old postpartum love life.

319
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,133
I feel you, big guy. All right.

320
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,538
Hey, Frank, I'm gonna be getting
my caffeine on if anybody's looking.

321
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,976
Hey. Is Dr. Kovac
going on vacation?

322
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,776
Yeah. A little romantic
getaway, I guess.

323
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,815
They're getting
married. I just know it.

324
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,079
Abby was asking a patient
about wedding cakes.

325
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,779
That getaway
smacks of honeymoon.

326
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,652
Have you met Abby Lockhart?
Not exactly the marrying kind.

327
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,157
We're female. We're
all the marrying kind.

328
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,728
I can smell a wedding
a mile away, Archie.

329
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,162
It's like a sixth sense.

330
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,164
- Still in V-fib, no pulse.
- Rib spreader.

331
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,963
All right. Hold
ventilation for a minute.

332
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:45,576
Okay. Now, as the lung
deflates, try to feel for the heart.

333
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,845
Okay, I feel it. No effusion.

334
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,678
Oh, good. Now you can
start internal compressions.

335
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,379
Got the first 10 liters.

336
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,912
Hey, Pratt.

337
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,854
- Hey, Charlotte, how did you get in here?
- The door.

338
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,156
We ready for the saline?

339
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,198
Yeah, go ahead. Pour in the
first liter and get suction ready.

340
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,960
Come on, hey, turn around.
You shouldn't see this.

341
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,199
Okay, the first
liter's going in.

342
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,531
What are they doing to my dad?

343
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,974
Pouring warm water in his heart.
It can help him fight off the cold.

344
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,808
This is all my mom's fault.

345
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,013
You were in an accident.
It's nobody's fault.

346
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,010
She was driving and
they were fighting.

347
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,671
Families fight, it
doesn't mean that she...

348
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:31,920
It's because she cheated.

349
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,994
That's why they're
getting a divorce.

350
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,893
Oh, thank goodness. Sorry. I
came back out and she was gone.

351
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,500
Come on, sweetie. Your
mom's asking for you.

352
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,930
I wanna stay with my dad.

353
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,203
All right, tell her
mom she'll be fine.

354
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,405
- It's okay.
- Where do you need me?

355
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,067
Internal compressions.
Sterile sixes to Neela.

356
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,736
What, are you expecting a call?

357
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,478
Spencer.

358
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,709
I keep texting him, but
he hasn't written back yet.

359
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,046
Charged.

360
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,657
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have a rhythm and a pulse.

361
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,705
Is this the father of the family?
- Yeah.

362
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,160
Trapped for 48
hours after an MVA.

363
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,921
Hypothermic to 84 degrees.

364
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,760
V-fib arrest,
refractory to shock.

365
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:14,990
Why is his chest open?

366
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,262
Bypass wasn't available, we did
a thoracotomy for rapid rewarming.

367
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,531
- Was that really necessary?
- We got a rhythm.

368
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,266
Okay, we'll close him up.
Suction fluids from the chest.

369
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,411
Cover the incision.
Take him to the O.R.

370
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,444
- Do you want me to scrub in?
- No.

371
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,243
This is a good teaching case for Mae
Lee. Stay down and finish your consults.

372
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,108
What's going on?

373
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,120
He wanted to talk to his son. I
was giving them a few minutes.

374
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,588
The police wanna know
if they can talk to the boy.

375
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,852
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

376
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,193
Hey, we ain't finished yet.

377
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,354
- Police need to talk to your son.
- What for?

378
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,796
They found him at the
scene. He might be involved.

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,401
Don't say nothing, Junior.
Everything's gonna be all right.

380
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,698
Damn, man, stop
calling me that, man.

381
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,472
We still gotta
wait for the CT...

382
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,941
but so far looks like
just a mild concussion.

383
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,408
My guess is he's fine.

384
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,315
So did he tell you
what happened today?

385
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,016
Fell down some stairs.

386
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,989
He fell? That's it?

387
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,319
That's it.

388
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,586
You're only making
it harder on yourself.

389
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,756
Give it up, Junior. Come on.

390
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,558
I told you, I don't
know nothing.

391
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:23,066
88th Street Bishop on Two-Niner turf.
What were you doing over there, man?

392
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,760
We know you had
beef with Donnie.

393
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,098
Where they taking him?

394
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,299
Up for that CT I told you about.

395
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,903
So?

396
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,444
Heard you guys got
pretty hot. Got into it.

397
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,977
- Why don't they just leave him alone?
- Hey, lay down, okay?

398
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,015
You don't wanna pull
that chest tube out.

399
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,279
Hey, yo, cop! Hey!

400
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,320
I'm in here.

401
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,618
What do you want?

402
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,120
Y'all want a statement?

403
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,626
Oh, now you're ready to talk.

404
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,961
Yeah.

405
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,693
I shot that punk. Nine milli.

406
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,700
Would've capped
his ass again too...

407
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,064
but he got me before I could.

408
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,066
You shot him?

409
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,379
Yeah, that's right.
What, I stutter?

410
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,874
So why don't
y'all go on ahead...

411
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,848
and ask me your little
questions for your little report?

412
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,886
What you wanna know?

413
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,826
We're treating the Paxon family.

414
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,054
Have Search and Rescue contact
us at County if there's information.

415
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,392
Dr. Lockhart. L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T.

416
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,261
Didn't find Spencer yet, huh?

417
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,096
Hey, guys. I made a latte run.

418
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,670
I remembered how much
you like extra cinnamon, Abby.

419
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,774
- I'm gonna put them in the break room.
- Pratt, you got a minute?

420
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,239
Yeah, come on. Walk with me.

421
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,436
I gotta sign out. I have
a family emergency.

422
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,944
- What?
- It's really important.

423
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,638
I'll be back in the morning.

424
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,744
It's always something
with that guy.

425
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,352
So check this out. I got
this O.G. with a GSW.

426
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,989
Just confessed to shooting
some kid from a rival gang.

427
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,421
But it doesn't add up.
I don't think he did it.

428
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,789
First he says he had nothing
to do with it. Then he confesses.

429
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,862
I mean, if he did it,
why would he confess?

430
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,931
If he didn't do it, why
would he confess?

431
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,658
How would I know?
Did you ask him?

432
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,599
- I thought maybe you could talk to him.
- Did you ask Kovac?

433
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,796
- Why would I do that?
- Let me think.

434
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,532
Chief of the ER, great with
people, years of experience.

435
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,474
Yeah, but you know, this is
kind of more in your wheelhouse.

436
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,945
Whoa, whoa, whoa. And
exactly what wheelhouse is that?

437
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,612
You want me to talk to
this dude because I'm black.

438
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,051
Well, yeah. I mean,
you are black, aren't you?

439
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,281
That's wrong, Morris.

440
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,982
What? We do this all the time.

441
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,286
If I had a pregnant
girl, I might get Abby.

442
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,485
Big Croatian, Kovac.

443
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,824
I didn't come to you
with my autistic Irish kid.

444
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,295
You could've. You should've.

445
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,664
Hey, what is the big deal? You
know that I love the black man.

446
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,233
You don't wanna
get into this with me.

447
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,499
Look, I got a black
guy from the inner city...

448
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,075
confessing to a crime I
don't think he committed.

449
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,508
You were a black
guy from the inner city.

450
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,012
I thought you could
relate on a level that I can't.

451
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,015
You think that just because we
both grew up black and poor...

452
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,777
we somehow magically relate.

453
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,447
Well, there's nothing
magical about it.

454
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,885
Black isn't just one thing.

455
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,720
We don't all share some sort
of collective consciousness.

456
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:04,352
I know you may think we
all look alike, but we're not.

457
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,533
- Thanks for making a coffee run.
- Yeah, no problem. There's sugar too.

458
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,902
Aargh. Where is my
darn stethoscope?

459
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,442
It's the third one I've lost.

460
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,745
- I knew it!
- What?

461
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,420
- You're getting married.
- Am not.

462
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,056
- Why are you looking at wedding mags?
- They're, uh, there.

463
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,556
Why were you asking
wedding-cake questions earlier?

464
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,456
I was... I was curious.

465
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,429
Okay, fine. Look me in the eye
and tell me you're not getting married.

466
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,622
- No.
- Why not?

467
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,065
Because that's stupid. I...

468
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,598
- I am not getting married.
- You looked away.

469
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,904
I knew it, I knew it! Oh, God, ah,
this one would look so pretty on you.

470
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,944
Luka asked if we
could keep this quiet...

471
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:58,084
It's in your eyes, you have the
glow. I can't wait for the glow.

472
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,549
- I can't wait to try on wedding dresses...
- Hope!

473
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,816
If you tell
anyone, I'll kill you.

474
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,422
Do you hear me?

475
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:10,085
Kill you, as in dead.

476
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,696
Got it?

477
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,128
What's up, bro?

478
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,671
Mr. Dunston, I'm Dr. Pratt.

479
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,674
- I'll go get his next dose of Ancef.
- All right.

480
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,209
Looks like your bleeding
has slowed down.

481
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,473
Your lung should heal in a
few days with the chest tube.

482
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,708
Yeah, that's what the
other dude told me.

483
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,582
Y'all changing shifts?

484
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,087
No. No, not exactly.

485
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,390
Just thought maybe you'd
wanna talk to somebody.

486
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,188
What, you like a shrink?

487
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,493
No. I'm not a shrink.

488
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:53,538
For some reason, Dr. Morris thinks you
didn't commit the crime you confessed to.

489
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,470
Oh.

490
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,301
So this is like a black thing.

491
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,878
Hey, excuse me, nurse.

492
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,708
I'm sorry, you might
wanna step out.

493
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,647
We about to have a black-man
talk. Ain't that right, doc?

494
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:06,877
I'm trying to help you.

495
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,918
Hey, go on ahead, break it down.

496
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,523
Why don't you tell me what
kind of help you think I need, doc?

497
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,852
You know what? Forget it.

498
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,325
That's right. We ain't
got nothing to talk about.

499
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,828
- You don't know me, fool.
- No, I don't know you.

500
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:22,162
I know I work on a parade of
dudes just like you every day.

501
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,828
Where you from, Dr. Pratt?

502
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:28,403
You one of them
North Shore brothers?

503
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,672
No. I'm from right here.

504
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,404
55th and Michigan.

505
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,610
So you think because you
got your little doctor degree...

506
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,913
you got out the ghetto,
you can judge me?

507
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,556
Nobody's judging you.
Mistakes you made are all yours.

508
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,851
That's right. And 20
years I spent paying.

509
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,188
I did my time, brother.

510
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,696
Strip searches,
nasty-ass food...

511
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,801
piss, take a dump
when they tell you.

512
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,436
It's like you didn't even exist.

513
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,299
Everything.

514
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,399
Your family, your friends,
your whole life just disappears.

515
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,476
And you still didn't
learn a damn thing.

516
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,340
Hey, man, look here, I learned.

517
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:11,006
- Yeah, but you're still banging, right?
- I didn't say that.

518
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,352
But yeah.

519
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,353
Yeah, I used to bang back in the
day. Boy, you couldn't tell me nothing.

520
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,593
Then my son came.

521
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,830
I gave all that up, man.

522
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,934
Years ago.

523
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:34,297
Now I just get through the days.

524
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,800
I try and raise my boy right.

525
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,204
Make up for lost time, you know?

526
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:46,248
Then how come your boy is
concussed, the other kid is dead...

527
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,649
and you're sitting here
with a bullet in your chest?

528
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,815
Mario? Hey, Mario.

529
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,324
Hey.

530
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,656
When was his last morphine?

531
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,094
Four mgs about an hour ago.

532
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,323
We've got muffled heart sounds.

533
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,763
Pressure's down, 80/60.

534
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,700
Give me the SonoSite. Is there
more blood in the Thora-Seal?

535
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,601
No, not a drop.

536
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,777
All right, squeeze
in a liter of saline.

537
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,283
Mario? Mario!

538
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,322
- Keith.
- Hey, Tone, how you been?

539
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,458
I'm all right. Where is he?

540
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,685
I wouldn't have called
you unless it was bad.

541
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,729
Started up with one of my
customers. Almost got himself killed.

542
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,017
How much does he owe?

543
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,124
Tony, your pop, he's
on a bender, you know.

544
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,292
Most of the time, it's
just the weekends...

545
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,462
I got it. Thanks.

546
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,011
Mike.

547
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,883
What the hell are
you doing here?

548
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,315
Shouldn't you be off playing
doctor with somebody's wife?

549
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,547
That's enough. Let's go.

550
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,884
Get your hands off me.

551
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,584
Enough. You're done. Let's go.

552
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,725
Little Tony.

553
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,560
Come on.

554
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,336
Can't drain with a catheter.
We'll never get it all out.

555
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,532
Is this the tamponade?

556
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,178
He's a candidate for a
subxiphoid pericardial window.

557
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,507
She's right. Prep from
nipples to umbilicus.

558
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,913
- Pressure's only 80 after two units.
- He needs to be decompressed now.

559
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,077
Masks and sterile gloves
for me and Mae Lee.

560
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,950
Thirty cc's of 1 percent lido.

561
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,285
You ever seen a
subxiphoid pericardiostomy?

562
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,722
I've read about them.

563
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,021
- Dr. Dubenko...
- It's a little crowded in here.

564
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:40,030
Tell the Paxon family Dad's
chest closure went really well.

565
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,634
They can see him in
Recovery. Two of Versed.

566
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,030
Take the edge off.

567
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,933
What are y'all doing to me?

568
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,904
We need to drain blood caught
in the sac around your heart...

569
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,440
keeping it from beating.

570
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,306
CT on the Dunston boy was
clear. No fractures, no bleeding.

571
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,380
- Okay.
- Is that Junior?

572
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,776
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

573
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,485
Hey.

574
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,614
Can you take a look
at him, make sure?

575
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,149
Versed's going in.

576
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,382
Yeah. Morris.

577
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,832
Hey, man, when y'all
gonna let me out of here?

578
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,768
Oh, my bad. You
got someplace to be?

579
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,271
Don't worry where I gotta be.

580
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,273
Do your chart and
let me up out of here.

581
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,902
What, you got a job to go to?
You going to school or something?

582
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,308
Look, you got a
mild concussion...

583
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,982
so you're getting
out of here today.

584
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,749
It's too bad I can't say the
same thing about your pops.

585
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,186
Man, he ain't my pops.

586
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,925
Only time I ever seen that
fool was on visiting day.

587
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:47,157
Yeah, well, looks like you're
gonna be visiting him again.

588
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,394
What, you didn't know?

589
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,268
He's going back in for
shooting that Two-Niner.

590
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,430
Hey, Dawn, what was his
name again? Like, Donnie, right?

591
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,768
Mm-hm. Donnie Moore.

592
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,604
Let me tell you
something, Junior.

593
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,076
Your pops, he ain't no joke.

594
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,647
He told five-0 everything.

595
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,576
Man, he must really
want all the credit for this.

596
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,519
Come on, man, you
don't have to front for me.

597
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,747
I mean, tell the truth.

598
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:14,257
It's gotta be kind of cool, right, to
have a pops with that kind of rep?

599
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:18,090
I mean, look at him. The man's been
shot eight times and he's still here.

600
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,955
Yeah. That's one bad
dude right there, Junior.

601
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,125
Look, man, don't
call me that, man.

602
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,804
Look, he didn't even do nothing.

603
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:27,632
I shot that fool.

604
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,069
- Yeah, right.
- It was me.

605
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,300
Yeah, okay.

606
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,536
All right. Look, yo, five-0.

607
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,146
Yo, get your ass in here, man.

608
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:38,250
Look, he ain't do nothing. He
ain't got nothing to do with this.

609
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,581
I shot that fool and this mother... He
tried to stop me, so I shot his ass too.

610
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,747
I threw my nine down the
garbage chute. Y'all go look, find it.

611
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,621
Look, man, you ain't my
father, man. Stay out of my life.

612
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,558
You ain't my father.
You a bitch, man.

613
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,062
- Man, you a bitch, man.
- Come on, come on.

614
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,427
- Let's go.
- No, get off me.

615
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,160
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Get off me.

616
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,168
Get off me, cop!

617
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,772
We're gonna grab you a hot chocolate
and then go up and see your dad.

618
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:09,278
- You sure you don't want anything?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

619
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,505
Why is she so sleepy?

620
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,583
Oh, no, it's just the
medicine. She's okay.

621
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,344
Pulse, 48. BP, 75 systolic.

622
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,181
- Spencer!
- He's unresponsive.

623
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,483
How did you find him?
- Damnedest thing.

624
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:22,094
They triangulated his cell phone from
text messages someone was sending.

625
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,696
- Spencer, it's gonna be okay.
- I'll go get Dr. Kovac.

626
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:29,062
CBC, chem panel, EKG, CK, warm
saline, a Bair Hugger and a portable chest.

627
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,033
Honey, stay out there
while we work, okay?

628
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,540
Hi. CHARLOTTE: Hi.

629
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,480
- I gotta go wake up the mom.
- Dr. Pratt gave her 5 of Versed.

630
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,916
- You might wanna try flumazenil.
- You got it.

631
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,325
Are they gonna cut open
Spencer like they did my dad?

632
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,384
No, only if they have to.

633
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,421
I hope they don't have to.

634
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,605
Only 400 cc's of
mediastinal output.

635
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,608
BP is 124/82. Everything
is back to normal.

636
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:12,801
How about his crit?

637
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:16,471
Holding steady at 40.
This guy's as tough as nails.

638
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,078
Hey, about earlier...

639
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,152
Oh, no, no, no, don't sweat it.

640
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:24,655
I just want you to know you
can come to me for help anytime.

641
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,449
- Likewise.
- All right.

642
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,821
Oh.

643
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,929
All right. Hmm.

644
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,864
Hey.

645
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,125
- Hey, um.
- You got it.

646
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,900
You're not supposed
to hang on that long.

647
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:37,994
Okay, yeah.

648
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,469
- Or that tight.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

649
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,835
- Peace out, man.
- All right.

650
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,810
So looks like you're good.

651
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,010
No more bleeding in your
chest, nothing around your heart.

652
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,486
Those tubes, they
stay in a few days.

653
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,954
Could I get something to drink?

654
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:01,150
Uh, yeah. Water okay?

655
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:07,227
I just wanted to apologize about
how things went down today.

656
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,130
Don't even trip. I
should be thanking you.

657
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,369
Saved my life, man.

658
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,906
I meant your son.

659
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,874
Man, you bust your ass trying
to protect the ones you love.

660
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:25,142
- Try to keep them from making mistakes...
- Yeah, they make them anyway.

661
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,917
I kept telling him to forget it.

662
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:32,154
He shot that Donnie kid over nothing,
because he looked at him the wrong way.

663
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:34,716
Kids, man.

664
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,988
You try to hold on to
them as long as you can.

665
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:41,793
Then one day, gotta let go.

666
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,934
Then maybe someday
they'll come back.

667
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,866
Yeah, maybe.

668
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,934
Hey, good luck to you, man.

669
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,442
Thanks, doc.

670
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,540
Hopefully, I never
see your ass again.

671
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,845
Hey. They found Spencer Paxon.

672
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,285
Get out of here. How is he?

673
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,188
- Not great.
- Well, do they need some help in there?

674
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,125
Uh, Kovac and Abby are in
there. You have a good night.

675
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,820
All right.

676
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:16,693
Asshole slumlord.

677
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,530
You got one week, Mike, one.

678
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,763
Should've been paying
me to live in that dump.

679
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,875
Then you're on your own.
You can stay in my room.

680
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,969
Listen, I want you to
know, I really appreciate it.

681
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,205
I really do.

682
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,374
And you won't
even know I'm there.

683
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,719
Hello.

684
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,288
You're home early.

685
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,759
Yeah.

686
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:47,093
Everyone, this is
Mike. Mike, everyone.

687
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,390
It's a pleasure.

688
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,797
These are the Rileys.

689
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,801
Meg's parents.

690
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,263
Oh.

691
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,671
I'm sorry about your girl.

692
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,102
It's a damn shame.

693
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,813
Where's the head?

694
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,317
Over there.

695
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,818
Who was that guy?

696
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,464
That was, uh, my father.

697
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,623
He wasn't feeling so well,
so I thought I'd help him out.

698
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,031
- Is he okay? GATES:
Yeah, he's fine.

699
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,137
So how many
paintings did you steal?

700
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,136
Just one. A lovely Degas.

701
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,707
It's a poster we're gonna
get framed for my bedroom.

702
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,775
That sounds terrific.

703
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,640
Tony, a minute?

704
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:35,940
Sure.

705
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,774
Everything okay? Did
she behave herself?

706
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,715
Yeah, you bet. Had a great day.

707
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,889
She seems to be
handling it well.

708
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,286
She has her good
days and bad days.

709
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,017
She's a fighter like Meg.

710
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,855
We don't wanna disrupt her
school year. She's been through a lot.

711
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,299
But we should start working
out the details for the move.

712
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,963
And she'll adjust
quickly. She's young.

713
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,200
Yeah. Well, family's best.

714
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,346
Oh, yeah. We have
six acres, the horses.

715
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,004
- Eh?
- And the good schools.

716
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,582
And we'll want you to visit.

717
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,982
You know, birthdays,
Thanksgiving.

718
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,582
You're always welcome.

719
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,815
Oh, thank you.
Wisconsin is a great place.

720
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,014
It is.

721
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,819
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Yeah.

722
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,690
What's up with that
secret ingredient?

723
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,704
It's secret. Now
remember, don't look.

724
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,241
- You guys seen Tony?
- He left early.

725
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,878
Gates leave me a message, Frank?

726
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,241
Let me check. No.

727
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,077
I'm out of here. You leaving?

728
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,741
Yeah.

729
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,288
Hey. I have info
about Abby and Luka.

730
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,685
Excuse us, nosy nellie.

731
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,451
Can you keep a secret?

732
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,858
It's confirmed.

733
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,691
The wedding is on.

734
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,356
No way. Wow.

735
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,363
I guess this means
I owe you dinner.

736
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,903
Have you ever known
Abby to be violent?

737
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:10,509
Your rescued kid is crashing.
Kovac wants you back in Trauma.

738
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,038
- Can I go in there?
- No, it's not a good idea.

739
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,044
Wait with your mom.
She'll be waking up.

740
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,240
- I won't freak out, I promise.
- Okay, fine.

741
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,282
Just wait right there.
What happened?

742
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,580
Runs of V-tach. We
need you for CPR.

743
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:23,983
Temp is 86.

744
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,748
Bypass should be
available by now.

745
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,894
Let's get the perfusionist
down here now.

746
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,222
I'm not cracking his chest.

747
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,113
Excuse me. Hi.

748
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,278
I'm Samantha Taggart.
This is my son, Alex.

749
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,185
We've been expecting you.

750
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,924
Nice to meet you,
Alex. I'm Mrs. Dawson.

751
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,195
I need you to fill
this paperwork out.

752
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,923
Okay.

753
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,441
Yo, Greg, what's up, man?

754
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,378
How you been?

755
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,813
I'm good. I'm doing good.

756
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,481
How about you?

757
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,677
How you think?

758
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,291
Yeah. Stupid-ass question.

759
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,653
Good to see you, dog.

760
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,055
Been a long time.

761
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,287
Yeah. Too long.

762
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:43,665
But seriously, I mean,
how you holding up?

763
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,333
It's hard, man.

764
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,705
Waiting on trial
over a year now.

765
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,845
Food sucks.

766
00:36:57,115 --> 00:37:00,017
Mostly just miss K.J., you know?

767
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,412
Miss seeing him growing up.

768
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,325
Worry about him
all the time, man.

769
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,129
Then I think about the
kid I hit when I was drunk.

770
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:17,125
His folks, what I
made them go through.

771
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,597
I don't want this for K.J.

772
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:24,174
I don't want him
to end up like me.

773
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,005
And ain't nothing I
could do about it in here.

774
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,273
Hey, D, um...

775
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,546
Man, I'm sorry I never
wrote you back, man.

776
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,381
So you got my letters.

777
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,353
Yeah, I got them.

778
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,920
I should've visited.

779
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,363
On the real, man, I
didn't know what to say.

780
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,592
I just know I hate
seeing you in here.

781
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,200
And believe me, I tried to do everything
I could to keep you out of here, but...

782
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:58,571
Yo, yo, Greg, hey, don't
even worry about that, man.

783
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,109
All that's on me.

784
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,080
If it hadn't been for you, I'd
probably still be out there drinking.

785
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:10,882
It's all good,
baby. We straight.

786
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,919
I'll always be your friend, man.

787
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,626
Thanks for coming, for real.

788
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,837
Okay, Spencer, can
you squeeze my hand?

789
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,109
Come on, Spencer,
try to squeeze my hand.

790
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,171
There you go. Good job.

791
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,474
Core temp is 94.

792
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,413
Nice work. ICU ready for him?

793
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,950
Yup.

794
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,965
- Is he gonna lose the frostbitten toes?
- Three of them don't look salvageable.

795
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,083
- Small price to pay.
- I'm gonna call Pratt.

796
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,750
He worked on the family.
I'll tell him the kid's okay.

797
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,728
- Do you wanna say hi?
- Can he hear me?

798
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,765
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,332
Spence, it's me, Charlie.

800
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,336
You saved us.

801
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,766
You saved us all.

802
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,278
- Okay, let's go.
- Move back, sweetie.

803
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,551
Hello?

804
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,698
Oh, hey, Abby.

805
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,189
Really?

806
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,802
Wow, that's great.

807
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,000
No. No.

808
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,005
No, I appreciate the
call. Thanks for calling.

809
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,209
No. No, no, no, I'm fine.

810
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:19,076
Really, that's really
good news. I'm just tired.

811
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,882
Yeah, it's been a long day.

812
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,215
All right, then.

813
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,314
All right. Good night.

814
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,552
<i>Bust them in a stereo Cause</i>

815
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,891
<i>I got to keep on walking
On the road to Zion, man</i>

816
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:43,234
<i>We got to keeps it
burning On the road to Zion</i>

817
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,604
- You remember that?
- How could I forget?

818
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,906
Okay, yeah. That
was a fun night.

819
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,139
That was a fun night.

820
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:53,910
Oh, God, it seems
like a million years ago.

821
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,951
Well, we could do
that again sometime.

822
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,282
Minus the whiskey. I can't
bounce back like I used to.

823
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,789
Ooh, yeah, tell me about it.

824
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,255
Well, thanks for the ride.

825
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:06,057
I'll see you tomorrow.

826
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,254
I'm off.

827
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:13,595
Okay. Then I'll see
you when I see you.

828
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,407
Neela.

829
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,928
We'll just show you
to the room, then.

830
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,998
Okay, buddy.

831
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,297
Behave yourself, okay?

832
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,633
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

833
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,208
Mom, I don't wanna stay here.

834
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,813
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

835
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,119
Mom, please.

836
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,850
I'll be better, I promise,
okay? I'm sorry.

837
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,961
I'm sorry.

838
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:15,967
Hey.

839
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,330
You gotta be brave, okay, baby?

840
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,798
I love you.

841
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,835
Mom, I'm sorry, okay?

842
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,852
Mom, please.

843
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,421
