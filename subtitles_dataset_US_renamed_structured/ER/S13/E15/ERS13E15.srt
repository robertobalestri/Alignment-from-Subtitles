1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,068
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,368
You can't let this happen, Tony.

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,104
No. Come on, Mom.
You gotta wake up.

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,611
What they got you for?

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,045
I helped some people get
some medications they needed.

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,895
Thanks for bailing me out, I'll make
sure you get your money right back...

7
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:22,321
Greg. I told you to shut it
down. Why didn't you do that?

8
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,613
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,986
I got a little boy and a
man with extensive burns.

10
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,056
- It started downstairs.
- In my apartment.

11
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:32,665
I want you to put your
hand in that vice there.

12
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,960
I want you to feel that.

13
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,804
Plenty more where
that came from.

14
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,139
There we go. Here.

15
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,547
Come on. Come on, eat.

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,313
I've been slaving over a hot
griddle all morning for you.

17
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,582
Please, at least try. Okay?

18
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,727
There you go. Hold your fork.

19
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,899
- Satisfied?
- No, I'm not.

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,002
I'm not gonna be
satisfied until I hear:

21
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,831
"Wow, I can't believe you made
me your world-famous pancakes."

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,339
Wow, Tony, I can't believe you
made me your world-famous pancakes.

23
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,844
Okay, here's your
lunch. It's time to go.

24
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,418
Are kids gonna act
weird to me today?

25
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,476
No.

26
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,019
I don't wanna talk about Mom.

27
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,851
You don't have to.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,300
Are you sending me to live
with Grandma and Grandpa?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,468
Why do you ask that?

30
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,366
Isn't that what you were
talking about at the funeral?

31
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,973
We were talking about a
lot of things at the funeral.

32
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,276
I don't wanna live with them.

33
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,440
I wanna stay here with you
and your crummy pancakes.

34
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,781
Come on.

35
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,052
- Bye.
- Bye.

36
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,130
X-rays show your
lungs are improving.

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,235
Oh, good.

38
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,769
I need to inhale.

39
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,906
Well, if your oxygen level stays
up, you can go home in a few hours.

40
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:26,069
Tell Timmy. He's been
worried sick about me.

41
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,271
So has Alex.

42
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,910
How is he?

43
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,178
He's, uh...

44
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,388
He's been acting weird.

45
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,420
You think he did it, don't you?

46
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,594
I know I blew out those candles.

47
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,427
I don't believe it.
He's a good boy.

48
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,002
You know, he's stealing
Dr. Morris' credit card...

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,604
he's disrespecting you.

50
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,774
I don't know what to think.

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,433
If he did do it, I'm sure
it wasn't on purpose.

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,672
Do you think Alex started
that fire by accident?

53
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,281
I think you should continue to
take him to that therapist lady.

54
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,049
As far as the police go,
they think it was a candle.

55
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,623
Let it go at that.

56
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,623
Well, I'm glad to
hear he's doing okay.

57
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,387
Yeah, he just needed a
little time for the hand to heal.

58
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,032
Look what we have here.
Not one, but two late doctors.

59
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,067
- Blue Line was stuck.
- Some bozo jumped in front of the train.

60
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,466
- Where's your main man?
- Um...

61
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,369
- He's gonna take one more day.
- No problem, got it covered.

62
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,533
Cover this. Some suit
came from upstairs...

63
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,441
and said to give that to
whoever's running the floor.

64
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,706
- Damn.
- Damn.

65
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,710
Where's Pratt?

66
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,319
You suck balls.

67
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,750
Hold still, ma'am.

68
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,390
Hold still yourself, bitch.

69
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,581
Can we give benzos IM?

70
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,818
- That'll take a half an hour to work.
- Okay.

71
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,553
All right, I got access. What
do you want? Four Ativan?

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,890
- Ativan?
- Haldol, what?

73
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,230
You're ruining my
high, you retard.

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,424
Pratt, we need to talk.

75
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,069
I'm a little busy here, Morris.

76
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,068
- Give me midazolam. Faster onset.
- Okay.

77
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,730
- Knock her down in a minute.
- Can we step outside?

78
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,341
Sure. Soon as she settles down.

79
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,410
- Settle on this.
- Watch out.

80
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,342
I'm really sorry,
but I have to ask...

81
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,004
You're gonna
have to wait, please.

82
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,240
- One minute.
- Let go.

83
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,577
Pratt. HEATHER: Scum.

84
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,014
- Pratt.
- What?

85
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,246
The Medical Board
suspended your license.

86
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,628
Hey, can we talk?

87
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,069
Yeah, sure, what
can I do for you?

88
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,970
I was Pratt's accomplice.

89
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:39,704
- Excuse me?
- I helped him at the clinic.

90
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,939
- What?
- I know, I know.

91
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,553
It seemed like the right
thing to do at the time.

92
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,983
I can't believe this.

93
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,987
Look, I told Pratt that he
didn't have to protect me...

94
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,887
but he wants me
to stay out of it.

95
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,322
Well, you listen to Pratt.

96
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,391
- I'm gonna burn in hell, aren't I?
- No.

97
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,727
I mean, you might have
some explaining to do.

98
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,770
Hey, I'm sorry about this, man.

99
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,410
Thought I could work half
a shift before the hearing.

100
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,637
It's just a formality.
They'll reinstate you.

101
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,476
GI bleeds from NSAIDs
happen to thousands every year.

102
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,745
Morris, Abby's asking for
you. Her guy in 1 is throwing up.

103
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,082
Be strong, brother.
Fight the power.

104
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,645
- Liter wide open?
- Yeah.

105
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,853
And 10 of Reglan. Okay.

106
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,429
- Does it hurt here?
- Aah.

107
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:35,262
No, but if you tug on willy, I'll
sing Dionne Warwick's greatest hits.

108
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,596
Tempting, but no, thanks.

109
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,105
No, really, I... Aah. I thought
that's why you put the gloves on.

110
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,709
Seriously, I have
a latex fetish.

111
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:47,336
I even tried to give myself a
Brazilian using rubber cement once.

112
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,848
Didn't work, but I got into <i>Hustler</i>
as one of those guys who has three...

113
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,213
- All right, I get it.
- Ever had food poisoning?

114
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,289
I puked once after biting into
a Red Hot with stretch marks.

115
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,625
Okay, uh, we have to run some
tests to rule out anything serious...

116
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:04,697
like appendicitis, but after that,
hopefully, we can discharge you.

117
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,233
- What's up with this guy?
- Vomiting, low fever, exam is equivocal.

118
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,168
Doc, doc, you gotta
get me out of here, man.

119
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,637
I got a hot date tonight.

120
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,407
Does, uh, she take
air or helium? Ha-ha.

121
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,141
She takes Visa. That was funny.

122
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,179
- Can I use it?
- Sure.

123
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,977
Do you want me
to image the belly?

124
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,590
Hydrate him. He may spiff up.

125
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,688
Uh... Four of
morphine, antiemetics.

126
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,982
We'll get you out
of here, just sit tight.

127
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,988
Okay, you're about
to meet the Grassos.

128
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,753
She's been on
dialysis since 2002.

129
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,829
He's got a kidney,
but they don't match.

130
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,364
Our exchange pool paired
them up with two cousins...

131
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,057
who are in the same situation.

132
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,668
Yup. Kidneys for everyone.

133
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,870
Hi.

134
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,565
You guys set?

135
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,766
You bet.

136
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,777
No more dialysis, no
more infected shunts.

137
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,414
This is Dr. Rasgotra.

138
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,675
- She'll be assisting on the transplant.
- I am?

139
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,285
Well, someone's about to
get some A-1 kidney meat.

140
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,579
I'm like a racehorse.

141
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,451
- I could drink a six-pack without peeing.
- Honey, gross.

142
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:07,116
Micturation capacity is related to
bladder size and neural sensitivity...

143
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,351
not renal function.

144
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,895
- Then we'll give them some bladder too.
- Ha-ha.

145
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,795
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
You guys have any questions?

146
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,936
Concerns? No?

147
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,765
Okay. I'll see you in the O.R.

148
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,233
Our goal is to enroll
200 donor-recipient pairs.

149
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,744
By mixing and matching, we'd find
kidneys for almost 50 percent of them.

150
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,973
I'll introduce you to
the Herrero cousins.

151
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,313
Marina's getting a kidney from one cousin
and Thomas is giving his to the other.

152
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,750
- Yep, kind of like a kidney key party.
- Key party?

153
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,914
Except donors and recipients aren't
allowed to meet. That could get messy.

154
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,884
It's the ER. I'll
catch up to you.

155
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,085
What's a key party?

156
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:46,165
Oh, it's a little gimmick to help
swinging couples pick their partners.

157
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,891
Forget it. Before your time.

158
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,563
It sounds dirty.

159
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,400
- Ow!
- Okay, Jessie, come on. Hold still.

160
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,508
If he's got lice,
you're cutting his hair.

161
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,143
I'm a doctor, not Vidal Sassoon.

162
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,439
Abby, I need you. Funny
boy keeps throwing up.

163
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,081
Okay, Ray. You got this, right?

164
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,649
Hey, no, no, no.
Don't leave me here.

165
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,980
- Did you give him the Reglan?
- An hour ago.

166
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,088
Okay, it's probably
just gastroenteritis.

167
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,747
And if your labs are
okay, we'll get you home.

168
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,589
Forget home. I
got a gig at 10:15.

169
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,788
The big room at Zanies.

170
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,490
I've been trying to get in
there for a couple of years.

171
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,828
You're a comedian?

172
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,265
Aspiring.

173
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,268
You should aspire
a little harder.

174
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,600
Oh, a heckler.

175
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:32,838
Don't make me go
Kramer on your ass. Aah!

176
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,843
Hey, blondie, no
need to get violent.

177
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,541
Four of Zofran. Repeat p.r.n.

178
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,046
Jeez. May I?

179
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,783
Lay down, Simon.

180
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,450
Oh, my gosh.

181
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:52,224
I gotta practice my routine,
I gotta change my clothes.

182
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,527
I was gonna wear this shirt, but
now I got chow mein all over it.

183
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,069
- We're trying to get you better.
- Oof.

184
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,298
How long you been doing standup?

185
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,704
Moved out here from
Detroit a couple of years ago.

186
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,143
- Very courageous.
- Yeah, my old boss pushed me into it.

187
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,407
Because you were funny at work?

188
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,050
No.

189
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,413
Because he fired me twice.

190
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,851
Hated my guts.

191
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,388
My dad also had
a lot to do with it.

192
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,583
He hated you too?

193
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,319
No.

194
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,661
He died.

195
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,697
Life took on a whole
new perspective.

196
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,604
I'm gonna call the lab and
see what's taking so long.

197
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,831
Just relax.

198
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,499
I will try to relax.

199
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,338
I will.

200
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,512
We spent four weeks
e-mailing each other.

201
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,844
We finally meet and he
sticks me with the bill?

202
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,045
So you chased after him
and you fell into a hydrant?

203
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,281
Would've caught him
had I been wearing flats.

204
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,857
All right, breath sounds
are perfect. Lay back.

205
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,359
So what if I told him I
looked like Cindy Crawford?

206
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,520
- He said he looked like Matt Damon.
- Did he?

207
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,893
More like Matt
Damon's fat uncle's ass.

208
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,364
Pulse ox, 98 on room air.

209
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,366
- Tell me if this hurts.
- Aah! Yeah.

210
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,027
All right, you
have a broken rib.

211
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,039
I'm gonna give you something
for the pain and take an x-ray.

212
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,110
Percocet, CBC
and two-view chest.

213
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,311
- Hey.
- So you out of here, man?

214
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,606
Yeah, guess so.

215
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,875
Well, hopefully, it
will just be temporary.

216
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,451
Yeah, that will
be too bad for you.

217
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,582
- Good luck, Dr. Pratt.
- Thanks, Timmy.

218
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,881
- Dr. Pratt.
- Yeah?

219
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:26,220
You're gonna be okay.
God is on your side.

220
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,883
Yeah, well, let's hope so.

221
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,462
Okay, I could go with
you. I just did the overnight.

222
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,098
- I'm almost off.
- Hope, go home.

223
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,289
Get some sleep, okay?

224
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,559
Dr. Pratt?

225
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,060
What are you doing here?

226
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,897
Uh...

227
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,471
I'm going with you to your
Medical Board hearing.

228
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,076
No, I'm okay, really. Please.

229
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,475
Hope, come pull the
PICC line for the guy in 2.

230
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,842
Okay, I gotta take this.

231
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,348
What about it, Greg? The
church's support couldn't hurt.

232
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,249
You're still operating the
clinic that got me in this mess.

233
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,120
Look, I'm just trying to
better the community.

234
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,851
Yeah? What are you doing
about black-male incarceration?

235
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,494
I have a sermon on it next week.

236
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,756
Make sure you tell them
how you got me there.

237
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,093
Greg, I just wanna help.

238
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,169
My license is suspended,
I'm facing jail time.

239
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,068
I think you've helped enough.

240
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,409
So how did it go
with the counselor?

241
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,775
It wasn't what I expected,
but nothing in my life ever is.

242
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,245
What did she say?

243
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:28,446
She, uh, wants
me to enroll Alex...

244
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:33,616
in an academy for at-risk youth,
which is code word for nutjobs.

245
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,456
My kid is not a nutjob. He's
just going through some stuff.

246
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,189
Well, maybe it's some
stuff that he can't handle.

247
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,802
I know about those places.
They starve them and beat them.

248
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,130
I can't send him there.

249
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:48,901
I could help you check some out,
see if there's any that might be okay.

250
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,771
Thank you.

251
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:56,075
But I, uh, need to do it alone.

252
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,413
I'm sorry that I dragged you
into everything in the first place.

253
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,754
Don't worry about it, Sam.

254
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,380
I rea...

255
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,183
I really like you...

256
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,455
but I have to focus
on Alex right now...

257
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:15,193
and I don't have time for
any kind of a relationship.

258
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,264
All right.

259
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,701
I get it.

260
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,332
- You do?
- I do.

261
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,704
Your kid comes first.

262
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,111
So take as much
time as you need.

263
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,619
Is there any discomfort here?

264
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,812
No.

265
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,788
Do you have a boyfriend?

266
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,256
Uh...

267
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,191
- Not exactly. We're still defining it.
- Mm.

268
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,992
A girl like you doesn't
need the Internet.

269
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,603
I haven't had a valentine since
Jimmy Bachner in sixth grade. Ouch!

270
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,864
She's into S & M. If you want
her to stop, say "mayday."

271
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,531
It's the safe word.

272
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,807
Mayday. Mayday.

273
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,213
There's no right upper-quadrant
tenderness, liver is fine.

274
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,975
Let's observe
her for two hours...

275
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,052
check another CBC
and follow serial exams.

276
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,013
Hey, wait up.

277
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,487
You okay?

278
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,559
Yeah. You?

279
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,162
Yeah, came home from
Wisconsin yesterday.

280
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,458
How is Sarah holding up?

281
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,066
It's not gonna be easy.

282
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,259
I can imagine.

283
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,665
- Listen, I should've called.
- Look...

284
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,466
- I'm sorry.
- No, I should've called.

285
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,075
- The funeral was awkward, the relatives...
- It's okay.

286
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,802
- No, Neela.
- No, I'm fine.

287
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,676
I'm sure you've got
a lot on your plate.

288
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,086
I mean, you've probably got
two plates and a little saucer.

289
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,989
Yeah, a heart-shaped saucer.

290
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,156
Valentine's Day, Wednesday.
Let's have a quiet dinner, huh?

291
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,687
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Hey, guys.

292
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,057
I've got surgery.

293
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,755
Neela?

294
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,423
Is she all right?

295
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,228
I don't know.

296
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,371
What about you?

297
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:04,036
Lockhart, your comic's CBC
is back, and it ain't funny.

298
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,509
White blood count 32,000
with 60 percent blasts.

299
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,703
He has leukemia?

300
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,406
With immature white cells,
he's anemic, neutropenic.

301
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,676
Oh, great.

302
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,355
Did you see the <i>AMJ's</i>
article on integrative medicine?

303
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,235
You know the world
is falling apart...

304
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,966
when a study on Reiki
makes it into the journal. Ha-ha.

305
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,111
It's sexy, but the
Dana wouldn't touch it.

306
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,643
The design is totally flawed.

307
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,405
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

308
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:42,872
Hey.

309
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,642
Are you Dr. Williams
from Evanston?

310
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,343
Uh, no, I'm Dr. Pratt
from County.

311
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,859
Take a seat.

312
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,757
I've isolated the artery.

313
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,411
All right, Neela, clip it.
- You're letting her?

314
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,903
She knows what she's doing.

315
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,005
What are the pertinent
anatomical relationships?

316
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:12,009
Anterior to posterior, it
goes renal pelvis, renal vein...

317
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,512
and then artery, which is clipped.
- Good.

318
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,515
Any third-year medical
student could've answered that.

319
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,448
What structures
make up the cortex?

320
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,679
The what?

321
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,866
Cortex. It's that bean-shaped
thing you're cutting into.

322
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,689
You mean, like, the proximal
tubules and the distal tubules?

323
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,522
And renal corpuscles. Medulla?

324
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,124
- Loop of Henle and...
- Mm-hm.

325
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,462
Your valentine needs
a surgical consult.

326
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,867
My valentine? Gates?

327
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,873
Oh, young love is so sweet.
He's not smart enough for you.

328
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,671
- You don't even know him.
- Come on, Gates is easy math.

329
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,005
Okay, that's enough.

330
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,480
Artery is ligated.

331
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,482
<i>Dr. Dubenko, the donor kidney
is prepped and ready to go.</i>

332
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,813
Excellent timing.
Have them send it in.

333
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,648
How did Mr. Herrero do?

334
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,724
<i>No complications, minimal
blood loss. They're closing now.</i>

335
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,154
That's great.

336
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,954
Hey, hey, hey, where you going?

337
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,152
Where you going?

338
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,662
Is that where you
do the anal probe?

339
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,560
Sam, can you grab the Zosyn?

340
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,499
I liked the other room.
No need for an upgrade.

341
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,038
- Three-point-three-seven-five?
- Yeah.

342
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,368
- Simon.
- Yeah.

343
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,306
I need to talk to you
about something important.

344
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,473
I can feel it too.

345
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,448
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but I do feel the sparks. Ha-ha.

346
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,151
Your blood tests show
that you have leukemia.

347
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,926
Thank God.

348
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,001
I thought you were
gonna tell me I had cancer.

349
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,170
Leukemia is cancer of the white
blood cells in the bone marrow.

350
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,364
That's great.

351
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,942
So give me Viagra, send
me home and we are all good.

352
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,102
This isn't funny.

353
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,374
- I know.
- You're gonna need IV antibiotics.

354
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,879
I know, I know, I know.

355
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,492
I got leukemia about a year ago.

356
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:12,029
I had induction chemo and
a bone-marrow transplant...

357
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,398
and now a year later, it's back.

358
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,770
Why can't cancer be like herpes?

359
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,241
I got that once and
it never came back.

360
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,309
Herpes doesn't go away.

361
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,779
This is Zanies, doc.

362
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:38,653
You jam there, you get
invited to Second City, to <i>SNL.</i>

363
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,816
You could get a
spot on <i>Letterman.</i>

364
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:46,732
You know, my dad, he
put hubcaps on Buicks.

365
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,595
Buicks.

366
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,995
Before he died, the
last thing he told me was:

367
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,607
"Don't be another auto worker wishing
you could've, would've, should've.

368
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,970
Don't be like me, son."

369
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,447
- I have to get you started on antibiotics.
- Hey, hey.

370
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,983
I go on at 10:15. At
10:35, I'm all yours.

371
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,748
There's not gonna be a
show tonight. I'm sorry.

372
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,750
If you wanna make
it to next month...

373
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,191
I have to get a CT, a surgical
consult, and check on chemo.

374
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,762
Sorry.

375
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,007
Hey, Timmy, can you call GI
and order an EGD report for me?

376
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,198
No problem.

377
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,707
Hey, you got time for coffee?

378
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,208
Yeah. Everything good?

379
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,348
Yes. I just had the coolest
surgery and I figured we could talk.

380
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,039
Sure.

381
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,445
- Dr. Kovac?
- Hello.

382
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,951
I thought you weren't coming.

383
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,453
I heard you were short
Attendings and I got bored.

384
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,716
You okay? You look good.

385
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,949
- You good?
- Yeah.

386
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,388
What are you doing here?

387
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,361
I talked to Timmy and he said
you guys could use some help.

388
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:57,159
Um, Neela, can you look at this?
My patient Simon's CT is back.

389
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,737
Gates, some school
principal's on the phone for you.

390
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,237
Appendicitis?

391
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,966
Hello.

392
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,579
She's crying?

393
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,577
No, I understand. I understand.

394
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,010
Let me talk to her, please.

395
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,845
Look at his cecum. There's
wall thickening and distension.

396
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,043
Hey.

397
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,815
No, I told you you didn't
have to go to school.

398
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,458
I'll get you. Let me
talk to the principal.

399
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:19,925
Hello?

400
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,151
It's typhlitis.

401
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,922
Immuno-compromised
hosts can get a cecal infection.

402
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,997
- Yeah.
- Surgery?

403
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,600
Treat with IV antibiotics
unless he perforates.

404
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,235
And then, would you operate?

405
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,427
Well, normally.

406
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,702
Given his leukemia, I
doubt he'd survive, so...

407
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,701
So?

408
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,951
No, no. Thank you for calling.

409
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,548
So nothing. No surgery for him.

410
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:43,944
Okay. Thanks.

411
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,009
I'm sorry. Sarah's
having trouble at school.

412
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,088
- Gotta pick her up. I'll call you later?
- Okay.

413
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,289
Um... I'm gonna go and grab a
coffee. Do you want anything?

414
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,430
Yeah, I'll tag along.

415
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,894
These people don't have
insurance, can't afford a doctor.

416
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,899
Some can't even buy medicine.

417
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,332
That's not the point.

418
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:09,707
I thought, with some guidance,
the clinic could be a good thing.

419
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,134
Why not send them
to County Hospital?

420
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,143
Have you ever been to County?

421
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,974
Trained there 20 years ago.

422
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,483
Well, nowadays, we're
filled with critical patients.

423
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,747
People come in for a prescription
refill, they wait up to 12 hours.

424
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,390
So this was about convenience?

425
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,390
This was about helping people.

426
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,551
There are programs for that.

427
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,721
Yeah, you're right. If you're over
65 or you have dependent kids.

428
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,958
Regular folks with low-paying
jobs, they don't qualify.

429
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,831
This clinic took care of those
who fell through the cracks.

430
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:42,498
Four O.R.s, four patients, four kidneys,
all being worked on at the same time.

431
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,338
Went like clockwork. We
were this fine-tuned machine.

432
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,345
I mean, this morning, two
people were wasting away...

433
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,983
waiting for a kidney they
thought would never come.

434
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,609
Now they're upstairs with their
donors, eating Jell-O, done with dialysis.

435
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,427
- It's amazing, right?
- It's pretty cool.

436
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,793
This is what it's all about, man.
This is why I became a surgeon.

437
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,364
- Hey, Ray, you wanna give us a hand?
- I need to take this, okay?

438
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,966
I thought, "What's a
14-year-old doing with strokes?"

439
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:12,538
I figured there's gotta be more to the
story, so I went back to the parents...

440
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,037
and, yes, kid's adopted.

441
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,643
- And?
- Undiagnosed sickle beta thal.

442
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,450
- Kid didn't get screened at birth.
- Wow.

443
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,892
- Nice pickup.
- Thank you.

444
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,042
Oliver Miles, burned his hands trying to
cremate his dead cat in the microwave.

445
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,982
I tried the fireplace,
but I couldn't get it lit.

446
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,180
Partial thickness to
the hands and forearms.

447
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,188
Tachy at 120. BP, 130/78.

448
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,382
Pulse ox, only 91.

449
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,188
Okay, let's start him on
five of albuterol by neb.

450
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,888
So I thought a crematorium
is just a big oven, right?

451
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,033
Another four of IV morphine.

452
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,898
I don't know what he ate last.
It was like he just exploded.

453
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,402
Oh!

454
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,165
I got it. I got it.

455
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,002
Do you know if
someone has my cat?

456
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:55,410
ABG with carboxyhemoglobin level,
portable chest and 125 of Solu-Medrol.

457
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,015
No problem. Trauma 2.

458
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,243
I'll be there in a second.

459
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,079
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, Morris.

460
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,747
Your hand is not.

461
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,480
No, this was just an accident.

462
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,057
Go home. Rest.

463
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,093
- I promise we'll be okay.
- Yoo-hoo. Ha-ha-ha.

464
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,230
Hey, Luka. I didn't
know you were back.

465
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,421
I'm not.

466
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,931
- How are you doing?
- Better now.

467
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,194
Take care, Gracie.

468
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,506
Sure you don't
wanna wait till I get off?

469
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,269
I don't really feel like
sending you home by yourself.

470
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,843
I'm not going home, Sammy.

471
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:31,108
I'm taking a little cruise. This
way, you and Alex can bond.

472
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,615
We can bond with you here.

473
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:36,381
You need time to
sort through all this.

474
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,056
Oh, God, Grandma.

475
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:41,023
All I ever wanted to
do was raise a good kid.

476
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,025
He got the crazy gene.

477
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,757
Oh, thank God, it skips a generation.
You and I were both spared.

478
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,628
- You think?
- Ha-ha-ha.

479
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,599
It's gonna be all right, Sammy.

480
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,067
He's going through a phase.

481
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,469
It's rebellion, and then
he'll come back around.

482
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,404
The good ones always do.

483
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,441
Yeah, well, what if
he's not a good one?

484
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,308
He's yours, isn't he?

485
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,809
You're going with Timmy?

486
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,648
The lido deck awaits.

487
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:15,319
Only old people
take cruises alone.

488
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,294
Hey, Abby.

489
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,265
Which one do you like better:

490
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,802
"Thank you, folks. It
was great to be here"...

491
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:31,171
or just, "That's all, folks. Now
go home and beat the kids"?

492
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:38,011
You have an infection in the cecum where
the small and large intestines join up.

493
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,242
Maybe I'll just say:

494
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,513
"Go home and beat the kids,
but don't forget to tip the wait staff."

495
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,180
Listen, did you hear me?
What I said to you earlier?

496
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,419
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel better.
I just need you to buff me up.

497
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,531
Well, I can't, because you
have no immune system.

498
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:56,533
- You cannot fight this infection.
- I don't need my immune system tonight.

499
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,136
I need my funny bone.

500
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,469
I spoke to your oncologist.

501
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,602
You're out of treatment options.
You have a poor prognostic karyotype.

502
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,714
- Eleven-Q-23 translocation.
- Exactly.

503
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,713
And because leukemia's
recurred twice...

504
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,876
you don't have any
options for chemotherapy.

505
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,554
Okay, okay.

506
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:24,129
Okay, so just put
me in some trial.

507
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,490
Make me a guinea pig.

508
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,567
I've always wanted to run on a
wheel, drink from a drip bottle.

509
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,397
There isn't any trial.

510
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:37,208
And it's probably a matter
of weeks, not months.

511
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,744
Is there anyone
you want me to call?

512
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,405
Yeah.

513
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,516
- A cab.
- What are you doing?

514
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,553
- I'm getting the hell out of here.
- Look, you can't, Simon, you can't.

515
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,487
What do I have to lose, huh?

516
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:57,096
I don't wanna walk on the
moon or bang Barbara Bush.

517
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,321
Look...

518
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,262
I wanna get on that stage
and make an audience laugh.

519
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,698
- You can't go.
- I have to go.

520
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:13,571
Have you ever wanted to do something
that just scared the hell out of you...

521
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,681
but you knew you had to do it?

522
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,581
Well, this is it for me.

523
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,084
All right.

524
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,386
All right.

525
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:36,729
Maybe a blood transfusion will give
you some more energy. Come on.

526
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,896
I just need to be
able to stand up.

527
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,311
Or sit down.

528
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,106
Maybe I could be
a sit-down standup.

529
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,150
All right.

530
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,151
I'm gonna have to have you
sign out against medical advice.

531
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,653
If I just took
anyone's advice...

532
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,383
I'd still be checking
taillights in Detroit now.

533
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,495
And if anybody asks,
this is not my idea.

534
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,664
Shh...

535
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,426
How do you keep
track of your patients?

536
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,728
I used 5-by-7 cards
for patient information.

537
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,771
And you have a complete
H & P on a 5-by-7 card?

538
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,766
Well, we had limited records,
just the important information.

539
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,572
Where did you keep them?

540
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,837
- In a box.
- A box?

541
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,417
And if your patients had
medical care other places...

542
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:31,023
was there a system for other health
professionals to access this box?

543
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,590
No. But they could
have paged me, I guess.

544
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:38,123
Would you say your records system met
the standards the Medical Board has set?

545
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,855
Come on. We were in a church.

546
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:45,035
And did you log the drugs you
dispensed? Did you record the lot numbers?

547
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,868
- No, not fully.
- Not at all, isn't that right?

548
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,773
Are you aware that this is a violation
of the Medical Practice Act, Dr. Pratt?

549
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,711
I never claimed that this was
a full-service medical center.

550
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,875
I didn't charge any money. I
was trying to help these people.

551
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,653
And do you think you helped Edgar
Dixon when you prescribed him Renuvium?

552
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,054
GI bleeding is a common
side effect of NSAIDs.

553
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,991
The same thing could've happened to him
if he'd been prescribed the med anywhere.

554
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:15,328
But it didn't happen to him anywhere.
He went to you, and it killed him.

555
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:19,131
Are you aware that diversion of
narcotics is a felony, Dr. Pratt?

556
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,495
I didn't steal...

557
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:25,667
You don't recall providing hydrocodone
and ibuprofen to Ms. Nancy Campbell?

558
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,740
Mrs. Campbell had gallstones.

559
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:34,580
So you took a narcotic medication sample
logged into the Emergency Department.

560
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,155
This is a felony punishable
by imprisonment, doctor.

561
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,589
Yes, she was suffering.
I wanted to help her.

562
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,662
I volunteer for a free clinic
myself and we follow the rules.

563
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,232
We keep accurate records...

564
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,529
we dispense medication with
proper safety precautions...

565
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,434
and we're there for
our patients, Dr. Pratt.

566
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,599
You remember the part
about doing no harm?

567
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,278
Well, that applies
to you too, sir.

568
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,414
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
- We're in a meeting.

569
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,676
I'm Pastor William Watkins
of First Mission Baptist.

570
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,514
I'd like to speak on
behalf of Dr. Pratt.

571
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,287
Sorry they haven't taken
you back to your room yet.

572
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,259
I just got a new kidney.

573
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,798
- I'm not gonna sweat the small stuff.
- Oh.

574
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,026
Hello.

575
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,831
Happy Valentine's Day.

576
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:30,332
Nothing says "I love
you" like a bag of urine.

577
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,805
How did my donor do?

578
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,276
They're fine.

579
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:38,281
But because of everybody's privacy,
we're not really allowed to discuss it.

580
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,444
Listen, this person
saved my life.

581
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,146
I wanna see him.

582
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,291
Or her. Just once.

583
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,656
So I have a face to
think of in my prayers.

584
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,121
How is it going?

585
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:57,167
Okay, so the Democrats took
over the House and the Senate.

586
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,601
How long before the Republicans
jack up the rent and evict them?

587
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,469
- That's pretty funny.
- Why aren't you laughing, then?

588
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,440
- I am.
- No, you're not.

589
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:07,341
HemoCue is up to
11 after two units.

590
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,605
Antibiotics?

591
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,182
- Zosyn is in, tobra's infusing.
- Oh...

592
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,579
I gotta go pee-pee.

593
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,086
- That's good. Your kidneys are working.
- Aah.

594
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,791
Hello? Hello?

595
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,450
Quiet on the set.
Thank you very much.

596
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,462
Doc, I can't pee in bed.

597
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,395
I've been standing
up since I was 4.

598
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,198
Pressure's been
pretty good, 101/68.

599
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,428
All right, get him a screen.

600
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,470
- Sit up and dangle your legs.
- All right.

601
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,372
- Let us know if you're feeling dizzy.
- I'm good. I'm good.

602
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,479
I got a little flop sweat, but
that happens to the best of them.

603
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,946
- Someone's gotta go with you.
- No.

604
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,109
I got a nervous bladder
and a neurotic sphincter.

605
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,050
Seriously, it sucks.

606
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:53,215
I can't pee in public and I'm
afraid to fart in case I start a fire.

607
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:54,688
We'll wait on the other side.

608
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,884
It'll be a good test.

609
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,723
Of what?

610
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,865
The Emergency
Broadcast System. Oh...

611
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,195
That is good.

612
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,564
Man, this will work.

613
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,797
Pee is funny.

614
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,135
Bedpans, funny.

615
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,743
Catheter, not so funny.

616
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:15,141
Maybe we can downgrade
to Tele from ICU.

617
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,059
- Oh, God.
- Okay, I got him.

618
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,244
Get him on the bed.

619
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,080
Come on. One, two, three.

620
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,536
- Pressure's down, 60/40.
- Great, he's septic.

621
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,594
- Another two units of packed cells.
- Start dopamine at 10 mics.

622
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,424
- Simon, can you hear me?
- Open your eyes, come on.

623
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,042
- Hear me?
- Sats are dropping.

624
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,830
Put him on 100
percent non-rebreather.

625
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,867
Open an intubation
kit. Come on, buddy.

626
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:42,269
Come on, there's a spotlight on the
curtains and they're calling your name.

627
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,281
Hey, baby girl.

628
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,257
Dopamine at 12 mics.

629
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,588
Systolic's up to 110.

630
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,458
Good. Run in the fourth unit.

631
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,998
Hey, am I on next?

632
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,294
How is it going?

633
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,495
- What happened?
- You took a little nap.

634
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,401
Okay, little prick.

635
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,006
It's just because
it's cold in here.

636
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,542
All right, you gotta
keep that on, okay?

637
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,475
You know, sats are
a hundred... Hey.

638
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,774
Why don't we try a
nasal cannula? Five liters.

639
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:27,113
Hey, Abby, how about our deal?

640
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,309
Working on it.

641
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:29,785
What deal?

642
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:33,016
I thought we could try to buff
him up so he could perform tonight.

643
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,215
He's septic.

644
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:37,021
His BP's dropped so low, he
needs continuous IV pressors.

645
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,458
What does that mean?

646
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,499
- It means you're not going anywhere.
- Can we talk outside? Please?

647
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,531
You realize you are asking me to break the
most central rule of this entire program?

648
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,734
It's a dumb rule.

649
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,805
Why is this so important to you?

650
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,345
Because it's important to her.

651
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:58,484
Part of him is gonna be part
of me for the rest of my life.

652
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,674
Oh, come on, Manish.

653
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,083
- Okay, fine. If Dubenko finds out...
- Dr. Rasgotra, what are you doing?

654
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,247
We're just waiting on some labs.

655
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,591
What? Doesn't even make sense.

656
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,853
Couldn't you do better
than "waiting on labs"?

657
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,052
I'm not a doctor.

658
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,323
Can I talk to you for a minute?

659
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,669
- I know we're not supposed to do this...
- Yeah.

660
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:23,241
But this guy saved her life. She wanted
to be able to see him in her prayers.

661
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,274
- Yeah, Nee...
- Dr. Crenshaw...

662
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,036
Dusty, I mean.

663
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:30,705
I know it's unethical,
but it's nice...

664
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:35,377
and sometimes people like to do
things for other people, just to be nice.

665
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:41,357
Neela, have I mentioned how
well you're coming along? Yeah.

666
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,188
Okay, we're good.

667
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,527
Okay. They're right over here.

668
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,902
Which one is he?

669
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,302
He's the one on the left.

670
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:58,067
Your husband's kidney
went into the other guy.

671
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,043
Thank you.

672
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,109
Thank you.

673
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,582
You know, Morris, it's
his dream. He's gonna die.

674
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,153
He's gonna do it here, not
on some comedy-club floor.

675
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,154
Blood count's okay.
He's had antibiotics.

676
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,590
- His pressure's dopamine dependent.
- What about intermittent pressors?

677
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,058
- There isn't one.
- Epinephrine?

678
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,630
- He can't leave here.
- I could give him six EpiPens.

679
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:22,927
- Point-three mgs each. Gives himself...
- Are you out of your mind?

680
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,831
- Why not try it?
- No. I'm not doing it.

681
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,299
I'll find another Attending.

682
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,940
- I'm running the floor.
- Then get some balls.

683
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,737
- I've got balls.
- They're no good unless you use them.

684
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,569
Fine.

685
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,476
Fine, you wanna
play Superdoc? Great.

686
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:40,449
Turn off the dopamine, give him epi, show
me his pressure can stay for 20 minutes.

687
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,588
- Fine.
- Fine.

688
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:46,956
Nobody builds hospitals
or clinics in the inner city...

689
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,822
because they know these
people don't have any money.

690
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,123
They're leeches on the system.

691
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,323
So they go out to the burbs...

692
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,936
and put up medical facilities
on every corner like Starbucks...

693
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:02,006
leaving us with a hospital that's
overrun, understaffed and underpaid.

694
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,965
There are free clinics.

695
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,634
Most think they're for
people with drug problems...

696
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,939
and sexually
transmitted diseases.

697
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,311
We're talking about
regular folk here...

698
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,719
black and brown people
who just need prescriptions.

699
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:20,019
Dr. Pratt knew the system was
flawed and tried to help mend it.

700
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:24,151
I've got a whole congregation who will
attest taking away this man's license...

701
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:29,165
would just be another demerit on a
system that has already failed them.

702
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,825
The EpiPen is spring-loaded...

703
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:34,302
so all you have to do is press it
against your thigh and it fires off a shot.

704
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,375
Ah. Sounds like my
high school years.

705
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,977
Can I use it during my act?

706
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,478
As long as you pull
your pants down.

707
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,851
Luckily, that's my big finish.

708
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,715
Or should I say my
average-size finish?

709
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,887
- Oh! All right.
- His pressure dropped again.

710
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,550
- How long since his last epi?
- Six minutes.

711
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,026
Push 0.2, start dopamine,
mix up Levophed.

712
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,528
- Damn.
- This was a dumb idea.

713
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,257
Epi has a one-minute half-life.

714
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,267
I have a body part
with that same problem.

715
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,767
Ha-ha. That was a good joke.

716
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,201
BP, 89/64.

717
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,899
You know what the best
thing about getting leukemia is?

718
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,520
Hang another liter of saline
and a unit of packed cells.

719
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,036
Everybody comes to see you.

720
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:20,850
The guys from the plant came,
my ex-soccer coach came.

721
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,784
Even Father Dunleavy came.

722
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,948
Took three orderlies to get
him out of the Pedes ward.

723
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,557
That's a keeper.

724
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:33,187
You know, I was
gonna kill tonight...

725
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,393
and instead, I'm dying.

726
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,366
Sats are dropping,
92 on five liters.

727
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,071
I would've left your
name at the door...

728
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,369
but something tells me
I'm not gonna make it.

729
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,975
Finish your act.

730
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,883
- Hey.
- Hey, I, uh, bought you some food.

731
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,117
Thank you. That's sweet.

732
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,090
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

733
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,254
- Sorry I couldn't talk earlier.
- Oh, it's okay, forget it.

734
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,797
Everything all right?

735
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,231
Yeah, I just, uh,
came by to say hi.

736
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,461
Hi.

737
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,570
Uh... Is Sarah okay?

738
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,838
We're just sitting down to
watch a movie. Wanna join us?

739
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:23,478
Uh... No. I'm not gonna stay.

740
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,311
Listen, can I talk
to you a second?

741
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,843
Yeah.

742
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,287
I've been wanting
to tell you this.

743
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,259
You remember the night we
were out there with Meg in the car?

744
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,153
At one point...

745
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,803
she grabbed me and
pulled me down to her...

746
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:50,169
and she said, "Tony,
Sarah is yours."

747
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,940
"Sarah is yours."

748
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,506
Is it possible?

749
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,450
It was 13 years ago.

750
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,182
You know, we were messed
up, the three of us, high.

751
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:11,352
Keith would disappear for
days and, you know, Meg and I...

752
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,897
It just happened.

753
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,294
It wasn't a secret.

754
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,036
So you mean she
could be your...?

755
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,678
And that never
occurred to you before?

756
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:36,811
Yeah. I mean, I thought about it
at first, but then years went by...

757
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,423
and I just believed what
everyone else believed.

758
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,822
- Tony?
- That she was Keith's.

759
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,886
I should go.

760
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,396
That's who I used to be.
It's not who I am anymore.

761
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,033
No, it's okay. It's no big deal.

762
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,998
Go watch your movie.

763
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,701
You know you
didn't have to do this.

764
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:04,043
Well, you know, that whole
black-male incarceration bit got to me.

765
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:05,942
You'll be okay, Greg.

766
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:11,545
There are laws in this
world that we have to follow...

767
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,419
but then there are God's laws.

768
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,195
He'll have the last word
in this. Just you watch.

769
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,724
- Hey.
- Hey.

770
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,958
- What are you doing here?
- You covered for me.

771
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,726
The least I can
do is support you.

772
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,894
All right, come on, sit down.

773
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,650
Dr. Pratt.

774
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,624
The board finds that you have
violated the Medical Practice Act...

775
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,957
and believes that these transgressions
are adequate justification...

776
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,100
to suspend your medical license.

777
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,938
However, in light of your
attempt to help your community...

778
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:04,234
we have decided to put
you on probation for one year.

779
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,100
Practice will be monitored...

780
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,304
you will need to perform 100
hours of community service.

781
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,814
Perhaps finding a way to legalize
a certain church-based clinic...

782
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,646
would be a good
use of your time?

783
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,987
Thank you.

784
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,021
Thank you. Thank you so much.

785
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,664
Dr. Pratt.

786
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,855
Hey, how did I do?

787
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,223
You brought the house down.

788
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,033
Thank you.

789
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,370
You've been such
a great audience.

790
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,574
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

791
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,084
I decided to put
our CDs on the iPod.

792
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,052
- We don't need all these anymore.
- I need to talk.

793
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,583
- Is everything okay?
- Um...

794
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:37,594
You know, when you were on the roof,
I was thinking about what I would do...

795
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:44,259
if Joe didn't have a father
and if we didn't have each other.

796
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:49,097
I realized if we could get through this,
we could probably get through anything.

797
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,133
What's going on?

798
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,302
I mean, have you ever
wanted something so much...

799
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:58,746
but it scared the
hell out of you?

800
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,119
See, here's the thing. I just...
Well, I changed my mind...

801
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,919
and I was wondering if
you could ask me again.

802
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:11,652
What?

803
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,866
Ask me again.

804
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,834
Ask me to marry you.
