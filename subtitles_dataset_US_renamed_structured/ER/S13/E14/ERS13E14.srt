00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,901
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,542
- The medical board called me.
- I bet they did.

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,543
They're issuing a letter for
us to cease our drug program.

4
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:15,444
Dr. Pratt is under arrest. Violation
of the Controlled Substance Act.

5
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,682
You could sleep here.

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,548
I don't know where we are, Tony,
but you have to do something.

7
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,785
I think she's dying.
GATES <i>Sarah.</i>

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,019
<i>Sarah.</i>

9
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,027
Call your husband.

10
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,470
Call him.

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,196
Call him.

12
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,406
I just called him.
He didn't pick up.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,208
Shh.

14
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,112
Just try again.

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,078
I have no idea where he is.

16
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,376
I don't even know what
he's doing right now.

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,281
Try again.

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,985
Mr. Ames, why don't you just go?

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,120
Okay? Just please go.

20
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,557
And I'm sure Luka will
be happy to talk to you...

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,891
about whatever it is you
want some other time, okay?

22
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:06,930
What I want?

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,367
Whatever the reason it is
you're here, just go, okay?

24
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,133
Please go and there won't
be any trouble. I promise.

25
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,805
Trouble?

26
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,139
Trouble?

27
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,517
- You don't know what trouble is.
- Oh, God.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,083
Abby? Abby, you call Luka now.

29
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,637
Sammy.

30
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,471
Sammy, you smell that?

31
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,738
- Something's on fire, Sammy.
- What?

32
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:53,937
Mom.

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,138
Alex?

34
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,908
Mom, help.

35
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,110
Son of a bitch. Sammy.

36
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,193
- Oh, my God.
- Mom, wake up. You have to wake up.

37
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,685
Someone, please.

38
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,524
- You have to wake up.
- What happened?

39
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,633
- I love you.
- What happened?

40
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,325
Hey, Meg.

41
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,994
- She got dizzy and pulled over.
- What happened? Meg.

42
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:22,006
- Stridorous resps. Let's lie her down.
- What did you take, Meg?

43
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,643
- Bunch of stuff. NEELA:
It's definitely ETOH.

44
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,336
- What else did you take?
- Nothing.

45
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,880
- What are you talking about?
- Sarah, quiet.

46
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,343
- What, Meg? What did you take?
- This Alpro.

47
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,147
Alprazolam?

48
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,814
- Oh, works fast.
- What is this?

49
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,054
- Amitriptyline.
- That's her pick-me-up medicine.

50
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,560
She needs a cardiac monitor.

51
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,664
How long you been
on the antidepressants?

52
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,665
There should be a
lot more pills in here.

53
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,463
Whoa. Roll her, roll her.
- Go ahead.

54
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,637
Hold on, Meg. Hold on.

55
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,854
No need for this. He
hasn't broken any law.

56
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,210
You'll be able to post
bail for him in a few hours.

57
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,247
This is not a criminal matter.
It's just a misunderstanding.

58
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,248
Yeah, I never heard that one.

59
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,751
Hey. Uh, sorry I
couldn't pick up before.

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,718
I'm at the police station.

61
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,915
<i>- Luka.</i>
- Are you okay?

62
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,251
Can you come home now?

63
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,390
No, it's gonna be a couple of
hours. Pratt's been arrested.

64
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,860
You need to come home now.

65
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,932
- What's wrong?
<i>- Nothing, I just...</i>

66
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,563
It's just something happened
and we need to discuss it.

67
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:24,864
- Is Joe okay?
<i>- He's fine.</i>

68
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,030
<i>- Just come home.</i>
- Tell me what's the matter.

69
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,039
I need to see you.

70
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,942
Okay. I'll... I'll
be right there.

71
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,921
Thank you.

72
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,954
I appreciate that.

73
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,770
Come on through. Go, go.

74
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,178
- Go.
- Go!

75
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,555
Move the cars. Let's go.

76
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,911
Keep moving.

77
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,484
Hurry up.

78
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,417
Move away from the building
so our people can work.

79
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,766
People are... Sammy.

80
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,419
Where's Alex? We
should all stay together.

81
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,062
She went back in to get him.
They must be around here.

82
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,165
- They're still inside?
- No, they must be around here.

83
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,252
- If you can walk...
- Where are they?

84
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,997
If you can walk, head to an
ambulance to be assessed.

85
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,332
Command, give me EMS plus
one at 1215 Granger Avenue.

86
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:38,502
- Sammy, Alex.
- It's my granddaughter, Sam Taggart.

87
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,979
How's he doing?

88
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,519
Who?

89
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,422
Joe.

90
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,723
He's fine.

91
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,961
Please?

92
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,199
My daughter was easy...

93
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,365
but my little boy, I told
you, he was always colicky.

94
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,273
Didn't sleep through the
night for the first three months.

95
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,538
How about Joe?

96
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,046
He sleeps fine.

97
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,612
Grew big since the park.

98
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,949
- They grow up fast...
- Look, what do you want?

99
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,051
I wanna talk to Luka.

100
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,282
Like this?

101
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,060
This happened to the both of us.

102
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,527
Him and me.

103
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,726
So I see no reason why we
should go through it alone.

104
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,632
It's over.

105
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,570
Is that what you think?

106
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,015
You're this successful
doctor, right?

107
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,881
You're smart.

108
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,417
You're beautiful.

109
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,284
You got the man, you got
the baby, you got everything.

110
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,923
So don't take it personal
when I say to you...

111
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,293
you have no idea
where I am right now.

112
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,594
You're wrong.

113
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,007
- You think so?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,809
I think I know exactly
where you are right now.

115
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,049
You know, nine years ago, I...

116
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,782
My marriage was over, my
mother was in a mental institution...

117
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,086
for the seventh or 10th time.

118
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,753
I don't know, and I drank a lot.

119
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,762
A lot.

120
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,263
And I had reached
this... You know what, I...

121
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:50,104
One morning, I woke up in this apartment,
and I had no idea how I got there.

122
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,440
Next to some guy I didn't
even remember meeting.

123
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,242
And he was going through
my stuff, looking for money...

124
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,351
so he and his
buddy can get a fix.

125
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,579
So I ran out of there,
and I went downstairs...

126
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,488
I tried to get a cab, but I
had no idea where I was...

127
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,993
and it was 5:00 in the morning,
and there were no cars, so I just...

128
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,361
I just sat down on the stoop, and I
just waited for something to happen.

129
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:24,011
And at that moment, I'm telling
you, I knew, I mean, I was positive...

130
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,176
that happiness was something
I was never gonna find.

131
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,152
- You getting deep on me now?
- No.

132
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,957
I am just trying to tell you
that things can change.

133
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,684
They can get better. Even
if you don't see it, they can.

134
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,295
Do you have any bourbon?

135
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,894
Dr. Gates, long time no see.

136
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,862
- We need suction and an intubation kit.
- I got it. I got it.

137
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,558
Jenny didn't tell you it was me.

138
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,227
Why you think we took our
time? This lady's messed up.

139
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,236
- It's Meg.
- Hey, I'm sorry, man, I didn't know.

140
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,710
- You gonna give her medicine?
- Take Sarah to the rig.

141
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,312
- I wanna stay here.
- I need room to work on your mom.

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,073
- Go to the rig.
- I wanna stay here.

143
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,308
Pulse is thready. Dumar,
let's get a move on.

144
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,577
We doing this here?

145
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,745
- Lower this to transfer her.
- I need to tell you...

146
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,150
Don't talk, okay?

147
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,186
Now, we're gonna place
a tube in your throat.

148
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,419
It's gonna help
you breathe, okay?

149
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,496
Closer.

150
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,262
Sarah.

151
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,999
She's yours, Tony.

152
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,769
She's yours.

153
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,906
Gates, come on.

154
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,275
Let's get her on
the gurney, man.

155
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,253
What? You too
good to talk to me?

156
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,698
No.

157
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,636
Hm.

158
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,205
You don't belong here, huh?

159
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,699
No.

160
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,138
Do you?

161
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,642
What they got you for?

162
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,778
- It's complicated, man.
- So now you calling me stupid.

163
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,779
I helped some people get
some medications they needed.

164
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,723
Medications? Like drugs?

165
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,557
Pharmaceutical, yeah.

166
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,530
See, coz? He belong.
We both the same.

167
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,162
Getting drugs to
people who need them.

168
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,036
Greg?

169
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,673
Oh, great.

170
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,504
Just in the nick of time.

171
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,805
My spiritual advisor.

172
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,915
It's been too long, Ben.

173
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,106
Where are they?

174
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,481
Maybe she went out the back way,
Gracie, or went up through the roof.

175
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,849
Would you ask them
again? Ask them.

176
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,159
Chief.

177
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,851
- Chief, please.
- Hold on, sir.

178
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,656
My friend and her son are in
2B, they haven't come down.

179
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,196
We're doing every...

180
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,669
Hey, hey, up here.

181
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,572
I got a little boy and a
man with extensive burns.

182
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,210
He's got smoke inhalation, no
thermal burns, sat 94 percent.

183
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,778
Pulse ox, chest x-ray,
carboxyhemoglobin level.

184
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,381
I'll put him in Exam 2. Let
me take care of your cut.

185
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,590
No, I'll do it, Dawn.

186
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:52,677
That'll need suturing.
I'll get to you next.

187
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,378
- I'm gonna go check on Grandma.
- Fine.

188
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,217
- Is Gracie okay?
- Yeah, she's on her way in with Ben.

189
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,360
Ben who? Ben the murse?

190
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,496
- He was over for dinner.
- I'll fix up Alex.

191
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,722
You come back when
you clean up that arm.

192
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,298
Burns on face, chest and arms.

193
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,128
- Pulse ox?
- Low 90's, stridorous.

194
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,896
He needs a line, chem
panel, CBC, lactate, CO.

195
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,834
My neighbor, slept
through everything.

196
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,737
- Mr. Owens, you're gonna be okay.
- How did this thing start?

197
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,140
I'm not sure. Alex said
he knocked over a candle.

198
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,671
Have somebody look at that.

199
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,475
All right, let's get him
exposed, and check the airway.

200
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,352
Hey.

201
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,498
Sorry it took me so
long. The traffic was...

202
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:39,724
Hey, hey.

203
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,163
I got fired.

204
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,168
What are you doing here?

205
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,607
You said if ever I need
anything, I should give you a call.

206
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,270
So this is my call.

207
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,745
Okay.

208
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,577
What do you need?

209
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,275
To talk.

210
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,647
To be listened to.

211
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,185
Abby, take the baby upstairs.

212
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,790
- No need for that.
- Hey, Curtis.

213
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,621
- Luka.
- Take the baby upstairs.

214
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,457
They can stay right here,
because we're going for a ride.

215
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,055
- All right.
- No, don't.

216
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,929
No, it's okay.

217
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,468
- My car's right around the corner.
- No, please.

218
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,299
- Luka, don't go. You can't go, Luka...
- Hey, Abby, hey.

219
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,378
Abby.

220
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,445
Thanks for the talk.

221
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,739
<i>911 operator.</i>

222
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,066
There was a man in my
apartment with a gun...

223
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,734
and he's taken my husband.
His name is Curtis Ames.

224
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,179
I can't find a pulse. - V-fib.

225
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,376
- Starting compressions.
- Charge to 360, amp of epi and bicarb.

226
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,384
Charged. Let them
know we have arrest.

227
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,181
Back off. Back off.

228
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,822
Clear.

229
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,015
Still in fib.

230
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,161
We're gonna take your
mom in the ambulance.

231
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,297
- You go with Neela.
- I wanna stay with you.

232
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,223
- I need you to do this.
- I wanna stay.

233
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,027
- We're gonna follow them.
- No.

234
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,396
Sarah, go with Neela now!
- Stop!

235
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,970
Just go straight.

236
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,704
I can help you find another
job, if that's the problem.

237
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,555
Look, do you need
money? I have money.

238
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,214
Turn right, right over here.

239
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,057
Come on. Talk to me, Ames.

240
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,093
I thought that's
what you wanted.

241
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,529
Just pull up here.

242
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
Park it.

243
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,396
Turn off the lights.

244
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,273
- You have no idea how he got in?
- No.

245
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,410
Look, why aren't you looking
for him? I told them I saw the car.

246
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,102
- '96 station wagon, light tan?
- Yeah, I think so, yeah.

247
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,942
- Ran a check, got one registered to him.
- So you know him?

248
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,140
His history? Ames.

249
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,386
You know, I told the cops this.

250
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,748
He had a stroke.

251
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,549
He lost the use of his left arm.

252
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,747
There was a lawsuit.

253
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,950
Okay. I'll get somebody
on that right away.

254
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,457
Okay. Louise, could you take
him to your place for a little while?

255
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,657
- Sure, Abby, we'll be fine.
- Thanks.

256
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,227
Now, listen, you
need to catch up.

257
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,736
There's a medical record
with information on it.

258
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,272
Numbers, addresses,
probably a psych assessment.

259
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,467
- Where?
- County General. I can get it.

260
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,805
Mr. Owens, you doing okay?
- Throw me a Cordis.

261
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,471
We don't wanna do a
subclavian through this eschar.

262
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,150
The fire.

263
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,218
It started downstairs.

264
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,186
Femoral? MORRIS:
Too much infection risk.

265
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,313
- In my apartment.
- How?

266
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,483
- I'm not sure. MORRIS:
Proximal arm is spared.

267
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,826
I think it was a candle.

268
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,158
I am so sorry.

269
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,325
Give me the ultrasound.
I'll cannulate the basilic vein.

270
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,101
Can we give him something for the pain?
- Oh, there it is.

271
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,297
All right.

272
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,136
Morphine, 5 milligrams, IV.

273
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,676
His nasal hairs are singed.
Should we go fiberoptic?

274
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,178
No, not enough time. His
airway is already swollen.

275
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,340
We gotta get in
before it closes.

276
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,522
She's gonna be okay, isn't she?

277
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,220
Tony's gonna fix her?

278
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:35,634
Your mom took too much of a
medicine that can be bad for the heart.

279
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,328
They're trying to
get it started again.

280
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,035
Tony can fix her.

281
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,645
I can't see the cords.
Too much edema.

282
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,146
- Pulse ox, 78.
- Help me, Ray. We don't wanna crike.

283
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,195
- I'm working on it. MORRIS:
Need more pressure?

284
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,020
No, no. Anatomy's too distorted.

285
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,883
Okay, damn it.
Let's go, crike tray.

286
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,492
- Wait, hold on.
- Sat's down to 70.

287
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,494
Watch carefully,
okay? Look for bubbles.

288
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,226
This'll force the air back to the trachea.
Bubbles show where to place the tube.

289
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,563
- That works?
- Once in a while.

290
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,037
Whoa, that's really
good. I can see it.

291
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,167
Well, push that baby home.
- All right.

292
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,538
Bag him.

293
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,039
You got it. We're in.

294
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,681
- Color change.
- Oh, Sam is the man.

295
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:30,222
Mr. Owens, take it easy, okay?
We're taking real good care of you.

296
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,421
- Ben went to find us some clothes.
- Oh, good.

297
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,496
Mr. Owens all right?

298
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,926
Yeah. I think he's gonna be.

299
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,034
He's a nice man. He helped
me with the groceries...

300
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,261
but he drinks too much.

301
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,770
What happened tonight, Sammy?

302
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,202
Uh...

303
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,201
- What did Alex say?
- Nothing.

304
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,504
He won't talk to me.

305
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,605
Well, I don't know
what happened.

306
00:16:55,815 --> 00:17:00,219
But if it is what I think, it
scares the hell out of me.

307
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,614
Heard the cops took
Pratt on a walk of shame.

308
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,521
If they did, they got it wrong.
Pratt's as good as they come.

309
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,786
Get away from my desk.

310
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,259
Sorry, man, I'm just asking.

311
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,789
- Frank?
- Keep it to yourself.

312
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,560
- Frank.
- You're either late or early.

313
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,261
I need you to call up to Records.
Tell them to pull Curtis Ames' chart.

314
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,597
- Curtis Ames?
- Just do it.

315
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,831
- You know, this late...
- Frank, just do it.

316
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,646
- Who lives here, Curtis?
- Quiet. Shh, shh. Quiet.

317
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,292
I've had a gun
pointed at me before.

318
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,926
I know you're not the
type of man to use that.

319
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,496
You see?

320
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,870
I used it.

321
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,176
There's Cheryl. There she is.

322
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:08,911
Remember Cheryl?

323
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,386
Mm.

324
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,662
She remarried in October.

325
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,488
Banker.

326
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,699
Investments or something. I
don't know about that kind of stuff.

327
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:30,138
But my daughter's
recital was tonight.

328
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,039
They asked me not
to come this time.

329
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,213
Said we would try rotating.

330
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,722
You know, at the
movies last week...

331
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,226
they wanted to know if it
would be okay with me...

332
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,523
if they call this new guy...

333
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,557
dad.

334
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,301
I mean, they would still call me
that, but they just wanted to know...

335
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:04,706
if it was okay if they
call this new guy that too.

336
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,404
I know she put them up to it.

337
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,242
I know she put them up to it.

338
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,343
I know she...

339
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,394
But...

340
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,864
the fact is...

341
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,102
I think they like the idea.

342
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,878
They're just confused. You
can help them understand.

343
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,050
Pretty soon, they'll
be going to bed.

344
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:58,487
He's gonna be screwing my wife with
my children sleeping in the next room.

345
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,236
She gets to...

346
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,206
To move on, huh?

347
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,446
She gets to be happy.

348
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,654
Guys like you and me...

349
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,293
we gotta live with it.

350
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,972
She's gone, man.

351
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,332
There's nothing else we can do.

352
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,448
Please give me
a little more time.

353
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,741
Can you spare the room?

354
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,577
Of course.

355
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,754
You take what you need.

356
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,756
Another round of epi and bicarb.

357
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,415
Coming up.

358
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,161
Sarah, you wanna
talk to your mom?

359
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,806
Is her heart beating now?

360
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:20,137
Well, we're giving her
more medicine, so...

361
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,873
Is she getting better?

362
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,077
I don't know.

363
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,583
Can she hear me?

364
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,028
I'm sure she'd like
to hear your voice.

365
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,596
Know that you're here with her.

366
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,228
Is she gonna die?

367
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,413
Mom.

368
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,227
Mom, I'm here.

369
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:19,265
I'm sorry you're sick and I'm
sorry that you've been so sad.

370
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,403
And I'm sorry if
I've been a pain...

371
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:26,774
but, Mom, you gotta
fight right now, okay?

372
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,443
You always said
we were survivors.

373
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,880
Didn't you say that?

374
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,753
So please, Mommy.

375
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,755
Please.

376
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,428
You gotta survive this.

377
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,955
I know you can do it.

378
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,797
I know you can do it.

379
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,843
Thanks for bailing me out. I'll
make sure you get your money soon.

380
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,036
Greg.

381
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,613
I told you to shut it down.

382
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,079
Why didn't you do that?

383
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,448
- Because the day hadn't come yet.
- What is that supposed to mean?

384
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,886
- I'll tell you about my favorite prophet.
- This about your bookie?

385
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,618
Isaiah knew when the Spirit of God
would unburden the brokenhearted.

386
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,286
Give strength to the meek, open the
prisons so the captives could go free.

387
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:21,798
You sound like the love child of
David Koresh and Al Sharpton.

388
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:26,337
- You realize that, right?
- Greg, you're looking for something.

389
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,531
I could see that the first time
you walked into my church.

390
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,737
You need to feel like
you belong to a family.

391
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,347
Well, we are your family.

392
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:41,545
You know, Isaiah's all fine, but I
prefer the one about the prodigal son.

393
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,423
Even he came back eventually.

394
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,493
Don't hold your breath.

395
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:55,858
Sarah, we've been working on your mom
and giving her medicine for over an hour.

396
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,832
- It's not working.
- Fix her.

397
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,098
That's why you wanted to be a
doctor, so you could fix people.

398
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,173
Sometimes you can't fix
people if they've taken too...

399
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,676
Shut up!

400
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,677
Go away. Why are you even here?

401
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,373
We don't want you here.
She doesn't want you here.

402
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,018
- Sarah.
- We don't want you!

403
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,953
It's okay.

404
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,122
I'm sorry.

405
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,855
I'm so sorry.

406
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,867
Now I'm gonna stop CPR.

407
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:43,313
If her heartbeat comes
back, that's good.

408
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,312
But if it doesn't, that
means your mom has died.

409
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,118
Are you ready?

410
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,841
No, Tony.

411
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,213
No. You can't let
this happen, Tony.

412
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:24,790
No. Come on, Mom. You gotta
wake up. You gotta wake up.

413
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,024
No.

414
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,219
Mom.

415
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,662
You gotta wake up.

416
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,034
Mom.

417
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,308
Tony, you have to do something.

418
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,080
Mom!

419
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,122
Mom.

420
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,331
Mom.

421
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,799
Tony.

422
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:20,571
Okay.

423
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,476
Okay, let's go.

424
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,585
Curtis, please. Just tell
me, what are we doing?

425
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,015
You're gonna like this.

426
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,122
I'm gonna show you something
that's really beautiful, all right?

427
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,314
Let's go.

428
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,323
Let's go. Come on, come on.

429
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:50,704
Ha.

430
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,309
I should have said...

431
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:03,855
that this... This, uh... This
could have been beautiful, right?

432
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,689
Is this yours?

433
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,321
Was.

434
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,395
I bought it four years ago.

435
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,759
We figured...

436
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:20,703
we'd live on the bottom two
floors, and then we'd rent out the top.

437
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,198
Started working on it.

438
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:24,870
Fixing it up.

439
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,172
My own two hands.

440
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,916
Those spindles on the staircase.

441
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,825
Yeah, that's... That's me.

442
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,223
The paneling...

443
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:51,067
took me two months
before I had to stop.

444
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,000
You still own it?

445
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:59,608
I held on to it even after
everything that happened.

446
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:09,916
I tried to keep working on
it, but it just took me so long.

447
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:15,588
You know, I couldn't be
as detailed as I used to be.

448
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,462
I gave Cheryl half
the market value...

449
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,529
in the divorce.

450
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,701
You know, I was stupid,
because I don't know...

451
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,606
why I didn't just sell it.

452
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,617
Now the bank owns it.

453
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,363
There was a time where I...

454
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:59,063
I thought that we
understood each other.

455
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,076
That we were...

456
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,937
We were hearing each other.

457
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,919
You know, like that
time up by the river.

458
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,257
You were just
talking, weren't you?

459
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,094
Because you
never really felt me.

460
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,596
I don't know what else you
expected, what you want.

461
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,165
Tell me what you want.

462
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,001
Are you a righty
or are you a lefty?

463
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,601
Why?

464
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,775
I'm right-handed.
I'm right-handed.

465
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,073
Why?

466
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:47,652
I want you to put your
hand in that vise there.

467
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,015
I want you to feel that.

468
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,157
No.

469
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:56,990
Do it.

470
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,064
Look, Curtis. Look,
you're confused.

471
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,830
I know you're upset.

472
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,171
Do it.

473
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,746
Tighten it.

474
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,049
Curtis, look...

475
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,054
Tighten it.

476
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,760
<i>Sighting of suspect's
vehicle outside a residence...</i>

477
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,998
<i>formerly owned by suspect,
located at 321 Parkdale.</i>

478
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,234
Get over there, help secure the
scene. I'm gonna pick up Mrs. Ames.

479
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,902
- Did they find them?
- Not yet, just the car.

480
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:24,049
- All right, I'm going with you.
<i>- That's 321 Parkdale.</i>

481
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,309
<i>Possible shots fired.</i>

482
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,477
Best thing for you is to stay put
until we have more information.

483
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,088
- Did she say shots fired?
- I know this can't be easy.

484
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,248
- No.
- I'll send an officer back, stay with...

485
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,587
Are you kidding me?
I'm not just gonna wait.

486
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,754
I'm sorry. You
need to trust us now.

487
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,904
It hurts, doesn't it?

488
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,317
Don't be so easy on yourself.

489
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,094
Tell me how it feels.

490
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,563
Tell me what it's doing to you.

491
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,769
I can, uh...

492
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,978
I can feel, uh...

493
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,518
crushing of the
metacarpal heads.

494
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,018
Uh...

495
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:13,087
The digital nerves
being compressed.

496
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:17,426
I'm losing sensation.

497
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,431
Uh, motor control.

498
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,692
You know what I mean.

499
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,234
- You know what I mean?
- I don't.

500
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,004
- You know...?
- I don't. I don't.

501
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,038
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

502
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:35,238
- Stop, please. Hey.
- You tell me how it feels.

503
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,677
Just stop it.

504
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,378
Come on, Luka.

505
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,611
Come on.

506
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,312
You see people
in pain every day.

507
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,223
You tell me how it feels.

508
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,259
Oh, son of a bitch.

509
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,828
See, do you feel me now?

510
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:02,907
What do you want from me, huh?
What do you want from me, huh? Ah!

511
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,854
I can't...

512
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,758
do it without my hands.

513
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,018
I'm a doctor.

514
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,158
I have a wife, a child.

515
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,922
Ha. Hey... It's hard, right?

516
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,998
Is that what you want, huh?

517
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,000
Is that what you want?

518
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,832
I won't be able to
take care of my family.

519
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,309
I won't be able to do anything.
I'm nothing, okay? I'm nothing.

520
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,616
You wanna kill me? Huh?

521
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,343
Is that what you want? You
wanna kill me, kill me now.

522
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,115
Now you get it. Now
you're saying something.

523
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,350
Now you finally
understand a little.

524
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,564
Get the hell out of here now!

525
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,563
This is my house!

526
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,328
You get the hell out of here!

527
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,693
Hey, hey, hey.
Lady, hey. Get back.

528
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,229
I gotta talk to somebody,
tell somebody I knew him.

529
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,696
I work in... Hey.

530
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:35,890
Hey. Hey.

531
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,263
I work in County. I
know Curtis Ames.

532
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,405
- Just let her go.
- Okay.

533
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,940
I brought his medical record.
It's the reason why he's doing this.

534
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,101
- There's a lot of info...
- Who are you again?

535
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,712
- That's my husband in there with him.
- Your husband?

536
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,078
Yes. We both work at County and I
thought that maybe your negotiator...

537
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,412
Yeah, move in.

538
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,311
No, I'm good.

539
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,948
Thanks. I don't think
this is gonna help.

540
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,159
Four-six, four-five, clear.

541
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,863
Somebody was here.
Signs of a struggle.

542
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,772
<i>This is Chopper 1. We
got two men on the roof.</i>

543
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,348
<i>One of them's armed.</i>

544
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,782
All right. I want that
chopper to back off.

545
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,912
Tell that pilot to get
some altitude now.

546
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,360
Does Kovac have a
cell phone with him?

547
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,693
I tried to call him before,
but he didn't answer.

548
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,130
What does he want?

549
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,325
What does he want?

550
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,495
If he wanted to kill Luka, he
could have shot him an hour ago.

551
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,840
Well, maybe he wanted
a bigger audience.

552
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,769
Forty-six, twenty-five
Charlie, what's your status?

553
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,437
<i>Securing second floor.</i>

554
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,379
Curtis, it's time to let this go.
- My...

555
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,679
The hospital said it.

556
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,012
Court said it.

557
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,488
My damn lawyers said it.

558
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,160
Even my own wife.

559
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,190
"Curtis, let it go. Let it go."

560
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:24,808
You know what it's
like to lose everything?

561
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,475
It's not just about the arm.

562
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:34,016
It's about feeling
like everything...

563
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:38,885
that ever made you a
man has been taken away.

564
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,024
How you supposed to fix that?

565
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,197
How am I supposed
to just let this go?

566
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,368
Hey.

567
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,237
This is probably
them again, Curtis.

568
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,953
Yeah, this is Kovac.

569
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,926
We're both here.

570
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,993
Yeah, hold on.

571
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,701
It's the police. They
wanna talk to you.

572
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,603
Just put it on speaker.

573
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:35,410
Mr. Ames, this is Deputy
Superintendent John Valentine.

574
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,142
We'd like to resolve this quickly
and peacefully, so first off...

575
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,979
is there anything
we can get you?

576
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,484
Yeah.

577
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,749
Could you just go away?

578
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,958
Can you just leave me alone?

579
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,052
Just go. Could
you go over there?

580
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:52,822
Just go over there.

581
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,662
<i>Curtis, we both have families.</i>

582
00:38:56,434 --> 00:39:00,098
Children we love,
a lot to live for.

583
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,900
<i>- This won't solve anything.</i>
- Mr. Ames?

584
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,741
<i>The numbness happened twice.</i>

585
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,410
So it was TIA, right?

586
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,843
- Right?
- Yes.

587
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,646
<i>But you didn't consider that.
Should have considered that.</i>

588
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,112
I thought it was from
sleeping on the gurney.

589
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,950
We've been through all this.

590
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:23,458
Intermittent numbness
is associated with TIA.

591
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:26,496
You should have considered
that, thought about my heart.

592
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,997
It was noisy. I explained that.

593
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,127
That's because you
listened with a steth.

594
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,829
But the standard of care
would have been a cardiac echo.

595
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,975
- It doesn't matter.
- It does!

596
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,642
<i>It does!</i>

597
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,571
Because...

598
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:48,446
you would have seen
the patent foramen ovale...

599
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,113
and you would have
pulled the central line!

600
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:57,058
Yes, okay? Yes,
yes, yes. You're right.

601
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,825
You were right all along. I blew
it. I missed it. I missed the murmur.

602
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,162
And I'm sorry for that.

603
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:11,874
Why didn't you ever
just say that, man?

604
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm saying it now, okay?

605
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,982
Maybe I needed
all this to... I...

606
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,749
I'm not innocent. I'm just...

607
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,915
Look, if I can take it all
back, if I can fix it, but I can't.

608
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,027
Okay? I can't. I just can't.

609
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,864
I can't.

610
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,529
Luka.

611
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:42,765
<i>Mr. Ames?</i>

612
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,243
<i>Mr. Ames?</i>

613
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,357
Curtis.

614
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,471
Who fired? There was
no command to fire.

615
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,114
<i>It came from the roof.</i>

616
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,042
Grab her.

617
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,913
- Get up on the roof now.
- No, no.

618
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,286
Go, go, go. ABBY: Let me go.

619
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,223
All units, I want
status reports now.

620
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:42,128
<i>Forty-five Charlie, we have a
man down. We have a man down.</i>

621
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,393
Oh, God. No, no.

622
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,662
You have to let me go.
Listen, I'm an ER doc.

623
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,396
Just let me go.
