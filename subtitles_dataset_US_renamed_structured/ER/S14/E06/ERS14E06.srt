00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,268
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,910
This disease is
invariably fatal.

3
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,636
- Derrek Lee.
- For you, buddy.

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,371
The whole team signed it.

5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,778
Written boards are in a
week. Failure's not an option.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,669
We quiz each other
every day, we'll nail it.

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:21,016
- How soon can you fly home?
- It's gonna be at least another week.

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,123
- Another week?
- You're right, I'm 19.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,656
- Nineteen?
- No way.

10
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,123
I started college when I was 12.

11
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,092
If you've decided you're not
an alcoholic, I can't help you.

12
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,326
If you are, I'll be your sponsor
again. Let me know what you decide.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,778
- Abby.
- Just a second.

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,189
Crap.

15
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,825
Med Staff office says
you can't work tonight.

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,022
- Right. See you.
- I'm serious.

17
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,563
- Banned until you deal with your charts.
- Excuse me, Frank.

18
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,066
Told them I was gonna sling you
over my shoulder and carry you myself.

19
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,229
- Sling me over your shoulder?
- You're backed up six months.

20
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,465
Good. You're here.

21
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,203
Bringing in a guy out
of his head, combative.

22
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,538
- We could use the extra set of hands.
- Ativan?

23
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,307
They gave him 10 migs
already, hasn't touched him.

24
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,915
Abby, don't go out there.

25
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,153
I think Frank has a crush on me.

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,313
And go see the Med Staff. They're
bugging me about your charts.

27
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,651
- Nemo Lynch, 32.
- There's a snake!

28
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,920
Ran through the water tower,
jumped through a plate-glass window.

29
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,494
Sounds like PCP.

30
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,503
Twenty of ziprasidone, I.M.
- Got it!

31
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,826
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,401
Hey, you need some help
here? Moretti's got me triaging.

33
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,903
Don't worry about that, worry about
keeping patients out of the door.

34
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:49,202
Vitals are stable, abdomen's
non-tender, wounds look superficial.

35
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,505
Why is the ER
calling for a surgeon?

36
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,375
You're a great mentor.

37
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,746
That was a question. Why
does this guy need an ex-lap?

38
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:03,118
Can't trust the exam if the patient's high.
You even listening to a word I'm saying?

39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,623
Can I ask a question?
It's a little embarrassing.

40
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,693
It's better to ask
rather than fake it.

41
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,626
I appreciate your attitude
towards that, I really do.

42
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,390
It's reassuring to know that...

43
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,058
- Harold, sometime today.
- My girlfriend, Lacey.

44
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,704
- Her homecoming dance is coming.
- Homecoming dance?

45
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,136
She's in the court. Out
of my league looks-wise.

46
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,744
But there's cachet in dating a
doctor when you're still in high school.

47
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,713
- Your girlfriend's in high school?
- A senior at Woodland.

48
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,818
Anyway, there are
certain skills, expectations.

49
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,978
Certain rites of passage that a
certain homecoming princess...

50
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,214
is gonna be counting
on, you know?

51
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,450
No, I'm not sure I do.

52
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,819
I've never been to the dance.

53
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,899
I don't know how to do the
mambo or pin the corsage.

54
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,395
- Do you have any idea?
- I didn't grow up in this country.

55
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,406
- I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask.
- Neela, help me.

56
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm a virgin.

57
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,973
You guys all right in here?
- Get away, you freak!

58
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,119
- You wrote the map of the skin!
- We're doing just fine.

59
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,983
I will not be the conduit.

60
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,818
Sedation's kicking in.

61
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,257
Interns, your first-quarter
evaluations are in your boxes.

62
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,920
- Find me if you want to discuss.
- Not a good time.

63
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,794
- Nobody told us we were tested.
- Every patient is a test.

64
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,027
Of your intellect, of your wit,
of your organizational skills.

65
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,432
- Get the snake!
- Shut up!

66
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,937
Hold still. We're
gonna get the snake.

67
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,134
Hear that? Every
patient's a test.

68
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,938
And Sam just got an A this time.

69
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,476
Guess I spoke too soon.

70
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,991
I stole this from
the GYN clinic.

71
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,894
- What?
- I didn't "steal" steal it.

72
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,558
- I'll take it back just as...
- I'm not touching that.

73
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,637
Just go over the
relevant anatomy.

74
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,296
Oh, come on, man.
Put that thing away.

75
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,806
No air under the diaphragm.

76
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,776
He's just so smug all the time.
Have you ever met anybody so smug?

77
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,642
Let me guess. Moretti?

78
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,409
Every time, you guys are
talking about the same thing.

79
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,419
Well, he's an ass, but I
can't deny he's a smart guy.

80
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,612
C-spine is fine.

81
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,985
- Should I take off his collar?
- No. Upstairs.

82
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,650
This one's fun. Get him up
before sedation wears off.

83
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,353
- Here's everything you need to know.
- We're good. Go.

84
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,690
He can't hear anything?

85
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,027
He's had enough sedation
to down an elephant.

86
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,500
Okay, so where
exactly is the G-spot?

87
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,574
Put that thing away.

88
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,340
Hey. I hope you're
on top of your game.

89
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,777
Boards tomorrow. You're
taking the hard cases.

90
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,440
- Why are you working before boards?
- It's Morris', he's taking them too.

91
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,109
- Couldn't find anybody?
- Nope.

92
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,688
And he swore that he would
fail if I didn't bail him out.

93
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,122
But I'll do fine. I test well.

94
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,819
- You hear from Luka?
- Taking longer than he expected.

95
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,488
He has to retrofit his dad's
house for a wheelchair.

96
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,567
- This is completely unfair.
- Guy's clearly on a power trip.

97
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,136
Abby, check this out.
Four pages of categories:

98
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,331
Procedures, patient
relations, intellectual curiosity.

99
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,341
- Each rated one to five.
- He gave us ones across the board.

100
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,790
- Is that good or bad?
- Bad.

101
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,346
No comments, no feedback.

102
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,845
- Just ones.
- So uncool.

103
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,075
I'm never gonna get
a toxicology fellowship.

104
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,186
- That's not true.
- Are we supposed to learn from this?

105
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,593
You have to talk to him.

106
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,417
Yeah, would you? - Please?

107
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,492
Frank, what's up with the lab? I've
been waiting three hours for a CBC.

108
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,096
Something about a flow
cytometer. It'll be a while.

109
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,359
Oh, your kid's school called twice.
Alex biting off lizard heads again?

110
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,196
Shut up. He's not a sociopath.

111
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,497
That's right, ignore the
problem. It'll go away.

112
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,005
Well, it's too late, I have to
call them tomorrow morning.

113
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,233
Mm-hm.

114
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,346
Hey, Sam. You're supposed
to be covering Triage right now.

115
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,606
- What?
- Yeah.

116
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:51,013
Nurses rotate every two
hours. You're up. Come on.

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,744
Excuse me.

118
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,547
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

119
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:03,728
Slamming the interns without giving
any concrete suggestions isn't helping.

120
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:07,299
These numeric
evaluations are useless.

121
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,096
Don't worry, Abby. I
gave you solid threes.

122
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,967
Listen, they're freaking out
about the bad evaluations...

123
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,267
instead of focusing
on how to improve.

124
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,139
- Illustrating my point.
- Which is what, exactly?

125
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,304
Are they concerned about giving
patients sub-optimal care? No.

126
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,541
They're worried about
how it's gonna look...

127
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,882
They need mentors, constructive
feedback, guidance. They're just kids.

128
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,580
Arrogance and inexperience
are a lethal combination.

129
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,660
- There's gotta be a more effective way...
- Abby, look, I understand...

130
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,492
it's your natural instinct to
listen, to wanna be supportive.

131
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,497
But in the end, with...

132
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,764
Forget it. Can't.

133
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,738
Excuse me.

134
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,414
Okay. Ma'am, why are you here?

135
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,742
He got a cough.

136
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,940
Oh, yeah? Let me see.

137
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,814
Hey, let me see. Well,
his breathing's okay.

138
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,148
I'll try to get you
back as soon as I can.

139
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,346
Hello.

140
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,958
Sir, let me see your
hand. Let me see.

141
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,754
Come over here. Sit down. - Hey.

142
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,760
- Hey.
- Yes?

143
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,922
I've been here. This
guy just walked in.

144
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,125
- Well, this guy's bleeding.
- Okay, well, my head is exploding.

145
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:20,638
- You look comfortable to me.
- Well, don't tell me what I'm feeling.

146
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,036
You get headaches a lot?

147
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,473
Never like this.

148
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,613
All right, here. Grab that.

149
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,547
I'll get back to you in
a second. Follow me.

150
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,049
- This place is gross.
- Well, you get used to it.

151
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,551
- What's your name?
- Heather.

152
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,485
Heather, I'm
Dr. Gates. This is Sam.

153
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,559
Sam, Heather here says she
has an exploding headache.

154
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,491
Hm. Let's get you checked out.

155
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,894
- Moretti have you working in Waiting?
- All day.

156
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,126
He's doing that to
all the Residents.

157
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,462
Well, I better get back.

158
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,900
Take a seat over here.

159
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,473
On a scale of one to 10,
how bad is your headache?

160
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,171
It's a 10.

161
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,709
You're pretty calm for a 10.

162
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,005
Yeah. So you think I'm lying?

163
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,014
- I have a high tolerance for pain.
- Where are your parents?

164
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,143
I don't know. Out.

165
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,650
Give me their numbers. We
need permission for any treatment.

166
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,018
Sam, you seen Pratt?

167
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:14,559
He's in Exam 3 reducing a
shoulder. Are you on tonight?

168
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,187
You mean "on" as in lively and
invigorated, or "on" as in working?

169
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,389
- What?
- Morris.

170
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,593
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for you.

171
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,500
- Why aren't you studying?
- I got too much nervous energy.

172
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,666
There's no way I'm gonna
sleep. I came in so we could study.

173
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,403
I took over your shift so
that you could stay home.

174
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,515
Come on. We can help each
other get psyched, get focused.

175
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,207
Listen, if you're here, I'm out.

176
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,081
Dude, you need to
work on your game face.

177
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,017
- What?
- Game face, Greg.

178
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,520
What's wrong with you?

179
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,784
Shrug your shoulders.

180
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,928
- Can I open my eyes now?
- Yep.

181
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,256
Okay, the good news is your
neuro exam is totally normal.

182
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,765
- But you have trigger points.
- Which means?

183
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,233
It's tension. You'll feel
better with ibuprofen.

184
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,437
Aren't you gonna do a CAT scan?

185
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,041
You don't need one.

186
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,208
Well, do one anyway.

187
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,108
We don't do tests just
because patients want them.

188
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,373
Why not?

189
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,312
It's a waste of resources.

190
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,452
Okay, well, make
my dad pay, he's rich.

191
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,951
That's not really the issue.

192
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,885
You just said it was
about resources, so...

193
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,720
- Is this your home phone number?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,385
So when I call it, why do
I get a video rental store?

195
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,957
Video rental? I didn't even
know those still existed.

196
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,957
That isn't funny.

197
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,133
My mom is dead, my
dad is in New York.

198
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,671
And he doesn't need you
guys bothering him, so...

199
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,966
Not that big a deal.

200
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,973
Six hundred of
ibuprofen. Get consent.

201
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,476
And give us his real
number. No more games.

202
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,945
That was so cool,
defending us to Moretti.

203
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,415
Well, we were just discussing
different teaching philosophies.

204
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,453
Yours is better. There's no
way I'm gonna present to him.

205
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,147
- You got a minute?
- You can't boycott an Attending.

206
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,953
I can't? Come
on, just for today.

207
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,153
Hanging out in
Waiting is inefficient.

208
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,128
- Just get back out there.
- I should be here clearing beds.

209
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,495
A woman arrested in
an ER waiting room...

210
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,933
because nobody
was paying attention...

211
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,869
- Brian?
- Hey.

212
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,445
What are you doing here?

213
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,374
- Thirteen-year-old
in respiratory distress.

214
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,637
Tony. It's really bad this time.

215
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,812
I know this kid. Got a
neuromuscular disorder.

216
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,507
- I know him from ICU.
- Okay.

217
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,949
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

218
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,214
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

219
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,687
Did you see D. Lee hit
for the cycle last night?

220
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,384
No, I missed it. Have to
give me the play-by-play.

221
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,189
Pulse ox is only 78. Let's go.
- He needs oxygen.

222
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,161
Sam, you're with
me. Where we going?

223
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,801
- Trauma 1.
- Brian, wait right here. I'll be back.

224
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,064
All right, let's set up a non-rebreather
and let's get an ABG going.

225
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,209
Find someone else to cover
Triage. I'm staying with this kid.

226
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,947
He left? What do
you mean, he left?

227
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,379
He was here and
then he was gone.

228
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,712
- Is that clear enough for you?
- Did he say where he was going?

229
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,356
Frank, where's
the Crohn's fistula?

230
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,048
Ask me again in English.

231
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,624
Never mind, I found her.

232
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,727
Do women need
additional lubrication?

233
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,693
Harold, get a consult form.

234
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,698
If you're willing to put in the time
to sufficiently stimulate the area...

235
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,360
Isn't there anyone in your life that
would be more appropriate for this?

236
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,201
Like a brother, uncle, anyone?

237
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,572
No, just Grandpa. And he
thinks I still believe in the stork.

238
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,839
Is there anything special I should
know about the Crohn's lady?

239
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,643
She's narcissistic, she's
addicted to morphine...

240
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,843
and if she says that she's
allergic to NSAIDs, she's lying.

241
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,181
Thanks for the warning.

242
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,849
Excuse me. I'm looking for you.

243
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,258
Dr. Moretti, I'm Skye Wexler, new
Attending. We spoke on the phone.

244
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,823
Yeah. I didn't realize
you were starting.

245
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,900
- Yeah, tonight's the night.
- All right.

246
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,934
Follow me. When you...

247
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,107
Write your initials in this column
when you pick up a patient.

248
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,004
And chart any progress in
this column over here, okay?

249
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,042
Frank. Sorry,
this is Dr. Wexler.

250
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,080
She's gonna be taking some
shifts over the next month or so.

251
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,114
And this is one
of our lifers, Haleh.

252
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,717
Hey.

253
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,854
- Hello.
- Hi.

254
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,682
You new to Chicago?

255
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,847
Doing locums to
make some extra cash.

256
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,859
Locums?

257
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,725
Yeah, it's like
moonlighting. Mostly nights.

258
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,627
- Ah. That's when I work too.
- Oh. Yeah.

259
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,634
Much better than being stuck in a hospital
all day when it's beautiful outside.

260
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,932
I hear you. I'm a
big hiker myself.

261
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,233
You bump your head?

262
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,235
Hang in there, Josh.
I'm almost done.

263
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,142
ABG's back, 7.18. CO2, 66.

264
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,942
Yeah, he's retaining.

265
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,950
- What does that mean?
- It means he's tiring out.

266
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,213
You try breathing
50 times a minute.

267
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,483
You're gonna have
washboard abs after this.

268
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,917
Art line's in.

269
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,563
So we can check your
blood gases without needles.

270
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,665
- See this shadow?
- Yeah, is that fluid?

271
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,926
Yeah, most likely
aspiration pneumonia.

272
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,332
His muscles are weak.
It's not protecting his...

273
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,766
- Airway.
- Right.

274
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,806
I never should've let you go
to that Kelly Clarkson concert.

275
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,943
That's not why I have pneumonia.

276
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,079
Did she just say Kelly Clarkson?

277
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,972
- Problem?
- Good thing you're sick.

278
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,140
I'd be giving you so
much crap. Kelly Clarkson?

279
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,341
Hey, Sam.

280
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,750
Gram of ceftriaxone,
liter of NS.

281
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,413
- Which one of you is Pratt?
- That would be him.

282
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,151
Hey, Skye Wexler, new
Attending. I'm doing overnights.

283
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,159
- Nice to meet you.
- Call Hopkins.

284
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,265
We're supposed to report ER
visits to the study coordinator.

285
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,832
- Boards tomorrow.
- Yeah.

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,935
I'll hang here so you can study.

287
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,537
Really. Go.

288
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,536
Gates, you good with this?
- Yeah.

289
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,199
All right, buddy. We'll get
you feeling better soon, okay?

290
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,209
Looks like you're
stuck with me, Josh.

291
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,247
Let me take a look at the film.
- Here.

292
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,811
Your feet must be tired.

293
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,051
This hospital bites.

294
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,524
Been here hours,
nobody's done anything.

295
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:48,753
We get busy.

296
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,955
- What are you doing?
- Trying to find someone who gives a crap.

297
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,899
Yeah, well, those computers are
for staff only. Go back to your bed.

298
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,672
Okay, did you hear
me? I have chest pain.

299
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,002
And it's really, really bad.

300
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,307
I'll get someone
to check you out.

301
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,673
How's the boy doing?

302
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,078
- Struggling, headed for a tube.
- So, what are you doing out here?

303
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,912
- The new Attending came and said...
- Wait, wait, wait.

304
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,180
You left a patient in
respiratory failure...

305
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,586
with an untested
Attending you've never met?

306
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,857
- Oh, well, I...
- I'm kidding.

307
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,051
I sent her in.

308
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,934
- Okay. Thanks.
- Hey, doctor. Check me out.

309
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,697
Hey. What happened?
There you are.

310
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,864
You show up out of nowhere
and then suddenly you disappear.

311
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,339
- How you doing?
- Good.

312
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,774
You seemed busy. I didn't
wanna get in your way.

313
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,507
Is everything all
right? You look like hell.

314
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,780
No, I drove all night, so...
- Oh.
- Yeah.

315
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,856
Dr. Pratt, I'm sorry,
this is Brian, my son.

316
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,015
- Oh, really? Hey.
- Yeah. Yeah.

317
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,127
Aren't you in college
on the East Coast?

318
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,455
- Yes, he is.
- Yeah.

319
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,961
And now this is the part where
you tell me why you're not in school...

320
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,694
and you're here
visiting me at work.

321
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,566
- What's that?
- Happy birthday.

322
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,607
You drove all night
to give me a book?

323
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,905
No, it's not just a
book, not just a book.

324
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,305
It's like a new way of thinking.

325
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,950
Really? All right, well...

326
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,780
Remember in college you got so
excited about everything that you learned?

327
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,389
Come, let's get out of here.

328
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,617
You look like you
haven't eaten in a week.

329
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,285
- Okay.
- Hey, Skye has my sign-out.

330
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,727
- All right.
- Okay.

331
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,126
It's the natural course
of Fazio-Londe disease.

332
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,740
The respiratory muscles aren't
strong enough to clear secretions.

333
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,741
So there are no other options.

334
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,681
This is Dr. Bazzano
from Pediatric Neurology.

335
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,251
Hi, Joshua.

336
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,016
- You're his mom?
- Yeah.

337
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,624
Acidosis is worse.

338
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,923
So listen up, buddy.

339
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:06,623
Your muscles that help you
breathe are starting to get tired.

340
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,630
Tell me something I don't know.

341
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,038
So we're gonna have
to put a tube down...

342
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,767
and that will breathe for you.

343
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,535
Oh, God.

344
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,042
The ventilator's temporary.

345
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,704
His muscles rest so the
antibiotics do their thing.

346
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,782
And after the pneumonia's
treated, we can take the tube out?

347
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:26,976
Well, that's the hope.

348
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,389
Okay.

349
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,115
It's gonna be okay.

350
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,490
We talked about
this possibility.

351
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,897
I have to run upstairs. I'll
see you guys up in the ICU.

352
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,534
Thanks, doctor.

353
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,171
Do you understand everything?

354
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,839
Yeah.

355
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,534
- Mom.
- Yeah, honey?

356
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,139
The situation demands a Slushee.

357
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,374
Josh, sorry, but
you gotta be NPO.

358
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,686
Come on. Let's give
the kid a Slushee, huh?

359
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,414
You can live with that, huh?

360
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,251
Sweet.

361
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,752
Okay. Where do I...?

362
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,829
The Jumbo Mart. My kid loves
them too. It's across the street.

363
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,196
Come on, I'll take you.

364
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,497
Be right back.

365
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,375
Good catch.

366
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,282
You're not tubing me.

367
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,621
Headache's gone.
Now it's chest pain.

368
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,056
EKG was fine, exam was normal.

369
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,391
Did you do a Beta HCG?
Could explain this whole thing.

370
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,124
Keep her on oxygen, call
if she has sustained decels.

371
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,603
Abby. HCG?

372
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,035
Oh, yeah. It was negative.

373
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,472
I have to check
on a sick asthmatic.

374
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,578
- Oh, that's cool. I got this.
- Okay.

375
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,940
Hey. I'm Dr. Wexler.

376
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,448
I'm in charge tonight.

377
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,916
Lucky you.

378
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,111
Deep breath.

379
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,553
- I can't.
- You can try.

380
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,722
Again.

381
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,299
Well, your heart and lungs
sound good. Oxygen level's perfect.

382
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,998
Better keep looking, then.

383
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,666
Your pain can't be that bad...

384
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,813
if you're able to text your
friends all through my exam.

385
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,107
I'm not texting.

386
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,979
I'm trying to get online.
Reception in here sucks.

387
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,177
Is there a computer
in here I can use?

388
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,586
Do you know where Pratt
is? I can't find him anywhere.

389
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,124
- Try the break room. He's studying.
- Thanks.

390
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,556
Sorry. You were saying?

391
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,994
Just forget it. Never mind.

392
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,509
Of course we have the grand
old dame of cramming, caffeine.

393
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,701
Grand old dame?

394
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,437
Three hundred milligrams, baby.

395
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,445
Keep our engines
nice and revved.

396
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:14,212
Oh, and this. Okay? This.

397
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,650
This is the silver bullet.

398
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,589
If you get stuck on the test,
squeeze this, the answer will come.

399
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,689
Hey, I don't need
any good-luck charms.

400
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,030
You can't reject a
good-luck charm.

401
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,068
That's like the opposite of
good luck, as in bad luck.

402
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,536
Don't believe in luck. I
believe in preparation.

403
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,675
And I'm prepared.

404
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,072
Whoa, what's all this?

405
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,644
We got boards tomorrow.

406
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,579
Yeah, and how
exactly does this fit in?

407
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,150
Something to perk us up
when our stamina flags.

408
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,514
Do you guys mind if
Harold hangs for a while?

409
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,089
He could benefit
from your tutelage.

410
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,192
No, we have too
much ground to cover.

411
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,419
If you don't know it,
this isn't gonna help.

412
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,062
That's not true.

413
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,597
Studies have shown that cramming
can improve short-term performance.

414
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,598
See? Have a seat, Harold.

415
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,760
Oh, excellent. Great guys.

416
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,202
Smart, experienced.

417
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,172
So, what topics do
you wanna cover?

418
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,210
Just some basic fundamentals.

419
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,707
No appetite?

420
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,183
Dairy is pumped full of hormones,
and wheat is genetically modified.

421
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,412
Right.

422
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,854
Okay, I'll try to find you
some organic Jell-O.

423
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,085
Urine aminolevulinic
acid is elevated.

424
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,957
Suggests a problem
with porphryin metabolism.

425
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,190
She does seem to have
a serious fear of food.

426
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:39,104
Acute porphyria can be
brought on by caloric restriction.

427
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,970
Well, see, it fits.

428
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,699
Hematology said to order
an erythrocyte enzyme assay.

429
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,573
Okay. Cool case,
Grady. But make sure...

430
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,682
- I keep moving other patients through.
- Okay.

431
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:52,808
Hey, Abby.

432
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,317
- Hey.
- How is everything?

433
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,923
It's better. Much better.

434
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,619
- You been going to meetings?
- Yes.

435
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,455
Okay, because I
haven't seen you.

436
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,258
Well, the last couple
of times, I worked late.

437
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,560
So I couldn't make
it to St. Mark's.

438
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,828
Oh, I see.

439
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:15,134
And I kind of wanted to go
somewhere where nobody knew me.

440
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,735
Hm. Why is that?

441
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,474
I don't know.

442
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,982
Look, the church on Franklin's got
meetings all hours, day and night.

443
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,144
Okay. Thanks.

444
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,255
That's good to know.

445
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,120
When your infection clears,
capacity will improve...

446
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,493
and they'll take the tube out.

447
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,831
Be real. I'll never
get off the vent.

448
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,529
Don't say that, Josh.

449
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:53,105
I've been thinking about this moment
continuously since I got my diagnosis.

450
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,941
No tube.

451
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:58,175
So that's it? You're
just gonna give up now?

452
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,651
And I need to make it
look like it's your decision.

453
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,654
What?

454
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:08,955
It would kill my mom if
she knew this was my idea.

455
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,058
I promised her I'd fight.

456
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:15,496
So fight. They're doing research on
neuromuscular diseases all over the world.

457
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,795
It's not gonna help me.

458
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,995
They could come up
with a breakthrough.

459
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,164
They're years away from a cure.

460
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,077
Whether we like it or
not, this is happening.

461
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,641
My mom can start
getting over it now...

462
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,217
or a year from now when she's
given up everything to be by my bed...

463
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,321
while I wither away
on a ventilator.

464
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,013
Josh.

465
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,093
Tony, you get me.

466
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,226
I know you understand.

467
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,230
He's a bright kid. He
knows what's in store.

468
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,468
Intellectual understanding isn't
the same as emotional maturity.

469
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:02,604
No, I know him. He
understands what he's doing.

470
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,580
You're absolutely
sure about this?

471
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,583
Yeah.

472
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,450
Okay. Do me a favor
and run it by Ethics.

473
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,683
You can tell them your
Attending's on board.

474
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,759
Thank you.

475
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,459
Hey, Sam.

476
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,032
- It is Sam, right?
- Yeah.

477
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,193
Could you give our asthmatic
in 2 125 of Solu-Medrol?

478
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,702
I already did.

479
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,198
Part of Moretti's new protocol.

480
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,934
You don't need orders if
the patient meets criteria.

481
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,806
Efficient. I like it.

482
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,970
- Could I take a look?
- Sure.

483
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,446
Hey, Frank, do you have
the asthma flowchart?

484
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,778
Hey, kid.

485
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:43,053
This is a hospital,
not an Internet café.

486
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,850
What's wrong with you?

487
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,152
What is wrong with you?

488
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,886
I called your dad. Somebody's
on their way to get you.

489
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,496
You shouldn't have. He
didn't wanna be bothered.

490
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,998
- Of course he does.
- How can you say that?

491
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,999
You don't know him,
you don't know me.

492
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,901
- I'm a parent, I understand a parent's...
- Oh, shut up, you phony bitch.

493
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,849
It's like... It's already after 3 and I
think it's about time we go to bed.

494
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,349
No. I think it's time we opened
another bottle of champagne.

495
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,646
Here.

496
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,721
Really?

497
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,524
Did I tell you I'm taking a
course on the history of wine?

498
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:21,820
- No.
- I know, I know.

499
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:25,055
It sounds like major
slacker territory, huh?

500
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,258
But it's actually this awesome
survey of Western civilization.

501
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:30,869
There's the Last Supper...

502
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,028
Spanish Inquisition,
Yalta Conference.

503
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,231
You name it, somehow
wine was involved.

504
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,775
- Yeah, well, wine is...
- Oh, I switched my major.

505
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,606
To semiotics.

506
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,739
A degree in the
meaning of meaning.

507
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,447
I mean, could there be
anything cooler than that?

508
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,556
No, I don't... But, Brian...

509
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,522
I know what you're
gonna say. I know.

510
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,890
I don't wanna be premed, Dad. I
thought you were cool with that.

511
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,730
No, I am. That's not...

512
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,096
- Why are you here?
- It's your birthday.

513
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,363
All right, but what's
the real reason?

514
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,278
I remember when I
was in fourth grade...

515
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,642
you showed up, and you said...

516
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,214
It was right before lunch.

517
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,376
And you said "We're gonna go
on this secret surprise mission."

518
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,713
That's what you said.

519
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:26,916
And I remember looking out
the window of the car, just...

520
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,790
I'm thinking, I'm wondering,
"Where are we gonna go?"

521
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:35,333
And that, I just... I swear,
that was just one of the...

522
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,800
That was the most
exciting moment of my life.

523
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,006
The time we went ice fishing?

524
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,972
Yeah. It was you
and me and the lake.

525
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:52,414
And I just...

526
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:56,786
I just wanted to thank you.

527
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:01,325
Thanks for that. Thanks.

528
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,320
You're welcome.

529
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:16,870
I'll call school. They can
send a new syllabus to the ICU.

530
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,670
Thanks, Mom.

531
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,109
Sat is 81. You guys ready?

532
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,511
Actually, we're gonna hold off.

533
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,345
- What do you mean, hold off?
- We're not intubating.

534
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,189
He won't tolerate the pressure
generated by the ventilator.

535
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,055
- But I thought you said before...
- I have new information.

536
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,752
The clinical picture's changed.

537
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,831
What kind of new information?

538
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,628
Are you on board?

539
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,339
Dr. Gates and I have
discussed the options at length.

540
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,273
You think this is such a
good idea on your first night?

541
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,843
I've been Attending
for 10 years.

542
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,583
I don't understand.
This wasn't the plan.

543
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,812
- Well, we have a different plan now.
- But he's in respiratory failure.

544
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,685
We'll give him medicine
to keep him comfortable...

545
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,292
take away the air hunger.

546
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,494
- Tony, no.
- Trust him, Mom.

547
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,005
Okay.

548
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,718
How's your new interns doing?

549
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:43,590
Uh, overzealous and inexperienced,
but they seem like an okay bunch.

550
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,890
Well, I had to send
mine to man camp today.

551
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,363
So I wake up the next
morning and I look over...

552
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,935
and that best-in-show
hottie from before...

553
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,936
big, hairy mustache.

554
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,701
And that, lads, is
why drinking is bad.

555
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,072
You have your noses
to the grindstone.

556
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,408
Yeah, well, we got
a little distracted.

557
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,575
It's only 4:00. The
night is still young, huh?

558
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,050
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

559
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,051
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

560
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,487
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

561
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,593
Harold, I need you upstairs now.

562
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,820
But we were getting
to toys and accessories.

563
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,793
It's not an invitation.

564
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,297
Paranoid chemical lady
in 2 dropped her pressure.

565
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,493
All right. NEELA: Come
on, party's over. Come on.

566
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,936
Whatever advice they gave you...

567
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,768
you must forget it immediately.

568
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:33,071
- Most of what they said made sense.
- God, what did they tell you?

569
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,908
Well, Morris said the greatest
sex happens when you're in love.

570
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,947
- Oh. He did?
- Yeah.

571
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,416
Pratt talked about how to keep
the lines of communication open.

572
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:42,611
You're joking.

573
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,280
I still do have some
unanswered questions, though.

574
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:50,122
Do two orgasms 40 minutes
apart still qualify as multiple?

575
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,590
Pulse ox is 84.

576
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,531
It's progressive. There's no
cure. He has the right to stop.

577
00:28:56,702 --> 00:29:00,469
- His mother, doesn't she have rights?
- My obligation is to my patient.

578
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,801
- Josh doesn't want his mom to know.
- He's 13.

579
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,341
People make bad decisions.

580
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,035
Laying in a bed hooked
to a ventilator is not a life.

581
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,671
He can think, communicate. Maybe
he's around when they discover a cure.

582
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,614
He doesn't want to lay in
bed waiting for a miracle.

583
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:17,984
What part of that do you not
understand? We're not intubating, Sam.

584
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,852
What are you doing?

585
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,722
- Who's on call for Ethics today, please?
- It's Larabee.

586
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,830
- I'm not gonna sit...
- All right, stop! This is my call.

587
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,524
Either go mix his morphine
drip or take yourself off this case.

588
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,725
We're done here.

589
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:41,236
Suction.

590
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,211
She had headaches, abdominal
pain, rash, mood swings.

591
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,407
Tube.

592
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,985
Porphyria seemed to
explain all her complaints.

593
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,754
Okay, I'm in. Pass me the bag.

594
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,861
- Nice job, Abby.
- Yeah, Abby. Real nice job.

595
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,521
You and your intern spent
hours working up a zebra...

596
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:02,327
without ruling out common
causes for abdominal pain.

597
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,663
X-ray's back.

598
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,770
Air under the diaphragm.
Probably a perfed ulcer.

599
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,775
Which might not be perfed if you
had diagnosed this four hours ago.

600
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,273
O.R. 3 is ready.

601
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,007
Haleh will help
you get her upstairs.

602
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,551
All right, that's it, you
two, okay? I got this.

603
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,956
- Sats coming up.
- What's her access?

604
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,557
- Did you send the coags?
- Yep. They're cooking.

605
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,557
Gotta have them
done. Flagyl's running.

606
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,094
I'm sorry. I went
down the wrong path.

607
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:34,893
You got excited about
your hypothesis. It's fine.

608
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,933
It's good.

609
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:40,436
This is my fault. I'm
supposed to know better.

610
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,541
Excuse me. I'm here to
pick up Heather Baker.

611
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,480
- Are you family?
- I oversee the Chicago property.

612
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,244
I have a letter which allows
you to release her to me.

613
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,217
I don't know where she is. And
I'm busy. Gonna have to wait.

614
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,622
Well, I've been
waiting almost an hour.

615
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,762
Sorry.

616
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,593
I have a kid who needs the
wax cleaned out of his ear.

617
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,265
I'm a little tied up now.

618
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,633
And if you could pull up the
troponins for our rule-out MI.

619
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,967
I don't have a password
for the computer yet.

620
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,932
Lily. Lily.

621
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,364
Take this to Gates.

622
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,620
Heather!

623
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,888
Stop!

624
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,458
Heather, stop!

625
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,696
No, I don't want this.

626
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,330
- Hold still. You're making this harder.
- Hypoxia makes people combative.

627
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,568
She was here alone
with vague complaints...

628
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,076
none of us wondered why.

629
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,271
- Kept changing her story.
- She's calming.

630
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,917
That's the valium. Next
she's gonna stop breathing.

631
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,076
- Eighteen gauge in the antecube.
- Give the flumazenil.

632
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,587
- I totally missed it again.
- Yeah, I saw her too. I blew her off.

633
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:40,783
Big occipital lac back here.

634
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,428
I knocked her down hard.
She cracked her head.

635
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,427
Page Psych. They
need to come see her.

636
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:48,192
- NG's in. Tape. PRATT:
Placement's good. Charcoal.

637
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,734
Fifty grams. PRATT: Yeah.

638
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,599
Here goes.

639
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,599
I thought she was playing
games. I should've seen it.

640
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:02,145
You saved her life, Sam.
Don't be too hard on yourself.

641
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,284
- Hey.
- Hey.

642
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,390
Thank you.

643
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,758
What can I say?

644
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,160
- I overreacted about the ulcer.
- No, you didn't.

645
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,132
It happens to everyone.
And she did great in the O.R.

646
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,365
How do people do this?

647
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,111
Working with interns
is always tricky.

648
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,009
It's hard to supervise
without micromanaging.

649
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,809
It's not just the interns.

650
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,153
It's everything.

651
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,793
Some guy shoved me
on the El today and I lost it.

652
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,295
I followed him off the train screaming
even though it wasn't my stop.

653
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,435
I also fired the nanny,
which is totally irrational.

654
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,433
Joe's fall had
nothing to do with her.

655
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,038
I couldn't look at her
without thinking about it.

656
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,607
- That's understandable.
- No, it's not.

657
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,110
It's like I'm actually
trying to screw things up.

658
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:17,052
- It sounds like you need a day off.
- I wish it were that simple.

659
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,052
Anything I can do?

660
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,425
Do you mind if I
sign out a little early?

661
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,798
Sure.

662
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,507
Thanks.

663
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,846
I finished the brow
lac on the carpenter.

664
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,679
Wow, that was fast. Didn't
need a two-layer closure?

665
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,048
Actually, Dr. Morris just
had me Dermabond it.

666
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,555
Oh, okay. And how's our
gastroenteritis girl doing?

667
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,353
Is she keeping Gatorade down?

668
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,223
I didn't end up
pushing fluids...

669
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:01,162
because Dr. Morris said to
just go ahead with the bolus.

670
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,862
I saw Ortho down here
reducing that shoulder.

671
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,698
- How much ketamine?
- I ended up using propofol...

672
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:11,502
because Dr. Morris... Well,
he decided that it wasn't...

673
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:14,907
- Morris.
- What?

674
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,844
What? Jeez.

675
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,950
I ask for Benadryl,
patient gets Atarax.

676
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,211
I order a splint,
kid gets an ace.

677
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:24,584
What kind of creepy loser hangs
out in the break room all night...

678
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,453
second-guessing Attendings
when he's not on schedule?

679
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,960
I don't know if I'm being punked
or if you haze all new Attendings...

680
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,791
but don't double-check my work.

681
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,428
The only reason I am here
is to make cash for a surf trip.

682
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,967
Come December, I am gone.

683
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,267
So you can stop worrying that I'm
after your job or your promotion...

684
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,239
or whatever you and your
micropenis are so afraid of.

685
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:50,742
Hi. Archie Morris.

686
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,612
I have no idea who you are
or what you're talking about.

687
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,253
Gotta bounce. You good?

688
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:06,125
Hey. You're okay.

689
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,165
Got rid of all the
pills you took.

690
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,669
Heather, we didn't take very
good care of you last night.

691
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,171
I'm sorry for that.

692
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,301
Your dad's on a plane.

693
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,175
He'll be here in an about hour.

694
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,615
- Is Eliza-bitch coming too?
- Who?

695
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,748
His wife.

696
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,324
He married her
after my mom died.

697
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,984
Eight months after my mom died.

698
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,363
She convinced him to move
to New York and leave me here.

699
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,332
What do you mean,
leave you here?

700
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,972
She didn't want a step-kid.

701
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:55,440
So he visits.

702
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,448
Takes me out to lunch
and buys me things.

703
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,848
But mainly he just pays
people to tend to me...

704
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,718
like I'm a
high-maintenance garden.

705
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,463
Why did you do it?

706
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,633
- Why did you save me?
- Heather.

707
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,702
I wanted to die.

708
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,604
Things will get better, I swear.

709
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:51,570
- Don't you have to get out of here?
- Yeah, it doesn't start for another hour.

710
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,570
I can't believe you worked
the overnight before the boards.

711
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,903
After a few years of getting
no sleep, you get used to it.

712
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,739
No, not me.

713
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,245
I don't think I'll get
used to it. I hate nights.

714
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,144
- Always have.
- Here.

715
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,643
- And good luck today.
- Thanks.

716
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,448
He's unconscious and
bradycardic, but he's still breathing.

717
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,553
So it could be a while
before he actually...

718
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,383
Yeah. I get it.

719
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:49,221
His mom's in shock. I don't
think she was expecting this.

720
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:51,420
But she knew that
he had a fatal...

721
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:55,431
Today. She wasn't
expecting this today.

722
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,091
She thought they had more time.

723
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,632
Of course she did.

724
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,178
Serena, this is Julia.

725
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,976
She's a chaplain here.

726
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,416
Chaplain?

727
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:21,219
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

728
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,434
I can't do this.

729
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,638
It's not the natural
order of things.

730
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,281
Do you wanna say a prayer?

731
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,886
No. JULIA: Okay.

732
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,621
Do you want me to say a prayer?

733
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,952
No.
