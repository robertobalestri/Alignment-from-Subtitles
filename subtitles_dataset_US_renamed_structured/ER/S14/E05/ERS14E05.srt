00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,499
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,973
Joe fell and hit his
head in the park today.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,806
But he's awake now,
we're at the hospital.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,712
It would be a lot easier if
I wasn't doing this alone.

5
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,049
There's no ozone in the
Tropics. Our skin will melt off.

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,625
Okay, enough, you don't
wanna go. I'll go without you.

7
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,729
You can check
yourself in the ICU.

8
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,971
Greg, Greg. Wait up,
wait up. Thyrotoxic crisis.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,507
You give Propylthiouracil
or methimazole?

10
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,168
You've got a patient
in thyroid storm?

11
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,177
- Go with PTU.
- What dose?

12
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,578
- I'll look it up for you.
- Eh! Six hundred migs.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,912
- Why'd you ask?
- Written boards are in a week.

14
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,078
Failure's not an option. We
quiz each other, we'll nail it.

15
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,692
Morris, if you don't know your
stuff by now, then you never will.

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,452
- You see that?
- See what?

17
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,529
- That vixen, the way she smiled.
- What are you talking about?

18
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,462
Yep, they all want a
bite of the forbidden fruit.

19
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,864
At the coffee shop, at
the gym, at the bank.

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,836
Women are coming on to me like
crazy ever since Hope gave me this ring.

21
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,498
- You and Hope got engaged?
- No, it's a promise ring.

22
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,612
- Yeah? What'd you promise?
- To be faithful while we're apart.

23
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,338
- That's sweet.
- Or stupid.

24
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,507
No, what's stupid is I should
have put this ring on years ago.

25
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,381
- I could have tapped so many hotties.
- Anybody seen Abby?

26
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:31,048
- No, she's not on till 10.
- All right, Morris, belly-pain lady in 3.

27
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,886
Gotta keep me
away from the ladies.

28
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,493
- She's 85, man.
- Perfect.

29
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,859
- Sixty percent, 700 cc's, AC 14.
- Moretti's looking for you.

30
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,125
- Taking this guy to ICU.
- In the break room.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,825
- He has to wait.
- It's important.

32
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,233
- What does he want?
- Don't shoot the messenger.

33
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,498
All right, I'll be right up.

34
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,734
- You summoned me?
- Dr. Gates.

35
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,506
I'm playing by your rules,
I'm doing my time upstairs.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,514
- I don't know what else to do.
- I spoke with Dr. Shuster.

37
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,050
This about my Coumadin
overdose with the GI bleed?

38
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,887
- No.
- I ordered FFP.

39
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,147
The blood bank was
responsible for delay.

40
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,850
- I'm not familiar with that case, but...
- Pneumothorax on the COPD'er?

41
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,758
- Even the radiologist missed it.
- Dr. Gates, look...

42
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,432
When the guy deteriorated,
I had the chest tube in.

43
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,535
- Even before they processed the film.
- Dr. Gates, if I might.

44
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,761
About what?

45
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,567
Okay, I just wanted to congratulate
you on your fine work in the ICU.

46
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,272
- You do?
- Yes.

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,446
Dr. Shuster has given you rave
reviews for your performance.

48
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,209
- She did?
- Yep.

49
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,615
And I think you're ready
to come back to the ER.

50
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,278
I am? Really?

51
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,216
Yes.

52
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,757
Okay.

53
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,728
All right.

54
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,858
Then I'll finish up my work
this week and then I'll...

55
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,734
Well, you do whatever you have to do,
but I want you back on the floor today.

56
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,568
Today?

57
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,909
All right. Thank you.

58
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,218
This was to be a
simple bowel resection.

59
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,254
I never should've promised
he'd make it to the Packers game.

60
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,983
- The family here?
- Yeah, there's a son named Jeremy.

61
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,492
- He just drove up from Notre Dame.
- Great.

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,264
Hello.

63
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,133
- I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
- Hi. Yeah, I've been waiting for you.

64
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,331
Surgery took a little
longer than expected.

65
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,941
That's okay, I was fine here.

66
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,011
There were some
complications, I'm afraid.

67
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,511
- Sorry to hear that.
- Would you like to sit down?

68
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,513
No, I'm good.

69
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,279
Well, during surgery, we
think he suffered a heart attack.

70
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,288
- Really?
- Yeah, he's on a ventilator.

71
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,120
And IV meds to maintain
his blood pressure.

72
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,922
Oh, man, that's never good.

73
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,257
Are you all right?

74
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:55,961
I gotta admit I'm a little bit nervous,
but I'm really, really psyched to be here.

75
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,267
Your father's in
critical condition.

76
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,840
What?

77
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,603
- Oh, no, he's not.
- I don't think you understand.

78
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,009
- Actually, I do.
- Jeremy, this is very serious.

79
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,948
Listen, my name is Harold
Zelinsky. My father died 10 years ago.

80
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,348
I'm your new intern.

81
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,022
- You are?
- Uh-huh.

82
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:20,650
Excuse me. Do you have
any news about my dad?

83
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,684
Hello.

84
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,325
Oh, hey, Luka. No, I'm awake.

85
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,692
I've been calling
for three hours.

86
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,199
<i>I was exhausted, so I shut the
ringer off so I could get some sleep.</i>

87
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,860
- Is that Joe?
- Yeah.

88
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,404
- So he's okay now?
- Yeah, he just woke up.

89
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,906
Hi, baby. Good morning.

90
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:14,639
Sorry I wasn't around. We got
stuck at the hospital with my dad.

91
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,249
I tried calling you at work.

92
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,942
<i>They filled me in, told
me his MRI was normal.</i>

93
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,678
Yeah, yeah. He's fine.

94
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,422
Sorry.

95
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:33,533
<i>With the spinal fracture, even after
surgery, my dad can't move his legs.</i>

96
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:39,035
So when he gets home, he'll
have to get around in a wheelchair.

97
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,265
Wanna sit down?

98
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,774
We're building ramps for the
steps and handrails for the bathroom.

99
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,879
Yeah, how soon can you fly home?

100
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:49,710
We need to fix up the
house. It's a lot of work.

101
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,047
You can just call the airline and
just get on the standby flight, right?

102
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,452
There's a seat available
on the redeye tonight.

103
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,491
I'm sorry, but it's gonna
be at least another week.

104
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,493
Another week? Luka, Luka. Why
can't your brother just finish up?

105
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,257
<i>Hey, I know you don't
like it. I don't like it either.</i>

106
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,130
But I need to do this, okay?

107
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,773
<i>Please, just don't
make it harder.</i>

108
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,741
Okay.

109
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,306
Okay, but we miss you.

110
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,582
I miss you too.

111
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,580
We miss you a lot.

112
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,689
All right, let's set
up for irrigation.

113
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:36,421
- I'll come back once the skin is numbed.
- Serum osmolality calculation.

114
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,095
Serum ozzims?

115
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,532
Two times sodium plus glucose
over 18 plus BUN over 2.8.

116
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,999
Way to go.

117
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,139
Morris, somebody's
waiting for you.

118
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,638
See what I'm talking about?

119
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,503
Here's the Levaquin you ordered.

120
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,975
So you came to
drop off an antibiotic?

121
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,546
I can't say that I agree
with your assessment.

122
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,541
And you're invited
to my opening.

123
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,652
Your opening?

124
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,288
Pharmacy's my day job,
but sculpture's my passion.

125
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,651
I do a lot of figures.
Mainly nudes.

126
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,827
- You like art?
- I love it.

127
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,725
I'm gonna put this up in the
lounge in case anyone's interested.

128
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,889
No, this invitation's
just for you.

129
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:21,006
- Assess that, Dr. Pratt.
- County general on 2B.

130
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,405
Dr. Morris and Pratt
are the Attendings.

131
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,877
Frank is the grouchy clerk. This
is Harold Zelinsky, my new intern.

132
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,573
Don't go far, we got two
car-crash victims en route.

133
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,980
Grab your coat and
meet me outside Trauma.

134
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,418
It's gonna be awesome
working with you guys.

135
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,682
That kid's an intern?
What is he like, 12?

136
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,226
- Keep getting younger.
- Or we keep getting older.

137
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,388
- Looks like he's in high school.
- I asked, he said he was 25.

138
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,166
No, man, he's lying. - Okay.

139
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:51,601
First one to verify his
age wins the pot. Who's in?

140
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,569
I'm with that.

141
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,974
- What you got?
- Bevan Wong...

142
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,740
- driver of a solo car versus utility pole.
- Remember what happened?

143
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,576
Not really. TRACY: I do.

144
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,843
Fell asleep at the
wheel, went off the road.

145
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,920
Tracy Martinez, front seat passenger.
- I didn't fall asleep.

146
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,784
Are you okay, baby?

147
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,549
I think so. How about you?

148
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,751
- I'm okay.
- Any neck pain, any chest pain?

149
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,692
- Dr. Gates, back in the saddle, huh?
- Yep. Possible syncope at the wheel.

150
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,464
He works all night
at a warehouse.

151
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,057
Wiggle your toes for me, Bevan.

152
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,094
- Good, now squeeze my hand.
- I should've been driving.

153
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,465
I don't like you driving
when you're pregnant.

154
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,631
Congratulations.
How far along are you?

155
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,140
- Twenty weeks.
- I got this.

156
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,869
- No, I got it.
- No, I'm good.

157
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,038
Were you wearing your seat belt?
- Always.

158
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:38,083
We'll check you and the baby,
make sure everybody's healthy.

159
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,811
The success or failure of
your interns depends on you.

160
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,479
- Looking forward to be a good mentor.
- Not a mentor.

161
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,919
You're their taskmaster.

162
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,322
- They need to be whipped.
- That's not my style.

163
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,962
You should make it your style.

164
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,394
Fear is what motivates
them to learn and excel.

165
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,726
- They should hate you.
- There are other ways...

166
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,062
It's worked for decades
of surgical residents.

167
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,569
You need to be Lou
Gossett to their Richard Gere.

168
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,764
- You're from Connecticut, right?
- Yeah.

169
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,967
Only two things come out of
Connecticut, steers and queers.

170
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,272
Which one are you,
boy? I don't see no horns.

171
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,481
Doesn't quite work
with Connecticut.

172
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,913
I'm not joking, Neela. Without
discipline, interns screw up.

173
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,092
And if he screws
up, you screw up.

174
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,286
You want your first-choice
elective? Bring him to his knees.

175
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,165
What have we got, Zelinsky?

176
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,633
I was supposed to wait
for you before I went in.

177
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,466
Know what it means
to be proactive?

178
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,631
You could've been
through your assessment.

179
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,333
Get right on it.
Am I understood?

180
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,104
- Where are we?
- Good vitals, no obvious injuries.

181
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,714
- First crit is 39, stable.
- This your new intern?

182
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,508
Harold Zelinsky, Nurse
Marquez, Dr. Lockhart.

183
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

184
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,648
- Hi, I'm Dr. Rasgotra from Surgery.
- Nice to meet you.

185
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,055
Okay, fetal Doppler
and Surgilube.

186
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:57,196
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- No, just stand back and observe.

187
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,456
- How do you like your iPod?
- It's cool.

188
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,066
Abdomen's soft and non-tender.

189
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,294
I remember when you had to go
to the record store to buy music.

190
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,134
- I bought my first CD when I was
10. MARQUEZ: SonoSite's ready.

191
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,037
What was that, like
mid-'90s? Eminem?

192
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,075
- He wasn't around yet.
- Right, right.

193
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,213
Probably Spice Girls?

194
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,575
"Mozart Clarinet Concerto in A
Major," Richard Stoltzman, soloist.

195
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,377
Dr. Zelinsky, take a look.

196
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,577
You might learn
something. No abruption.

197
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,879
That's good?

198
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,148
Very good.

199
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:28,352
Okay, serial crits, fetal
monitor and send off a...

200
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,587
A what?

201
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,028
You know, the test.

202
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,067
The test for fetal-maternal
blood exchange.

203
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,999
- Kleihauer-Betke.
- Right.

204
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,663
No evidence of pravia. Type
and Rh to the blood bank.

205
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,069
- You all right?
- Yeah.

206
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,406
I was just up all night with a
bad stomach. It's probably a virus.

207
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,206
- So, what, do you need an IV?
- No.

208
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,609
Take a nap, get some rest.

209
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,615
- No, it's all right, I just need to...
- It's slow right now.

210
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,719
Go before we get slammed.

211
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,413
- Really?
- Yeah, go.

212
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,520
- What are you doing?
- Just taking this off for the x-ray.

213
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,359
Please don't lose it.

214
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,926
It was my grandma's.

215
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,631
C-spine's clear,
let's sit him up.

216
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,432
- Do you want cardiac enzymes?
- No.

217
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,543
- How about a head CT?
- No. No headache, no focal findings.

218
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,078
I forgot to eat breakfast.

219
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,946
- Maybe that's why I got dizzy.
- Well, you got a lot on your mind.

220
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,644
Boy or girl?

221
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,255
We wanna be surprised.

222
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,120
- You got kids?
- Yeah, I have a little girl.

223
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:37,094
- She doesn't live with me, but...
- Okay, if I send him to get an x-ray?

224
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,256
- It's up to Dr. Gates.
- You'll get a better film in Radiology.

225
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,664
You know what?
Let's leave him here.

226
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,498
If it's simple fainting,
symptoms last a couple minutes.

227
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,573
His dizziness only
lasted a few seconds.

228
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,902
Could indicate dangerous
cardiac arrhythmia.

229
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,773
- Valid point.
- I've got something dangerous?

230
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,812
We're gonna keep
you on a heart monitor.

231
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,313
Give me another listen, huh?

232
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,041
Seen the Wood's lamp? - Nope.

233
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,947
- Are you still okay?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,816
You know what?
You're working too hard.

235
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,285
How's the baby? TRACY: Okay.

236
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,426
- They did an ultrasound?
- Yeah, they did.

237
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:10,621
- We'll let you guys chat in a minute.
- Come on, lie down and relax.

238
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,261
I don't feel so good.

239
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,259
V-tach. Bevan, Bevan.

240
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,336
- Unresponsive, no pulse.
- Charge to 360.

241
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,064
Everyone clear?

242
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,774
Okay.

243
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,178
- Back in sinus.
- He's a healthy 22-year-old.

244
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:39,291
- Do you need me?
- No, just the Wood's lamp.

245
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,519
Sorry, I'll put up a
"do not disturb" sign.

246
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,194
Thank you.

247
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,960
No ectopy on lidocaine.

248
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,093
Is this gonna keep happening?

249
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,723
I don't know. You
ever have chest pain?

250
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,267
- Your father have heart disease?
- No.

251
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,334
Any drug use?

252
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,378
Look, we live in a
studio apartment.

253
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,745
I'm trying to save up for a two
bedroom before the baby comes.

254
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,413
I work at a print shop.

255
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,055
Then pull the graveyard
at a furniture warehouse.

256
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,594
So you took something
to stay awake?

257
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,562
- Couple nights ago, I took a pill.
- Like speed?

258
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,235
I don't know, my
friend gave it to me.

259
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,266
You think it messed up my heart?

260
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,106
Well, you know, it
probably wasn't that.

261
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,438
Your, EKG has a different
kind of abnormality.

262
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,944
It could be a condition
that you were born with.

263
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:11,278
- Want to have Cardiology come down?
- Yeah.

264
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,222
I wanna be a good dad.

265
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,788
I'm trying.

266
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,453
I'm really trying.

267
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,092
Harold.

268
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,999
Hey, Security needs a
photocopy of your driver's license.

269
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,106
- I don't have one.
- You don't?

270
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,935
I took Driver's
Ed in high school.

271
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,271
I never got around to
taking the test though.

272
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,969
Dr. Rasgotra's waiting for this.

273
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,774
How do you get places?

274
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,077
I take the El. If the
weather's good, I ride my bike.

275
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,015
Do you want a copy
of my hospital ID?

276
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:51,248
No, no, I'll talk to the
authorities, find out what we need.

277
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,484
- Repeat crit is 38.
- You figure it out?

278
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,752
No, he's crafty.

279
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,522
Dr. Zelinsky, your progress
notes and dressing changes?

280
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,256
They're all done.

281
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,367
- Does the baby have ascites?
- We're focusing on the placenta.

282
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,764
Looks like pleural
effusions too.

283
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,600
I think you're right in
the way of my screen.

284
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,675
Step back, please.

285
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,141
- Is my baby okay?
- No, the heart's beating well.

286
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,803
Could be iso-immunization
if the mom's Rh negative...

287
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,610
- She's Rh positive.
- What are you talking about?

288
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:21,276
- There are some fluid collections.
- Are you with children a lot?

289
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,479
- I teach preschool.
- Can you page OB?

290
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,715
- The kids gave her a virus...
- I get colds.

291
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,518
Twenty percent of
hydrops is caused by parvo.

292
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,698
- It's an infection amongst toddlers.
- Is it serious?

293
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:35,494
There's increased risk of fetal
abnormalities and miscarriage.

294
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,062
Oh, my God.

295
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,332
Parvo is one of the few treatable
etiologies of Hydrops fetalis.

296
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,567
You're pretty lucky, if that's it.
- Harold.

297
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,009
Lucky? You just said
I could lose my baby.

298
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,617
- No, not with a UV transfusion.
- Look.

299
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,481
I know this is hard.

300
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,681
But we're gonna do everything we
can to help you and your baby, okay?

301
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,729
Vincent Greco, skin infection.

302
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,265
I got two boils, here, here.

303
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,528
Okay.

304
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,729
- How long have you had them?
- About a week.

305
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,373
Started out like a pimple.

306
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,009
I tried hot compresses,
but they just kept growing.

307
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,045
- And do you work out a lot?
- Yeah, I'm a personal trainer.

308
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:25,208
Well, gyms have nasty germs. It
looks like I'm gonna have to open...

309
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,910
- Sorry.
- Did you have a nice nap, Dr. Lockhart?

310
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,680
Yes, thank you.

311
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,553
Can you tell me why Gates
has two patients on the board?

312
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,216
Got stuck with a V-tach arrest.

313
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,522
- Is the patient in V-tach right now?
- Cardiology is on their way.

314
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,359
Then he can come
down and pitch in.

315
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,195
I think there's benefit to
his staying with the patient.

316
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,133
- Greg, you have something to ask me?
- No.

317
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,967
Oh, right, the boards.

318
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,143
Don't know, antidote
for aspirin overdose?

319
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,040
Come on, you call that a
ques...? Okay, new deal.

320
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,977
From now on, tough questions
and only when we're stressed.

321
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,151
That will re-create
anxiety of test day.

322
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,979
Come on, let me check some labs.

323
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,553
IceColdShower.com?
What the hell is that?

324
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,590
- Ordering herbal anaphrodisiacs.
- You need aphrodisiacs?

325
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,784
No, no, no. Anaphrodisiacs.

326
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,930
"Curbs your libido and puts
the brakes on sexual energy.

327
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,067
These tablets ensure
a lust-free day."

328
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,828
What? You've seen what's
happening. I need this stuff.

329
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,462
You wanna lose your libido?
Get married and have a kid.

330
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,802
Well, I'm impressed.

331
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,001
It usually takes an
OB to pick up hydrops.

332
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,409
It wasn't that tough to diagnose.
The ascites was a clear tip-off.

333
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,346
Tracy, this is
Dr. Coburn from OB.

334
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,780
- Hi.
- Hi.

335
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:36,650
Your blood test shows you
had a recent parvovirus infection.

336
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,519
- I had a bad cold in August.
- That was it.

337
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,956
We're concerned about
the possible effects...

338
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,721
in your baby's bone marrow.

339
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,128
Blood velocity in the brain
is 44 centimeters per second.

340
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,431
That is not what we were hoping
for. Indicates a severe anemia.

341
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,799
I went to the clinic. My
blood count was fine.

342
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,999
You're not anemic. Your baby is.

343
00:17:56,342 --> 00:18:00,677
So we need to give a transfusion
directly into the umbilical cord.

344
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,594
Are you sure?

345
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:03,782
Without it, there's
a risk of fetal death.

346
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,384
Seventy percent.

347
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,487
With it, there's a very
high probability of a cure.

348
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:09,781
Ninety percent.

349
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,721
You wanna stick a needle
in the umbilical cord?

350
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,828
It's the only way to help.

351
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,658
Although there is a slight
possibility of a miscarriage.

352
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,890
Seven percent.

353
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,158
Well, just look at the numbers.

354
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,805
The benefits outweigh
the risks by a factor of 12.

355
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,533
- I wanna talk to Bevan.
- He's with the cardiologist.

356
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,770
- Can he be here when you do it?
- If it's okay with Dr. Kayson.

357
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,908
- I need him with me.
- Okay, I'll go get things set up.

358
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,077
Dr. Zelinsky will assist you.

359
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,488
When I first found out...

360
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,294
I wasn't sure I wanted the baby.

361
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,694
But then Bevan stepped up.

362
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,030
He said we could do it together.

363
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,240
It made us closer.

364
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,347
Everything was really good.

365
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,113
It can still be good.

366
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,249
I thought it was a
blessing getting pregnant.

367
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,058
Now I'm not so sure.

368
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,431
- Is it sharp here?
- Can't feel a thing.

369
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,366
Let me know if anything hurts.

370
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,242
- That's a lot of pus.
- Good thing I came in.

371
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,412
Smells anaerobic. You
want a wound culture?

372
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,384
Jin Kim? JIN: Right here.

373
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,153
Are you going to be my doctor?

374
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,149
Nope, actually, no. No, I'm not.

375
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,730
Dr. Lockhart, can I
take over, please?

376
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,272
Lady with foot pain in
Exam Two I need you to see.

377
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,739
Sounds good.

378
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,105
Heart sounds good.

379
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,910
EKG shows ST segment
elevation in V one, two and three.

380
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,746
I'm thinking Brugada Syndrome.

381
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,144
Hm.

382
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,587
What?

383
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,250
Dr. Gates will be back to discuss
all of my recommendations.

384
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,962
- Please, can I go in with Tracy?
- Yeah, soon as I get back.

385
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,460
It's not Brugada.

386
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:40,162
Ventricular arrhythmia in an
Asian man, classic EKG findings?

387
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,635
That's not ST elevation.

388
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,606
- It's early repolarization.
- How'd you explain the V-tach?

389
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,407
Gee, maybe it has something to do
with the amphetamines in his urine.

390
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,218
He took a pill three days
ago. But nothing since then.

391
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,115
And every drunk with an
ETOH of 500 only had two beers.

392
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,722
Repeat his cardiac enzymes.

393
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,290
If they're negative, I'll
clear him for discharge.

394
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,792
- Or jail for DUI.
- He had a cardiac arrest.

395
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,988
- Amphetamines.
- Think it can happen again?

396
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,962
- Not unless he takes more drugs.
- I disagree with you.

397
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:11,832
If it's Brugada, could happen any time.
He needs an implantable defibrillator.

398
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,839
Well, let's continue this discussion
after you complete a cardiology fellowship.

399
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,705
This is a good guy here.
Why are you writing him off?

400
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,074
He's had eight hours
of normal monitoring.

401
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,077
That's not enough.
Keep him overnight.

402
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:27,311
Don't tell me how to practice medicine.
I am not admitting a speed freak.

403
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,682
Can you hold it down?

404
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,919
It was a mistake.
A one-time thing.

405
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:36,654
A kid who's popping amphetamines
doesn't need the CCU, he needs rehab.

406
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,559
Better learn to take the
advice of a senior consultant...

407
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,894
if you intend on
finishing your residency.

408
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,750
- Any more pain, Mr. Greco?
- No, I'm fine.

409
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,550
Dr. Morris, my daughter, Layna.
- Hey.

410
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,749
Hi. Uh...

411
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:12,263
He needs to be admitted to
the IV antibiotics for the hospital.

412
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,792
I mean...

413
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,836
You know what I mean.
Let's get a dressing on this.

414
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,463
It looks pretty bad. It's not
that flesh-eating bacteria, is it?

415
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,008
- No, this will clear up in a few days.
- Thank God.

416
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,443
- I've got your clinda.
- Are we out of Kerlix?

417
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:29,673
I don't think so.

418
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,411
So, doctor, may I ask, what
kind of car do you drive?

419
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,319
Yeah, a BMW 328.

420
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,957
Not bad, but I'd love
to see you in a Z4.

421
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,425
I sell luxury cars. A man like
you deserves something sexy.

422
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,090
Anything else, Dr. Morris?

423
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,097
Some tape.

424
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,633
So, what's your wife in?

425
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,499
Actually, I'm not married.

426
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,971
Oh, really? So the ring's
just to sweeten the pot?

427
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,806
All we have is three-inch. I've
heard you can make that work.

428
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,618
Hey, Sam, where'd
you move the boyfriend?

429
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,309
- Bevan Wong?
- Exam 3 with Chuny.

430
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,546
- We're waiting on Troponins.
- We have time.

431
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,882
Will you talk to Kayson?

432
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,651
Override the chief of Cardiology
and demand admission?

433
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:14,885
Yeah.

434
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,461
Think about working with
Dr. Kayson in the future.

435
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,964
- Think about saving lives now.
- You have to defer to the consultants.

436
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,830
- Yeah, well, what if they're wrong?
- Get creative.

437
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,700
- Could the needle hurt the baby?
- There's a small chance.

438
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,898
But Tracy wants to
have the transfusion.

439
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,305
- She decided on her own?
- Mm-hm.

440
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,809
Can I talk to her about it?

441
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,311
I don't think she wants
to see you right now.

442
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,513
Because of the speed?

443
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,150
It was only once.

444
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:47,555
- It's not like I'm a tweaker or...
- She's a little disappointed.

445
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,189
<i>I won't listen to
his crap anymore.</i>

446
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,723
I should have known.

447
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:59,272
He used to deejay at warehouse
parties. He'd be out all night.

448
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,533
- I thought he was different now.
- I think he is.

449
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,710
He lied to me. He was like:

450
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,212
"I'm gonna work hard and support
you and the baby and be a good dad."

451
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,941
- He's trying to step up.
- By getting high?

452
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:17,055
- By almost getting us killed?
- People change, Tracy.

453
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,954
I used to get high all the time.
Made a lot of dumb mistakes.

454
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,858
- I straightened out when it mattered.
- He's not like that.

455
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,625
- He proved it.
- He messed up.

456
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:32,236
You know, sometimes things
aren't always right or wrong...

457
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,702
black or white.

458
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,039
My baby's sick.

459
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,113
Might not even make it.

460
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,215
Can we not talk
about this right now?

461
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,351
Okay.

462
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,426
Okay.

463
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,907
You look very lost.

464
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,670
Yeah, I'm looking for Tracy Martinez.
They pointed me in this direction.

465
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,506
They said she was in Trauma 1.

466
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,173
Yes, I'm Dr. Gates and the good
news is you're very, very warm.

467
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:21,411
- Because Trauma 1 is right there.
- Thank you.

468
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,317
So you're a friend?

469
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,323
Not exactly. Julia Dupree.

470
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,983
I'm the on-call chaplain.

471
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,023
Right.

472
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,257
- So they called you for a consultation?
- Yeah.

473
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,527
Good, I'm very
familiar with the case...

474
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,965
so if you have any questions...

475
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,704
No, I think I can manage.
Thank you, doctor.

476
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,672
Gates.

477
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,853
The nerve gets compressed
and inflamed right here.

478
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,613
So, what should we do?

479
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,280
There's a pad for your arch...

480
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,188
but you're gonna have
to stop with the high heels.

481
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,328
- Are you serious?
- I'm sorry, can you...?

482
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,929
Can you make her stop?

483
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,931
- She's expressing her frustration.
- Yes, well, so am I.

484
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,398
Emily, give that to Mommy.

485
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,868
Ah!

486
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,064
I'll be right back.

487
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,514
Your lady has a
Morton's Neuroma.

488
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,309
I figured, thanks.

489
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,518
Well, looks like further
surgery won't be necessary.

490
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,986
- How's it going, Dad?
- Much better, sweetheart.

491
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,684
- Thank you.
- This guy is the best.

492
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,587
You ever been inside a Shelby?

493
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,826
Those are some
tight little numbers.

494
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,693
Didn't we talk about this? I was
perfectly clear about my situation.

495
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,337
- What situation?
- Hey, Sophia.

496
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:49,532
- Hey. LAYNA: I see
you've met my sister?

497
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,601
Twins?

498
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,104
We were hoping we could
take you out for a test drive.

499
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,717
- So you two work together?
- We do everything together.

500
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,482
Advancing the needle.

501
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:07,023
When my friends had
babies, they were all so happy.

502
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,093
I thought I could handle it.

503
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:12,527
It's okay to be afraid. I'd
be scared out of my mind.

504
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,597
I'm not strong enough
to do this alone.

505
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,769
Hey, I think you
might surprise yourself.

506
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,642
- There's the tip.
- I'm not so sure.

507
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,296
- Really shows up.
- You wanna say a prayer?

508
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,874
- It's etched, echo tipped.
- We can do it together.

509
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,602
Move to the right
toward Mom's feet.

510
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,373
There's the cord. SAM:
Packed cells and platelets are up.

511
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:33,315
- How big is the umbilical vein?
- At 20 weeks, about a millimeter.

512
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,579
All right, I'm in.

513
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,756
You hit that with
a 22-gauge? Sick.

514
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,722
Dr. Zelinsky, I need you to
check on the rule out appy.

515
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,453
Right now? NEELA: I
don't want her to perf, go.

516
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,098
Pull off 1 cc for the lab.

517
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,664
- It's okay so far? COBURN:
It's perfect, couldn't be better.

518
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,396
Must have been
one hell of a prayer.

519
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,735
Don't worry, Harold.
She's having a bad day.

520
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,073
I'll be in Trauma
if you need me.

521
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,273
- Got it.
- Gates, is that even your patient?

522
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,782
I'm taking care of the
boyfriend. He's concerned.

523
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:10,252
I'm very concerned too. You've
been working on this for eight hours.

524
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,085
They have special needs.
Medical, social, psychological.

525
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,751
- You're not in the ICU anymore.
- Top three organisms for neonatal sepsis.

526
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,990
Reboot to ER mode. Stabilize
and pass off to the admitting team.

527
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,327
Appropriate if it was
pneumonia or cellulitis.

528
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:23,935
- I need an answer.
- Shut up.

529
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,968
- Let me just check.
- What did I say?

530
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,572
- I'm discharging Bevan.
- No, you're not.

531
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,504
- Gates.
- Gotta deal with this.

532
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:34,272
Feeling some pressure? Excellent.
Name three bacteria for neonatal sepsis.

533
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,347
- Bend over and kiss my ass.
- Those are not bacteria.

534
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,815
Group B strep,
E. coli and Listeria.

535
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,045
Not bad, Abby.

536
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,713
- That's turbulent flow in the UV.
- Excuse me.

537
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,882
My intern's in with
your belly pain guy.

538
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,859
Okay. But Dr. Coburn,
I had a question for you.

539
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,197
- Another consult?
- No, not exactly.

540
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,633
Could you find me
when you're done here?

541
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:02,740
- Go with the platelet infusion.
- Eighteen cc's of packed cells are in.

542
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,672
So I hear Luka's in Europe.
Something about his dad?

543
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,212
- Multiple myeloma.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

544
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,583
Well, things are a little bit
better. He should be home soon.

545
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,743
Must be hard.

546
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,718
- You managing with Joe?
- Mm.

547
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,148
Joe's amazing.
You should see him.

548
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:24,262
He's walking, babbling,
feeding himself.

549
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,921
He loves the books you
got him for his birthday.

550
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,660
<i>Good Night, Gorilla</i> has to
be the last book every night.

551
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,165
You drank.

552
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,504
When?

553
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,172
Last night.

554
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:49,082
- You wanna get to a meeting?
- I don't have time to go to a meeting.

555
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,621
I don't need to go
to a meeting. I just...

556
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,784
I had a bad day. A very bad day.

557
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,591
And it was just one time.
Not gonna start drinking again.

558
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,795
Really?

559
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,099
Are you an alcoholic?

560
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,899
- Yes, but...
- Yes, but?

561
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:13,478
All those years that you were sitting in
meetings, were you an alcoholic then?

562
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,477
Yes or no?

563
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,449
Okay, keep drinking.

564
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:23,248
- Do the research, see what happens.
- I can handle this.

565
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,084
Let me know how
it works for you.

566
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,282
Okay, I've got a
clinic full of patients.

567
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,054
Janet, Janet, you're my sponsor.

568
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,428
I was your sponsor,
but now it's very simple.

569
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,500
If you've decided you're not
an alcoholic, I can't help you.

570
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:42,303
If you are, I'll be your sponsor
again and I'll support you in recovery.

571
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,901
Let me know what you decide.

572
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,792
It's really... It's okay.

573
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,431
You can call me any time.

574
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:07,827
Okay.

575
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,730
Good luck on your midterms.

576
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,270
I love you too. Bye.

577
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,739
Was my son.

578
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,936
In Rhode Island.

579
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,812
He's having a
hard time in college.

580
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,478
- Really?
- Yeah.

581
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,144
He's a long way from home.

582
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:35,426
I don't know if it's the normal
school stress or if it's more...

583
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:43,959
But I feel like he's not
telling me stuff, you know?

584
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,269
It's hard to know what's
going on with someone...

585
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,203
even if they're your own kid.

586
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,674
Yeah. I'm sorry, but they're
waiting for me to sign out.

587
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,710
Good night, Abby.

588
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,980
- Migraine lady's groaning.
- Another four more of MS.

589
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,649
- You out of here?
- I'm trying.

590
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,454
Frank, did Ortho call back yet?

591
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:12,548
Oh, damn it, another dead end.
- You said this would be easy.

592
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,064
- Sure you spelled his name right?
- Frank?

593
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,737
There's no mortgage, there's no
credit cards, not even student loans.

594
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,499
- Well, maybe he had a full scholarship.
- Hello? Ortho?

595
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,700
Not yet. I can't even
find a birth record.

596
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,072
- What are you doing?
- Check on Neela's intern.

597
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,577
Yeah, we're gonna
figure out his age.

598
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:36,344
Oh. I'm here late because our clerk
can't get CT results or call consults.

599
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,719
And my Attendings don't have
time to hear about a migraine...

600
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,087
DKA, femur fracture, or
an incarcerated hernia...

601
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,991
because they're busy
playing "how old is the intern"?

602
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,884
- A couple minutes.
- We've been here.

603
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,366
These are my pass-ons.
Harold, how old are you?

604
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,094
- Twenty-five. GATES:
That's an intern?

605
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,330
How old were you
during the O.J. trial?

606
00:32:55,607 --> 00:33:00,341
- Uh... Well, that was, like, 1995...
- You're not 25.

607
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,243
- You're right, I'm 19.
- Nineteen? No way.

608
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,851
I started college when I
was 12. Med school at 15.

609
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,079
- How is that possible?
- I was home-schooled.

610
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,554
I got a perfect score on
the SATs when I was 11.

611
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,990
- So I knew I was ready for college.
- What?

612
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:17,754
Perfect score.

613
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,899
All right, let's go and
check on that rule out appy.

614
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,625
Dr. Gates?

615
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,270
Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yep.

616
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,771
I understand that Dr. Kayson wrote
a discharge order for Bevan Wong.

617
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,966
- Mm-hm.
- And that you canceled it?

618
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,271
- This your idea of problem solving?
- Didn't know what else to do.

619
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:37,439
Well, did you consider a Holter
monitor? What about a transfer?

620
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,915
Runs of V-tach. I
need a doctor in here.

621
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:43,055
Open the crash cart.
- Call Kayson.

622
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,387
- Dr. Morris?
- Dr. Morris?

623
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,460
- Your dad got moved upstairs.
- We just wanted to say goodbye.

624
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,893
You've been very wonderful.

625
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,033
Uh... Just doing my job.

626
00:33:55,667 --> 00:34:00,469
It's too bad things didn't work
out. We could've had some fun.

627
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,068
<i>- Ciao.</i> See you.

628
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,784
Frank, how about the
LFT's on my hepatitis guy?

629
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,614
- Called five minutes ago.
- Call again, been three hours.

630
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,154
Abby's right. Why can't
anything get done here?

631
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,258
- Tell me the Ottawa Ankle Rules.
- Where's his chart?

632
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,486
The ankle rules.
There's only five of them.

633
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,359
I don't have time for
your stupid games.

634
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,570
Going again. Clear.

635
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,503
Normal sinus.

636
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,878
- Strong carotid.
- What happened?

637
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,843
- Pulseless V-tach.
- You're kidding.

638
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,347
No. MORETTI: Take
a look at the strip.

639
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:47,213
Hundred and fifty amiodarone.

640
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,881
Recurrent ventricular arrhythmias
in the absence of amphetamines.

641
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,592
Possible he'll need an
implantable defibrillator.

642
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,786
Glad I didn't discharge him. He
would've died on the way home.

643
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:00,296
Yeah, good thing we got
busy with another trauma.

644
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,627
I'll go prep the EPS lab.

645
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,236
- You all right, Dr. Gates?
- Yeah.

646
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,965
Hey, Jack, hold on.

647
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,632
Welcome back.

648
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,678
Sometimes I wish I could
just see the patients by myself.

649
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,406
- Without the residents.
- Life would be so much easier.

650
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,085
I know. They don't listen,
they don't want to learn.

651
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,585
- Well, they think they know everything.
- And you know the worst part?

652
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,816
Every now and then,
they turn out to be right.

653
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,869
Excuse me, miss?

654
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,572
Is that yours?

655
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:20,203
I miss you too, baby.
Is it hot down there?

656
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,778
Really?

657
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:28,318
So, what are you wearing
right now? Like a tank top?

658
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,480
All hot and sweaty and
clinging to your skin?

659
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,126
- I need this bed.
- Yes, thank you.

660
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,592
Could you page Urology
for Dr. Morris in the ER?

661
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,493
Thanks. Hope, you still there?

662
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:45,262
So when you're all hot and
steamy, what do you do to cool off?

663
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,737
Oh, I'm so jealous. You're
that close to the Caribbean?

664
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,000
Do they have any
topless beaches?

665
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,303
You are such a bad girl.

666
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,642
Wouldn't mind going skinny
dipping with you late at night.

667
00:36:56,815 --> 00:37:00,274
Yeah? Yeah. Then I'll
take you back to your tent.

668
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,751
Right, hut. Oh!

669
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,250
I'll sneak into your hut
one of these nights and...

670
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,655
Hold on, hold on. Bardelli.

671
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,956
Can I use your rig for five minutes?
I have an administrative tour.

672
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,190
Take your time, I'm
gonna grab some dinner.

673
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,801
Okay, okay, okay, where were we?

674
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,198
Right, right, right.

675
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,205
You're fast asleep,
naked under satin sheets.

676
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:27,277
First, I gently nibble on
your toes, then your ankles.

677
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,676
Now I'm licking the
back of your knee.

678
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,608
- My baby's okay?
- Everything looks great.

679
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,687
No contractions, hydrops should
resolve in a couple of weeks.

680
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:40,656
Excellent. So did you
hear about Bevan?

681
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,552
Heard his heart was bad again.

682
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,665
Yeah, but this time there were
no amphetamines in his system.

683
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,960
We think it's called
Brugada Syndrome.

684
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:52,831
He was born with an
electrical problem in his heart.

685
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,505
So it wasn't the drugs?

686
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,142
And he'll need a
shock box in his chest.

687
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,071
Okay, but he still took speed.

688
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,013
Once, to get through work.
And he realized it was wrong.

689
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,518
And he promised, from now
on, nothing stronger than coffee.

690
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,554
You think he means it?

691
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,985
- I guess I should go see him.
- If you're ready.

692
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:24,995
Hey. JULIA: Hey.

693
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,574
- I'm gonna go talk to Bevan.
- Good, I think that's a good thing.

694
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,708
You know that guy Robert Frost?

695
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,374
He was right.

696
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,052
Robert Frost?

697
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:45,748
He said, "The only way
out is always through."

698
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,519
- Done a great job with her.
- Oh, I just held her hand.

699
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,253
Told her it was okay
to be mad at God.

700
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:55,594
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I get mad at God all the time.

701
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,430
It's actually done wonders
for our relationship.

702
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,571
I haven't been struck
down by lightning.

703
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,806
Yeah, not yet.

704
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:07,969
All right, so how does someone
like you become a chaplain?

705
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,978
I mean, is there
a lot of training?

706
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,244
No worse than med school.

707
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,117
So I guess...

708
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,087
So I guess you'd have to
give up a lot of things, huh?

709
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:22,056
Well, I don't know, aren't
there like vows or something?

710
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,422
Dr. Gates, I'm not a
nun and I'm not a saint.

711
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:28,089
I'm a woman who
happens to be a chaplain.

712
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:33,237
- And you don't really get that, do you?
- Yes, I do.

713
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,373
Get what?

714
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:40,170
That I have a spiritual
life and a spiritual career...

715
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,313
but I live in the real world.

716
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,511
That sounds nice.

717
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,882
You should try it sometime.

718
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,585
I don't know.

719
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,752
Maybe it's not too late to
switch to something else.

720
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,935
Seriously, I don't think
I can take a year of this.

721
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,037
Hey, listen, I gotta
go. Call you later.

722
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,786
- Do you wanna start evening rounds?
- No, there's a trauma coming in.

723
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,223
- You all right?
- Yeah.

724
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,888
Are you...?

725
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,793
- You're not...?
- No.

726
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,524
No, I'm fine.

727
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,733
This is all because I've
been riding you so hard?

728
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,464
Bollocks, come on.

729
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,234
I'm not really a mean person.

730
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,073
My boss told me I had to be that way
so you'd work harder and learn more.

731
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,580
- It's not working.
- Yeah, I knew this was stupid.

732
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,913
- But you were so convincing.
- But I think you're doing a fine job.

733
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:58,420
From now on, I'm gonna be a lot
nicer and a lot more supportive, okay?

734
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,148
- Okay.
- No more unnecessary scut.

735
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:04,558
No more pimping for humiliation, no
more taking credit for your good ideas.

736
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,594
Don't believe a
word I'm about to say.

737
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:07,959
- What?
- Just play along.

738
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,328
- What's coming in?
- Stab wound to the chest.

739
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,403
Don't set foot in that trauma
until you advance the drains...

740
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:17,167
write your progress notes and check
preop labs for tomorrow's OR cases.

741
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:18,503
- Am I clear?
- Yes.

742
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,178
- Yes, what?
- Yes, Dr. Rasgotra.

743
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,847
Well, what are you waiting for?

744
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:33,684
Nice. Now that's
what I'm talking about.

745
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:13,591
- What do you got coming in?
- Stab wound under the left nipple.

746
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:17,099
- I can stay if you want.
- No, we got it.

747
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,066
Good work today.

748
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,397
Nice to have you back.

749
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,310
Beautiful night, isn't it?

750
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,043
Everything okay, Dr. Morris?

751
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:39,785
Oh, yeah. Everything's
good, real good.
