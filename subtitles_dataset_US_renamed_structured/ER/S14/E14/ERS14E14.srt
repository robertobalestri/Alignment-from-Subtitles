00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,018
After everything, you
don't want to tell me?

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:08,599
No tonight.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,368
I was not aware
that I was flirting.

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,304
Do you still love me?
- Oh, my God!

6
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,746
Of course I still love you,
why would you even ask me?

7
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,611
Why the hell do you
think? Just talk to me!

8
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,845
I was in a residential
detox facility.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,387
Are you ever drunk at work?

10
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:28,626
My husband, Dr. Kovac, and our
son are in Croatia. They've been there...

11
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,321
I just need to spend
some time with them.

12
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,832
- Second-guessing and the...
- Shut up.

13
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,126
Ladies, I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,399
I got to go.

15
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,199
- Now?
- Mm-hm.

16
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,863
What about dinner?

17
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,645
You can order room service.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,206
Anything you want.

19
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,411
I'll be back for breakfast.

20
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,527
Simon.

21
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,799
Ah.

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,642
Baby, that is very,
very tempting but...

23
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,381
You know how devoted
I am to my work...

24
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,918
so we'll save it for
round two, okay?

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,651
Hey. I didn't know you were on.

26
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,917
Yeah, I just started.

27
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,788
Are you waiting
for the chest pain?

28
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,460
Uh-uh.

29
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,055
At least it's not raining.

30
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,298
Nope.

31
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,406
Okay, about Ike's
the other night, I'm...

32
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,008
I had a few drinks, and
I really wasn't trying to...

33
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,643
I get it.

34
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,842
You do?

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,015
Good. I don't want
anything to be weird.

36
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,186
I know you have something
going on with Julia. I don't wanna...

37
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,345
She's in Nepal, actually,
on a spiritual retreat.

38
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,923
- Oh, really? Oh.
- Mm-hm.

39
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,328
Well, good. Then we can have
some time to get it out of our system.

40
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,725
I mean, get over it.

41
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,999
- And forget it ever happened.
- Okay.

42
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,502
- Okay? And just get back to normal.
- All right.

43
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,798
- Right. MAN: Can I get
some help over here?

44
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,339
What happened?

45
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,273
She stopped breathing.

46
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,676
- What's her name?
- Mia.

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,042
Mia. Mia, open your eyes.

48
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,151
- Does she have asthma?
- No, I think it's her heart.

49
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,682
And last but not
least, Trauma One.

50
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,017
I really appreciate the tour,
I know how busy you are.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,552
- Is that a ruby?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,157
- Oh.
- Heh.

53
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,960
You know, rubies
have a lot of power.

54
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,000
According to Vedic astrology...

55
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,197
they bestow courage, vitality...

56
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,253
- and spiritual insight.
- Spiritual insight.

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,679
- Excuse me.
- Hey, heard you got a sick one.

58
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,848
- Yep.
- This is Mia, her boyfriend Jordan.

59
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,076
- Pertinent history?
- She had a heart transplant last year.

60
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,980
- Excuse me, doctor?
- Simon Brenner.

61
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,179
Heard you're starting
today. I'm Dr. Pratt.

62
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,189
- Keep her on 15 liters.
- Pulse ox, 85, tachy at 135.

63
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,519
Set up for intubation.

64
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,719
- Drop, etomidate and sux.
- I'm doing it.

65
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,262
- She had heart failure?
- Not since the transplant.

66
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,229
- She's been doing well.
- Hey, Mia.

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,665
Give me a deep breath
for me. Can you do that?

68
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,667
Doctors, you mind
if I try something?

69
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,865
- Like what?
- Sublingual captopril of nitrate.

70
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,566
- I'm Simon, new attending.
- Sam.

71
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,870
- Let's start airway first.
- This is only gonna take a second.

72
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,450
We got to put her on
a breathing machine.

73
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,085
She really hated
that after surgery.

74
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,745
When her lungs are this
bad, we don't have a choice.

75
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,118
- Ready with thorazine.
- Aah. What's going on?

76
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,623
- Whoa, whoa. JORDAN:
You're at the hospital, honey.

77
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,689
Pulse ox is 95. Wow.

78
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,598
Those lips, those eyes, it'd be a
crime to intubate a face like that.

79
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,686
<i>What'd you get me?</i>

80
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,033
You all right?

81
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,905
We don't talk much anymore.

82
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,741
Like we don't know what to say.

83
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,947
Well, we should fix that.

84
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,823
I miss you, Abby.

85
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,187
- Abby?
- Janet.

86
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,262
Hold on.

87
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,199
I thought you'd be
waiting for me downstairs.

88
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,873
Oh.

89
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:45,403
Come in, I just checked the
website and the flight's delayed.

90
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,741
God, I wish I'd known.
I rushed over here.

91
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,917
Oh, I'm sorry. I just found out.

92
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,417
And it's like only an hour. I can
get you a cup of coffee if you want.

93
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,714
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

94
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:55,947
- Abby.
- What?

95
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,489
I'm going to go.

96
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,157
I promise this
time. I'm gonna go.

97
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,993
It's been a week. He's
been waiting a week for you.

98
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,136
I'm not so sure about that.

99
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,567
You can't keep putting it off.

100
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,641
What if it doesn't work?

101
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:20,273
- It works as long as you believe in it.
- I'm not talking about the program.

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,005
I'm talking about my marriage.

103
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,014
I just... I don't
know if I can fix it.

104
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,424
What does it mean when a
phone doesn't even go to voicemail?

105
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,117
Is there an attending around?

106
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,320
- That would be Dr. Pratt.
- Ah.

107
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,625
Laverne St. John, 4th year
student starting my rotation.

108
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,701
- Really? With an overnight?
- Some girls have all the fun.

109
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,963
Why don't you get
started with Dr. Brenner.

110
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,697
He's in Exam Two.

111
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,734
- Right there. Ah.

112
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,605
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

113
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,040
You giving her to new guy?

114
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,976
He seems to know
how to do everything.

115
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,809
Morris, I said no.
Stop bugging me.

116
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,144
This is for the advancement
of science, Frank.

117
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,751
That's what Dr. Mengele said.

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,718
Great, thank you.
She'll be right up.

119
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,484
- Wanna make a quick hundred bucks?
- Does it involve a French maid's outfit?

120
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,561
No, I have a proposal due
tomorrow. I need one test subject.

121
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,787
What you have to do?

122
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,330
Study the effects of
conducted electrical weapons.

123
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,559
- Tasers?
- It's just a five second shock.

124
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,726
- We record all your vitals...
- Forget it.

125
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,929
How about for 200?

126
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,905
- E and B's ready.
- Can I go with her?

127
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,840
- It's best if you stay down here.
- Is that okay with you?

128
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,073
It's not like I haven't
had a biopsy before.

129
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,616
I'll be waiting here for you.

130
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,655
He seems like a good guy.

131
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,620
Yeah, he really is.

132
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,590
- How long you been together?
- About a year, I guess?

133
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,491
It was 14 months ago. A few
days after she got the heart.

134
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,131
You met in the hospital?

135
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,029
She was in cardiac rehab.
We hit it off pretty quickly.

136
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,127
He drove me to my
doctors' appointments...

137
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,034
made sure I had my meds.

138
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,936
I called him my recovery buddy.

139
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,701
I can't imagine
being without her.

140
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,612
Well, you're lucky to have
found that, especially so young.

141
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,115
Every day, I thank God
for bringing us together.

142
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,687
Let's stock continuous
albuterol at 20nl.

143
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,950
- Dr. Pratt.
- Hey.

144
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,615
Thank you for the med student.

145
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,057
Intelligent and
enthusiastic and docile.

146
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,527
I'm surprised you didn't
keep her for yourself.

147
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,225
Doctor, this whole
orientation shift, it's a formality.

148
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,199
It's wasn't really my
idea. So let's make it work.

149
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,033
No sense getting
in the same case.

150
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,903
Instead of burdening you,
I'll see patients on my own?

151
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,237
- If that's what you want.
- Best for everyone.

152
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,675
There's a trauma coming
in, want me to take it?

153
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,713
- Sure, thanks. Huh.
- Okay.

154
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,349
Hey, Sam, family in Exam 4,
they're requesting a chaplain.

155
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,717
- Well, who's filling in for Julia?
- I asked Father Brian.

156
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,255
Who's that? Temp chaplain?

157
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,824
No, he's Julia's
replacement. She quit.

158
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,427
Pratt, it's a double trauma.

159
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,087
All right, come on.
Let's clear two rooms.

160
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,493
Kelly Robinson, 69,
assisted living resident.

161
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,726
Victim of assault.
Chest trauma, facial lat.

162
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,962
- I'm Dr. Brenner.
- It hurts to breathe.

163
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,935
- Who beat her up?
- That old bitch.

164
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,201
- Because you dropped me, dummy.
- She fell backwards off a table.

165
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,435
Right onto my head.

166
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,603
- Few seconds at best.
- It was an accident.

167
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,873
The hell it was.

168
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,540
Then she started kicking
and punching like a lunatic.

169
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,776
Let's settle down.

170
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,784
- We'll get her in Trauma 2.
- I'll take her in Trauma 2.

171
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,752
Go ahead, you can have it.

172
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,257
- What was she doing on the table?
- We had a communal living workshop.

173
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,259
It was a trust exercise.

174
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,796
I'll never trust
you again, whore.

175
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,934
You know what? I feel like my whole life
I haven't had control of a single thing.

176
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,401
It's like I've just
been, like, floating.

177
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,802
Well, that's the disease.

178
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,135
Drinking takes over, it
directs your impulses.

179
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,369
You stay out of its
grip, you keep control.

180
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,037
- Yeah, well, maybe it's too late.
- All right.

181
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:45,083
Thinking like that only
opens up the way to a relapse.

182
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,947
- Are you looking for an excuse?
- No.

183
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,318
I'm not looking for excuses. It's
just how many chances do you get?

184
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,489
I'm already, like, two
or probably three past...

185
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,822
what anyone actually deserves.

186
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,828
So who decides how
many chances you deserve?

187
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,590
I don't know. Maybe he does.

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,109
Yeah, he came to see me.

189
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,737
Two weeks into rehab.

190
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:28,094
I was very moved that he would come
all that way for me, but, you know...

191
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,156
There's more to it than that.

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,697
There's some pictures when
I brought Joe to the seaside.

193
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,005
You didn't bring him?

194
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,510
I only came for a day or two to
take care of some things, yeah.

195
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,849
- And I thought it might be too hard.
- Probably, yeah.

196
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,158
What things?

197
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,852
You said "take
care of some things."

198
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:06,363
Uh... I quit. I'm not gonna
work at County again.

199
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:13,201
Just after everything
with my father, with you...

200
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,732
I was thinking I
need something else.

201
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,814
Are you gonna stop
practicing medicine?

202
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,247
I don't know. Maybe
a different area.

203
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,515
- Well...
- Ah.

204
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,218
It's like those halls
are haunted to me.

205
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,421
I mean, not exactly
haunted, it's just...

206
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,228
- I need a clean break.
- Yeah. Yup.

207
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,364
So I gotta go.

208
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,738
So I'm done here in two weeks.

209
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,877
And I didn't... Do you
wanna come back here?

210
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,043
Or should I meet you
and Joe in Croatia?

211
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,246
We'll see.

212
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,159
What do you mean, "we'll see"?

213
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:15,233
Right now it feels good for Joe
and me to be there with my family.

214
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,596
I think he's happy.

215
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,264
Me too.

216
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,940
Um...

217
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,614
Yeah, we'll see where we
are when you're done here.

218
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,080
- How you feel, how I feel.
- You know, Luka...

219
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:37,987
Hey, and I also hope you'll let me
know when you wanna tell me the truth.

220
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,783
About what?

221
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,833
Sats at 92.

222
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,475
Okay, excuse us
while we talk shop?

223
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,612
Okay, what do you think about
.10 in this left costal margin?

224
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,976
Let's do a chest x-ray
to rule out pneumothorax.

225
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,582
Got any better ideas?

226
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,219
- Are we worried about the spleen?
- I don't know.

227
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,445
- You want morphine?
- Fentanyl.

228
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,955
Why don't you head next door.
Maybe Dr. Pratt could use some help.

229
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,753
- But, I... BRENNER:
We're okay in here.

230
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,363
Laverne, what's another way
to diagnose a collapsed lung?

231
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,433
You hear that, you old
battleaxe, you collapsed my lung.

232
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,603
Screw you, you had it coming.

233
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,704
- How much Ativan?
- Start with two.

234
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,170
You're just an old tart.

235
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,832
- She's combative from the trauma.
- I'm not combative.

236
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,501
- I thought you're with Brenner.
- He sent me in here.

237
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,114
Senile kook. This
is all your fault.

238
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,479
You are rough on each other.
What are you, professional wrestlers?

239
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,483
We used to work together.
We were librarians.

240
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,815
Heh. Okay.

241
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,184
Is that a blown pupil?

242
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,326
All right, 15 liters O2 by mass.

243
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,358
Let's mix up mannitol
and make sure...

244
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,996
Do you need me, Dr. Pratt?

245
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,463
- What's going on in there?
- Dr. Brenner didn't like any of my ideas.

246
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,363
- He suggested I go to library and read.
- What?

247
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,869
He also suggested I use
a different eye shadow...

248
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,132
and do something
different with my hair.

249
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,400
- He what?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,167
Please don't make
us go back in there.

251
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,308
Call CT. She needs to be in the
scanner as soon as the mannitol is in.

252
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,850
Put her on a portable
monitor, I'll be right back.

253
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,082
And this is fentanyl. This
is the really good stuff.

254
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,053
I mean, for the
special patients.

255
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:22,320
While we fix you up, you're
gonna be floating in a state of bliss.

256
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:33,062
You know, I know this is your first
day and I don't wanna embarrass you...

257
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,368
but this is a teaching hospital.

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,010
So that means that you
have to actually teach.

259
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,712
You see, those guys, they
look up to us as examples.

260
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,350
Heh. So this is me trying
to preserve their illusion...

261
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,615
that you are actually
worthy of their admiration.

262
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,451
Okay? All right.

263
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:57,290
One more thing, keep a lid on talking
about people's hair and their makeup...

264
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:01,525
or I'll make sure Human Resources
throws you right out on your ass.

265
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,799
I didn't realize you were
running the floor, Greg.

266
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,772
Keep it up, man. And I'll make
you real familiar with the floor.

267
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,373
All right, guys, it's all good.

268
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,776
Dr. Brenner will see you now.

269
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,817
Hey, Pratt told me
that the chaplain quit.

270
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,224
You didn't mention that.

271
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,922
Yeah, I didn't think
it was that important.

272
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,000
Did she find another job?

273
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:39,230
I think she's gonna stay
in Nepal for a couple years.

274
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,170
A couple years. Hmm.

275
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,210
We broke up. Just a little
embarrassing being dumped like that.

276
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,780
Well, it happens.

277
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,746
Not really. It's new to me.

278
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,716
You're such an ass.

279
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,618
Dr. Gates, are the
biopsy results back?

280
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:03,218
Your rejection fraction dropped
from 60 percent to 25 percent.

281
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,530
That doesn't sound very good.

282
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,430
And under the microscope, we see that
your heart is full of white blood cells.

283
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,265
So your immune system
is attacking the heart.

284
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,542
It's rejection.

285
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,139
But you can treat it, can't
you? What do we need to do?

286
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,250
This medication is
to stop the rejection.

287
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,578
What if that doesn't work?

288
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,243
Don't worry, it's gonna work.

289
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,152
Worst-case scenario, you
go back on the transplant list.

290
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,260
No. Maybe there's some better
medicines you don't know about.

291
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,658
- Shouldn't there be a specialist here?
- Jordan.

292
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,493
- This is what Cardiology recommends.
- The heart she's got is perfectly fine.

293
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,761
It's a good heart. Just find
a way to keep it working.

294
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,055
- Here.
- Thank you.

295
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,263
- What are you thinking?
- Ahem. That I've been here before.

296
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,456
Hmm.

297
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,463
That I'm gonna have to be
honest with him about something...

298
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,474
I don't really wanna talk about.

299
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,304
Well, it's possible that
the details don't matter.

300
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,279
He's smart enough to know
that the behavior was a disease.

301
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,042
So don't tell him?

302
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:36,349
It's about what they need to hear,
not about what you need to say.

303
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,892
Oh. Okay. So tell the truth.

304
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,598
Unless it's too difficult, in
which case lying is okay.

305
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,291
- To omit, maybe.
- Omit.

306
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,972
Janet, omit is a
nice word for lie.

307
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,577
And it's like he
knows. He knows.

308
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,906
He knows there's
more to it than I told him.

309
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,172
- All right.
- It's...

310
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,976
- Easy.
- It was Kevin Moretti.

311
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,983
Yeah.

312
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,317
- Hmm. It all makes more sense now.
- What does?

313
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,833
When Luka came to Chicago,
he came to see me at the hospital.

314
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,662
- He did?
- Yeah, you were deep in recovery then.

315
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,639
I know he loves me, I know that.

316
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,723
- It's just that...
- That guy wants you healthy.

317
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,867
What's the problem?

318
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,032
My heart.

319
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,070
It came from his fiancée.

320
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,850
She got into a bike
accident, was brain-dead...

321
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,714
and a couple of days
after the transplant...

322
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,520
he started to visit,
offered to help.

323
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,757
And I felt so bad for
him. He was destroyed.

324
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,862
So he's not your boyfriend?

325
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,403
It didn't start off like that...

326
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,408
but a couple of months ago,
I realized I let it go too far.

327
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,046
It's my fault.

328
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,608
So you stopped taking the meds?

329
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,850
I started doing things
that didn't make sense...

330
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,750
because I care about him.

331
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,391
I wanna help
him, but it's just...

332
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,886
He's not the one.

333
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,261
Getting sober means
being honest with yourself...

334
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:28,265
and with the people you
love, and you were right before.

335
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,926
It means being honest
about everything.

336
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,234
Yeah, well, here's
the thing. I'm a liar.

337
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,568
I grew up lying about
my crazy mother...

338
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,609
and now I lie to my husband
and I lie to my coworkers.

339
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,269
- I lie to myself...
- Abby.

340
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,812
I lie to my sponsor.

341
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,584
I drank at work.

342
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,311
Okay. Oh.

343
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,114
Damn it.

344
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,291
Okay.

345
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,488
Displaced femoral
neck fracture, right?

346
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,223
You asking me?

347
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,425
No, that's what it is.

348
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,501
I'll get a hair traction.

349
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,730
No, I wanna try 5
pounds of Bucks Traction.

350
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,735
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Sam, I'm sure.

351
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,911
We all lie.

352
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,411
I am 12 years sober.

353
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,414
And I can't say I know that I
won't relapse at some point.

354
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,586
But I sure as hell
believe that I won't.

355
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,353
And that is the best
thing I got going for myself.

356
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,489
Every day I look in the mirror
and try to tell myself the truth.

357
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,696
What if I can't?

358
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,500
You already are.

359
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,361
Hey, Bettina. It's Greg.

360
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,437
Check your cell, there's something
wrong with your voicemail.

361
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,266
Anyway, I'm here in the ER.

362
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,434
I'll be here all night, so
if you get this, call me.

363
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,308
- Dr. Pratt.
- I already said no.

364
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,747
I'll take the shock,
you fire the weapon.

365
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,409
- Go away.
- I got a release form.

366
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,111
Clearing you of any
responsibility in event of...

367
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,259
Okay, think about it and,
you know, get back to me later.

368
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,887
- Tony.
- No.

369
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,132
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

370
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,600
Dr. Gates says you're
not feeling so good.

371
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,242
We're giving her diuretics
to dry out the lungs...

372
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,776
and IV meds to increase
her cardiac output.

373
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,506
Well, whatever you gotta
do to keep that ticker going.

374
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,775
If it doesn't work, we
may need to intubate.

375
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,078
Just to help the lungs.

376
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,916
If her heart keeps failing, Mia is at
risk for arrhythmias, cardiac arrest...

377
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,580
Can we not talk about that now?

378
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,282
Jordan...

379
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:14,592
I am so grateful for everything
that you've done for me.

380
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,735
I've done it for us.

381
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,806
This past year has been a gift.

382
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,342
I know that.

383
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,676
I will know that for
the rest of my life.

384
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,513
But I think...

385
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:42,351
We were both at very
intense points in our lives...

386
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,396
and I think we got
a little confused.

387
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,898
Confused?

388
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:55,832
I know it's hard.

389
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,676
You know what?

390
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,281
But I think you understand
what I'm trying to say.

391
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,683
You know what? I think we
should talk when you feel better.

392
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:10,380
I got to go outside, I
promised I'd call your mother.

393
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,851
- Jordan.
- Uh...

394
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,087
You know she's gonna be
upset if she can't get through, so...

395
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,825
I'm gonna call. I'll come
back when she calls.

396
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,057
Jordan.

397
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,597
- Hey, Jordan.
- I got to make a call.

398
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,706
Hey, buddy, come on.
Let's go take a walk.

399
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,881
Let's take a walk, Jordan, okay?

400
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,987
<i>And I was thinking...</i>

401
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,743
<i>of a poem before, actually.</i>

402
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:17,049
<i>Before, when I was getting
ready. And I think it starts:</i>

403
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:23,056
<i>I carry your heart in my heart.</i>

404
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,627
You are a good nurse, Abby.

405
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,394
But you could be a great doctor.

406
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:34,635
You just need a
little confidence.

407
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,802
<i>I am never without it.</i>

408
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:40,838
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Heh.

409
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,072
No.

410
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,450
<i>I just can't stop
thinking about...</i>

411
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,317
What she must
have gone through...

412
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,688
and I can't stop thinking about
how afraid she must have been...

413
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,761
and I can't stop thinking
about why we couldn't save her.

414
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,591
I just...

415
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,681
<i>Anywhere I go, you go.</i>

416
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,155
A compass?

417
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:33,197
I know it's corny, but it seems
we always find each other.

418
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:34,731
Oh, man.

419
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,202
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

420
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,669
<i>I carry your heart.</i>

421
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,835
<i>I carry it in my heart.</i>

422
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,001
<i>What if I don't know
how to love it right?</i>

423
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,148
<i>Abby.</i> ABBY: <i>I'm afraid
I'd mess it up, Luka.</i>

424
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,950
We won't.

425
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,816
Ask me again.

426
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,830
Ask me to marry you.

427
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,711
<i>So.</i>

428
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:34,053
<i>I guess what I'm saying is, let's
just try to love each other and...</i>

429
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,686
<i>Persevere.</i>

430
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:42,133
- Chuny, have you seen Brenner around?
- In Trauma.

431
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,599
He's playing peacekeeper
with the two ladies.

432
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,863
Great.

433
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,562
As someone once said:

434
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:53,110
"To forgive is to set a prisoner free,
and realize that prisoner was you."

435
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,373
Michelle.

436
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:02,085
I'm sorry I hurt you.

437
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,318
Look, we need to talk.

438
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,226
And I'm sorry I didn't use
my full strength to catch you.

439
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,162
Now, doesn't that feel good?

440
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,028
Not as good as when I'm
doing her boyfriend. Ha-ha-ha.

441
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,760
- You lying strumpet, you will rot.
- It's the truth.

442
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,806
Come on, let's go. Larry,
Laverne, they're all yours.

443
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,499
Think those two can handle that?

444
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,838
Yeah, they could handle
a lot if you let them.

445
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,514
- That's right, you said that before.
- No disrespect.

446
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,173
But you're making it real
hard for me to respect you.

447
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,343
You're taking the procedures.
Not letting them do physicals.

448
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,489
- They don't know what they're doing.
- They've been to med school.

449
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,955
- You've either got it or you don't.
- Excuse me?

450
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,619
You know what I'm talking about.
Some catch on, others never get it.

451
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,628
Yeah, but it's our
job to train them.

452
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,825
That is sweet, Greg, but it's
also a complete waste of time.

453
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,438
- Are you serious?
- Look, I teach people that can benefit.

454
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,096
Ah. What about
Larry and Laverne?

455
00:32:55,307 --> 00:33:00,143
Well, they're adorable and
eager and absolutely clueless.

456
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,514
I could spoon-feed everything I know.
It'd pass to them like a case of cholera.

457
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,275
So, what do you suggest instead?

458
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,886
Encourage them
to find new careers.

459
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,819
I don't know where you came
from, but this is a teaching hospital.

460
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,655
So if you can't accept that
everybody needs to learn...

461
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,330
then you don't belong here.

462
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,022
Okay, sorry. Remind me again.

463
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,861
You're not the Chief
of Department, right?

464
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,061
- No, I'm not.
- Okay, that's great.

465
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,675
So you do things your way, and
I'll stick with the way that works.

466
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,640
Shift's over. It's been a
pleasure, but I gotta go.

467
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,745
I got a date. I
got two, actually.

468
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,417
- Hey, I'm not the only who thinks...
- Good night, Dr. Pratt.

469
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,153
All right, I knew you'd
change your mind.

470
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,351
You ready to shoot me?

471
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,693
Beth and I met our
senior year in college.

472
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,530
We got engaged...

473
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,430
two years later, we'd
never spend a day apart.

474
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,502
She must have
been pretty special.

475
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,402
It seemed wrong when I lost her.

476
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:05,669
Not like it didn't happen, but
like it shouldn't have happened.

477
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,040
It couldn't have happened.

478
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,511
When I heard they'd found a
recipient, I just wanted to meet her.

479
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,018
That information is
usually confidential, Jordan.

480
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,347
I did some snooping around. You
know, I was a man on a mission.

481
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,391
It's all I had left of her.

482
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,527
First love is rough.

483
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:28,030
It's hard trying to
find that feeling again.

484
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,727
Whew.

485
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,096
When I finally met Mia...

486
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,728
I just wanted to stay
connected, you know?

487
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,238
Maybe it's time to let go.

488
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,277
Let go of Mia?

489
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,608
Let go of Beth.

490
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,211
- Tony, her sats are bottoming out.
- Mia?

491
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,549
- Hundred percent?
- Yeah, but it's not helping.

492
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,555
Call RT, get a vent.
- Already did.

493
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,786
- What's happening?
- Her breathing is getting worse.

494
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,631
Pulse ox, 82, on 15 liters.
She maxed out on the present.

495
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,268
Got to thread BiPAP.

496
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,597
- It's okay, you'll be okay.
- Systolic's on 70.

497
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,898
- Add dopamine.
- Run a five.

498
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,009
Hundred of lidocaine
and open the crash cart.

499
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,751
It's like a sterilization scene
out of some bad sci-fi movie.

500
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,389
If it means no more children for
Morris, it's a service to mankind.

501
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,753
Too late, Frank, my stuff's on ice.
- Okay, okay.

502
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,757
Ready, set... Hold on.

503
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,588
I have to record data for a
full five minutes after the shock.

504
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,529
So whatever happens,
do not touch me.

505
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,260
- You don't have to worry about that.
- No, I'm serious.

506
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,338
You can mess up the EKG,
skin resistance, pulse pressure...

507
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,498
All right. We got it,
okay? Here we go.

508
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,837
- One, two... MORRIS:
Wait, wait, wait.

509
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,785
In 1921, Walter Reed infected
his team with yellow fever.

510
00:35:55,487 --> 00:36:00,255
In 1929, Werner Forssmann
catheterized his own heart.

511
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,385
In the spirit of these great
pioneers, I, Arc... Aah!

512
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,293
Oh, my God.

513
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,771
Hang in there, Morris. It
will only last five seconds.

514
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,598
Just a sting. - All right.

515
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,901
Has it been five seconds?

516
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,207
All right, all right.

517
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,713
Stop the trigger, Pratt!
- No, no, I did.

518
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:26,579
Definitely more
than five seconds.

519
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,948
- Pull the leads off.
- No.

520
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,747
No, it says don't touch them.

521
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,821
I'm trying, Morris.

522
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:36,961
This stupid thing. What the
hell is wrong with this thing?

523
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,589
The battery should
be gone by now.

524
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,562
- Oh, Greg, stop.
- No, I'm trying.

525
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,829
- It's killing the son of a bitch.
- He's had enough, stop it. Come on.

526
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,241
- Jeez.
- Archie?

527
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,271
- Archie?
- Morris?

528
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,643
Archie?

529
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,110
- Talk to us.
- Morris?

530
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,283
Is he breathing?

531
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,050
It's okay, Mia.

532
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,449
- It's okay, Mia.
- How are we on dopamine?

533
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,322
Twelve mics. BiPAP 20 over 10.

534
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,997
Systolic's 120.

535
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,293
This thing.

536
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,064
It's keeping you alive.

537
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:26,209
- My back.
- You wanna sit up?

538
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,955
- Jordan.
- I know.

539
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,583
I know.

540
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,492
Oh...

541
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,594
How are you doing?

542
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,364
I can't move.

543
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,242
You'll be fine in a few hours.

544
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,675
You depleted all the
acetylcholine in your muscles.

545
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,176
From one shock?

546
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,713
You don't remember?

547
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,881
Was that a standard
issue stun gun?

548
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,916
I had the guys in bioengineering
make some modifications.

549
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,655
That explains it.

550
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,625
What?

551
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,089
It was a long shock.

552
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,428
Over two minutes.

553
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,728
I'm sorry, Morris.

554
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:32,003
- Did you keep the monitors going?
- Yeah.

555
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:42,377
Send off a CBC,
chem-20, CK and troponin.

556
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:46,456
I need an EKG, ABG
and cardiac echo.

557
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,685
- Vitals, cue 15 minutes.
- Relax.

558
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,297
Nobody's ever been
Tasered this long before.

559
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,534
- It's publishable.
- You should get some rest.

560
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,432
I'd hug you guys but
I can't lift my arms.

561
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,741
- Hey.
- You look better.

562
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,613
- Feeling better. JORDAN:
I'll go home before work.

563
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:10,941
I'll call you tomorrow?

564
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,776
Sounds good. JORDAN: Okay.

565
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:32,463
- Hey, thanks a lot for your help.
- I think it's gonna be okay.

566
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,974
It's just hard thinking a piece of a
girl I fell in love with is gonna go on...

567
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,978
and have a life I won't be
a part of, won't know about.

568
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,316
You guys will still be
friends, I'm pretty sure.

569
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,316
It's not the same.

570
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,152
Heart's just an organ, right?

571
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,205
Whew. It's almost 6 a.m.

572
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,503
It's like a ghost
town in here for once.

573
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:13,770
Yeah.

574
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:17,109
Exam 4 is open. Why
don't you go take a rest.

575
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,246
Maybe I will.

576
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,119
The last time I checked,
the rack's all clear.

577
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:27,053
Well, I have at least a
good hour of paperwork.

578
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,056
Yep. I'm all done.

579
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,785
Lucky you.

580
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,522
Well, it's my third
night in a row.

581
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,496
I am pretty beat.

582
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:40,162
Well, you have time to go
rest before the shift change.

583
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,865
Yeah, good.

584
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,373
And thanks.
