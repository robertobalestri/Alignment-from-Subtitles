1
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,899
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,669
- Why you working the night before boards?
- Supposed to be Morris. He has them too.

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,075
You get stuck on the test:
Squeeze this, the answer will come.

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,443
That was so cool,
defending us to Moretti.

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,609
We were just discussing
different teaching philosophies.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,584
Yours is better, which is why
there's no way I'll present to him.

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,088
My girlfriend, Lacey, her
homecoming dance is coming up.

8
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,920
Help me. I'm a virgin.

9
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:29,689
I'm not a nun. I'm a woman
who happens to be a chaplain.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,923
- You been going to meetings?
- Yes.

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,934
It's like I'm actually
trying to screw things up.

12
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,401
<i>A third straight day of
unseasonably hot weather...</i>

13
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,511
<i>reaching into triple figures has
resulted in sporadic power failures.</i>

14
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,842
Soon they'll be blaming
this on global warming.

15
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,712
All those years of plastic cups and
Styrofoam are coming home to roost.

16
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,753
So because I've used spraycan
deodorant my whole life...

17
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:32,017
now I'm supposed to feel guilty about
the resurgence of the malaria in Kenya?

18
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,387
You talk so crazy, Frank.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,755
I read it in the paper.

20
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,488
I read that cow farts are
gonna be the death of us.

21
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:38,825
Cow farts?

22
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,333
We eat too much livestock, which
release gases into the atmosphere...

23
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,528
- killing the ozone.
- Thank you, Al Gore.

24
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,766
I would rather drop dead right
now over a bone-in rib eye...

25
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,103
than live forever
on organic spinach.

26
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,768
The truth is very inconvenient.

27
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,847
I don't know about the rest of
you, but I have gotten smart.

28
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:57,211
I hooked up with a
tight, little sex machine.

29
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,615
Energy-efficient to the tune
of 40-plus miles per gallon...

30
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,621
and draws babes to
Archie like bees to honey.

31
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,123
Oh, that made me throw
up in my mouth a little.

32
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,886
Me too. ABBY: What about Hope?

33
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,428
Didn't you take an oath
of fidelity or something?

34
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,295
She's saving starving kids in Venezuela,
you're out here cruising for chicks?

35
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,402
Hope, Hope, Hope? Oh, that Hope.

36
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,129
Yeah, we broke up.

37
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,206
No, you didn't.

38
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,371
You did? I'm sorry.

39
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,637
- No, no big deal, it was very mutual.
- That's good.

40
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,213
Except it was her idea,
I begged her not to do it.

41
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,374
But I'm fine with it
now, it's all good.

42
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,418
- Lady for you on three, chief.
- Hope she chokes on a mojito.

43
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,556
Your ex-wife. Something
about your son.

44
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,715
Oh, all right. I'll
take it in there.

45
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,159
- He was married?
- Poor woman.

46
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,129
Oh, the very person
we're looking for.

47
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,596
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,395
- What's he doing?
- Oh, don't forget the clutch, dummy.

49
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,004
You said I could teach
him to drive your car today.

50
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,265
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,602
No, that was before I
hooked up my new wheels.

52
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,404
- But...
- You have new wheels? Cool.

53
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,636
No, no, not cool.

54
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:02,340
I'm not gonna let some prepubescent
intern ding up my chick magnet.

55
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,074
Is it? For reals?

56
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,083
This car makes a statement.

57
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,848
And that statement is "I
am bringing sexy back."

58
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,082
- Sweet.
- Hello?

59
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,750
He's got his homecoming.
He wants to drive his date.

60
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,247
- Give the kid a break.
- What...?

61
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,142
Had to pull strings to get this. You
can't buy one of these babies yet.

62
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,431
I'll get you the number
of that new PACU nurse.

63
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,264
- The one from Nashville?
- I heard she was in the circus.

64
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,633
She does look flexible.

65
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:27,866
All right.

66
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,134
Okay, fine.

67
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,504
Now, let's see.

68
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:32,837
What are you doing?

69
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,505
A walk-around, make sure
it comes back the same.

70
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,880
- God, you're so anal.
- Pristine, beautiful, unblemished.

71
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,181
- Thank you, Dr. Morris.
- Now, let's run down a few things here.

72
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,722
- Harold, the brake.
- Hey, wait a minute.

73
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,359
Harold, Harold.

74
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,789
Be careful, Harold.

75
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,724
Stay aware of your surroundings.

76
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,660
It's all about peripheral... Uh!

77
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,461
What we're talking
about here is pain.

78
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,727
Proactively treating it right here
in Triage with you guys, all right?

79
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,234
Most of you know how to
use the Wong-Baker scale.

80
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,067
Any kid coming in, we
assess the pain from zero to 10.

81
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,733
Any score above zero,
we give them analgesia.

82
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,071
Put it on your charts.
Docs will be checking.

83
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,738
- Someone's been Moretti-sized.
- Mm-hm. Gates drank Kool-Aid.

84
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,148
- How old?
- Three months.

85
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,082
- She's been like this for hours.
- Okay.

86
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,914
- Fussy, crying.
- Probably the heat.

87
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,919
- Chuny, you take her back?
- I got this.

88
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,684
- Come on, follow me.
- It's never been this bad before.

89
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,885
- All right, here, check this out.
- Guys, stop goofing around.

90
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,054
- Victim of auto versus pedestrian.
- Possible blunt head trauma.

91
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,030
The car didn't hit me, I
walked into it. I told them that.

92
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,864
- What's with the backboard?
- Patient resisted treatment.

93
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,905
- I don't meet trauma center criteria.
- What do we have here?

94
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,541
- Combative on scene.
- I wasn't.

95
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,542
- Little bit, little bit.
- Because I don't need any of this.

96
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,010
- He might need a head CT.
- Definite possibility.

97
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,276
What? No, no, and I don't
need spinal immobilization.

98
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,009
No, you need an x-ray,
sir, before you take this off.

99
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,281
No, the hell you do,
and stop calling me sir.

100
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,957
Could be a distracting injury.

101
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,423
I'm gonna distract
your face with my foot.

102
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,027
Look. Huh? Huh? I'm fine.

103
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,860
All this wasted energy is seriously
inflating my carbon footprint.

104
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:36,128
- So are you refusing medical care, sir?
- Yes, yes, I am.

105
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:40,035
You're gonna sign a form indicating
you're leaving ER against medical advice?

106
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,642
You're wasting valuable
time and resources...

107
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,745
on this silly, little
comedy routine.

108
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,073
Stupid doors.

109
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,643
Next time that happens,
give him a Foley in the field.

110
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,259
Make sure your grandma follows
up with the clinic visits, okay, Jeffrey?

111
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,396
And a happy
<i>L'shanah tova</i> to you.

112
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,163
Oh, nice try. Jewish New
Year was two months ago.

113
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,830
- Oh, I got you your musicians.
- My what?

114
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,568
You said you wanted help brightening
up the place, alleviating the misery.

115
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:22,148
So, Ken and Willow
Monterey, this is Dr. Gates.

116
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,840
Oh, hello, thanks for having us.

117
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,610
This is our first time in the
ER. We're super excited.

118
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,345
We mostly perform in Pedes.

119
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,454
Love bringing joy
to the little people.

120
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,992
But this gives us a chance to
dig a bit deeper into the old set list.

121
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,587
Oh, good.

122
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,697
All right, well, make
yourself at home.

123
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,169
Where'd you find them, God Camp?

124
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,172
Oh, man, I almost forgot. Is
it...? It is. Today is the day.

125
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,837
- What day?
- D-day or Independence Day.

126
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,677
- Starting to sound like Stupid Day.
- Don't push me, Sam.

127
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,012
It's hot, I don't know
where my smart car is.

128
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,051
Greg and I get our
board results today.

129
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,350
I'm worried about him. I'm not
sure he hit the books hard enough.

130
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,460
- Hey, Vin Diesel, where's my car?
- Parked around the corner.

131
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,027
Gotta go to a laparotomy.

132
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,324
- Zelinsky, did you damage that vehicle?
- No, not that I know of.

133
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,161
Well, yeah, a little.

134
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,854
- What? NEELA: Tiny
ding on the fender.

135
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,562
- Miniscule.
- Gives it character.

136
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,138
- Personality.
- You'll hardly notice it, I gotta go.

137
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,333
Air conditioner broke
down at nursing home.

138
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,501
Victims with hyperthermia
and dehydration.

139
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,169
Another five coming in the van.

140
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,713
It turned our place into
Kentucky Fried Old Folks.

141
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:29,975
How you doing, sir?

142
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,746
I did not survive a pogrom, a
gulag and a bris in a back alley...

143
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,218
just so I could be
baked like a strudel.

144
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,553
This is J.J. Perkins, 80 years
old. ALOC, history of hypertension.

145
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,319
Previous MI, temp high of 104.

146
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,894
- Mr. Perkins.
- Thirsty.

147
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,395
Positive O sign. Not good.

148
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,226
Is he okay? We're roommates.

149
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,890
Hey, Grady, get some
more wheelchairs.

150
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,536
Power shortage, my ass.

151
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,832
The engineers are selling off
the energy to the highest bidder...

152
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,907
just like they
did in California.

153
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,011
You know who's
getting it all? The Pakis.

154
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,704
Hey, where'd they put my buddy?

155
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,857
Do you think our
apartment's too hot for her?

156
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,396
I can't say yet.

157
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,427
Any vomiting or diarrhea?

158
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,593
No, none of that.

159
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:29,270
Does anything help to calm her
down, car rides or noise machines?

160
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,138
She doesn't like
any noise, really.

161
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,643
Even music.

162
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,271
Well, I can't say I blame
her for that right now.

163
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,908
Our doctor thought it might be
reflux, so she ordered the scope test.

164
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,954
- Uh-huh. And?
- Everything came out normal.

165
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,614
Do you think it could be colic?

166
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,625
Well, we have to rule
out some other stuff first.

167
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,555
- How are you guys holding up?
- Um...

168
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,494
It's been kind of hard.

169
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,898
With the heat and the brownouts.

170
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,973
She just seems so
unhappy all the time.

171
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,436
It gets easier.

172
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,506
It does.

173
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,441
I'm gonna run this by
my supervisor. I'll be back.

174
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,678
Now, the next time that
the power goes out...

175
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,411
don't go using jumper
cables to juice up the a.c.

176
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,751
Where I went wrong was I had
the widescreen and massage chair...

177
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,517
hooked up to the same battery.

178
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,158
See you.

179
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,132
Three-month-old, intermittently
crying times three months.

180
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,362
The kid's whole life?

181
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,700
If it's been that long,
it's not an emergency.

182
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,968
The kid looks okay,
afebrile, alert, fontanel's flat...

183
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,305
no signs of injury,
and the exam's benign.

184
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,643
Of course it is. Exam's always
normal with babies like this.

185
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,780
I'll check it out
as soon as I can.

186
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,979
I got to take care of
this. Where is Gates?

187
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,522
No, more importantly,
where are our board results?

188
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,159
Oh, they're not in yet.

189
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,886
But the Vegas odds are
10-to-1 you both failed.

190
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,031
Tell Gates get rid
of Captain & Tenille.

191
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,565
We're healing people,
not driving them to suicide.

192
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,395
Are you nervous
about the results?

193
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,662
No. Are you?

194
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,032
No.

195
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,869
- You get those old folks all fixed up?
- Moretti ordered evaporative cooling.

196
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,237
I got Javier babysitting.

197
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,504
All right, let me know
if you need any help.

198
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,377
Patient was in his usual
state of excellent health...

199
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,388
until 1 p.m. today when he
got up from the living room...

200
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,753
Okay, stop. I'm bored and lost.

201
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,589
- You're gonna put him to sleep.
- But that's the history.

202
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,560
Yes, presented in
the most obtuse way.

203
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,223
- What do you think is wrong?
- Dehydration.

204
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,995
Okay, spit it out, so
Mussolini doesn't eat you alive.

205
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,571
And can you please
shoot me or shoot them?

206
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,674
I really don't care which.

207
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,537
- How's it going?
- It's weird.

208
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,009
- Hi.
- This music seems to be soothing her.

209
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,613
That is weird.

210
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,682
My supervisor's on his way
over. Okay, Grady, one more time.

211
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,548
Sixty-five-year-old man, syncopal
episode after skipping breakfast and lunch.

212
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,055
- I know what you're thinking.
- No chest pains, palpitation, headache.

213
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,022
That's what I'm talking about.

214
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,185
- Please, make them go away.
- I'm with her.

215
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,694
What do you want me to do?

216
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,023
Get rid of them. ALL: Yeah.

217
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,566
Guys, what they're doing
is a nice thing, okay?

218
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,396
And some people
actually like it.

219
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,731
Oh, yeah, what people?

220
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,765
Frank's not people.

221
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,141
I'll see what I can do.

222
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,973
Grady, break room. It's
time to present, come on.

223
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,238
Hey, here's an update, folks.

224
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,317
Green Line is down. Scattered
looting on the West Side.

225
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,147
We got two x-ray machines out.

226
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,549
The temperature in
the O.R. is 84 degrees.

227
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,247
And...

228
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,086
Oh, that's right, boys,
the test scores are in.

229
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,422
- What? MORRIS: What?
Why didn't you say so?

230
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,758
Stop playing games,
Frank. Here you go.

231
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,890
Hey.

232
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,263
You got us waiting like this.

233
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,596
So did the Medical Board make
another deadly error in judgment?

234
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,408
- Yes, they have, Frank, I passed.
- Yeah.

235
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,742
Congratulations.

236
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,813
Morris? Come on, baby.

237
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,506
Yeah, it's good, it's all good.

238
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,517
They passed, Morris and Pratt passed.
- My man, good stuff.

239
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,451
All right, after work,
drinks on me and Morris.

240
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,106
<i>You stole her, didn't you?</i>

241
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,497
<i>- What?
- She's mine.</i>

242
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,725
<i>- Says who?
- Says me.</i>

243
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,870
<i>- Yeah, well, she came to me.</i>
- Damn power.

244
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,732
I keep telling
you, it's the Pakis.

245
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,498
Oh, that's not nice, honey.

246
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,369
Chuny, how's Mrs. Lidner?

247
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,875
Down to 99. She's perking up.

248
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,036
Chest x-ray clear,
no hypernatremia.

249
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,240
Hey, you should see
this, J.J. It's very good.

250
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,543
What's it called again?

251
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,346
<i>Grumpy Old Men.</i>

252
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,488
- How's Mr. Perkins doing?
- Oh, he's fine.

253
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,556
Hey, he's better.
Leave him alone.

254
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,919
Minimally responsive.

255
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,559
Tachy to 130, having
some ectopy on the monitor.

256
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,162
Hey, we were hot and thirsty.

257
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,195
We don't need any
more witchy medicine.

258
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,526
Shh. MORRIS: Temp?

259
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,979
The cooling blanket didn't help.

260
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,093
He's still at 103.

261
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,867
Mr. Perkins?

262
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,099
Don't do that. What
are you doing to him?

263
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,437
- Neck's stiff, are we missing meningitis?
- Increased muscle tone.

264
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,170
Let's go, Trauma 2.

265
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,577
Blood cultures, two
milligrams Ceftriaxone.

266
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,513
- Get head a CT.
- You're not a doctor.

267
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,119
I want a real doctor.
You're just some quack.

268
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,687
- Calm down.
- He's gonna be all right, right?

269
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:13,224
Of course. Relax.

270
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,561
<i>Is that it?</i>

271
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,529
Worse when I press?

272
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,861
Or let go?

273
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,401
The same. DUBENKO: CT?

274
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,072
White count is 11.2.

275
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,869
Mildly inflamed appendix that
doesn't fill with oral contrast.

276
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,808
- Looks like early appendicitis.
- Oh, jeez, I need surgery?

277
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,380
Take it out laparoscopically,
you'll be back home.

278
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,609
Might we be jumping the gun here?
An alternate diagnosis to consider.

279
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:43,154
- It could be epiploic appendagitis.
- Rather unlikely, doctor.

280
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,224
- So in terms of the laparoscopic...
- He hasn't been vomiting.

281
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,985
He's got a normal white count.

282
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:53,558
No single sign, symptom or test confirms
the diagnosis of appendicitis, okay?

283
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,269
- As I was saying...
- Just hold the phone.

284
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,098
- CT isn't impressive.
- Dr. Zelinsky.

285
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,398
- Harold.
- Dr. Zelinsky.

286
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,565
I'm onto something, he'll get
better with rest, nonsteroidals.

287
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,268
- He won't need surgery.
- So I don't need surgery?

288
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,808
That's not what we're saying.

289
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:13,578
His CT lacks all of the predictable
findings to support your theory, okay?

290
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:16,279
I don't want an unnecessary
operation. Are you sure?

291
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,391
Very sure. Dr. Rasgotra will
be back to consent for surgery.

292
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,112
- I'll see you in the
O.R. NEELA: Okay.

293
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,592
Thanks, Mary.

294
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,758
Dr. Dubenko, I'm interested in
why you think that the CT shows...

295
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,595
no signs of an
ovoid pericolic...

296
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,100
Shut up now.

297
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,328
Go round.

298
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,837
Drinks at Ike's on Morris
and Pratt. They passed.

299
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,941
- Wow, great.
- Uh-huh.

300
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,102
- I'd like to discuss Zelinsky's progress.
- Yeah, about that...

301
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,042
- Tomorrow, not now.
- Tomorrow?

302
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:45,117
I don't wanna say anything cruel,
which I'm at risk of doing at this moment.

303
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,345
So we'll talk about
Dr. Rain Man tomorrow.

304
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,836
Can you help me out
here, please, a little?

305
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,183
You want me to
fire the volunteers?

306
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,556
Yes, in a nice way.

307
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,289
Look, they love them in Pedes.

308
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,865
They're a hit in Oncology.

309
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,025
Why do you ER types
have to be such snobs?

310
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,465
Just do what God would do.

311
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,798
Cast these people out.

312
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,706
Nice, the mocking use of religious
imagery always works with me.

313
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,845
I'm just trying to speak to you
in a language you understand.

314
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,447
Bye.

315
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:23,883
Still having ectopy.

316
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,854
Three hundred amiodarone IV.

317
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,223
So chest pain in 3 should've
had an EKG and troponin.

318
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,921
But the resident
canceled the orders.

319
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,589
He's breathing. Sats okay.

320
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,428
Hey, Dawn, bring them in.

321
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,503
- What resident?
- Lockhart, did you sign off on it?

322
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,833
Must've been Pratt. I'm
sure there was a good reason.

323
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,600
What are you doing to J.J.?

324
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,868
Shh.

325
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,874
Mr. Lefkowitz, did Mr. Perkins
have any new pills at the home?

326
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,949
Always giving us pills. You
can't poop, they give you a pill.

327
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,382
Complain about the
government, you get a pill.

328
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,918
Can you be more specific?

329
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,251
Try to get people to vote for
Obama, they got a pill for that too.

330
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,053
<i>Papi,</i> listen. Did they
give J.J. anything today?

331
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,628
He got feisty, because
it was so hot in there.

332
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,458
Does this look
familiar? How about this?

333
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,224
Maybe this, it was yellow.

334
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,527
Bingo, Haloperidol.

335
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,431
I bet he's got neuroleptic
malignant syndrome.

336
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,006
- Interesting theory.
- Dantrolene, a hundred milligrams IV.

337
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,206
I'm pretty sure
what we have here...

338
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,438
is a beautiful, healthy little
girl with a bad case of colic.

339
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,213
That's what the
pediatrician said.

340
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,217
Is there nothing you can do?
No medicines you can give her?

341
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,979
No, you just
have to wait it out.

342
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,750
But it's too hot to keep
her all wrapped up like that.

343
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,291
A book said to do that
when she gets fussy.

344
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,760
Not in this weather. Feel the
blanket, she sweated right through it.

345
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,627
That's normal. She gets all
worked up when she feeds.

346
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,132
Well, just hang in there.

347
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,066
A nurse will be back with your
discharge paperwork. Abby?

348
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:51,968
Do me a favor. Get some kind of referral
for new parenting group or something.

349
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,636
That's it? You don't wanna
do any more workup?

350
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,806
For colic? No, why?

351
00:16:56,983 --> 00:17:00,147
- There's no need, it's classic.
- Well, it's not classic, actually.

352
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,653
When I worked in OB, we did a lot
of anticipatory guidance about this.

353
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,349
Colic doesn't usually
start until six weeks of life.

354
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,994
- Baby's been fussy since birth.
- Hasn't killed her.

355
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,460
But the sweating when
she feeds could be an...

356
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,692
It's a million degrees outside.
Her parents keep her wrapped up.

357
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,960
I have a feeling...

358
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,833
Look, this is a long-term preexisting
condition with no signs of abuse.

359
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,975
Let them follow up
with the pediatrician.

360
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,769
And, Abby, relax, okay?

361
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,378
You're now talking to a
board-certified attending.

362
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,445
You still have to
take the oral boards.

363
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,640
Nothing but a mere technicality.

364
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,307
See you at Ike's?

365
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,453
So we done with them?

366
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,855
- The Birk baby?
- Um, yeah.

367
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,964
Hey, wait, no. Sorry.

368
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,967
Hold on, I just wanna
check one more thing.

369
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:51,036
Hey, you coming out tonight?
It's Brownout Thursday at Ike's.

370
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,231
- Drinks half price if you bring a candle.
- I thought Pratt and Morris were buying.

371
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,876
Only a round. Cheap bastards.

372
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,740
- Come on, let loose for a night.
- I'll think about it.

373
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,544
Your a.c. is putting out air at
77 degrees through this duct.

374
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,379
You mean, it's working?

375
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,384
But it's 62 degrees
at the compressor.

376
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,681
That's a lot of waste.

377
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,187
Hey, Frank, what's going on?

378
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,825
Oh, the green Nazis are here.

379
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,257
Oh, you must be
the energy manager.

380
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,158
Ethan Mackiner. And you are?

381
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,697
Sam Taggart, charge
nurse. I spoke to your office.

382
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,199
We made sure to change all the
incandescents for compact fluorescents.

383
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,168
- We're down to 30-foot candles.
- That's very green of you.

384
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,398
Just doing our part.

385
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,940
Maybe you can show me
where the utility access is.

386
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,577
Sure. Come with me.

387
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,538
I'm going out back and burn
some tires with kerosene.

388
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,183
You good with that?

389
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,251
I'm leaving these for Sam.

390
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,751
You're out of here already?
What about the party?

391
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,584
God, it's like junior
high around here.

392
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:45,850
Hi. Bye.

393
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,584
Shift over already?

394
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,285
Pratt's up to speed on my stuff.

395
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,455
Your intern presented to me.

396
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,656
Did he forget to kiss the ring?

397
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,800
No, in fact, Grady
was letter-perfect.

398
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,462
Which I'm sure had absolutely
nothing to do with you.

399
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,240
Absolutely nothing.

400
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,648
Doctor.

401
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,784
- Doctor.
- Yeah.

402
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,149
I understand you've been
canceling my preemptive orders.

403
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,290
In selected cases, I have, yes.

404
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,685
On what criteria?

405
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,750
A 20-year-old with epigastric
pain from ibuprofen...

406
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,657
doesn't need CBC,
chem panel, UA.

407
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,389
He needs to be sent
home with some antacid.

408
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,794
That's an exception.

409
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,236
I mean, the system is the
system, and the system is working.

410
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,736
Yeah, not for me.

411
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,601
I didn't go to med school to
check boxes and push paper.

412
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,644
When are you gonna stop
with the end-runs, huh?

413
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,111
Huh? I mean, what is it?

414
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,342
Feel comfortable with Dr. Pratt
because you've worked with him?

415
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,249
Or is this just like the
path of least resistance?

416
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,287
Or is it simply you
just don't like me?

417
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,015
What?

418
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,424
You know, it doesn't matter.

419
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,687
- What, if I like you or not?
- No, forget it.

420
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,160
No, I don't like you.

421
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,491
You know what?

422
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,531
You do whatever the
hell you want, okay?

423
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,169
And I hope it all
works out for you.

424
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,441
Folks, local power grid
might be going down.

425
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,411
But don't worry, we're prepared.

426
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,517
Somebody gonna make
a toast or something?

427
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,620
Nobody's saying anything until
my partner in crime gets here.

428
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,655
Oh, and by the way, I know
I'm still on, so this is 7 and 7.

429
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,521
Minus one of the sevens.
Can you guess which one?

430
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,255
Hey, here he is. ALL: Hey.

431
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,956
I can't stay long. Somebody's
gotta mind the store.

432
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,863
Well, then allow me.

433
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,266
We are gonna talk later. I
saw what you did to my car.

434
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,307
- Is he mad at me?
- No. He is.

435
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,377
Fair amount of failures as well.

436
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,208
But I think it's important that we all
reflect and appreciate the milestones.

437
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:55,446
So I would like to be the first to
congratulate Dr. Pratt and Dr. Morris...

438
00:20:55,621 --> 00:21:00,525
who will become newly-minted,
soon to be board-certified...

439
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,322
Attending emergency physicians.

440
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,664
This chaplain thing is
really more of a hobby.

441
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,369
My true passion
is hustling pool.

442
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,304
I see.

443
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,405
You know, I gotta tell you.

444
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,571
To be honest with you, you don't
really strike me as the chaplain type.

445
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,841
And why is that?

446
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:30,149
I don't know, you don't look the part.
The way you dress, your vibe, your tat.

447
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,018
Oh, I have lots of tats.

448
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,921
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

449
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,694
What is that one?

450
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,225
It's a labyrinth. It's a pretty
common symbol, actually.

451
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,890
In the Native American
culture and the Vedas.

452
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,729
The Minoans use it too.

453
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,168
It represents
life's real journey.

454
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,399
The spiritual journey
to the inner self.

455
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,209
Reminds me every day that I
have to constantly be seeking.

456
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,054
And how easy it is to get lost.

457
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:04,849
Have you been lost?

458
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,257
Haven't you?

459
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,022
So, what other tats you got?

460
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,473
- Harold was just trying to impress you.
- I thought we weren't gonna talk now.

461
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,648
I don't understand
why you don't like him.

462
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,613
- He's unshaped, he's immature...
- Smart.

463
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,877
That's not enough.

464
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,816
He's a little rough
around the edges.

465
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,480
But instead of getting hung
up about the presentation...

466
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,990
we should start commending
him on the insight.

467
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,822
And by we, I, of
course, mean you.

468
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,189
He's not ready to be a
surgeon on my team, Neela.

469
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,665
Lucien, he wants
to be here so badly.

470
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,895
And I believe he can do it.

471
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,707
You really wanna
mentor this kid?

472
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,311
Well, if you agree
not to kick him out.

473
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,174
Give me a month?

474
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,249
It's not just about turning
him into a doctor, Neela.

475
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,647
It's about turning
him into an adult.

476
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,150
Do you understand that?

477
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,721
Oh, hey, guys, looks
like I'm getting kicked out.

478
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,018
Check you on the flip side.

479
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,826
Okay, you got a month.

480
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:22,132
It's weird to think of Morris
and Pratt as the top of the heap.

481
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:26,363
I still remember when Mark Greene
and Doug Ross were running the place.

482
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,006
Who?

483
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,199
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey.

484
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,868
I came over as soon as I
was done with my evaluation.

485
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,308
- This is Chuny.
- Hi.

486
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,039
- And Dawn.
- Hey.

487
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,649
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

488
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,877
- Need anything from the bar?
- No, I'm good.

489
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,616
Apple martini.

490
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,881
Coming up.

491
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,823
Hello?

492
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,456
- What?
- What's up with the fine brother?

493
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,636
He wanted to see if I wanted
to have a drink after work...

494
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,202
What about your hunky beat cop?

495
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,976
- You sly dog.
- No, no, no, it's not like that.

496
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,839
Just...

497
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:11,211
You know that time in your life when
you're in your teens or your early 20s?

498
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,249
You know, when you
get to look around...

499
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,650
see what you like and
what you don't like?

500
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,914
You mean, like positions?

501
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,693
No, like, well, I
never had that.

502
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,193
And I think I should.

503
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:27,197
So now is my chance.

504
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,527
You know what I mean?

505
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,547
- Oh, yeah, we know what you mean.
- Mm-hm.

506
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,730
The boy in the blue
wasn't hitting that buzzer.

507
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,101
Guys, that's not true.

508
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,606
Apple martini.

509
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,676
I miss something?

510
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,180
Let's hope you don't.

511
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,911
Excuse me. Hey, hey, hey,
is this where the party is?

512
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,783
Hey, you made it. - Hey, girl.

513
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,082
Hey. ABBY: Hey.

514
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,191
Abby, what's happening? - Hey.

515
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,351
It does not look
very festive in here.

516
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,225
- Better.
- Oh, no, no, no.

517
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,230
- Better.
- Do I have to?

518
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
Frank.

519
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,869
Frank.

520
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,131
I love Frank.

521
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,131
Frank never misses a party.

522
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,535
- Yeah.
- Where you been?

523
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,735
Nowhere.

524
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,208
Sam. SAM: Yes?

525
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,472
You look fantastic.

526
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,046
- Oh, I do?
- You look so hot.

527
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,308
Oh, yeah.

528
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,146
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

529
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,651
You're getting some, aren't you?

530
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,652
You are.

531
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,488
- Hi.
- Hey.

532
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,856
Who's he? Who are you?

533
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:34,263
Ethan, Ethan Mackiner. I work
for the county as an energy...

534
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,924
Rowr.

535
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,001
Hello.

536
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,365
Look at his eyes.

537
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,999
He's very sincere. Hey.

538
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,638
Congratulations.

539
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:49,179
- All right, let's get you some coffee.
- Oh, no.

540
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,441
Thank you. No, thank you, boss.

541
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,246
It's a night to
celebrate, right? Right?

542
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,184
Tonight is a night
to celebrate, right?

543
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,118
- Am I right, Chuny?
- You are right.

544
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,952
What...?

545
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,920
What is Chuny short for, anyway?

546
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,493
Nothing, just Chuny.

547
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,324
Actually, my real name is Ethel.

548
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,591
- Get out.
- I'm serious.

549
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,530
Frank, put that hat back on.

550
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,794
Abby.

551
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,699
- Hi.
- Hey.

552
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,134
Uh-oh. Surgeons are here.

553
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:18,175
You guys better be careful,
because you are outnumbered.

554
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,279
And if there's a throw
down, we will kick your ass.

555
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,976
Oh, is there gonna
be a throw down?

556
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,045
You never know, Lucien.

557
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,685
You never know.

558
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,822
Heads up.

559
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,354
Nice.

560
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,550
- Um. Who wants a drink?
- No, I'm good.

561
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,490
Anybody?

562
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,333
What's up? It's
a party, cheer up.

563
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,566
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, just blowing off some steam.

564
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,943
Hey, hey, hey.

565
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,855
Hi.

566
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,149
Hi.

567
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,325
I didn't expect to see you here.

568
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:14,092
Oh, well, yeah, I...

569
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:18,203
I had a babysitter, so I just
figured, you know, what the hell?

570
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,907
Can I get something, please?

571
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,881
Hey, look, about before...

572
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,717
You shouldn't do that, you know.

573
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,550
What?

574
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,896
What you've been doing.

575
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,290
What have I been doing?

576
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,768
Playing a tyrant,
and then flirting.

577
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,137
Flirting?

578
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:58,641
Yeah, you should stop that.

579
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,903
Okay.

580
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,808
I was not aware
that I was flirting.

581
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,276
I'm not stupid, you know.

582
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,417
No, I know, I never
said you were stupid.

583
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,917
Okay, good, because I get it.

584
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:13,889
And you come in here on your
white horse, and you just figure...

585
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:15,920
What?

586
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,585
What?

587
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,762
What do I figure?

588
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:29,835
Nothing.

589
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,271
You just figure.

590
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,105
- Abby, hey.
- Hey.

591
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,771
I just got paged back on the Birk
baby. She's been screaming for an hour.

592
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,815
Parents are threatening
to sign out AMA.

593
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,850
- Who?
- The baby we saw.

594
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:47,192
Oh. Yes, sorry. That's her prerogative,
their prerogative, their prerogative.

595
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,457
You were supposed
to discharge them.

596
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:53,463
Now, instead, they're waiting on studies
someone ordered without my permission.

597
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,192
Studies that this
kid doesn't need.

598
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,634
Now, do you have any
idea who could've done that?

599
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,205
Was it me?

600
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,838
You know what?
Let's take this outside.

601
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,274
Okay.

602
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:18,483
Okay, if I ordered tests, I'm sure
I had a very good reason, Greg.

603
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:22,059
- Even if you don't remember it?
- I remember it, I just...

604
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,958
What's the big deal? Chest
film shouldn't take this long.

605
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,567
It does when half the x-ray
machines in the hospital are down.

606
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,898
You totally disregarded my
instructions to send these people home.

607
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,632
Okay, power trip, what do you
want? I'll go over there, discharge them.

608
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,298
What? No, you can't be serious.

609
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,206
It's your party.
Cry if you want to.

610
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,040
- I'll take care of it.
- No, no, no.

611
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,047
- What? Get off me.
- You're not going in the ER like this.

612
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,809
Like what?

613
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,416
- Hey.
- Like what? Huh?

614
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,213
What?

615
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,551
You know, I don't know
what your problem is...

616
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:56,024
but you should really take
a cab home right now, really.

617
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,334
Whatever.

618
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,270
Both guests of honor are
gone. This place is kind of dead.

619
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,933
I know a little blues place
over by Northwestern.

620
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,237
I know where we can go.

621
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,404
There's a place. Salsa
nights on Thursdays.

622
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,707
Now you're talking.

623
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:17,941
Hey, hey, hey, Abby.

624
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,085
We're getting ready
to go somewhere else.

625
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,345
You wanna come?

626
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,046
No, I'm just gonna finish
this and get out of here.

627
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,919
- You sure?
- Yeah, but have fun.

628
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,421
Did you drive here?

629
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,088
- No.
- Okay.

630
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,635
I got his attention.

631
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,571
Oh...

632
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,980
Thank you.

633
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,980
- Everything okay?
- Yes, work thing, we fixed it.

634
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,424
- So where's your husband? He's in...?
- Croatia.

635
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,586
Croatia?

636
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:08,825
- How much longer is he gonna be there?
- Oh, you have to ask him that.

637
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,437
Because he was supposed
to be home weeks ago.

638
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:15,805
It's hard to...

639
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:20,435
It's complicated to balance the whole,
you know, the kids and the spouse.

640
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,640
You wanna hear about a
complicated life? I will make you cry.

641
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,219
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

642
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,013
Really?

643
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,255
Sorry.

644
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:43,263
- Look, what you said before, when you...
- Yeah, forget about it, I...

645
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,461
Listen to me. I'm an asshole.

646
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,932
I know.

647
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:51,543
- You're not, you're not.
- Well, just forget about it, really.

648
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,177
- All right, all right.
- Okay?

649
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,217
- It's a good thing about Pratt and Morris.
- Yes.

650
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,285
- It's good.
- Here's to Pratt and Morris.

651
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,354
Yup, Pratt and Morris.

652
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,395
- Sorry, sir. No problem.
- Sorry about that.

653
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:16,331
We ain't closing for no stinking blackout
either, all right? Next round's on me.

654
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,321
Damn.

655
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,427
Power's back.

656
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,868
This family shouldn't
even be here.

657
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,271
Well, plan was
chest x-ray, an EKG...

658
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,038
and then discharge if the
studies are normal, right?

659
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,612
That was Abby's plan, not mine.

660
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,108
How's she doing?

661
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:41,515
She's been sweating and breathing
really fast ever since I fed her.

662
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,712
- She's retracting. MORRIS:
And really diaphoretic.

663
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,790
No fever, her temp's normal.

664
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,654
You guys better check this out.

665
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,124
Heart's big.

666
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,856
Lungs are wet. She's in failure.

667
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,898
- What's the sat?
- I don't know.

668
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,762
- You don't know?
- I'll do one now.

669
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,495
So all this started happening
after she had a bottle?

670
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,005
Sweating with feeds is
a sign of heart disease.

671
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,040
- What's going on?
- You're confusing us.

672
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,405
Tell us what's going on.

673
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,707
Heart's not pumping strong,
fluid's backing up into her lungs.

674
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,043
- She doesn't have an IV?
- She was going home.

675
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,210
- Get me an IV kit.
- And where's the EKG Abby ordered?

676
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,480
- I haven't done it yet.
- We're moving to 1.

677
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,420
- I don't know your name...
- Tiffany.

678
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,686
- That EKG was ordered hours ago.
- We didn't have neonatal leads.

679
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,194
- I called Central supply.
- Central takes forever.

680
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,992
You can't wait for
them. Run to NICU, run.

681
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,500
- Get those leads and get back here.
- Where did you find that one?

682
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,701
You don't wanna have a glass of
water, a cup of coffee, something?

683
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,035
No, I gotta go.

684
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,369
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

685
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,512
What happened?
How did I get here?

686
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,443
Well, I mean...

687
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,743
Look, why don't you stay for a little
bit? Don't drive right now, it's late.

688
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,078
- I don't think you should go, wait.
- I gotta go.

689
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,917
- Wait a minute.
- I gotta go to Joe.

690
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,523
What are you doing? Don't.

691
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,751
All right, sorry.

692
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,621
Dr. Morris?

693
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,459
Is she...?

694
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,764
- Sure the leads aren't reversed?
- I checked three times.

695
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,065
- Look at the lateral leads.
- Oh, damn.

696
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,105
Call Cards. We're on our way up.

697
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,712
Blood flow to your baby's heart's
been compromised. We're not sure how.

698
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,438
An EKG shows the classic
pattern of an acute MI.

699
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,948
- An MI? What's an MI?
- Your daughter's having a heart attack.

700
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,211
- Let's go.
- Oh, God.

701
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:24,117
We're taking her to cath lab.
We're gonna do everything.

702
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,053
You told us to go home.

703
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,056
You said we should go home.

704
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,923
Why did you tell us to leave?

705
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:36,125
He told us to go home.

706
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,564
I don't know, officer.

707
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:39,932
I don't know.

708
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,002
Okay. It's okay, she's home now.

709
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,612
- Doris, I'm really sorry, I'm so sorry.
- It's almost 3 in the morning.

710
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,941
I know, I'm really sorry.
And you can go now.

711
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,447
But he...

712
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,778
He slept the whole
time, right? He just slept?

713
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:55,853
Are you okay? What's the matter?

714
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,353
Here you go, just take that.

715
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,252
Take that and take that.

716
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,858
And you can go now. Take that.

717
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,927
Maybe I should stay.
You're worrying me.

718
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,426
No, I'm okay, hon. I'm fine.

719
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:08,590
- I can call my mother, tell her I won't...
- Oh, my God, please get out of here.

720
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,142
Hi, hi.

721
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,968
Hey, Joe.

722
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,641
Hey, buddy.

723
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,316
How you doing?

724
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,783
We're gonna go
see your daddy, huh?

725
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,888
It's gonna be okay.

726
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,116
All right, sweetie.

727
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,307
It's all right.

728
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,072
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

729
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,010
It's okay.

730
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,046
Hey, taxi.

731
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,551
I'm going to O'Hare.

732
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,582
International. Ow!

733
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,060
Lady, you can't hold
the kid like that in here.

734
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,357
It's okay, just go.

735
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:48,591
Go.

736
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,794
Croatia, please. Zagreb, Dubrovnik,
whatever, just get me there.

737
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,064
- Ma'am...
- Do you go through London or Frankfurt?

738
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,641
- London, but...
- London it is.

739
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,472
- Ma'am, there are no flights...
- Just get me a ticket.

740
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,547
- The blackout, it's affected our flight...
- Give me a ticket.

741
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,116
- It doesn't have to be for right now.
- Calm down.

742
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,584
No, you need to do your
job and sell me a ticket, okay?

743
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,223
Ma'am, you need to relax
before we can do anything.

744
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,484
Don't understand
what's so hard about this.

745
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,753
I have a passport and
I have a credit card.

746
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,329
I'm not a terrorist. Do
I look like a terrorist?

747
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,966
- She's been drinking.
- Why'd you have to be bitchy?

748
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,658
Okay, you can't call me a bitch.

749
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,079
- I didn't. TICKET
AGENT: You did.

750
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:28,767
- I said bitchy, not the same thing.
- Okay, here's how this is gonna go.

751
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,498
You won't be getting a ticket...

752
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:34,009
or boarding a flight as long
as you keep behaving like this.

753
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,808
I want you to sit over
there, get yourself together...

754
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,779
so I don't have
to call security.

755
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,475
Got me?

756
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:17,149
Keep the urine alkaline and
recheck labs in another six hours.

757
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,484
I'll let the ICU know.

758
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:23,886
You'll have your
roommate back tomorrow.

759
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,032
He doesn't trust lawyers,
accountants, anybody with a degree.

760
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,536
But he appreciates what you did.

761
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,811
Oh, yeah...

762
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:49,515
As doctors go, you seem
to be a pretty decent one.

763
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,123
So thanks.

764
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,162
Hey, just got back
from the cath lab.

765
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,771
Baby was born with an
anomalous left main coronary.

766
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,101
Blood was getting
diverted into the GI tract.

767
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:13,404
The heart gets shafted, which
explains the fussiness after feeds.

768
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,570
She was having
angina. They can fix it?

769
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,740
Well, she's in the O.R. now.
Cards said the prognosis was good.

770
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,886
- Guess we got lucky.
- Yeah, we got lucky.

771
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:25,012
I don't remember any questions like
this on the boards. Coffee's on you.

772
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,250
Looks like we
survived the blackout.

773
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,555
Yup, the news said
Commonwealth Edison...

774
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,960
has got it all under control.

775
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,200
I failed, Greg.

776
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,964
What?

777
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,267
Oh...

778
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,973
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was ashamed.

779
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,809
It happened so fast. Everybody
was so psyched for us.

780
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:56,045
Look, man, the only thing that this test
measures is how well you take the test.

781
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,587
It doesn't mean you
can't keep working.

782
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,622
You just have to
take it again, come on.

783
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:05,924
Well, in the meantime, maybe
we can keep this between us?

784
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,131
- Not tell anybody?
- Yeah, if that's what you want.

785
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,998
- Oh, man.
- Especially Abby.

786
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,732
She coached me a little on the side.
I had some family stuff a while back.

787
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,606
- I kind of feel like I let her down.
- I'm sure she wouldn't see it that way.

788
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,247
But, okay, we won't tell anyone.

789
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,814
Thank God for Abby, huh?

790
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,508
She saved that kid's life.

791
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,950
Yeah, thank God for Abby.
