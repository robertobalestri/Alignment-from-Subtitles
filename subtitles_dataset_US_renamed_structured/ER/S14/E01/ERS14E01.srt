1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,871
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,338
Tony and I are done.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,774
Well, it doesn't really
matter now, does it?

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,413
Luka's father got sick. He
had to fly back to Croatia.

5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,348
Say bye to Daddy. Say bye.

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,800
Kevin Moretti. I'm
replacing your husband.

7
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:19,453
Excuse me?

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,421
Nobody took a decent history.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,891
What I want is for us to live in
mortal fear of doing something wrong.

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,526
Neela!

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,434
Neela!

12
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,885
Thank you.

13
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,021
How's that done?

14
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,062
Is that a staff meeting?
- That was fun.

15
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,748
Yeah, can't wait
for the next one.

16
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,413
Don't know what this
guy's up to. It ain't gonna fly.

17
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,891
- Not sure there's anything we can do.
- Get Kovac to come back ASAP?

18
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,725
Luka's not the chief anymore.
Moretti's the man now.

19
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,561
Well, someone should
talk to Anspaugh.

20
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,929
- Me? Why me?
- Come on, girl.

21
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,835
- I've seen that old Abby charm.
- Old?

22
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,102
Anspaugh's not gonna give a
damn that we don't like the new guy.

23
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,746
He's gonna say we
haven't given him a chance.

24
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,473
Why? Because he's only
been working here 13 hours?

25
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,517
Hey, let's go grab a drink
while we plan the revolution.

26
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,847
- I could use something to eat.
- You're buying.

27
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,490
Me? No, no, no, I'm not
buying, and I'm not going.

28
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,821
Oh, come on. Where's
that old Pratt charm?

29
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,293
Oh, maybe just one.

30
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,998
Hi. Are you the charge nurse?

31
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,760
Sent me down from the
dean's office, I'm a new intern.

32
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,666
Interns don't start for
another month, so you're early.

33
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,501
Actually, I'm late.
Like, almost a year.

34
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,666
Had some trouble
last spring with the law.

35
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,108
But it's all good now,
you can see here.

36
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,442
That's just me. Kind of
skyjewkuss, if you know what I mean.

37
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,447
- I don't.
- Ah.

38
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,985
Oh, it kind of means off-kilter,
in case you were wondering.

39
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,520
I wasn't.

40
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:39,353
Hey, leave her alone now.
He's who you wanna talk to.

41
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,156
Are you Grady?
Hi, I'm Kevin Moretti.

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,701
So you're my clod of
unmolded clay. My tabula rasa.

43
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,829
Aren't you new too? I heard
you just took over, like, today.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,805
Lesson number one, take
no lessons from anybody here.

45
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,209
That's a paradox. If I take
no lessons from anyone here...

46
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,349
- I can't take lessons from you...
- Except from me, Grady.

47
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,851
Copy that, Rescue 49. Blanket
orders for C-spine, IVs, O2.

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,080
Multi-victim incident,
some crowd trampling.

49
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,053
- Ten minutes out.
- Who's on?

50
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,922
You got an R3, a junior, and
your lump of Play-Doh there.

51
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,256
We'll take two patients.

52
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,889
I already accepted four majors and
10 minors. That's standard protocol.

53
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,696
Good thing I showed up.

54
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,035
- Aah!
- Sats are coming up.

55
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,176
You're doing better,
Aaron. You're okay.

56
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,210
We'll drop you off, then get
back. There's 50 more victims.

57
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,404
- Who picked up Neela?
- I don't know.

58
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,745
- Could have been Dumar. Check on it?
- Sure, after we drop him off.

59
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,080
- Check on it now!
- Aah!

60
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,449
Hey, driver,
mellow out up there.

61
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,783
It's okay, buddy. Sorry.

62
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,517
Give me two of MS and a
couple of rolls to stabilize.

63
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,788
Yeah, Bardelli in 93 is trying
to locate a victim from the park.

64
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,592
- No problem.
- This will help so it won't move around.

65
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,860
- They sound busy.
- Are you gonna stick that in me again?

66
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,939
No, it's just gonna go right in your IV.
It's pain medication. It won't hurt at all.

67
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,905
Yeah, a female
doc, works at County.

68
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,566
- How old is she?
- Twenty-nine.

69
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,374
Twenty-nine years old.
Name, Neela Rasgotra.

70
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,245
- What we need is a unified approach.
- Like what?

71
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,583
Like a secret signal
to each other...

72
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,055
if we don't agree with
what Moretti's saying.

73
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:22,162
- What are we, like 8 years old?
- No, I like it. It's good.

74
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,299
Say we think an intubation is
called for and Moretti disagrees...

75
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,630
I can look at Morris across
the gurney and go like this:

76
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,965
Heh. Abby, don't
encourage him, okay? Heh.

77
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,271
Oh, that can't be good.

78
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,604
Maybe we should get out of
here before Moretti decides to...

79
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,520
Ah... I knew I should
have gone home.

80
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,086
Check, please.

81
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,186
Daniel Harrison, 58, chest pain.

82
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,195
ST elevation in leads two and
three, shocked him for V-fib.

83
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,460
- Injuries?
- I was running to get away.

84
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,104
- Heart. He's...
- Aspirin, beta blockers, cath lab.

85
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,935
- We got a protocol.
- Grady, did you ever handle a STEMI?

86
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,009
- I think so. MORETTI:
Stick with the nurse.

87
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:13,614
I want door-to-balloon
time in under 60 minutes.

88
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,375
Candice Morgan, 16, bad
crush injury to the chest.

89
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,317
Tachy to 120, pulse
ox, 90, BP, 100/60.

90
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,786
- I can't breathe. REIDY:
Multiple rib fractures.

91
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,481
Flail chest. She got trampled?

92
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,492
Public-address speaker fell
on her. Must weigh 200 pounds.

93
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,289
- Where do you want her?
- Trauma 2.

94
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,522
Get her labs
cooking. I'll be right in.

95
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,691
- We heard there was a riot or something.
- Yes, you're back on.

96
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,531
Aaron Gonzalez, chest
trauma, crushing to the pelvis.

97
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,401
- Gates, what you doing?
- I was there, I saw him get hurt.

98
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,476
- Get it out, pull it out.
- You gotta see more doctors first.

99
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,976
- What is that? GATES:
Piece of a protest sign.

100
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,513
- Doris, you see Neela? You with her?
- Not me.

101
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,049
Hey, Bards, who took Neela?
Who transported Neela?

102
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,982
- Never heard.
- Neela got hurt?

103
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,146
I tried to get to her but that
kid was critical. I had to stay.

104
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,918
- Maybe she didn't need an ambulance.
- Probably helping.

105
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,062
Guys, come on! We got
another 10 victims coming in.

106
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,966
Gates, come on, let's go.

107
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,949
Pulse ox, 92 on 5 liters.

108
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,552
- Let's put her on a non-rebreather.
- Where are we?

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,746
Paradoxical movement
in the flail segment.

110
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,084
- X-ray's cooking.
- Don't place a chest tube...

111
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,727
Unless there's a definite
hemothorax. We know.

112
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,494
- It hurts a lot.
- Another four of morphine.

113
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,614
No, you'll decrease
her respiratory drive.

114
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:39,693
What? She's in pain.

115
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,870
She'll need a good tidal
volume. Let's try an epidural.

116
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,698
Look, we can't wait for
anesthesia to come down.

117
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,967
You don't have to. I'm
credentialed in the procedure.

118
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,601
- Call Central for a tray, please.
- My granddad, is he coming?

119
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,326
- I'll be right back. CANDICE:
Does he know I'm here?

120
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,246
<i>- Patient ID?</i>
- Rasgotra, Neela Rasgotra.

121
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,410
<i>Patients are ID'd by
run number, not name.</i>

122
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,488
She's a doctor. The
drivers know her.

123
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,784
<i>- A minute. I'll run it.</i>
- How is he doing?

124
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,223
Second intercostal
space, midclavicular line.

125
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,989
Another 500 of MS and fresh dressing.
- Where's my mom?

126
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,597
She's coming soon, buddy.

127
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,065
I resuscitated the kid in the field,
told his mom I'd stay with him.

128
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,261
Where did they take
all the other patients?

129
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,929
- I need another two of Kerlix.
- Damn it, where is it?

130
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,473
- Check the cart.
- Do your secondary survey.

131
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,009
<i>Casualties were transported
to multiple hospitals.</i>

132
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,945
- Yeah, which ones?
<i>- Mercy, St. Rafe's, Northwestern...</i>

133
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,244
- Hey!
- This kid needs your undivided attention.

134
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,921
Give it to him.

135
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,787
- How's the pain, sir?
- Still a nine.

136
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,359
Another nitro spray.

137
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,257
- When can the cath lab take him?
- Five minutes.

138
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,160
- He's had a heparin bolus?
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,164
Two B3A receptor blocker?

140
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,796
- Sam? - Uh...
- Like abciximab? - Yeah.

141
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,029
- Eptifibatide?
- Yeah.

142
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,870
Oh. They give that to them sometimes
down in the cath lab, but not here.

143
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,306
Well, they should.

144
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,538
If you believe <i>The
Journal of Cardiology...</i>

145
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,809
that stuff can reduce in-hospital
mortality by 50 percent.

146
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,954
- Very good. Excuse me.
- Should bring that up with Dr. Kayson.

147
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,986
- I will, don't worry.
- Dr. Moretti.

148
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,124
- Mm-hm.
- This guy on a backboard is miserable.

149
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,051
- Pressure's down.
- Titrate dopamine.

150
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,561
- Can you clear his neck?
- No. Give him a limited C-spine series.

151
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,165
Okay. Lady in 3, dislocated hip.

152
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,030
- No, let one of the residents take her.
- They're all busy.

153
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,505
- Sam, start another IV.
- Doing it right now.

154
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,667
All right, a little prick here.

155
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,904
Four of morphine,
tell her we'll get to her.

156
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,741
- How long?
- Are you the attending?

157
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,476
- Yeah. Tell her we're busy.
- Foreign body to the eye, 10 pain.

158
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,051
Two drops of Alcaine.

159
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,246
- Where do you keep that?
- You're asking me?

160
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,823
I got floated from Surgery.
I don't know the ER.

161
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,722
- Channel 4's outside with a video crew.
- No, no.

162
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,762
Also, I got an elderly man with
a bad nosebleed on Coumadin.

163
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,558
Just keep pressure
on it for now.

164
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,032
Yes, this is County General ER,
we're looking for a Neela Rasgotra.

165
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,104
I'm familiar with HIPAA,
but she's one of our doctors.

166
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,867
Lab from Trauma 1. You try
calling Lutheran and Rush?

167
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,604
Frank, no. Try Ophthalmology,
Cardiology and General Surgery.

168
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,840
Let's focus on the patients who
are actually here and need our help.

169
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,915
You ready to do the epidural?

170
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,058
I'll be right there.

171
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,103
- Chest film's back.
- Does it hurt, <i>mi hijo?</i>

172
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,601
- I'm okay. DAWN:
Morphine's on board.

173
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,805
- Lung's partially collapsed.
- Put a tube in to help it expand.

174
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,644
- Whatever it takes.
- You can step outside if you prefer.

175
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,411
No, I'll stay.

176
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,054
It's crazy.

177
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:51,214
I never worry about
Aaron, just his brother.

178
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,758
Eddie is in the Army, in Iraq.

179
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,396
We went to the rally
to support the troops.

180
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,395
To support Eddie.

181
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:02,002
All they hear are people saying
we shouldn't be over there.

182
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,832
- How's the x-ray look?
- Mom's consented to the chest tube.

183
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,840
Let's let Dr. Lockhart do that procedure.
You're not on if I remember correctly.

184
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,911
- I'm happy to supervise.
- Dr. Lockhart is a senior doctor.

185
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,810
It would be better for your
son if she places the tube.

186
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,213
- If that's what you think.
- It is.

187
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,478
Excuse me.

188
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,652
- I don't think that guy likes you.
- Mm.

189
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,287
- Bilateral hemothoraces.
- A little less than 200 cc's on each side.

190
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,694
- The grandfather is here.
- Jared Morgan.

191
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,266
Dr. Moretti.

192
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,699
Did they explain
the epidural to you?

193
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,271
Yeah. Will it hurt?

194
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,341
You'll have a little
burning with the local.

195
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,742
Okay, here it comes.

196
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,313
- Didn't you call Mom and Dad?
- I couldn't get through.

197
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,649
Her parents are on
an Alaskan cruise.

198
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,759
Spinal needle.

199
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,860
Okay, how do we find
the epidural space?

200
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,397
Feel for a pop in the
ligamentum flavum.

201
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,001
Yeah.

202
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,697
And then we make sure that
we're not through the dura.

203
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,803
- Then inject air.
- All right.

204
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,674
How many ribs did she break?

205
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,309
Five on each side.

206
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,081
And, bingo.

207
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,917
- Okay?
- It was a peaceful demonstration.

208
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,584
Okay, relief is on its way.

209
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,919
Catheter.

210
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,654
I wanted to show her
the power of people...

211
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,392
raising their voices in a
democracy, and those...

212
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,929
Grandpa was teargassed at
the '68 Democratic Convention.

213
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:50,036
- Heh-heh. Right on.
- Yeah, yeah.

214
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,611
But then I worked on
defending the Chicago Eight.

215
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,509
- Oh, an old peacenik, huh?
- No justice, no peace.

216
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,847
Did I ever tell you how I was
sitting right next to Bobby Seale...

217
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,217
the day the bailiffs chained
him to his chair and gagged him?

218
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,185
Only about 10 times.

219
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,554
And what did you
learn from that?

220
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,254
Okay, tape it.

221
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,129
- And we're done.
- It feels better.

222
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,064
- Nice job.
- Excellent.

223
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,232
Doctors Morris and Pratt,
let's review the chest film.

224
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,308
Why do I smell
ETOH on your breath?

225
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,073
- Oh, we were off shift.
- Shh.

226
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,115
Yeah, we had less
than half a beer.

227
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,118
- All right, you're done for the day.
- Are you serious?

228
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,314
- Yeah, I can't have you working.
- Have you looked around?

229
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,288
- Shh.
- We're getting slammed.

230
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,793
- It's too much of a liability.
- You were smart for calling us back in.

231
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,590
You really wanna act stupid now?

232
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,901
Paramedics en route with a
young woman, late 20s, in full arrest.

233
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,366
They're ready to call it.

234
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,310
Just FYI, Doctors Morris and
Pratt will no longer be working today.

235
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,313
- Why?
- It's just you and me.

236
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,482
Fifteen minutes of asystole.
She's done, not gonna make it.

237
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,953
How long since the last epi?
- Three minutes.

238
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,094
- Two of atropine.
- Get her to Grady.

239
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,758
- What have we got?
- It's Neela.

240
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,301
Extensive crush injuries to the
chest, abdomen, all four extremities.

241
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,995
Pressure's only 90/60.

242
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,367
- Hey, how you doing?
- I've been better.

243
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,306
Okay, well, the pupils
are equal and reactive.

244
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,104
- What year is it, hon?
- Oh-seven.

245
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,841
- Okay, good, let's go to Trauma 1.
- Oh, God, not the yellow room.

246
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,712
Let start with a
lateral C-spine.

247
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,478
A waste of time if you're
gonna pan scan her in CT.

248
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,782
Yeah, we're starting
with the lateral, okay?

249
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,723
Four units of O-neg, set up central line.
- Okay.

250
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,698
Ladies and gentlemen,
evening rounds are on hold.

251
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,834
- Until when?
- Until we get out from this.

252
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,800
- We're getting the bulk of the victims.
- Got an O.R. open.

253
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,304
See it on the news? We need more.
I want three rooms, prepped, ready.

254
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,876
- I've got an elective gall bladder...
- Cancel case. It's the ER, again.

255
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,512
- Herniorrhaphy?
- Tomorrow at 7.

256
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,308
- Dr. Dubenko...
- A minute. Page both anesthesiologists.

257
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,973
- ER called.
- About to head down.

258
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,312
Make sure Ortho and
Neurosurg are ready.

259
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,715
- They want you.
- On my way.

260
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,186
- Do you have nurses to staff the rooms?
- Yes.

261
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,156
Get a perfusionist
on standby, in case.

262
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,888
They have a major trauma
victim downstairs. It's Neela.

263
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,396
How much pain on
a scale of 1 to 10?

264
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,059
One.

265
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,536
Give him your cell phone, Mommy.
- What for?

266
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,232
A picture. The kids at
school won't believe it.

267
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,538
All right, you
ready? Here we go.

268
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,376
- A hundred cc's out so far.
- Good, he's not losing too much blood.

269
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,542
- When's he going to surgery?
- Soon, I hope.

270
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,052
- Can you call them again, please?
- Yeah, yeah.

271
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,850
- Where are you going?
- I need to talk to the surgeons.

272
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,788
One, two, three.

273
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,190
Trauma panel and
catheterize urine.

274
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,024
- I'm sorry, we gotta.
- Bollocks.

275
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,757
- Sats, 91 on 5 liters.
- Get a capnograph on her.

276
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,926
- We don't have those.
- I brought one from ICU. On the counter.

277
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,267
- Hey, I've been looking for you.
- Guess you found me.

278
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,137
- You're here for what reason?
- I was waiting for Dubenko.

279
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,403
I need a consult on
my chest impalement.

280
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,876
Well, he's not here.

281
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,039
- All right, well, maybe I can help.
- No, I don't think so.

282
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,118
- HemoCue, 9.4 after fluids.
- All right, two units of O-neg.

283
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,881
I'm bleeding internally?

284
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,285
- It's okay.
- You're in good hands.

285
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,958
Quick and concise, how is she?

286
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,823
Hypotensive, anemic with abdominal
pain. Extensive crush injuries.

287
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,488
- Neela?
- Thirsty, some water.

288
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,496
- Sats dropping.
- CO2, 60.

289
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,724
Bag her, she's retaining.

290
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:39,839
- Etomidate, sux and an intubation tray.
- Maybe I can do a femoral, huh?

291
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,836
Dr. Gates, Aaron dropped his BP.

292
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,500
- Give him saline. I'll be right in.
- No, go now.

293
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,236
Etomidate's in. ABBY:
Neela, you're going to sleep.

294
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,747
See you when you wake up, okay?
- Okay, here we go.

295
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,914
- How's it going here?
- Sixty over 40.

296
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,178
What's happening?

297
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,414
Well, his pressure's low, and
he's not bleeding in his chest.

298
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,115
I don't feel so good.

299
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,989
Is he bleeding somewhere
else? What's happening?

300
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,027
- More Compazine?
- Give me that SonoSite.

301
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,199
I'm suturing an arm lac.
- That can wait.

302
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,927
- Gates, O.R. can take him in 30 minutes.
- It needs to be sooner than that.

303
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,531
- How's Neela doing?
- They seem to have it under control.

304
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,538
- You wanna help here?
- I can't. The idiot benched me.

305
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,841
- Hey, is that for Candice?
- She's not doing good.

306
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,348
Hey, Chuny, wait
up. What are the sats?

307
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:28,215
- Eighty-five on 100 percent.
- All right, start at 10 over five.

308
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,879
- Okay, the doctors are here.
- Your lungs are bruised.

309
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,322
What we gotta do is
give this pressure boost...

310
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,553
to help get more
oxygen to your air sacs.

311
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,627
- Okay.
- The mask will go over your nose.

312
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,359
- It'll feel a little weird, okay?
- Pratt, what are you doing?

313
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:42,866
BiPAP for hypoxia, Morris.

314
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,561
- Well, Moretti is right next door.
- Yeah, I know.

315
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,971
How's that? CANDICE: Better.

316
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,374
- Pulse ox is up to 94.
- Thank you.

317
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,307
Dr. Pratt, I need a
consult in sutures.

318
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,710
Excuse us a moment.

319
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,477
Come on, Morris, will
you stop grabbing me?

320
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,813
- Know what we should do?
- Be there with Neela.

321
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,718
Since we can't, we gonna fix
as many patients as we can.

322
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,985
We need to draw blood-alcohol
levels on each other.

323
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,722
You better get real.

324
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,989
We gotta prove to
Moretti we're good to go.

325
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:15,191
You wanna get back in the
game, you gotta pass the test.

326
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,768
- First two units are in.
- Systolic's up to 100.

327
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,033
PVCs, wide QRS.

328
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,700
- We got blood in Morrison's pouch.
- Liver laceration?

329
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,607
Most likely. We're
going to the O.R.

330
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,281
- Her heart's too irritable.
- Because she's bleeding.

331
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,747
- Can't screw around.
- She has to get to Surgery.

332
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,944
She will. What's her potassium?
- Not back.

333
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,612
- Get it back.
- Dr. Dubenko, can you help me...?

334
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,621
- No, I can't.
- It's rhabdo, that's what it is. Rhabdo.

335
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,454
Her potassium is sky high
because of the crushed muscle.

336
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,291
- Amp of calcium now. GATES:
My kid has persistent hypotension.

337
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,229
- Repeat a crit and chest film.
- If she has hyper K...

338
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,868
Gates, please.

339
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,602
- What is wrong with that guy?
- He and Neela used to date.

340
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,108
Let's go. We can manage
electrolytes in the O.R.

341
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,279
No, she will crash
in the elevator.

342
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,972
Doctor, dislocated-hip
lady's losing a foot pulse.

343
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,829
- Okay. Kevin? JARVIK:
I've got neck films.

344
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,148
- I've got...
- Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

345
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:13,088
- Abby, I need you out there. Go.
- Type specifics up, units three and four.

346
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,752
Get her on a portable monitor.
We're out of here in two minutes.

347
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,989
That's it.

348
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,329
Okay, let's rush these
to the lab, please.

349
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,595
- Greg, I need you in here.
- All right, okay.

350
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,565
What's happening?

351
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,073
Well, sometimes the BiPAP
isn't enough. Intubation tray.

352
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,309
- We need to put her on a ventilator.
- Then she'll be okay?

353
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
- Grandpa. MARQUEZ:
Induction meds are ready.

354
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,614
Seven-point-five tube.

355
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,283
Listen, when you wake up...

356
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,912
there's gonna be a tube in your
throat to help you breathe, okay?

357
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,363
Okay, hip's back in.

358
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,366
Check a post-reduction
film and admit to Ortho.

359
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,798
- Okay.
- Who's next?

360
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,529
Nosebleed in the hall.

361
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,979
- Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
- Can you stop this?

362
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,877
Let me see. Okay, I'm gonna try.

363
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,211
All right, here we go.

364
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,678
Now, this is gonna
feel a little bit slimy.

365
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,722
Did they find out
who set off the bomb?

366
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,724
I don't know.

367
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:25,560
I was walking by the
park, like I do every day...

368
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,632
next thing I know,
I'm on the ground.

369
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,634
Are you an intern? Need tube
gauze for an avulsed toenail.

370
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,032
Okay, hang in there.

371
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,867
I'll be back to check you,
all right? I'm not an intern.

372
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,239
I'm a third-year resident and the
tube gauze is in Exam 2, center cabinet.

373
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,243
Heh. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

374
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,815
- Yeah. Exam 2 is that way.
- Right.

375
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:50,818
- Second-degree bilateral forearm.
- How'd this happen?

376
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,721
They were burning the
flag. I was trying to put it out.

377
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:58,888
Okay, Silvadene
dressing and 10 of MS.

378
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,899
And nothing circumferential.
You're not gonna need surgery.

379
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,934
- Thank God for that.
- Here you go.

380
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,571
You'll be feeling better soon.

381
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,440
All right, my man, you might
feel a little pressure here.

382
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,076
Is that a suprapubic catheter?

383
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,374
Yeah, he must have torn his urethra.
His bladder's the size of a basketball.

384
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,710
- So he's not bleeding?
- No, his bladder is distended...

385
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,548
and that's what's
making his pressure drop.

386
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,017
Okay. I'll tell Dubenko.

387
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:28,252
- Hey, how's Neela?
- I don't know, been out here for a while.

388
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,707
- You'll let me know?
- Yup.

389
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,263
All right.

390
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,799
- Am I peeing?
- Sort of.

391
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,869
Mom, quick, take
another picture.

392
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,584
Get out of the way. - No.

393
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,735
- We're going.
- Bad idea.

394
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,629
- I'll call security.
- I don't care.

395
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,579
- V-tach.
- This happens when you screw around.

396
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,942
- Three hundred charge.
- Clear.

397
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,342
- No change. DUBENKO:
Resuming compressions.

398
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,052
- Charge to 300.
- All right, 100 of lido.

399
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,627
All right, clear.

400
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,725
- Sinus rhythm.
- With a pulse.

401
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,664
- All right, clear the way, let's go.
- Nope, no.

402
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,929
- Potassium's 8.1.
- Oh, my God.

403
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,505
- CK's 9200.
- It is rhabdo.

404
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,837
Bicarb, insulin, glucose
and Kayexalate. Right away.

405
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,842
Keep urine output over 300
an hour or she'll renal failure.

406
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,311
Yours in a minute,
Lucien. Abby, on the floor.

407
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,782
I was just out there.
Well, then you go!

408
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,755
- Excuse me?
- I'm not leaving her. I'm not leaving.

409
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:39,355
- Hang another liter of saline. Blood?
- Fourth unit's going in.

410
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,502
Send FFP upstairs, call O.R.,
tell them we're on our way up.

411
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,638
Neela, you're intubated,
and you're going for an ex-lap.

412
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,967
And I'm gonna
stay with you, okay?

413
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,574
You're doing great, Neela.

414
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:53,144
Hang in there. Just hang
in there. Hang in there.

415
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,076
Did that impaled
boy make it up okay?

416
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,307
- Stable in O.R. 2.
- Good, thank you.

417
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,418
Dr. Moretti, can I
present some patients?

418
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,587
- Of course.
- Foreign body to the eye.

419
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,655
Now has total vision
loss on the right.

420
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,019
- Complete loss?
- A little light perception.

421
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,525
- For how long?
- About 15 minutes.

422
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,994
- Why didn't you come and get me?
- You were busy.

423
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,497
Hi, I'm Dr. Moretti.

424
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,330
Can you close your
good eye for me, please?

425
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,397
Okay, how many
fingers am I holding up?

426
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,543
- I couldn't tell you.
- All right, give me that.

427
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,615
- Oh. Irregular pupil.
- That's new. It was reactive.

428
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:33,048
No, no, it's not a foreign
body, it's a ruptured globe.

429
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,347
I tripped and some jerk
stomped on my face.

430
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,458
Something penetrated your
eyeball. It's bleeding inside.

431
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,218
- Am I gonna be blind?
- Not if surgery can correct it.

432
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,626
And the sooner the better. All
right, head of bed to 45 degrees.

433
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,963
Metal eye shield, gram of
Ancef and stat page Ophtho.

434
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,968
- 4-0 Vicryl.
- Gentlemen.

435
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,734
Hand service has been paged. I did
a Bier block, so he's feeling no pain.

436
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,469
- Great, I got it from here.
- No, we can do it, really.

437
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,614
In my pocket, labs on two
of your favorite attendings.

438
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,046
Blood alcohol is less than 0.01.

439
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,952
They let airline
pilots fly at that level.

440
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:08,096
Shh. Keep your voice down.

441
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,588
Another Vicryl, Dr. Gates.

442
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,383
Sure.

443
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,984
Okay.

444
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,885
- How'd this happen?
- I was cutting the lawn.

445
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,157
I was having problems with the
mower. I was running out of gas...

446
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,496
so I tried to refill the tank
without shutting the engine off.

447
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,666
I don't really remember
what happened. I blacked out.

448
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,673
There's a reason it's called
an internal combustion engine.

449
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,606
You managed to
make it an external.

450
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,246
You gonna be able to
sew my fingers back on?

451
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,211
Do you have them?

452
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,777
Good luck.

453
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:47,259
- She's bleeding inside her lungs.
- Oh, my God, How do you stop that?

454
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,828
You just have to wait for it to heal.
This low-pressure vent will help.

455
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,259
- All set.
- Dr. Pratt.

456
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,593
Hey, don't even start,
man. I'm serious, okay?

457
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,030
I'm working on my patient.

458
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:59,205
- She needs constant attention...
- Relax, I talked to Dr. Morris.

459
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,102
- I saw the blood tests. Relax.
- All right, good.

460
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,834
We got severe pulmonary
contusions, hypoxia with PEEP.

461
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,708
- And we switched to an oscillator.
- You can be better utilized outside.

462
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,544
Have you taken a look at
the x-ray? Patient is critical.

463
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,946
So are 10 other patients
who have a chance.

464
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,021
You're wasting time and
resources trying to save a dead girl.

465
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,717
- Excuse me. What does that mean?
- I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there.

466
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,384
- Okay.
- Okay.

467
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:27,192
With the extent of her hemorrhaging,
her chances of survival are almost nil.

468
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,631
- So, what? You just give up on her?
- We're not giving up.

469
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,669
- We're giving her the best care.
- Leave.

470
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,898
I don't want you in
here. He's doing fine.

471
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,372
- Please, continue.
- I will.

472
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,307
- She's bradying down. Lost her pulse.
- All right, PEA.

473
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,812
- She was fine until you came in here.
- Sir, please get out of the way.

474
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,474
- This is your fault.
- All right, get out of the way.

475
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,086
Amp of atropine.

476
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,193
Kocher clamps.

477
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,418
Buzz here.

478
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,388
How about the cell saver?
- Ready to go.

479
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,331
Metz. CRENSHAW:
Couple of Richardsons.

480
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,399
Let's go.

481
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,071
Into the peritoneum.

482
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,265
- Oh, my God.
- We're on it.

483
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,279
- Suction, Dusty.
- Got it.

484
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,368
Another suction line.
Keep packs coming.

485
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,383
Yankauer's not gonna
do it. Pool sucker.

486
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,611
Systolic's down to 60.

487
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,187
Clots in left upper
quadrant. Pack off the spleen.

488
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,087
No, she had impact on
the right. Pack the liver first.

489
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,457
- And that's your call.
- Yeah, damn right it is.

490
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,358
Yeah, okay. Please have somebody
call down if you hear anything.

491
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,933
Is she out of surgery?

492
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,697
Yo, Taggart. Got
a live one for you.

493
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,898
Found him in the
street, directing traffic.

494
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:45,135
Well, I was just trying
to calm the masses.

495
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:48,644
There was so much negative
energy that nobody could feel...

496
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:53,547
the universal connection
that we all have.

497
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,745
- Right, what are you on, buddy?
- Oh, no.

498
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,083
You know, when I
touch you like this...

499
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,091
we are exchanging matter
on a subatomic particle level.

500
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,253
I don't know where your atoms
have been. Keep them to yourself.

501
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,423
- What's this?
- I'm thinking acid trip.

502
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,569
Oh, you would be...

503
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,799
wrong.

504
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:19,240
LSD is a man-made chemical
and psilocybin is a gift from God.

505
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,779
- Oh-ho. The magic of mushrooms.
- Yes, that is corr...

506
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,173
Look at this.

507
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,445
Your shirt is breathing.

508
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,783
All right, you're
freaking him out.

509
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,151
Ho.

510
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:34,655
No.

511
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:38,264
- How's your doctor friend doing?
- It's too soon to tell.

512
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,660
- We're all thinking about her.
- Thanks.

513
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,395
Ho-ho. Oh, this is so
good. No, don't stop.

514
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,300
Excuse me. Do you have
any medical problems?

515
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:51,034
No. My skin becomes
transparent, occasionally.

516
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,544
I can see my organs, but...

517
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,945
I'll going to get a urine tox
screen and find him a comfy bed.

518
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,513
- Dive, dive!
- Don't touch that.

519
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,487
You'd better hold my hand if you
don't want me to just float away.

520
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,626
- I'll hold your hand, sir.
- Oh.

521
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,395
I can feel the love you
have for your friend.

522
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,690
- It's beautiful.
- Any other victims?

523
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:16,825
- No, I think we got most of them.
- No shrapnel or blast injuries?

524
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,665
- It wasn't a bomb.
- There was an explosion. I heard it.

525
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,740
- People saw smoke. It was on the news.
- Bomb squad figures...

526
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,536
it was some guy setting
off fireworks or something.

527
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,577
Well, it had to be
at least an M-80.

528
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,682
Whatever it was, it wasn't
the terrorists. Not today.

529
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,713
Complex, stellate
liver laceration.

530
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,674
- It's a bear-claw injury.
- You'll never repair that.

531
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,717
What? Why? What do you mean?
- Bovie.

532
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,179
Bleeding too briskly.
Bovie can't even coagulate.

533
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,594
- Well, what else can you do?
- Get me the argon-beam coagulator.

534
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,224
The thing to do is pack up the liver,
put in a Bogota bag, close her up.

535
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,337
We'll come back in
two days for repair.

536
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,563
- Two days?
- No.

537
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,607
I don't want biliary leaks or
abscess formation. Lap pads.

538
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,335
- Can't screw around while she bleeds.
- You can't try to repair the liver?

539
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,312
We would have to
clamp the artery...

540
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,279
less than an hour
before the liver died.

541
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,917
- Can you do it in an hour?
- No.

542
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,950
Yes, yes, we can try.
Where's my argon?

543
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,554
Ready in a minute. ABBY: Stop.

544
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,747
- You're not helping.
- That makes two of us.

545
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,120
- I don't know what you're getting at.
- Doctor.

546
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,888
Perhaps you should
just shut up, both of you.

547
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,361
Lucien, can the repair be done?

548
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,966
- Yeah, yes, it can.
- Okay.

549
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,626
Dr. Crenshaw's gonna do it.

550
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,777
- What?
- You're too close to this.

551
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,806
You know I'm right
so let him operate...

552
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,909
you'll assist and
I'll keep time, okay?

553
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,403
Okay, you.

554
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,280
- How's it going here?
- Hand service can take him in an hour.

555
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:16,513
- Good.
- Can I get something to drink?

556
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,180
Chuny, why don't you
get him some ice chips.

557
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,986
All right.

558
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,094
So whose...? Whose
lawn were you cutting?

559
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:34,099
- Mine.
- Yours. All right.

560
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,368
Says here you live on Halstead.

561
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,308
Not a lot of lawns out
there on Halstead, right?

562
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:45,348
There's some grass around
the building, on the side.

563
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:50,281
Right. So, what
are you, the super?

564
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,623
No, but sometimes I help out.

565
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,824
So you help out the super cut
the lawns on the side of the...?

566
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,329
- He's old. I feel sorry for him.
- Yeah.

567
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:06,532
You know, there are a lot of
hospitals between Halstead and County.

568
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,036
- That's my stuff.
- Right.

569
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,198
I stopped by a friend's
house around here.

570
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,640
She told me I needed
to go to the hospital.

571
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,871
- What are you doing?
- Doesn't smell like gasoline, does it?

572
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,712
- Smell that. That smell like gasoline?
- No. I didn't spill it.

573
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,353
- Does it smell like gas?
- No!

574
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,682
Smells like black
powder, doesn't it?

575
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,149
What's this? A lighter.

576
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,419
Your chart says you don't
smoke, but what's that?

577
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:33,525
What was it? M-80?
Cherry bomb? What?

578
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,190
- Where you going?
- You're crazy.

579
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,561
- Get back in bed.
- No.

580
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:37,828
What are you doing?

581
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,165
- Where the docs don't sniff your...
- Oh, yeah?

582
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,002
- What's your problem?
- You know what my problem is, ass?

583
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,269
All these people are
here because of you.

584
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,913
Look at this girl. Look
at that girl. You see that?

585
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,605
This is your fault. Look at him.

586
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,546
Look at him, huh?
That's because of you.

587
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:53,998
- Tony!
- What are you doing?

588
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,518
This guy, you see him?

589
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,622
- Tony, calm down.
- Use your brain.

590
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,781
You killed people.
Do you understand?

591
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,224
Look over there. Look at that
little girl. You killed that girl.

592
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,194
All right? You killed
people. You understand that?

593
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,876
Are you supposed
to be a tough guy?

594
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,409
Where'd you hear that?

595
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,740
- Oh, I don't know. Word on the street.
- Mm.

596
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:26,351
Seems you have a history of violence
whenever your vocabulary is overtaxed.

597
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,510
That happens with
alarming frequency.

598
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:31,885
Look around. Every bed has a
patient because of that jackass.

599
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,892
- Not to mention Dr. Rasgotra.
- Yeah. Not to mention.

600
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,096
You think a dalliance with a
coworker mitigates the situation?

601
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,598
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know.

602
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:45,636
- You don't know. It doesn't.
- Hmm.

603
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,137
You attacked a patient.

604
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,865
Who caused a riot that
messed up a lot of people.

605
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,874
That has been established.

606
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,775
For what? For nothing.
Because he thought it was fun.

607
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,448
I don't care! I don't care!

608
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:01,883
I don't care if he attacked
your crippled, blind mother.

609
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,225
You are not gonna get
away with this stuff anymore.

610
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,826
- You understand me?
- Yeah.

611
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:13,158
- Do you?
- Yes, sir, I do.

612
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,732
I will check myself
next time this happens.

613
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,238
- You can check yourself in the ICU.
- What?

614
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,466
There are lots of lessons for a
guy like you up there. Trust me.

615
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:25,941
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

616
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,743
The ICU forces one...

617
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,906
especially an ex-paramedic,
ER doc like yourself...

618
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,142
to slow down and to think.

619
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:37,119
People are dying up there,
often in excruciatingly slow ways...

620
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,553
so you won't really
have much choice.

621
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,331
We're at 52 minutes.

622
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,470
Okay, release the Pringle.
Let's see if the dam holds.

623
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,580
- How's the liver look?
- Not bad.

624
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,207
Not bad at all. Minimal oozing.

625
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,181
Systolic's holding at 110.

626
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:12,154
- It was a sound approach, Lucien.
- Well, you executed it well.

627
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,225
Let's hope that her brain
was sufficiently perfused.

628
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,952
We'll see how she wakes up.

629
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:20,724
Dr. Crenshaw, brachial artery
repair is ready for you in 2.

630
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,063
- Care to finish?
- Yes, I would.

631
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:27,365
A few big liver sutures
and simple closure.

632
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,371
I'll be in O.R. 2
if you need me.

633
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,534
And I have to get back
downstairs. So I'll just...

634
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,380
I'll check on her later.

635
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,641
Okay. I'll let you know
when she's in Recovery.

636
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:48,093
What's the word on Neela?
She took 10 units of blood.

637
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,593
Yeah, they're still
working on her.

638
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:02,597
Take a deep
breath and let it out.

639
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,141
Another deep breath.

640
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:09,075
Let it out. Now you're
gonna feel some discomfort...

641
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:14,185
but it's not going to bother you,
because you're in your safe place.

642
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,589
Hey, you old stoner,
what are you doing?

643
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,226
Well, it's a Colles' fracture,
45 degrees angulation.

644
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,760
I've reduced and casted.

645
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,959
What? You what?

646
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:31,398
This is embarrassing. I've
neglected to introduce myself properly.

647
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,071
I am James Broderick.

648
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:37,572
I'm the chair of Orthopedics
at St. Raphael's Hospital.

649
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,438
You're a doctor?

650
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,977
One of the leading
orthopods in the country, yes.

651
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,775
- And you are doctor...?
- Morris.

652
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,317
- Morris, yes.
- Why don't we get you back to a bed.

653
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,114
And maybe it's best if you
don't touch anyone else.

654
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,417
I don't mean to brag,
but I am here now.

655
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,152
And there are those who
feel I have a certain gift.

656
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,127
Well, save it for Christmas.
We're good at this ourselves.

657
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,630
You're not licensed to
practice in this hospital.

658
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,326
Will you show this gentleman
back to his bed, please?

659
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,663
- This way, sir.
- Sure.

660
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,806
But I am internationally
renowned.

661
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:11,000
Don't let him drift
away. He's on a beach.

662
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,409
- Look at that cast. It's perfect.
- Looks nice.

663
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,811
- I didn't do it.
- Who did?

664
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,919
- A patient.
- Fast learner.

665
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:24,079
Hey, I heard Moretti
reassigned you. I'm sorry.

666
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,487
- It's only temporary.
- I'm sure.

667
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,495
So, what's happening in surgery?

668
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,631
She's had a hard time
maintaining her BP.

669
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,289
- They said she's in renal failure.
- I'm calling.

670
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,302
No, you're not. They're in the middle
of surgery. Let them do their thing.

671
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,633
- Who's there with her?
- Crenshaw and Dubenko.

672
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,604
- She's in good hands.
- Abby's there too.

673
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,375
- Not anymore.
- Is she all right?

674
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,854
Yeah. MARQUEZ: She in Recovery?

675
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,109
They just... They
repaired the liver.

676
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,943
Her vitals are stable, and
Dubenko was closing up.

677
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,516
- She awake?
- Not yet.

678
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,314
With the arrest and
hypotension, probably be a while.

679
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,514
Yeah, that's what they said.

680
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:02,953
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

681
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,393
All right, where's Mussolini? He
said he needed me down here.

682
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,160
He gave me these to give
you. You're not to see him...

683
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,826
until they are all disposed.

684
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,268
Okay. Thank you. SAM: Mm.

685
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,341
All right, watch
your step. Easy now.

686
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,353
Melman?

687
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:38,558
Melman. Where the
hell did we put Melman?

688
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,374
You're not lost, are you?

689
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,376
- If you need directions, you know...
- No, no.

690
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,851
You know why we're here?

691
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,422
Because of war.

692
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,950
Without it, you would be a
pediatrician or an oncologist...

693
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:12,063
and I'd probably still be
losing my mind in the ICU.

694
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,955
- War, huh?
- Mm-hm.

695
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:18,627
Emergency medicine is actually
the result of centuries of warfare.

696
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:25,402
It's a field that was defined by doctors
and nurses in bombed-out buildings...

697
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,412
trying to take care of patients
on dirty canvas stretchers.

698
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,751
And performing
procedures in tent hospitals...

699
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,752
that were literally
hundreds of feet away...

700
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,583
from where the battles raged.

701
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,289
And these people,
our predecessors...

702
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,856
they had a simple primary focus.

703
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,963
Survival.

704
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,730
And down in the bunkers,
they dug in deep...

705
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:57,365
to try to save their patient's lives,
and to try to save their own lives.

706
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,813
And they ended up giving
life to this whole new art form...

707
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,918
this great collaborative
enterprise...

708
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,520
that we still carry on today.

709
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,814
That's why we're here.

710
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,255
You don't get out much, do you?

711
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,967
If you can't take the bunker,
get out of the trauma room.

712
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,403
Ha. I hope, I hope you're
not talking about me.

713
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,803
Heh. No.

714
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,508
If I can't manage this
floor during a mass-cas...

715
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,550
then what good am I?

716
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,483
Every day is not the bunker.
Most days aren't, in fact.

717
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,659
Thank God.

718
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,459
I guess every war teaches
us something, right?

719
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,963
I wonder what we'll
learn from this one.

720
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,716
- Hey, stop it.
- Somebody call Security.

721
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,306
- Stop that.
- You son of a bitch.

722
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,806
- Get off of him.
- You killed her.

723
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,096
Hey, come on, come on.
- You killed her.

724
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,077
- You son of a bitch.
- Come here.

725
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:11,010
You... MORETTI: Hey, hey.

726
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,548
Hey, hey, hey.

727
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,390
- You killed her.
- Come here.

728
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,205
- You stupid... You killed her.
- Stop.

729
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,687
You... Let me go. ABBY: Sir.

730
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,858
Sir? Not responsive.

731
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,259
- No pulse.
- He's not breathing.

732
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,246
She's ready for
an ABG on 5 liters.

733
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,437
No problem.

734
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:47,416
- Hey, how's she doing?
- Pressure's up, hematocrit's 32.

735
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,076
- Hi, Mayday.
- That's good.

736
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,485
She'll be sleeping for a while.

737
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,685
It's probably best
if you wait out here.

738
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,090
I have several pages
of postop orders to write.

739
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,424
Be an hour before
she's ready for visitors.

740
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,533
I'll just... I'll wait
out here, okay?

741
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:14,240
- Check a repeat HemoCue in 15 minutes.
- Got it.

742
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,779
You gonna write those
postop orders now?

743
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,611
No, I already did.
It's all on the chart.

744
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,661
No, call PR. That's
extension 456.

745
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,326
County, hello? Extension 456.

746
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,937
Hello?

747
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,769
Didn't I just talk to you and tell you
we already have digital television?

748
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,674
Criminy. Telemarketers.

749
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,405
Hey, Frank. Heard
Neela's in Recovery.

750
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,345
Yeah. I have
confirmation on that.

751
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,485
- Is she awake?
- Negative.

752
00:40:56,187 --> 00:41:00,283
- Look, it's irrelevant, right?
- Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.

753
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,360
I mean, it'd be weird if
she was awake this soon.

754
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,160
- Absolutely.
- Sam was about to go up there.

755
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:09,358
She wondered if anybody
wanted to go with her.

756
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,507
Any news?

757
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,675
Vitals are stable,
crits are okay.

758
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,645
- She hasn't woken up yet.
- How much longer is it gonna be?

759
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,944
Oh, waking up takes awhile
after all that anesthesia.

760
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,283
- Hey.
- Hey.

761
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,220
- Has anybody seen her?
- I saw her on her way to Recovery.

762
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,588
- She looked okay.
- Can we go in?

763
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:39,892
Not yet. Dubenko
said he'll let us know.

764
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,025
So I guess we wait.

765
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,849
I'm calling for pizza. Who's in?

766
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,886
- Cool. Pratt, you buying?
- No, no, I'm not.

767
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,655
- Sure, you are.
- You got cash, right?

768
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,491
Morris...
