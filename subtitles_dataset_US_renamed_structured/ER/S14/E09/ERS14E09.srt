1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,153
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,177
I'll be coming to Chicago soon.

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,562
Skye Wexler, new attending.

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,843
- I'm doing the overnights with you.
- Nice to meet you

5
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,286
All right. It's
about Dr. Moretti.

6
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,254
I think you should replace
him with someone...

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,790
who knows how to do the job. Me.

8
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,291
This is my surprise. Niko, this
is Abby. Abby, my brother Niko.

9
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,830
Sarah?

10
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,437
Sarah, shake a leg.
We gotta get going.

11
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,942
- Can I have a sleepover tonight?
- Tonight? I don't know, Sarah.

12
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,944
Tony, now that I'm
back living here...

13
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,606
me and my BFFs has some
serious catching up to do.

14
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:53,014
- How many BFFs are we talking?
- A few.

15
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,748
I promise we won't make mess
or noise and we'll be asleep by 3.

16
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,553
- Twelve.
- Two?

17
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,920
- One.
- Deal.

18
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,652
So it's okay?

19
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,326
- Yeah, it's all right.
- Yes.

20
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,591
Your friend Julia can
come too. She's cool.

21
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,258
She is, but she's busy tonight.

22
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,202
Why don't I pick you up some videos
and maybe some pizza, ice cream?

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,204
- Cool. You're the best.
- Yes, yes, I am.

24
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,809
Oh, you should know.

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,947
Steffie's a vegan, Kiki has a soy allergy
and Mary Claire is lactose intolerant.

26
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,174
What's left to eat, air?

27
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,146
All right, come on, Joey.

28
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,031
- Hey.
- Hi.

29
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,302
What time did you get
to bed? I didn't hear.

30
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,844
Oh, I didn't get to bed
till early this morning...

31
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,380
because I'm writing up
a case for grand rounds.

32
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,349
- Hi, honey.
- You need your sleep.

33
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,752
Well, late night's the only time
it's quiet around here, so... Thanks.

34
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,892
- Hey, come here, come here.
- It's my fault, keeping Luka up.

35
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,425
No, I didn't mean
to imply that...

36
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,563
Yeah, we wasted so
much time not talking.

37
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,562
- Now it seems we can't shut up.
- We?

38
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:16,568
No, no, it's good that you two
have this time together. Um...

39
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,763
But, you know, I have
to go, okay? Bye-bye.

40
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,534
- Bye, sweetie. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

41
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,540
Hey, so I'll stop by later.

42
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,407
Frank's been holding my
mail. I need to talk to Anspaugh.

43
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,912
Okay, well, find me.

44
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,279
Abby, we should
all go out sometimes.

45
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,046
That way, we could
talk a little bit more, and...

46
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,520
I can tell everyone in
Croatia what you're like.

47
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,783
Yeah. I mean, we will.

48
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,759
I just need to get a
break in my schedule.

49
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,226
Bye, Joe.

50
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,593
I know I don't know
you very well yet...

51
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,595
but anyone who can make
my brother this happy is, uh...

52
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,074
Extraordinary.

53
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,436
Extraordinary person.

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,573
Bye.

55
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,816
And thank you for the
Thai food recommendation.

56
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,147
Best <i>Tom Yum Gai</i> I've
had outside of Phuket.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,256
Well, any time you wanna
vent over a bowl of sticky rice...

58
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,223
- just let me know.
- Hey, why is Mrs. Lawlor still here?

59
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,555
Medicine won't accept
her without CT results.

60
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,096
The CT isn't gonna change
the management. Come on.

61
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,631
Frank, where's Anspaugh?

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,099
Don't shoot the messenger.
He said he'd be down.

63
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,465
Hey, Dawn, did you get
the, uh, EKG for the CHF'er?

64
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,504
I tried, but someone
moved your patient.

65
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,005
There's a baby in Curtain 4.

66
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,336
Thought that's where
they put the septic hip.

67
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,674
How can you accept a Neurosurgery
transfer if we don't have a bed?

68
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:37,011
- We have to if it's for higher level.
- Not if we don't have a bed.

69
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,278
Neurosurgery can see them
even if there isn't an inpatient bed.

70
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,946
Were we talking to you? Do
you have chest CT results?

71
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,025
No. Okay, hold your water.
Ultrasound is on the phone again.

72
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,627
Somebody has to pick
up that ovarian-cyst lady.

73
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,594
Listen up. Two victims, one
critical with vascular injury.

74
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,165
Three-minute ETA.

75
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,996
Okay, people, gather around.
Everybody, gather around.

76
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,003
Morning, everyone. I know
we're all busy, so I'll be brief.

77
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,868
I have some unfortunate news.

78
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,533
It's with deep regret that
I announce Dr. Moretti...

79
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,179
will not be returning to the ER.

80
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,815
Kevin fully intended his
absence to be temporary...

81
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,316
but due to personal
circumstances...

82
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,547
he's not certain when or
if he will be able to return.

83
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,815
Here we go again.

84
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,687
A search committee will be convened,
find a replacement to consider...

85
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,454
- Dr. Anspaugh.
- Yes?

86
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,464
With all due respect, the
ER needs a chief now. Today.

87
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:30,131
There's a lack of communication
among the staff and departments.

88
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,398
Waiting room times are up
and patient care is compromised.

89
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,008
Yeah. We can't wait, and
neither can our patients.

90
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,871
Yes, it sounds
like it can't wait.

91
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,139
So until the search committee
meets and until further notice...

92
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,909
the acting chief of the
ER will be Dr. Wexler.

93
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,853
What?

94
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,837
She's a sly one, that Skye.

95
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,605
You see the surprised look on her face
when Anspaugh made her acting chief?

96
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,543
- She didn't look surprised.
- Exactly.

97
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,582
I'll admit, I believed her
funky, laid-back surfer-girl act.

98
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,744
- But she's been playing us.
- She's only been here for a month?

99
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,083
- How could she know what ER needs?
- She can't.

100
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,280
Cannery accident.

101
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,791
Sleeve caught in a conveyor belt.
Pulled his arm into a metal cutter.

102
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,623
Long extrication,
heavy blood loss.

103
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,890
- What's your name, sir?
- Um... Murphy.

104
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,795
- He's out of it.
- Got 15 of morphine.

105
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,698
- Type and cross, CBC, chemistry.
- Call for O-neg too.

106
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,736
- Who does Skye think she is?
- Let it go.

107
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,397
She's not fooling
anybody. She wants the job.

108
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,599
I don't want it.

109
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,278
Hey, I hear
congratulations are in order.

110
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,606
You make me acting
chief just like that?

111
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,976
Okay, well, I got a lap
chole to scrub in on.

112
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,812
- Don't I have a say?
- You did.

113
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,819
You made it quite clear
the ER needs a leader.

114
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,889
I am not the administrator type.

115
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:00,050
But you are the most
experienced ER Attending we have.

116
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,492
I only signed on at
County as a moonlighter.

117
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,257
Well, your new duties
will require more than that.

118
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,060
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

119
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,829
Budget meetings,
politicking and ass-kissing?

120
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,096
This is not me.

121
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,433
I'm gonna be surfing
in Uluwatu at Christmas.

122
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,235
Well, look, the
bump in salary...

123
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,173
will buy more sun block,
board wax and shark repellent.

124
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,281
Dr. Anspaugh, all I want is to
do my shifts and get out of Dodge.

125
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,248
Dr. Wexler, I need
you to step up.

126
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,751
So it's either Dodge or nothing.

127
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:36,027
You use the ratcheted forceps
to grasp the apex of the fundus.

128
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,492
Harold, you into the blues?

129
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,758
- Watch the omentum, Neela.
- Yeah, I see it.

130
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,200
Recent events have led me
to discover that musical genre.

131
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,837
My true passion is the
urban blues style of the '70s.

132
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,342
Sam Lay, Jimmy
Rogers, Magic Slim.

133
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,706
Carey Bell, Eddy
Clearwater, Left Hand Frank.

134
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,815
Dr. Zelinsky, what do you see?

135
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,644
The cystic duct and artery.

136
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,222
The next step is to dissect them
circumferentially, taking care to...

137
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,051
That's my beeper.
Could somebody get it?

138
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,219
Thanks. It's the ER.

139
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,861
What, you're leaving?

140
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,522
Yeah. I'll pop my head
back in after I've checked in.

141
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,828
No, you can't. I mean,
where's Dr. Crenshaw?

142
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,631
He's stuck in fem-pop
bypass on a 400-pounder.

143
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,434
You're doing great,
Neela. You got this.

144
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,508
Okay.

145
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,203
Uh...

146
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,941
- Get ready to ligate the cystic artery.
- You know what this means, right?

147
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,016
- Yeah, to ligate, we...
- No, not that.

148
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,087
- You are the senior surgeon in the room.
- I'm aware of that.

149
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:39,158
Listen, about before, I had no
idea Anspaugh was gonna do that.

150
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,023
I'm sure if we work together,
we can get this place back.

151
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,994
- Yeah, sounds good.
- You've been here longer than me...

152
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,760
so I hope I can pick your
brain when things come up.

153
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,937
Sure, anytime.

154
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,197
Anything going on that
I need to know about?

155
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,240
Morris and Abby are with an
industrial-accident victim in 1.

156
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,070
And the second
victim is imminent.

157
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,212
- Okay, I'll go check on them.
- All right.

158
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,972
Hey, Frank.

159
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,082
Dr. Wexler's gonna
make a terrific chief.

160
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:09,086
And personally, I have no
problems taking orders from a woman.

161
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,382
Good.

162
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,049
Call Radiology. We're still
waiting on that chest CT.

163
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,060
- I called them three times.
- Fourth time's a charm, Frank.

164
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,891
I liked you when
you were a blond.

165
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,626
Dolores Salazar, cleaning woman,
injured while trying to free a worker.

166
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,394
Sam, what's open? - Curtain 2.

167
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,300
Gates, go with Sam.
Skye's in 1, let her know.

168
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,634
Vitals stable, full range,
minimal blood loss.

169
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm Dr. Gates. You have
problems with any medicines?

170
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,740
No, no problems.

171
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,245
- Mr. Murphy is okay?
- I don't know who that is.

172
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,747
You allergic to anything?

173
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,977
- Sorry, my English is not good.
- Yeah, my Spanish is <i>muy</i> bad.

174
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,054
- Sam?
- High school French.

175
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,158
- Hey, Chuny, we need a translator.
- Be right there.

176
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,124
- Do you know how my husband is?
- Pop's a tough SOB.

177
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,729
The doctors can
answer all your questions.

178
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,430
You're welcome.

179
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,594
- Damn, what a mess.
- Hand is dusky. No radial pulse.

180
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,898
Oh, this is bad.

181
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,735
- BP is 80 systolic.
- Honey, John and I are here.

182
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,969
- Stop pushing.
- Grady, set up. Abby, supervise.

183
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,309
- Betadine, sterile drapes, central line.
- Let them do their thing.

184
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,178
- Sure you want an intern doing a line?
- He can handle it.

185
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,785
Do we have matched blood yet?

186
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,012
- Another five minutes.
- Hang the O-neg.

187
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,536
- Sir, you need to hold still. Sorry.
- I wanna sedate and intubate him.

188
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,061
His airway's okay. We
need to control the bleeding.

189
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,822
- Yes, you do, soon.
- I'm on this, okay?

190
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,296
Okay, how are we doing?

191
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,702
Tied off the artery. Just
lots of nonviable tissue.

192
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,302
- Got a flash.
- Introducer.

193
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,598
Ortho and vascular if
there's even a chance.

194
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,868
- Okay, who are you?
- I'm Dr. Dubenko from Surgery.

195
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,601
He's three hours out.

196
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,612
Dr. Wexler, second
cannery victim is in Curtain 2.

197
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,443
She has a few
lacerations, minor.

198
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,676
- That patient, she the cleaning lady?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,717
- Be right there.
- Femoral line's in.

200
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,115
Another unit of saline.

201
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,224
We're gonna need your
consent including all possibilities.

202
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,826
- Okay, like what?
- Amputation.

203
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,485
- No. No.
- We will do everything in our power.

204
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,565
No, you know, you're saying
my father's gonna lose his arm...

205
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,201
but that dumb spic,
she's gonna walk away?

206
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,495
- Okay.
- Calm down.

207
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,640
Ma'am, I cannot take your
husband to the O.R. until you sign.

208
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,401
No, no way. No, we
want a second opinion.

209
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,975
Pop. Pop.

210
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,808
Don't worry about anything, okay?
They're not gonna take a thing.

211
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,239
Okay, guys, what do we have?

212
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:20,352
This is Dolores Salazar.
This is Dr. Wexler.

213
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,512
- Hi.
- Neurovascularly, she's intact.

214
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,887
This one needs a two-layer closure.
The rest can be Steri-Stripped.

215
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,857
So, Dolores, what
happened today?

216
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:33,765
I clean and I hear moaning,
and I see a man, Mr. Murphy.

217
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,029
His arm was in the
machine. It was full of blood.

218
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,367
He begged her to help him.

219
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,199
And then what happened?

220
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,574
- I know the yellow box.
- The yellow box?

221
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,689
The green button was on.

222
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,350
And she pushed the
red button to shut it off.

223
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,783
Electrical control box.

224
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,285
I yell for help. Try to help.

225
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,019
But his arm, it is stuck.

226
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,793
- And that's how you got hurt.
- Mm-hm.

227
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,465
You're a very brave woman.

228
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,432
- No, not me. SAM:
Are you kidding?

229
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,604
The company should
give you a raise.

230
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,598
Mama.

231
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,406
This is Manny, Manuel.

232
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,569
- This is my son.
- Hello.

233
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

234
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,239
It was nice to
meet you, Dolores.

235
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,248
Chuny, tell him his
mother will be discharged.

236
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,745
I speak English.

237
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,650
Manny goes to college.

238
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,554
The first Salazar
to go law school.

239
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,992
It's pre-law, Mama, and
these people don't care.

240
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,456
Chuny, will you cover this closure
with loose gauze dressing, please?

241
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,466
- Yeah.
- Dolores, we'll be back soon.

242
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,967
Thank you.

243
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,737
- Nice kid. His mom's proud of him.
- Hello?

244
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,313
Extra blankets are
in the hall closet.

245
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,815
No. Because it's
R-rated. Goodbye.

246
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,510
- How is Sarah?
- Driving me crazy.

247
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,280
Having a sleepover, it's like
she's planning Normandy.

248
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,620
- Well, she's a teenager and a girl.
- Yeah, nothing I can't handle.

249
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,819
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, Dubenko saw him.

250
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,487
The family won't consent
without a second opinion.

251
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,600
Open fracture, proximal humerus.
Arm already looks ischemic.

252
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,245
<i>- I'll be right down.</i>
- Thanks.

253
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,138
Hey, Sam. I heard you have to pass a
strength test before shifts for Transport.

254
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,968
They wanna make
sure you can lift.

255
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,167
- Make a muscle.
- What? No.

256
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,609
Look. Check out the guns.

257
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,772
- Those are more like water pistols.
- No, I can help you train.

258
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,613
I took the liberty of getting
you some fitness balls.

259
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,846
Start with the lighter
one, and you squeeze.

260
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,015
Archie, you couldn't pay
me to touch your balls.

261
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,320
Gates, Exam 3. Kid
with a facial lac. Here.

262
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,553
Thanks.

263
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,324
Hey, Pratt, for what it's worth, I
think Anspaugh should've picked you.

264
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,799
Yeah, thanks, but no thanks.
Skye's more than welcome to it.

265
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,537
You know what? I'm going out
to get a coffee. I'll be right back.

266
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,670
Greg.

267
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,404
- You okay?
- Yeah.

268
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,673
Why?

269
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,477
Maybe you wish Anspaugh
tapped you instead of Skye?

270
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,643
- Hey, that was his choice.
- Talk to him.

271
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,550
- Tell him you want it.
- I already did, months ago.

272
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,746
Sorry.

273
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,324
Look, I know I'm too young
and less experienced...

274
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:17,225
than Skye or Moretti or Kovac or
Weav... Even that nutcase Clemente.

275
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,729
But, man, I'd be good at it.

276
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,424
- You'll get your shot.
- Really? When?

277
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,696
Hmm? How long do I have to wait?

278
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,339
What do I do to
be taken seriously?

279
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,372
Dr. Morris, we need
you in Trauma 1.

280
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,306
- Murphy's arm started gushing.
- Okay.

281
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,945
I don't know, man.
What else can you do?

282
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,674
I mean, it's not like you're
gonna quit in protest.

283
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,786
We're on our third unit.

284
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,290
Keep the blood bank
ahead two units. Order FFP.

285
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,453
- I thought you had this under control.
- I got the artery.

286
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,690
- Might be DIC.
- Did you push five more morphine?

287
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,062
Moretti said not to give
meds without orders.

288
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,227
Moretti's not here. Push it.

289
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,032
BP's back up to 120 systolic.

290
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:04,108
- It's not DIC. He's over-resuscitated.
- Had to give fluids, he was bleeding out.

291
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,076
- He's bleeding out?
- Ever heard of controlled hypotension?

292
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,045
- You bitch. Look what you did.
- Keep the BP around 90.

293
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,050
No, don't worry about my dad.
Enjoy your free medical care.

294
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,485
- Anything else our taxes can pay for?
- That is not helping your dad.

295
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,658
- Free school for your <i>niños?</i>
- Talk to me.

296
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,384
- Venous hemorrhage.
- He was fine.

297
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,291
- Started bleeding again.
- Axilla's a mess. Crits?

298
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,728
Twenty-four, down from 30.
DUBENKO: Curved Kelley.

299
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,600
- What's his BP?
- 128/72.

300
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,294
That's too high. It's called
controlled hypotension.

301
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,840
- When are you gonna learn this?
- That's what I told them.

302
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,003
Okay, that should
hold him for a while.

303
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,606
He needs the O.R.
What have you decided?

304
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,113
Uh... I don't know.

305
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:46,650
- We're waiting on a second opinion.
- We're gonna wait for that.

306
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,014
Did you talk to Anspaugh?

307
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,847
- Yes.
- Well, why isn't he here?

308
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,115
Get him down here
and get consent now.

309
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,462
Dr. Wexler, can I have a minute?

310
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,832
- Yes, Dr. Morris?
- I was thinking I should be angry.

311
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,136
But then I figured since you're
new here, I'd help you out.

312
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:14,712
- Help me.
- Back-seat doctoring doesn't go well.

313
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,113
- Is that what you think?
- Instead of criticizing, you could help.

314
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,546
It's called collaboration.

315
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,984
When a decision needs to be
made about my patients, I will make it.

316
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,624
I see. Anything else?

317
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,856
Yeah. Yeah, what's with all the
buddy-buddy business with Surgery?

318
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,995
Conferring with Dr. Dubenko
on a surgical case...

319
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,633
is somehow bad or disloyal?

320
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,326
This is our case. Until
we hand it over, we...

321
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,505
Get a life, Morris.

322
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,363
Excuse me. I'm not done yet.

323
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,738
Ugh. Kicked in the face. I know
how that feels. Not good, huh?

324
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,642
- Uh-huh.
- All right, here, go like this for me:

325
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,248
All right, no jaw dislocation.

326
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,646
- Tate's gonna need some stitches.
- Stitches?

327
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,183
Take it easy, son.

328
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,151
Don't worry, I'll make sure
you don't feel a thing, okay?

329
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,048
See?

330
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,887
Doctor says it's
all gonna be okay.

331
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,562
Set me up sterile saline
and an irrigation tray.

332
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,196
Sorry about that.

333
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,663
- About what?
- Oh, he's the sensitive type.

334
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,929
You know, I thought karate
was gonna toughen him up, but...

335
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,197
Well, he's not his older
brother. There's one tough kid.

336
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,441
Cystic duct is clear.

337
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,377
- We're kicking ass.
- Don't jinx it.

338
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:26,614
So, Harold, you have any pictures
from the homecoming dance?

339
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,783
I don't need any pictures to
remember that magical night.

340
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,755
All I have to do is close
my eyes and I'm there.

341
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,690
A little suction here. You
and Lacey had a good time?

342
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,054
It was awesome.

343
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,063
I only ask because
you never said.

344
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:44,931
And you were a little apprehensive
about the night's, um, expectations.

345
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,436
A gentleman never
kisses and tells.

346
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,933
Right.

347
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,374
All right, so, Tate, I'm
gonna get the anesthesia...

348
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,107
I don't want anything.

349
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,377
- What?
- Don't give me anything for the pain.

350
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,487
I wanna be tough. I wanna
show my dad I can do it.

351
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,782
You seem tough. You
took a kick in the face.

352
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:08,553
- Yeah, and I cried like a big baby.
- There's nothing wrong with crying.

353
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,796
That's not what my dad thinks.

354
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,932
- If I were you, I would want anesthesia.
- No.

355
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,431
I don't need it.

356
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,832
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey.

357
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,769
Can't stay away,
can you? Ha-ha-ha.

358
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,431
- Hey.
- Whoa.

359
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,168
You can't hide from
the U.S. Postal Service.

360
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,778
- Thanks for holding it for me, Frank.
- No problem.

361
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,415
- How's your dad?
- Doing better.

362
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,017
He's under 24-hour care.
My cousin's looking in.

363
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,277
Good.

364
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,889
- Come back to get the stitches removed.
- We'll make sure she does.

365
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,585
- Get the paperwork for workers' comp.
- That won't be necessary.

366
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,264
Oh, but she got hurt on
the job, so she's eligible.

367
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,662
Actually, she's not.
She's paid off the books.

368
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,095
So you're undocumented?

369
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,828
No, she's illegal. Come
on, just tell it like it is.

370
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,633
- You should go back to Mexico.
- She's from El Salvador.

371
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,505
- But to you, we're all the same.
- I'm tired of pressing one for English.

372
00:17:58,678 --> 00:17:59,805
That's enough. JOHN: No.

373
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,346
No, my father is probably gonna
be a cripple, and it's all her fault.

374
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,882
You're wrong. She
got hurt helping him.

375
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,680
What? What? What?

376
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,017
You people, you want everything
we got. Why don't you work for it?

377
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,352
My mother's been working
here longer than you.

378
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,824
This is not the place.

379
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,725
Amigo, I got no problem with
you foreigners coming here.

380
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,457
Get on the list, wait your turn.
Don't go sneaking across our borders.

381
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,899
I was born here, man.
I'm as American as you.

382
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,130
- Frank, call security.
- You're a criminal.

383
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,139
I'm gonna make sure that
they deport your fruit-picking...

384
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,937
spic-nic-on-the-side-of-the-road
ass.

385
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,447
- Hey, knock it off. Ow!
- Manuel.

386
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,917
What do you have to say
now? What you gonna do now?

387
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,077
- Get him off.
- Break it up, break it up.

388
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,449
Okay, people, show's over.

389
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:48,185
- Hey, can I go be with my dad now?
- Yeah, just a minute, Mr. Murphy.

390
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,024
- You okay, Sam?
- Yeah, I think I just caught an elbow.

391
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,166
You saw, he attacked
me. It wasn't my fault.

392
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,893
Someone put a gun to your
head, made you say stuff.

393
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,734
Okay, you know, I was upset,
okay? My dad, he's all messed up.

394
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,674
So, chief, what do you wanna do?

395
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,544
Well, I think...

396
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,908
I'd like to hear what you think.

397
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,481
Okay.

398
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:20,120
Well, he didn't take the first
swing and his dad is in bad shape.

399
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,160
So I say we escort him
back, post security in the hall.

400
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,096
Well, I say, sick dad or no sick
dad, we keep his racist ass in Waiting.

401
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,234
Yeah, I'm with Pratt.

402
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,298
Okay, thank you for your input.

403
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,599
We'll go with your
suggestion, Dr. Morris.

404
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,336
- Take him back to Trauma 1.
- You can see your father now.

405
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,412
Let's go. You too.

406
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,644
Hey, Sam, I left something
for you in your locker.

407
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,251
- What is it?
- Oh, I can't say.

408
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,447
But it's guaranteed
to pump you up. Ha.

409
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,458
- Morris wants to give you a pump?
- Not if I can help it.

410
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,858
So are you playing tour
guide for your brother?

411
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,191
Well, we've been to Navy
Pier and Sears Tower.

412
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,857
But what he really wants
to see is a taping of <i>Oprah.</i>

413
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,503
Kovac, I gotta say, you
always have perfect timing.

414
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,003
I thought you staged all
that to welcome me back.

415
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:10,166
You know, the break room was
open if you wanna go through that.

416
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,709
And I think the coffee's
only about two hours old.

417
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,677
- I'll buy you a cup. Come on.
- All right.

418
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,850
I'll be in the break
room if you need me.

419
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,280
Take your time.

420
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:23,753
Hey, Frank, would you mind
buying a couple dozen doughnuts?

421
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,322
- Doughnuts?
- Yeah. My treat, for everyone.

422
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,726
- Frank, you all right?
- You know what I think?

423
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:37,359
I think Skye is an angel
sent to walk among us.

424
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,999
Right.

425
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,573
Who the hell knows how
long we're gonna be here?

426
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,903
Reschedule the home
inspection for Monday.

427
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,070
Mr. Udecker, Tate just told me
he doesn't wanna be numbed up...

428
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,407
before I suture.

429
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,708
- Tate said that?
- Wants to prove he's tough.

430
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,149
Really? Okay.

431
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,383
Okay? He's gonna
be in a lot of pain.

432
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,888
- That's fine with you?
- No.

433
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,357
If he wants to man up,
it's better to learn now.

434
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,088
- It's cold out there in the real world.
- He's 13. This is wrong and cruel.

435
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,496
You have children?

436
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,026
No, I don't.

437
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,932
Then who the hell are you
telling me how to raise my kid?

438
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,573
Just do your job
and sew up my boy.

439
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,801
Okay, boss. Whatever you say.

440
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:23,013
So when you getting back
on the schedule? Here.

441
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,583
- Uh, next week. Thanks.
- Good.

442
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,054
Is there any chance you'll
consider being chief again?

443
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,621
No.

444
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,624
You know, Moretti's gone.

445
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:37,627
And today, Anspaugh
made Skye the acting chief.

446
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,264
Really?

447
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,092
- How about you?
- Me? No.

448
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,303
No, I'm years away from that.

449
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,840
In fact, I was thinking maybe it's
time for me to start looking around.

450
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,477
- Build up my résumé.
- Leave County?

451
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,380
I might need a letter
of recommendation.

452
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,712
So I was wondering, maybe
you could write me one.

453
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:03,447
Yeah, of course, Greg. But, uh,
if you wanna run an ER one day...

454
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,456
there's no better
place to learn.

455
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,594
Yeah, maybe.

456
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,387
But I'm feeling real
invisible around here.

457
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, what have you
been doing to get attention?

458
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,633
- What do you mean?
- Well, be proactive.

459
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,138
Show Anspaugh and the administration
you can make their lives easier.

460
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,241
What do they always
complain about?

461
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,141
Document compliance,
medication reconciliation.

462
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,442
Just give them a plan to fix it.

463
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,481
Dr. Pratt, sats are down
on your pneumonia guy.

464
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,518
All right, I'll be right there.

465
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,482
I'll let Abby know
that you're here.

466
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,751
- Thanks.
- It's good that you're back, man.

467
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,286
I know she missed you.

468
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,930
Hey, and...

469
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,294
thanks.

470
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,795
I'll think about what you said.

471
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,147
Mr. Murphy, can you
wiggle your fingers for us?

472
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,614
- Ancef is in.
- So, what about my dad's arm?

473
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:13,383
He's suffered nerve and artery
damage and I doubt if we can repair it.

474
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,323
Okay, that's not good enough.

475
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,692
If you leave a non-viable
arm attached, it could kill him.

476
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,964
- I'll sign the consent.
- No, Ma.

477
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,002
Ma, what are you saying?
Dad's gonna lose everything.

478
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,503
How's he gonna work,
okay? How's he gonna drive?

479
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:31,474
- How's he gonna play pool?
- There are a lot of great prosthetics.

480
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:35,137
Your father can live a long and
productive life without his arm.

481
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,546
I thought your friends
liked my impressions.

482
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,677
What? What do you mean they
don't know who Elvis Presley is?

483
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,815
Well, then stop calling me.
I didn't call you. Goodbye.

484
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,494
Problems with the
Normandy invasion?

485
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:55,499
The Allied forces had it
easier with the Germans.

486
00:23:56,402 --> 00:24:00,237
I'm not gonna get an ounce of sleep.
Her friends are gonna keep me up all night.

487
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,500
Gonna want me to tell
them my funny stories.

488
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,701
And, you know, DJ and such.

489
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,903
- Can I help you?
- Where do you guys keep the TAC?

490
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,743
- It's right here.
- Oh, good.

491
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:16,286
And could you mix up, uh, 30
mics of fent with 3 cc's of sterile NS...

492
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,354
and load it in an
atomizer for me?

493
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,617
What are you doing?

494
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,285
I've got this sweet kid. He's
got a facial lac, he needs stitches.

495
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,590
Wants to be tough for his old
man, so he doesn't want anesthesia.

496
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,530
You're gonna give the boy
anesthesia without telling him?

497
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:33,536
- Yeah. Gonna think he's toughing it out.
- You can't without the dad's consent.

498
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,642
The dad's an asshole. And
trust me, this kid needs to win.

499
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,605
- Gates...
- Look, it's a topical agent.

500
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,043
And a tiny whiff of
fent. It's like zero risk.

501
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,215
Fine.

502
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:50,151
- Where are they?
- Exam 3.

503
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,587
- I'll meet you there.
- All right.

504
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,570
Thank you, Sam.
Thank you very much.

505
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,928
Keep him on nasal canula and
continuous pulse ox till he's more awake.

506
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:03,058
We'll tell your family everything went
well, and then send them in to see you.

507
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,137
I remember my
homecoming date too.

508
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,404
Way to go, tiger.

509
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,339
That's right.

510
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,020
- Harold, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

511
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,781
You should be on top of
the world. We rocked in there.

512
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,822
She left the dance
with somebody else.

513
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:27,651
Who? Lacey?

514
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,193
- That's awful.
- I can't say I blame her.

515
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:34,332
I mean, Ned Birnbaum is
the president of the chess club.

516
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,196
How can I compete with that?

517
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,597
Well, you know, it's
her loss, not yours.

518
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,262
I bet they had sex.

519
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,533
I bet she had my sex
with Ned Birnbaum.

520
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,439
Someday you're gonna
meet the right girl, fall in love...

521
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,978
and your first time
is gonna be special.

522
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,445
I don't think so.

523
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:52,483
I think I'm gonna end
up a lonely old virgin.

524
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:56,314
Hey, you mustn't give Lacey or any
girl the power to make you feel bad.

525
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,515
You've done something
well. Don't let her ruin that.

526
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,453
What good is success when
you have no one to share it with?

527
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,162
Can we get this
show on the road?

528
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,999
- Okay, big sniff, Tate.
- What's that?

529
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:20,545
Oh, it's something to dry Tate's nose
up so it doesn't run and mess up the field.

530
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,614
Ready? One, two, three.

531
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,478
- Good job.
- All right.

532
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:28,211
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

533
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,615
Still time to back out.

534
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:34,892
All right.

535
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,822
Hold still.

536
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:40,856
All right.

537
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:52,943
- How you feeling, buddy?
- That doesn't hurt at all.

538
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,279
Really? Well, you're
tougher than I am.

539
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,776
He's got a high
tolerance for pain.

540
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,650
Impressive.

541
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,053
What do you know?

542
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,758
Way to go, son.

543
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,760
Okay, Mr. Zangolia, the
endocrinologist will be right down.

544
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,299
Hi. KOVAC: Hey.

545
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,199
- Heard you had a fight.
- More like I helped break one up.

546
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:23,741
- Did you bring Joe with you?
- No, he and Niko are home decorating.

547
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,967
- It's November.
- I know, I know.

548
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:30,707
But Niko won't be here for the holidays
and he wanted to celebrate with us.

549
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,251
- What? What's the matter?
- Nothing.

550
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:38,120
- You don't like my brother?
- He's great. Did he have to visit now?

551
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,919
- You said you wanted to meet my family.
- Yeah, someday.

552
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,891
You were gone for
a really long time.

553
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,554
- You want me to ask him to leave?
- No, no. That's not what I mean.

554
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,257
- I just...
- Listen, I'm sorry.

555
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,664
I know it was tough for
you with me being away.

556
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,134
You think?

557
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,638
To be honest, things have seemed
a little tense since I've been back.

558
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,140
I think it's because you
and I haven't had time...

559
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,610
Do you think it's wrong for
me to want you to myself?

560
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,745
- It was tough for me too.
- Really?

561
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:09,082
Because from the stories Niko tells,
it sounds like you two had a lot of fun.

562
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,416
- Fun?
- Yes, while I was here alone...

563
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,082
working, taking care of
Joe and paying the bills.

564
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,421
Half the time, I didn't
know where you were.

565
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,654
I was taking care
of my dying father.

566
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,025
- Oh, hey there.
- Hi.

567
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,963
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

568
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,027
Not too awkward.

569
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:29,265
- Is that Dr. Kovac?
- Yeah. He's a great guy.

570
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,636
I thought he'd be taller.

571
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,374
- My father has multiple myeloma.
- I know.

572
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,639
You're a doctor, I'd
think you'd understand.

573
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,112
Of course I understand.

574
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,377
But your being there didn't
change his diagnosis or his disease.

575
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,886
- Your life is here.
- You think I liked being miles away?

576
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,821
Yes, at times. I
heard it in your voice.

577
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,220
I love my father.

578
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,192
- You expect me to turn my back on him?
- This is so unfair.

579
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:54,231
- You wanna do this?
- No. I gotta go. Let's talk later.

580
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,459
Fine, I'll put my
brother in a hotel.

581
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,695
Twentysomething male,
baseball bat vs. head.

582
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,498
Bradycardic, lost
pulse en route.

583
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,301
- What happened?
- Friends say he was hanging out...

584
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:07,037
next thing, car pulls up, guys
jump out, start wailing away on him.

585
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,182
- Any ID?
- No, but family followed the rig.

586
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,547
Manny. Manny.

587
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:17,046
- Manny.
- Oh, my God, it's her son.

588
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,020
Manny.

589
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,200
IV's blown.

590
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,427
Hold the compressions.

591
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,531
- Still V-tach.
- No pulse.

592
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,538
Shock again.

593
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,233
Clear.

594
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,746
No change. Resume compressions.

595
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,481
- CT's ready for him.
- No.

596
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:49,382
- Forget it. He's too unstable.
- What have you got?

597
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,080
Twenty-year-old bludgeoned
in the head with a bat.

598
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,589
We treated his mother.

599
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,490
Blown pupil suggestive
of intracranial bleed.

600
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,425
Pulseless V-tach for
almost 45 minutes.

601
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,770
Okay, well, uh, there's
nothing for me to do, then.

602
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,571
Dr. Wexler.

603
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,401
Lucien, wait.

604
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,246
Let mom see we did
everything we could.

605
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,214
Okay. Um... Another mig of epi.

606
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,116
- You want me to go through the tube?
- Put in a central line.

607
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,956
- Chuny, where are they?
- Tiffany was supposed to restock.

608
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,162
I'll be right back.

609
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:39,764
- How you feeling?
- Stupid.

610
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,634
- I can't believe what I did.
- What you did?

611
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,505
Everyone knows it was
that cleaning lady's fault.

612
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,940
What?

613
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,243
Yeah, but I took care of it.

614
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:53,844
Took care of what?

615
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,186
What are you talking about?

616
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:01,817
I left the cutter on,
bypassed the safety guard.

617
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:06,488
If it wasn't for that
woman, I'd be dead.

618
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,868
But it was her fault. I
mean, that's what they said.

619
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,630
What did you do, John?

620
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,208
What did you do?

621
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,983
What did you do?

622
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,322
- Here's the kit. WEXLER:
Hold compressions.

623
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,689
Tell security I need to talk to them.
And post a guard outside Trauma 1.

624
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,559
Asystole.

625
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,022
- Resume.
- What?

626
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,161
He's been down for
almost 50 minutes.

627
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,605
Just for a few more moments.

628
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,603
Hey, I'll take over
for you, Abby.

629
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,229
We have been working on
your son for almost an hour.

630
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,967
The injuries to his brain
and body were too severe.

631
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,134
His heart has stopped beating.

632
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,609
His body has stopped breathing.

633
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,881
No, <i>por favor.</i>

634
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,358
No.

635
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,768
Please, don't.

636
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,133
Please.

637
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,944
Justin broke up with Brianna.
When did that happen?

638
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:47,616
- The week before he moved back.
- She caught him texting Emma Rosen.

639
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,556
- Men.
- Men.

640
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,995
Hey. Here we go.

641
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,696
Top one's no cheese.

642
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:03,305
- So how's it going?
- Good, I guess.

643
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,000
All right.

644
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,810
So, what do we wanna
do first? Watch videos?

645
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,309
Want me to grab my harmonica?
Wanna sing some songs?

646
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,218
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

647
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,058
Be right back.

648
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,591
Yeah?

649
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,722
- Can you give us some privacy?
- What? I thought we were having...

650
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,035
Oh, all right, sure.

651
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,830
But, at least, could I
have a slice of pizza?

652
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,475
Yeah.

653
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,469
Just gonna...

654
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,046
- So anyway...
- Anyways...

655
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,581
So you met him?

656
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,593
- Hey, Abby, you off soon?
- No, I'm on till 10.

657
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,286
Harold and I are on all night.

658
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,294
Heard Moretti's gone.
What's the story?

659
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,229
- I don't know.
- His son. Did you know he had a kid?

660
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,926
No. Uh, maybe.

661
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,196
- I don't know.
- Okay.

662
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,272
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

663
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,966
Hey, Neela.

664
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:15,102
Um, would it be okay if I stopped
by? There's a bunch of stuff I left there.

665
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,805
Yeah, sure. You've got
some stuff in the hall closet.

666
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,881
Thanks.

667
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,752
Morris.

668
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,231
How's it going, Sam?

669
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,625
Dolores Salazar and
her family just left.

670
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,295
That was a tough one.

671
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:44,134
Yeah, I just keep thinking about
how much she's gone through...

672
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,643
and how hard she worked
to have a good life here.

673
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,611
She and Manny deserved better.

674
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,814
- You working out?
- Oh. They're not mine.

675
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,785
Hey, I wanted to say thanks for
suggesting I look into the program.

676
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,825
- I'm going for it.
- Good.

677
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,486
It's good to have aspirations.

678
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,792
It's never too late to be
what you might have been.

679
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,835
- That's George Eliot.
- He's a writer, right?

680
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,506
He was a she, actually.
Mary Ann Evans.

681
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,634
She used a pen name because the
work of men was taken more seriously.

682
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,110
Like anything's changed.

683
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,308
- So how was your first day as chief?
- I'm clear and strong, I'm a bitch.

684
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,113
If I play it loose and Socratic,
I'm perceived as weak.

685
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,381
I even bought
doughnuts for everybody.

686
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,648
Doughnuts.

687
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,293
Maybe you can ask
Hillary Clinton for advice.

688
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,292
Either way, I can't
win, so screw it.

689
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,693
Tough when I have to
be, nice when I wanna be.

690
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,459
Hey, they're taking
the Murphy kid.

691
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,460
- Good.
- Yeah, you said it.

692
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,368
Sam, do you know
where Room 2G-315 is?

693
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,532
No, sorry.

694
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,366
I do.

695
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,707
- I'll show you on my way out.
- Great.

696
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,545
<i>We're off men for the
rest of our natural lives.</i>

697
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:48,422
Ah. The perks of being chief.

698
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,032
I have a feeling this isn't
really quite what you wanted.

699
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,605
Yeah, I've never been
one for putting down roots.

700
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,369
But I'm fine.

701
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,570
- It'll all work out.
- Yeah?

702
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,476
Well, why don't we celebrate?

703
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:05,979
I can make a mean lasagna.

704
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,881
I'll come over to your house,
break in your new kitchen.

705
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,720
Lucien...

706
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,827
I don't wanna be presumptuous...

707
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,462
but I like you, and I
think you like me...

708
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,965
so I wanna be
completely up-front.

709
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,968
Okay. I welcome honesty.

710
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,838
When it comes
to relationships...

711
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:35,242
I guess you could say
I have a fluid attitude.

712
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,506
Uh-huh.

713
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,245
When I'm with
someone, I'm with them.

714
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,150
And when I'm not, I'm not.

715
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,085
Love the one you're with.

716
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,527
So if you can handle a
relationship with no strings...

717
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,134
sex with no commitments,
then we're cool.

718
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,472
Does that freak you out?

719
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:10,175
Uh... No. I'm all good.

720
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,943
How about drinks tomorrow night?

721
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,519
Why wait?

722
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,988
It's like... It's 2 a.m.

723
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,897
Right.

724
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:31,964
Yeah, alcohol probably isn't the
best way to unwind at this hour.

725
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:35,300
You know what really relaxes me?

726
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,174
Yoga.

727
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,311
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

728
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:46,383
After a couple of long hours in the O.R.,
a few poses can really mellow me out.

729
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,046
I'm not into yoga.

730
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,089
No?

731
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,372
- So this is your office.
- Mm-hm.

732
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,746
Nice desk.

733
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,461
Need help with that?

734
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,355
You're up.

735
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,030
Where have you been?

736
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,803
It's after 2.

737
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,940
Oh, my God, already?

738
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,475
I was worried. I called the ER.

739
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:53,778
They said you
left. Early, in fact.

740
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,580
Why didn't you
answer your cell phone?

741
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,225
Um... Why didn't I
answer my cell phone?

742
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,392
I don't know. Why didn't
you answer your cell?

743
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,302
- You didn't call me tonight.
- I'm not... It's not...

744
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,099
When you were in
Croatia and Joe was hurt...

745
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:17,174
and I couldn't find you...

746
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,742
why didn't you answer
your cell phone?

747
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:23,848
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. I just... I had a long day.

748
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:27,110
- Where's Joe?
- Joe's fine. He's asleep.

749
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,382
You know what?
Why do you do that?

750
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,113
- Do what?
- Drink in front of me.

751
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,590
You never once asked me was that
okay with me or did that bother me.

752
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,127
You used to have a
problem. You're better now.

753
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,663
Well, it takes
what it takes, right?

754
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,663
What does that mean?

755
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,104
I don't wanna do this now.

756
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:59,478
You don't wanna do this now?
It's about what you want, isn't it?

757
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,764
- This isn't the best time.
- What about what I want?

758
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,320
I mean, you promised
and I believed you.

759
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,218
What are you talking about?

760
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,656
You said "let's do it together" in
front of everyone. You promised.

761
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,662
- Okay, let's go to bed.
- I'm not tired.

762
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,233
- I have things to talk about.
- Okay, tomorrow.

763
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,870
We're not gonna talk
tomorrow. We need to talk now.

764
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,472
Hey.

765
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,500
My father died.
