1
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,600
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,435
- Okay, but we miss you.
- I miss you too.

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,889
Brian, why are you here?

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,912
- I feel like he's not telling me stuff.
- Yeah.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,258
- Come on, let loose for a night.
- I'll think about it.

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,911
- Who wants drink? Anybody?
- No, no.

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,850
You should really take a
cab home right now. Really.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,423
- I was not aware that I was flirting.
- I'm not stupid, you know.

9
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,789
Mr. and Mrs. Riley
have legal custody.

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,362
It's not gonna be for
a long time, I promise.

11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,099
- Have you've been lost.
- Haven't you?

12
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:43,508
All right, so tell me again, who
were those weird forest chicks?

13
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:44,701
The Wilis.

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,178
The spirits of girls jilted in
love left to haunt the woodland.

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,341
And that macarena
thing they were doing?

16
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,113
To make the prince dance
until his heart gave out.

17
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,779
But Giselle came to his rescue.

18
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,517
- Yeah, well, I guess that happens, huh?
- You don't like ballet.

19
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:04,893
Not about haunted girls in the woods. I
like sugarplum fairies, it's Christmassy.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,727
Ha-ha-ha. This was
pretty groundbreaking.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,096
I mean, Gautier
created the whole idea...

22
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,229
of investing emotion
and sincerity in ballet.

23
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,002
Uh-oh. You're smart, aren't you?

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,975
- You've only just noticed?
- I've been in denial.

25
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,445
- You'll get over that.
- Or else what?

26
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:25,552
Or else I'll make you dance
till your heart gives out.

27
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:34,452
You know, I have <i>The
Nutcracker</i> DVD back at my place.

28
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:38,463
- It's got bonus features.
- Ha-ha-ha.

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,595
- How long have you been living here?
- Uh, two months.

30
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,503
- It sucks, huh?
- Shut up, Kim, it's not that bad.

31
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,076
Yes, it is. Isn't it, Sarah?

32
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,408
- Yeah, it kind of sucks.
- Yo, losers.

33
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,415
Meet our friend. This
is Sarah, she's new.

34
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,246
- Hey.
- New from where?

35
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,514
- Chicago.
- Chicago, that's dope.

36
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,180
I haven't seen you around.

37
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,123
- Yeah, I'm not your year.
- What are you?

38
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,364
- Sophomore.
- Cool.

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,194
It's crazy in here.

40
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,464
Uh, I'm gonna go out
front. Wanna come?

41
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,018
Come on in.

42
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,479
It's, uh, very dark.

43
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,024
Oh, yeah. Look, I have
one of these. Watch this.

44
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,285
Huh?

45
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,452
It's nice. It's not bad.

46
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,157
It's, uh, not bad at all.

47
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,499
- Is this Sarah?
- Mm-hm.

48
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,299
Yeah, that's her at
Halloween a few years ago.

49
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,032
You said she lives
with her grandparents?

50
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,200
She's a beautiful little girl.

51
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,712
Yeah, she is.

52
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,655
Party's lame.

53
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,226
Wanna go for a drive?

54
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:27,003
Here, give it back if
you're not gonna smoke it.

55
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,441
Well?

56
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,779
Wait, I'm coming. I'm
coming, I'm coming.

57
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,050
- You want some?
- Oh, no, I try not to.

58
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,095
I think it's the way
God would want it.

59
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,962
You know, the Rastafarians
consider it a sacrament.

60
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,434
- I'm very ecumenical.
- All right.

61
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,933
What? Was it something I said?

62
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,879
Oh, no, this was great.

63
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,571
- Great?
- It was nice.

64
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,274
- Nice?
- You know, it was fun.

65
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,479
- What did we just do, go to Disneyland?
- You rocked my world, okay?

66
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,928
But I don't like sleeping over
this early in a relationship.

67
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,395
Wow. All right, well, just leave
the money on your way out.

68
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,803
I still have to go.

69
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,764
Oh, good, this is
my next appointment.

70
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,735
- Hello?
- Tony, I need you to come.

71
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,278
I messed up, I'm in trouble.

72
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,109
Sarah? What happened?
Where are you?

73
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,081
- I don't know, I don't know where I am.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

74
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,914
Tony, just come.

75
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,923
<i>I'm kind of busy, Dad.</i>

76
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,534
<i>I've been up all night working,
studying for my history midterm.</i>

77
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,828
Yeah, I can tell you
look a little worn-out.

78
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,837
Maybe you should just
try getting a little more rest.

79
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,534
<i>I just told you I've been up...
Did you not hear what I just said?</i>

80
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,178
No, I heard you. I
heard you. Sorry.

81
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,172
I just wanted to check in and see
if, um, you had given any thought...

82
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,477
to what we discussed
the other day.

83
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:25,122
<i>If Obama wins, do you think
there's gonna be riots in the streets?</i>

84
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,285
- Brian, look, I want...
<i>- I mean, because people have to unify.</i>

85
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,021
<i>- Like, you know? Right now.</i>
- Right.

86
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,666
<i>I've been reading about Watts.</i>

87
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,495
<i>It's like... Do you
remember? Watts?</i>

88
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,899
Well, yeah. I mean, I
know about it. Yeah.

89
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,835
<i>White America is so racist.</i>

90
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,669
<i>It's such a shame.</i>

91
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,578
- Right.
<i>- I mean, this country, Dad, is a crock.</i>

92
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,374
Yeah.

93
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,041
Look, Brian, did you
see that therapist?

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,990
<i>You want the answer? Is
that what you wanna know?</i>

95
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:00,821
<i>The answer to your putrid question?
None of your damn business.</i>

96
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,590
- Okay.
<i>- I have privacy rights.</i>

97
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,198
<i>Which means you need
to leave me the hell alone...</i>

98
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,834
<i>or else you can go to jail.</i>

99
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,492
Okay. Okay.

100
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,501
That is not what
we're talking about.

101
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,573
What we're talking about
is I'm just asking you...

102
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,073
<i>- I gotta go.</i>
- Hey.

103
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,178
- Look...
<i>- I gotta study.</i>

104
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:23,249
<i>The... This thing is
in like a couple hours.</i>

105
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,681
<i>- I wanna go to the gym first.</i>
- Okay, but look...

106
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,016
Son, look, wait a minute.
Can you just talk to me, son?

107
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,350
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

108
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:36,724
<i>Thank you so much for
your paternal concern.</i>

109
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,288
<i>And, Dad?</i>

110
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:43,165
<i>I hope one of your patients
stabs you with an AIDS needle.</i>

111
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,410
So you're back on, huh?

112
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,787
Yeah, I took a few days.

113
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,631
I... Yeah, that's a... I
have a seizure patient.

114
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,996
CT shows an AVM. I was
gonna admit to Neurosurgery.

115
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,658
All right, just make
sure that you call IR.

116
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:18,399
I did that.

117
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,473
Okay, good, thanks.

118
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,773
Hey, look, Abby...

119
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,745
Grady has a hip dislocation
in 3 he wants to run by you...

120
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,441
before he sends to, um, Ortho.

121
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,248
Okay.

122
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,326
She wouldn't go to the police.
She wouldn't do anything.

123
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,325
I don't see her.

124
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,602
You know who Teri is? I
talked to someone named Teri.

125
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,269
- About the little girl?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,882
She's in the back.

127
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,498
It's okay.

128
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,964
It's all right now.

129
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,297
Oh, hey, hey, hey, take that.

130
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,566
Hey, I haven't seen
you in a few days.

131
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,834
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

132
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,740
Are we okay?

133
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,176
That night outside
Ike's, it got a little ugly.

134
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,542
That wasn't a big deal.

135
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,207
Haven't been yourself. I'm
not the one who's noticed.

136
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,513
This place is a breeding
ground for gossip.

137
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,519
It's not gossip,
it's more like worry.

138
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,057
Well, maybe they should
worry about themselves.

139
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,860
It's just hard with Luka
not here, that's all. I'm fine.

140
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,695
When is the big
Croat coming back?

141
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,202
He was gonna get a flight today,
so hopefully he'll be here tomorrow.

142
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,172
- Well, that should make things easier.
- Yeah, it should.

143
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,675
Marcus Faneca,
20-foot fall from a ladder.

144
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,336
No LOC, complains of
chest and right hip pain.

145
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,541
- How'd this happen?
- I was cleaning leaves from the gutters.

146
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,518
BP, 100/60, tachy at 120,
had two of MS in the field.

147
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,589
- Hey, buddy, how old are you?
- I'll be 13 in January.

148
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,783
- Where are your parents?
- Just my father.

149
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,088
He's coming behind, we couldn't
fit the chair in the rig with us.

150
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,894
My dad's a paraplegic.

151
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:30,268
He gave me a sip of something out
of a flask and started touching me.

152
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,564
Sexually?

153
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,865
Yeah.

154
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,577
It's okay. You can
tell him everything.

155
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:45,384
I reached down and grabbed
something and hit him with it.

156
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,285
- Hit him with what?
- I don't know.

157
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:53,450
It was, like, metal, heavy,
kind of like an L shape.

158
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,650
A tire iron?

159
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,727
I guess so, maybe.

160
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,266
You hit him with a tire iron?

161
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,430
Okay, we're gonna
sit you up now.

162
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,063
My dad, he might need
help getting in here.

163
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,473
It's okay. The hospital's
wheelchair-accessible.

164
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,943
- Aah.
- A little more morphine?

165
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:18,142
No. His pressure's borderline,
another 250 of saline first.

166
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,787
Small pneumothorax,
gonna need a chest tube.

167
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,423
Okay. Oh, damn it.

168
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,492
Okay.

169
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,654
Displaced femoral
neck fracture, right?

170
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,824
- You asking me?
- No.

171
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,835
- That's what it is.
- Okay, I'll get Hare Traction.

172
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,098
No, I wanna try 5
pounds of Buck's traction.

173
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,708
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Sam, I'm sure.

174
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,440
Sorry.

175
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,880
Hey, pal. I got here as fast
as I could. How you doing?

176
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,182
I'm sorry, Dad, I should've
had the ladder angled better.

177
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,327
Oh, hey, no, no. That
was not your fault.

178
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,988
- You his doctor?
- Yeah, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

179
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,526
So, what's the deal?

180
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,966
Well, your son has
a collapsed lung.

181
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,164
We're gonna need to insert a
tube to expand it while it gets better.

182
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,208
- How bad is that? Is that bad?
- Not too bad, it'll heal.

183
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,505
- He also has a fractured femur.
- What?

184
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,308
A broken hip bone the
surgeons will take a look at.

185
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,644
We're gonna try to
reduce it under anesthesia.

186
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,183
If they can't, then what?

187
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,686
- Well, why don't we wait for the consult?
- What could happen?

188
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,722
Sir, maybe we should
talk out here, huh?

189
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,051
I'll be right back, okay?

190
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,034
I don't think you need
to be worrying about...

191
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,701
What? Worst-case scenario?
Why the hell shouldn't we?

192
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,279
Okay, avascular necrosis of
the femoral head, chronic pain...

193
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,510
hip replacement at a young
age, he never walks normally.

194
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,981
That's what I was afraid of.

195
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,082
Mr. Faneca, what
I'm trying to tell you...

196
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:10,094
is the surgeons should be able to
realign and stabilize your son's leg.

197
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,791
- It doesn't need to get to that.
- Yeah, like I've never heard that before.

198
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,459
Two-layer closure.

199
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,763
Yes. And what else?

200
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,065
And a Psych consult.
The guy's a nut job.

201
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,367
Right, well, get on it.

202
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,533
By the way, I need
to be out of here by 6.

203
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,975
It's Lacey's homecoming
tonight. Big deal.

204
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,875
- Right. MORRIS:
Go, go, Badgers.

205
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,743
- What?
- That's their school mascot.

206
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,544
- The Woodland Badgers.
- Americans.

207
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,483
You ready, stallion? You got
your moves all worked out?

208
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:38,887
Wait, wait. Okay, let me see. First
you have the yawn reach-around.

209
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:43,496
- Ooh. Ah. Nice.
- You yawn like a horse.

210
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:48,601
Oh, then there's the
earnest emo shoulder-hold.

211
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,832
- I really, really care about you, Lacey.
- Oh, please.

212
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,438
Is that even a move?

213
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:59,671
And finally, the false drop
intentional-accidental face-to-face.

214
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,154
Oh, excuse me. How clumsy.

215
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,548
Please, you're making me queasy.

216
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,456
I'm letting him have the
sex machine for the big night.

217
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,927
- Oh, wow. I appreciate it.
- Got it detailed, you're gonna love it.

218
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,430
- I thought you were mad about your car.
- No.

219
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,091
- Haleh?
- No more dings, okay?

220
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,796
Can you man the triage desk?
We got a backup in Waiting.

221
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,498
No, but I can woman it.

222
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,644
Abby's bitching
about her chest tube.

223
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,177
- We're on our way.
- Let her sniff your hand first.

224
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,542
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

225
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:39,049
Abby keeps going like this, I'm
gonna slap her with a colostomy bag.

226
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,280
I only have to take it for a few hours
before I switch to my O.R. shift at noon.

227
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,685
- O.R. shift?
- Mm-hm.

228
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,624
It's part of my transpo training
for intubation experience.

229
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,821
Morris, go and supervise, okay?

230
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,331
Maybe you should, I was just
about to see this swimsuit model...

231
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,628
with knee pain after
slipping on runway.

232
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,363
I'll take that, you
go deal with Abby.

233
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:05,044
Well, well, look what
the cat dragged in. Ha.

234
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,010
Three-centimeter
incision over the fifth rib.

235
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,640
- How's that?
- Good.

236
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,650
Okay, 36 French tube.

237
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,484
Thirty-six? You mean 28, right?

238
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,990
Right, sorry, 28.

239
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,663
- Tunnel over the intercostal space.
- Uh-huh.

240
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,925
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?

241
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,127
It's just, a kid under
50 kilos needs a...

242
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,397
I know what he needs.

243
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,773
Another vascular clamp.

244
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,406
- A curved clamp.
- Are you kidding me?

245
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:43,016
Okay, you know what? You wanna show off
to your sidekick here, fine. It's all you.

246
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,048
What? What's wrong?

247
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,948
Nothing, everything
is fine, sir.

248
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,385
- I stay superior to the rib, right?
- If you were to go inferior...

249
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,924
I could bag an intercostal
artery and then he'd bleed out.

250
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,391
How old are you?

251
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,292
What I lack in experience, I
make up for in enthusiasm.

252
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,729
- What?
- Yeah, this being my first chest tube...

253
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,926
I am committed
to getting it right.

254
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,264
You're kidding.
Is he kidding me?

255
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,966
This is a teaching hospital, and
Dr. Zelinsky's a qualified Resident.

256
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,043
Well, I don't want him. I want
someone with more experience.

257
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,077
Her. Why can't she do it?

258
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,415
Hello?

259
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,768
I thought you were
coming tomorrow.

260
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,308
I caught an earlier
connection to Frankfurt.

261
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,139
- What?
- Nothing, I just wish you told me.

262
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,943
- I would've taken the day off.
- Last minute. I thought I'd surprise you.

263
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,380
- No, it's nice.
- Yeah?

264
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,418
Yes. Are you exhausted?

265
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,147
No, I feel good. I just
wanna go home and see Joe.

266
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,814
You should go home and see Joe.

267
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,085
Marnie probably has
him at swim class now...

268
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,421
but they'll be home...

269
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:06,498
I just wanted to stop by and
see you, the look on your face.

270
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,135
And, um, I got you something.

271
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,396
- You did?
- Mm-hm.

272
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,231
It's, uh, licitar.

273
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,468
I know it's corny,
but it's Croatian.

274
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,478
What you're supposed to get your girl
when you haven't seen her in a long time.

275
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:26,483
And since you had a blackout,
I figured, you know, candle...

276
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:33,088
You know, like...
God, I missed you so...

277
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,689
- Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.
- Sorry.

278
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,266
Hi, you must be Dr. Kovac.

279
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,131
- Yes, I'm Kevin Moretti.
- Nice to meet you.

280
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,296
I hear you really whipped
the place into shape.

281
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,272
Yeah, well, you
know, I certainly tried.

282
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,208
- Well, so how was your...?
- No, being...

283
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,679
Being chief is a lot of responsibility,
and after we had the baby...

284
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,819
I decided I'd rather spend
the time with my family.

285
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,649
Yeah, well... Yeah, I
mean, it's a tough job, but...

286
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,951
- Someone's gotta do it.
- That's right, someone's got to.

287
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,963
- Okay, if you'll excuse me. Okay.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,123
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, thanks, bye.

289
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,634
- Well, doesn't seem like such a bad guy.
- No, he's all right, I guess.

290
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,238
- You called him Mussolini.
- Yeah.

291
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,966
Okay, I'll see you later.

292
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:27,045
I'm gonna run by the desk. I
got some souvenirs for the guys.

293
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,672
And when you get home,
I have a surprise for you.

294
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,819
Luka.

295
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,053
I missed you too.

296
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,748
Well, you got some nerve.

297
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,543
- You don't wanna start.
- I don't?

298
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,585
Sarah got in trouble, she
didn't call you. Think about that.

299
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,313
About why she didn't turn to
you when she needed help.

300
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,584
I know why. Because we
have rules here and discipline.

301
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,252
We don't just let her talk or dress
or do whatever the hell she wants.

302
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,627
Hank, go finish with the horses.

303
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,268
- I can do that later.
- Hank.

304
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,503
Sarah's taking a bath.

305
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,837
She likes me to wash her
hair for her. More coffee?

306
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,004
No, thanks, we gotta
go. Let's go, Julia.

307
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,944
Where are you from, Julia?

308
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,585
I was an Army brat. My
family moved around a lot.

309
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,950
- Mostly the Midwest, though.
- What part?

310
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,690
Indiana. And some
time in South Dakota.

311
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,353
I got apples need peeling.
How are you with that?

312
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,028
Where's your paring knife?

313
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:37,475
Hey, Abby. Sorry.
We should talk.

314
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,838
- We don't need to.
- Hey.

315
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,111
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, um, Mr. Faneca.

316
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,185
Sorry, excuse me. I was
just reviewing your son's chart.

317
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,821
Where'd you go? You just left.

318
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,389
Well, the chest tube was
placed and I'm here now.

319
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,049
- Repeat CBC is back?
- Hemoglobin's stable.

320
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,161
Okay. Ortho ready for him?

321
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,628
- Tied up with an open tib-fib.
- I'm concerned about his chest pain.

322
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,325
It hurts when I breathe.

323
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,993
Take it easy, Marcus.
It's gonna be okay.

324
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,538
Okay, Harold, I'll try.

325
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,836
- Should I repeat the chest x-ray?
- Um... No.

326
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,174
Breath sounds are good,
sats are fine, BP's normal.

327
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,043
Try four of MS. I'll try
to get an ETA on Ortho.

328
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,377
- So it's all good?
- Yeah.

329
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,020
It's normal to have pain
when you have a tube in.

330
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,679
The morphine should help that.

331
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,988
You know, you seem distracted.

332
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,824
- Should I ask for another doctor?
- Excuse me?

333
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,660
I need you to fix this.
Get things moving along.

334
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,826
- We're wasting time.
- Just calm down, sir.

335
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:41,667
- We're doing our best, we really are.
- Look, he's my kid, okay?

336
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,208
He's all I've got.

337
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,180
Guys, excellent. I need
a little fashion help here.

338
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,282
You can say that
again. Look at your tie.

339
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,179
For Harold.

340
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,877
- Which one should he wear tonight?
- Go black.

341
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,614
- That's what I'm talking about.
- The black's short...

342
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,689
and Harold is lankier
than he seems.

343
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,727
- I was measuring his inseam earlier...
- Whoa, TMI.

344
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:03,919
All right.

345
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:09,091
I gotta pick up a
choledoco-jejunostomy for Dubenko.

346
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,067
Greg, what is up with Ortho?
We need to get that kid up.

347
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,298
They were still
working on the tib-fib.

348
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,066
It's gonna be a bit longer.

349
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,302
I heard Luka was here.
You told me tomorrow.

350
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,447
Yeah, I know. It
was a surprise. Um...

351
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,946
They need to hurry it up.

352
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,482
That's what I've been
telling them for 15 minutes.

353
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,813
And thanks for taking
care of that chest tube.

354
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:32,152
It was really Harold.
Tell Luka I said hello.

355
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,790
Hey, Benito left this stack of
preemptive orders for you to sign off on.

356
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,625
- Where is he now?
- I'm not sure, he went to take a call.

357
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,665
Something about his kid.

358
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,893
You people and your
dysfunctional families.

359
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,504
- Hey, you just can't go in there.
- Thank you, love.

360
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,335
- A little help, mate.
- He's hurt his ankle rather badly.

361
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,807
- And how did you do that?
- Cheese rolling.

362
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,577
Cheese rolling?

363
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,478
It's an old, rather
pointless pagan ritual...

364
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,178
that some of us in the local ex-pat
community periodically reenact.

365
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:04,186
They roll the wheel down
the hill and you tumble after it.

366
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,158
- The first one down wins the cheese.
- Morris, this one is all you.

367
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,524
- What can I do for you?
- He's hurt his ankle.

368
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,166
Oh, wow, wait, are you
one of those cheese rollers?

369
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,029
- Yes, I am.
- Cool, cool.

370
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,330
I've read about that.
Let's find you a bed.

371
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,995
Heard you were looking for me.

372
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,006
Check out that rack there.
Pick out a suit for tonight.

373
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,507
What? Really?

374
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,005
Wow.

375
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,443
- Hey, are you a cheese roller?
- Yes, I am.

376
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,379
- Sweet.
- So you're the lucky winner, huh?

377
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,451
Enough Double
Gloucester for a year.

378
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:37,147
- You must be proud.
- He's quite a catch.

379
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,784
Well, probably just a sprain...

380
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,520
but I'll get an x-ray, give
you something for pain.

381
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,632
Look, this won't take long,
will it? We must be on our way.

382
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,792
We've gotta pick up some
biscuits and mustard at the market.

383
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,529
Well, I'll get you moving
fast as I can, governor.

384
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,442
On your way, then. Good chap.

385
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,707
- Still waiting on Ortho?
- Yes, doctor. Nice suit.

386
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,853
- You look good.
- Oh, this? I have a date.

387
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,578
I wanted to check on my buddy...

388
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,588
before I sign out
for my big night.

389
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,389
You rock, Harold.

390
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,222
- Pressure's down to 80/40.
- What?

391
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,592
- Harder to breathe.
- Oh, that's not good.

392
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,896
- Sats are dropping.
- Oh, jeepers, subcutaneous emphysema.

393
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:33,039
- Go get an Attending.
- No, you stay. Help them, I'll go.

394
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,713
What's happening?

395
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,113
Because of your fall, the air in your
chest is leaking into your neck and torso.

396
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,084
- Seventy over thirty.
- It's constricting, 10 blade.

397
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,246
- Come again?
- I need to open him up.

398
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,517
- He needs sedation.
- Pressure won't take it.

399
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,423
There's no time for a local.
This is gonna hurt a bit.

400
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,359
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

401
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,200
- Harold, what are you doing?
- Harold.

402
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,945
Oh, my God.

403
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,149
Sats at 99, pressure's 120/85.

404
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,584
Wow.

405
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,521
Sorry about that.

406
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,823
Dude.

407
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,836
That's a rental.

408
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,206
Hey, they said you wanted to
see me ASAP. What's going on?

409
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,079
Yeah. Housekeeping's gonna
have to clean up this sink.

410
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,881
- It smells like somebody puked in here.
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.

411
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,081
Um, I have to go.

412
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,725
Frank's getting me a flight...

413
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,158
but I'm gonna go to
the airport and just wait.

414
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,333
Okay. Where are you going?

415
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,832
Cover the shift. I know
that you've expressed...

416
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,097
You know, the desire for
more responsibility in the past...

417
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:10,641
and, um, let's use
this as a trial run, okay?

418
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,244
Oh, okay, thanks.

419
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:17,406
- Until when?
- I don't know. Um...

420
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:23,789
I don't usually let my personal
obligations interfere with my work...

421
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,653
and I expect the
same in my staff, but I...

422
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,294
This, um... There's...

423
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,755
Hey, you okay?

424
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:39,839
It's my son. He's having
a tough time at school.

425
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,032
He got very agitated during
an exam in a lecture hall.

426
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,301
Agitated?

427
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,877
And he accused the kid
next to him of cheating.

428
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,141
And then when the professor
tried to intercede, he just...

429
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,807
He lashed out at her.

430
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,715
So...

431
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,787
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

432
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,061
Yeah, no, I know,
I didn't either.

433
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,560
Maybe I should've.

434
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,231
Yeah, if there's
anything I can do...

435
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,035
Thanks.

436
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,235
All right, that's it.

437
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,135
Okay.

438
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,980
Okay, here goes.

439
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,088
Harold, why don't you get
changed and get out of here?

440
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,247
Are you sure? But Marcus and...

441
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:36,225
Yeah, you'll have plenty of other
chances to scrub in on O.R. cases.

442
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,693
Okay, I see the cords.

443
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,389
Tube.

444
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,396
Only one high school homecoming.

445
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:45,095
Well, actually, it's my third,
but, okay, if you say so.

446
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,265
Okay, I'm in.

447
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:51,535
Nicely done.

448
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,474
Yeah, wow. Congratulations, Sam.

449
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,342
Bye, Marcus. I'll check
in on you tomorrow.

450
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,248
Well, it's a night
of many firsts.

451
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,118
Let's keep our fingers crossed
for one more. Bye, everybody.

452
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,124
What is taking so long? You
should be to the joint capsule.

453
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,727
- What?
- Kidding.

454
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:11,786
Ortho.

455
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,796
- Ten blade to...?
- Neela Rasgotra. Trauma.

456
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,460
Okay, 10 blade to her.

457
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,629
Between the sartorius and
the tensor fasciae latae, right?

458
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:25,540
Trauma surgeons, so serious, I love it.
Can we get some tunes going in here?

459
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:29,912
She's good at that, Tony, must
have some farm experience.

460
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,880
Only a little.

461
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,576
Oh, fold that right,
that's no good.

462
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,086
Did you know Meg, my daughter?

463
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,485
No, ma'am, I didn't.

464
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,116
She was good at her chores,
helping out around the place.

465
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:46,231
Then she got older, bored, a
little wild, and she moved away.

466
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,927
- She doesn't need to know all that.
- No, it's fine, I'm very interested.

467
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,663
You're here, you
seem nice enough.

468
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,037
Maybe you can
help him understand.

469
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,079
Understand what, Becky?

470
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,343
Sarah's been changing.

471
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:09,488
Talking back, disappearing,
having trouble at school.

472
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:13,092
She's becoming more
and more like her mother.

473
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,592
Now, we love her and we never
wanna lose her from our lives.

474
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,660
But we're old and we've
been through this once before.

475
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,165
You fought to keep her.
You wanted it like this.

476
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,928
The child's not happy here.

477
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,130
She's 13 now,
it'll only get worse.

478
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,502
We don't have it in us...

479
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,803
to go through again
what we went through.

480
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:35,141
- All the struggle.
- You never thought about that before?

481
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,145
We were grieving
for our daughter...

482
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,380
looking for a way
to hold onto her.

483
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,556
Do what we thought
was best for Sarah.

484
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,591
We made a mistake, Tony,
but out of the best of intentions.

485
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,791
I don't wanna punish her
because we were wrong.

486
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,466
Much better. I knew
the black one wouldn't fit.

487
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,333
I told those guys, you're lanky.

488
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,736
- This is pretty hardcore.
- Oh, yeah, I like it.

489
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,471
Oh. Can't be late. Don't
keep the little lady waiting.

490
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:10,138
No, Lacey's 5-foot-10.
She's on the volleyball team.

491
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,750
Okay, now, this
is for her wrist.

492
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,183
Don't jump into the
deep end right off the bat.

493
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:19,189
And this is non-alcoholic, but you
can always hope for the placebo effect.

494
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,850
I gotta get back downstairs.

495
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:25,759
My gimpy limey cheese freak is
waiting to get his ankle wrapped.

496
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,230
I wanted to show
Neela before I go.

497
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,504
All right, don't dawdle. Or your
chances of getting some are ruined.

498
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,437
I almost forgot.

499
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,770
Remember, there's a
reason we have speed limits.

500
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,004
Come on.

501
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,012
Yeah.

502
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,019
The periosteum
slipped into the fracture.

503
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,020
We will flip it
back out. Debakey.

504
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,421
First liter of NS in. Want
me to hang another?

505
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:57,290
Don't bother, we'll
be done in a minute.

506
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,054
Whoa!

507
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,159
Damn, damn.

508
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,900
Pulse 144, 78/45.

509
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,062
Hang O-neg, saline,
whatever we've got.

510
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,104
Hi.

511
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,209
Something bad's happening.

512
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,150
It appears that the broken
bone injured the artery.

513
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,054
Once they repositioned
it, the tear started bleeding.

514
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,785
It's rare. No way the doctors
could've predicted this.

515
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,486
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

516
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:35,395
I mean, the body's entire
blood volume could just...

517
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,243
Dr. Rasgotra's a wonderful
surgeon. She'll save him.

518
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,918
I thought you had
somewhere to go.

519
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,919
No.

520
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,118
I'm gonna stay here with
you until Marcus is okay.

521
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,676
- I'm sorry, Grandma.
- What about?

522
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,116
For the way I acted.

523
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,477
Listen here.

524
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,646
You acted the way you
needed to, to make me see.

525
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,520
I wasn't gonna see
it any other way.

526
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,324
And now things will all turn
out how they're supposed to.

527
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,164
So no being sorry.

528
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,139
You watch her, now.

529
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:58,272
I'll be coming to Chicago
soon, so you be ready.

530
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,792
- He's gotta be here somewhere.
- May I help you?

531
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,062
There he is. MAN: Hey!

532
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,498
- Oh, man.
- You stole my cheese.

533
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,400
Oh, sod off, I won
it fair and square.

534
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,940
- Gareth crossed the line first.
- Off him, you plonkers.

535
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,203
We have proof, you little slag.

536
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,512
Break it up, guys.

537
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,310
David Beckham is a wanker.

538
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,087
Ha. Just kidding.

539
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,524
Relax. Love the guy.

540
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,891
Terrific.

541
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,095
Okay.

542
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:56,265
Until we decide
the rightful owner...

543
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:00,835
I will be the keeper
of the cheese.

544
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:08,443
Heard he was flying out tonight.
Frank's getting him a flight.

545
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,452
- Really?
- Something about his kid.

546
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,591
- Serious, from what I hear.
- It must be.

547
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:16,091
Mind if I leave you to this? I
gotta check on Pratt's MI in 3.

548
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,355
Sure, I got it.

549
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:23,801
- See you soon, Dr. Moretti.
- Okay, sure thing, Haleh.

550
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,313
Take care, Abby.

551
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,011
Kevin.

552
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,823
I hope everything works out.

553
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:00,897
Heparin's in.

554
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,302
All right, good flow, no leaks.

555
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:13,247
We were able to stop the
bleeding and repair his artery.

556
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,887
We have every reason to
believe he's gonna recover.

557
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,147
And the leg?

558
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:20,724
Gonna need a few screws, but
in time, should be good as new.

559
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,694
- Awesome.
- All right, kid, get out of here.

560
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,698
Are you sure? I wanted
to see if Marcus...

561
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,201
You can talk to him in the
morning. Go to your thing.

562
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,240
Okey-dokey, then. Um,
congrats on a successful outcome.

563
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,211
Nice kid, that one.

564
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:47,113
- A little weird.
- Yeah.

565
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,516
A little.

566
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,884
That's Margaret. She
saw the whole thing.

567
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:56,392
- Coming up right there. MAN:
See, see, see? Gareth won.

568
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:00,293
- He passed out before the finish line.
- After you pulled me down.

569
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:04,129
Oh! Poor Henry, they had
to cart him off in a stretcher.

570
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,862
All right, all right.

571
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:11,703
After careful review of
the tape, I am ruling it a tie.

572
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,243
- You each get half.
- You're gonna cut the cheese?

573
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,574
Ha-ha. Well, I mean...

574
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,951
- Yes, that's right.
- Fine, split it in two so I can go home.

575
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,918
No, no, no. He can have it.

576
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,990
The cheese should
not be divided.

577
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:30,424
I would rather see it absconded
by a cheater than be split in half.

578
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,759
- I knew you'd cave.
- Not so fast.

579
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,467
- Gareth, the cheese is yours.
- But you just said...

580
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,166
According to the wisdom of
Solomon, Gareth has shown himself...

581
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,334
as the true cheese lover
and its rightful guardian.

582
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:50,915
He was willing to forfeit the
cheese rather than see it torn apart.

583
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,449
Well, thanks for nothing, doc.

584
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:57,316
- What a bunch of gits.
- Hey, tossers.

585
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,617
Frank?

586
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,287
Your roof kid's doing well.
They're moving him to Recovery.

587
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,592
Oh, great.

588
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,668
Oh, well, I thought
you'd wanna know.

589
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,101
- Thank you.
- Are we fighting?

590
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,942
No, I don't think so.

591
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,374
We're friends, right?

592
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:25,245
- Right? We confide in each other?
- Yeah, we do.

593
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,686
Forget it.

594
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,753
Hey, Neela. Hold
up, Neela. Just...

595
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,362
Look, I know I've been...

596
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,990
I don't know, bitchy or something
lately, but I just hit a rough patch.

597
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:47,264
And, um, Luka's home now,
so everything's gonna be better.

598
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,144
I'm gonna check on the Fanecas.

599
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,420
I heard he's doing well.

600
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,525
Um, listen...

601
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,699
I wasn't attentive
enough before.

602
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,604
You were right to be angry.

603
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:24,938
Being angry's
kind of my baseline.

604
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:32,382
I was 28 when he was born,
but I was still a kid myself.

605
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,382
Wouldn't grow up.

606
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,751
I was reckless, out of control.

607
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,952
I had this sweet
Ninja ZX-9. Loved it.

608
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,262
Kayla, that was his mom...

609
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,598
she was riding behind me
the night I had my accident...

610
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,297
holding on around my waist.

611
00:37:55,473 --> 00:38:00,468
When I came to, I saw
her lying on the pavement.

612
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:05,379
I saw them pull the
sheet over her face.

613
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,109
I did that.

614
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,913
One stupid night.

615
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,726
But you're a really good father.

616
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,630
I can tell.

617
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,930
I'm sure that
makes up for a lot.

618
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,906
I don't know. You
know, I've just...

619
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:35,445
I've carried this thing
in my gut for so long.

620
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,640
He spends all of his energy
trying to make me feel better.

621
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,184
He's my kid. That's not his job.

622
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,484
Well, you could
try to change that.

623
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,626
You know, everybody screws up.

624
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:55,961
You know, you just try not to
make the same mistake again.

625
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:59,332
There's some things
you can never fix.

626
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:04,334
You can't unring
a bell, they say.

627
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,509
No, I guess you can't.

628
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,649
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, hi.

629
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,317
So this is my surprise.

630
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,554
Niko, this is Abby.
Abby, my brother Niko.

631
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:30,031
Oh, hi. Wow, you
didn't mention that...

632
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,999
We thought it was time.

633
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,832
Niko's never been to America.

634
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,735
I hope I won't be in the way.

635
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,999
Oh, no, not at all. Oh...

636
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:41,044
I was just a little bit surprised,
that's all. It's nice to finally meet you.

637
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,408
Joe's asleep and we
have pizza coming, so...

638
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,243
- Okay, great.
- You want some drink?

639
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,885
No, I'll get it. Thanks.

640
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,988
So your flight was good?

641
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,318
Yeah, the Germans
know how to travel in style.

642
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,358
We were lucky to
make connection.

643
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,928
Luka wants to
give you big shock.

644
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,725
Well, he did.

645
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,139
Welcome home.

646
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:53,005
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Nothing, I spilled.

647
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,979
Uh... Niko's almost
ready to go to bed.

648
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,948
So we can be all
alone, just the two of us.

649
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,520
Okay, I'll be right down.

650
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,384
Okay.

651
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,614
Don't wake him up.
