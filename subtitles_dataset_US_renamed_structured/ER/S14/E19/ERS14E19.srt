1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,898
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:10,204
- I'm actually here for a job interview.
- Why would you want to work here?

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,137
- Finish up. The hard stuff's done.
- Lucien.

4
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,875
We both know you should never
have left that room this morning.

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,574
None of this should be
news to you. This is the job.

6
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,414
So I heard you made
the short list for chief.

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,453
I'm in love with you.

8
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:26,052
- Luka moved out.
- He what? Why?

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,093
- Hold on. Wait.
- No, I gotta go.

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,361
- What are you doing? Don't.
- All right, sorry.

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,932
There. You got us.
Gates is my boyfriend.

12
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:45,605
Okay, when I was 4... All right.

13
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,875
I wrote a letter to Ernie, inviting
him to take a bath with me.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,212
That's very forward of you.

15
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,979
- Did he go for it?
- No.

16
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,680
He was very busy
with <i>Sesame Street.</i>

17
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,850
You do realize that's code for,
"I'm living with my boyfriend."

18
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,120
No.

19
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,059
He actually never
even mentioned Bert.

20
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,561
Yeah?

21
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,694
And he wrote
me, like, 20 letters.

22
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,893
- Really?
- Kind of led me on.

23
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,798
Turned out that it was my mom.

24
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,368
That's the first nice thing
you've said about your mom.

25
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,976
Yeah, well, she had her moment.

26
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,306
- Oh, crap.
- What?

27
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,311
We missed our stop.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,848
You know, we're
getting into trouble here.

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,684
It's Pratt. He won't care.

30
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,057
Hi, guys. Hey, I
missed you, guys.

31
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,224
I missed you.

32
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,367
How was your weekend with Daddy?

33
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,596
Pretty good.

34
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:48,264
He would only eat frozen
waffles and strawberry yogurt.

35
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,707
It's probably the
new environment.

36
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,173
It's okay. Strawberry's
almost a vegetable, right?

37
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,749
Hey, how are you, buddy?

38
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,385
- Do you want a cup of coffee?
- No, no, I'm off caffeine.

39
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,956
Really? Wow.

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,888
Good for you.

41
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,528
What happened to his knee?

42
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,296
He fell, I think.

43
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,865
- You think?
- I left him with Marnie yesterday.

44
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,026
First weekend with your son
and you left him with a babysitter?

45
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,865
It was just for two
hours, Abby. Come on.

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,573
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

47
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,904
It's okay, we just got here.

48
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,346
I have to go.

49
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,716
I have to go to work.

50
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,284
Um, here you go. I
have to take the El.

51
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,852
Oh, car's still in the shop?

52
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,754
Yeah, I'm waiting for them to get some
electrical thing in stock or something.

53
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,951
You need a ride?

54
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,593
Yeah, sure, Gates. Never
heard that one before.

55
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,734
- Hey, Archie.
- Hey, how'd it go?

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,597
- Well, very well. I rocked it.
- You rocked it?

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,432
- Rocked what?
- His chief interview.

58
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,267
Had Anspaugh
eating out of my hands.

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,636
- How long did it last?
- Forty-five minutes.

60
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:56,970
Really? Mine was longer.

61
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,636
Part of it was him showing
me the family scrapbook.

62
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,839
Gates called, he and
Sam are gonna be late.

63
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,142
They had train trouble.

64
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,616
And we're supposed to give them a
free pass because they're an item?

65
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,949
They're so adorable,
is that what they think?

66
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,454
Yeah, they did mention that.

67
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,684
I've had it with the
giddy-new-couple thing.

68
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,522
Greg doesn't get all
huh-hooey about Bettina at work.

69
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,925
Oh, hey, that reminds me.

70
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,033
Frank, about that guy, about
the thing. That's today, right?

71
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,192
- Yeah, I'm on it, boss.
- All right.

72
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,927
So you two still shacking up?

73
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,470
Yes, I'm staying with her.

74
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,437
Can't you see I don't
wanna hear that?

75
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,940
- You asked.
- I shouldn't have, I'm down on love.

76
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,170
- You and me.
- You, the Internet dating star?

77
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,543
Been online for a month and
you're number four in all-time winks.

78
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,276
Don't waste your time.
Online dating blows.

79
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,614
I'm totally over it. Totally.

80
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,221
Join my monastery, Laverne.

81
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,856
Sign me up.

82
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,619
You haven't been out with any of them?
- Let me go.

83
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,024
- One for you, Neela.
- I'm like a shark.

84
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,222
I gotta keep moving
or I'm dead, all right?

85
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,297
- Look, you're gonna get me killed.
- Sir.

86
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,561
And her, and anybody
that's around me.

87
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,568
You don't settle,
I'm gonna cuff you.

88
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,207
They showed up at my
mother's funeral. Understand?

89
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,898
Hey, what the hell is this?

90
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,010
Found him staggering
down on Austin.

91
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,978
What are you doing? We don't have
room to dry out every drunk in Chicago.

92
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,516
You think you're safe in
here? Better think again.

93
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,382
- Whoa, hey, sir, you can't...
- Okay, listen up, everybody.

94
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,989
I'm the last guy
you want in your ER.

95
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,021
You can say that again.

96
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,430
Make sure they check
the, uh, brake pads.

97
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,662
Right.

98
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,898
Listen, I got you this.

99
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,436
The paper?

100
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,446
It's what you're supposed
to get for the first anniversary.

101
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,681
Okay, um. Thanks for the ride.

102
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,189
Yeah, I appreciate it, Lenny.

103
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,165
Now, what's the guy's number?

104
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,871
Yeah, go ahead.

105
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,802
Who you talking
to? Is that our guy?

106
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,499
All right, all right, all right.

107
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,645
Keep up the good work, Frank.

108
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,940
So, what's up with that guy? You
getting him out of here or what?

109
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,640
- There's something weird going on.
- Weird, how?

110
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:55,482
They sent his name out on the wire,
now my lieu says to keep him here.

111
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,679
Great.

112
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,486
Well, guess I'll go make
sure that the king of crime...

113
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,993
gets all the resources
that County can muster.

114
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,392
Nice suit. Where's the funeral?

115
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,402
Straczynski Manor
Chapel on South Pulaski.

116
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,036
My mom.

117
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,407
Oh, sorry to hear that.

118
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,143
Well, you know what they
say. You can't go home again.

119
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,911
Yeah. You from out of town?

120
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,181
Rapid City, where
God left his shoes.

121
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,252
I run a scrap metal yard for
a bunch of hayseed farmers.

122
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,157
I look like Eddie Albert to you?

123
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,725
I really couldn't say.

124
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,667
There's only one place
worse than South Dakota.

125
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,497
North Dakota.

126
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,730
I had to go and move
my whole family there.

127
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,876
My wife, two kids,
and they hate me for it.

128
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,409
- I hate me for it.
- So why did you leave, then?

129
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,410
Well, I could tell you that,
but then I'd have to kill you.

130
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,248
All systems are
go. He'll be by later.

131
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,717
All right, take it easy.
Keep it on the low.

132
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,186
My trap is shut.

133
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,785
I guess we both
got a secret, huh?

134
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,630
Get a PCA for our fireman and
pull the drain on the empyema.

135
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,097
It must be fun having
her at your beck and call.

136
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,568
Is it possible for you to have an
interaction without some innuendo?

137
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,900
I need a little time to
prep for the M and M.

138
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,474
I hate those teaching things.

139
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,043
Bunch of doctors who
like to hear themselves talk.

140
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,306
You should check one out sometime.
- Yeah, you might learn something...

141
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,574
dolt.

142
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,153
Excuse me. Any medications?

143
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,221
Prednisone and
Plaquenil. She has lupus.

144
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,721
Has she been using
any drugs or alcohol?

145
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,759
- We were at a christening.
- Abby, you're with us, Trauma 1.

146
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,419
He's had half a liter, but
he doesn't wanna be here.

147
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,326
Yeah, well, the
feeling's mutual.

148
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,297
Do you have a cell phone I
could use? I need a cell phone.

149
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,404
- Just shoot me already, all right?
- Don't tempt me, man.

150
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:55,008
Cupcake, can you get this coconut
sack, or whatever you call it, off me?

151
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,234
- Banana bag?
- And arrest me already.

152
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,969
- Get me out of here.
- Calm down.

153
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,169
It's not that simple.

154
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,316
People want me dead, okay? Dead.

155
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,849
- A little Haldol?
- No, he doesn't need Haldol.

156
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,010
Listen to me. You
look like a regular girl.

157
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,387
I'm sorry. PRATT: Calm down.

158
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,922
If anything happens to me...

159
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,821
you tell my wife there's
an account in the Bahamas.

160
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,436
Okay.

161
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,527
And tell her I'm sorry
I screwed it all up.

162
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,208
Sats only 82. ABBY: Blood
with a gram of Dilantin.

163
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,498
I'll go mix it.

164
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,471
If we can't stop this, we
have to put a breathing tube in.

165
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,132
What do you mean, if you can't?

166
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,608
- You need help in here?
- No.

167
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,058
- Not really.
- Lupus, huh?

168
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,305
Hi, I'm Simon Brenner.

169
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,542
Maybe it'd be better if we
transferred her to another hospital.

170
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,186
Don't worry. They're more
competent than they seem.

171
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,687
- See, the meds are kicking in.
- Thank God.

172
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,055
Head CT, metabolic panel, tox
screen, EEG, and neuro consult.

173
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,388
- Don't you think that's excessive?
- No.

174
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,794
- Seizure goes with lupus.
- First-time seizure warrants a workup.

175
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:56,027
Okay, you don't wanna put your
mum through all that, now do you?

176
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,036
Do what you want. I don't
want you to miss anything.

177
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,639
Hey, I just saw
Moretti at the desk.

178
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,241
- Moretti?
- What's he doing here?

179
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,850
I don't know. Visiting, I guess.

180
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,577
Dr. Moretti, our old nemesis.

181
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:14,982
- Dr. Gates.
- Hello.

182
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,987
- Hello, Sam.
- Couldn't stay away, huh?

183
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,388
No, no. Had to tie
up a few loose ends.

184
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,720
How's your son doing?

185
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,226
Oh, he's in a group home.

186
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,024
- He's doing okay, thanks.
- That's good to hear.

187
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,723
Can we help you?

188
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,596
I'm looking for Art Masterson.

189
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,364
- You his parole officer?
- Brother-in-law.

190
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,735
He's over there. Hope
you brought a lawyer.

191
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,107
Hey, Kevin. Does that
mean you're coming back?

192
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,180
No, his mother and I have
decided to stay close to him so...

193
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,947
Yeah, I can definitely
understand that.

194
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,250
Don't look so relieved.

195
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,779
Excuse me.

196
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,333
No one misses
you like I do, Kevin.

197
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,223
Yeah, I'm sure that's the case.

198
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,760
Hey, hey, get off of him.
What the hell are you doing?

199
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,962
- Get off him.
- You're dead.

200
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,471
Get the hell off
him. Get off him.

201
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,475
Hey, come on. Get off of him.

202
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,942
Let him go.

203
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,772
Let go.

204
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,579
You should never have come back.
- Get him out of here.

205
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,653
You should've stayed
where they put you.

206
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,380
All right.

207
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,056
You okay?

208
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,563
Do you believe
me now, smart guy?

209
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,900
We'll be back to check on you
a little later when you're rested.

210
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,597
You can call me Arnie.

211
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,072
I thought you said
your name was Art?

212
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,007
All right, men. Look alive now.

213
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,377
What was that?

214
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,543
Well, guy's got enemies.
It's not hard to see that.

215
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,417
I know, I know. I'll keep
somebody on him at all times.

216
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,615
Hey, that's a great idea.

217
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,125
Why does it seem like someone's
always getting punched in this place?

218
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,557
I gave as good as I got.

219
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,699
I would expect nothing less.

220
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,130
They find a new chief yet?

221
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,737
Soon enough.

222
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,601
- You?
- Why, is that so crazy?

223
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,139
I'm just pleased they finally
recognized your talent, Greg.

224
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,408
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

225
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,209
Okay.

226
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,585
Frank, is Dr. Lockhart on today?

227
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,950
She's in with a patient.

228
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,153
Okay, thanks.

229
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,288
Your electrolytes look good and
the drug test came back negative.

230
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,328
Yeah, Mom gave up
the crack years ago.

231
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,763
Christine, let
them do their job.

232
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,563
CAT scan was normal,
no bleed, no abscess.

233
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,096
That's a good sign? - Very.

234
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,638
Systolic won't go up over 80.

235
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,401
And she's got crackles, I
think we should get an echo.

236
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,807
- I should have had more children.
- Deep breath.

237
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,140
So that I wouldn't be
such a bother to you.

238
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,407
Shh. You're not a burden.

239
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,347
My daughter takes
care of me all day.

240
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,987
Then works at night
in a doctor's office.

241
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,283
Physical therapy. It's for
sports injuries and stuff.

242
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,585
Let's skip the echo.
Get a spiral CT.

243
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:11,463
- Really?
- Lupus patients are susceptible to PE.

244
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,862
- What?
- It's just that CHF is much more likely.

245
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,195
- Why don't we just get the echo...
- Get the CT.

246
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,598
Let me pull rank on
you while I still can.

247
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,137
Yes, sir.

248
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,934
What's wrong?

249
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,806
I tried to block my mother's fall.
I must have tweaked something.

250
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,813
Why don't I take a look? Chuny?

251
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,009
We removed the infected graft
and proceeded with the washout.

252
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,848
You redose the antibiotics
before opening the abdomen?

253
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,013
No, she was already on triples.

254
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,888
Well, still, it's standard practice to
add a dose halfway through a case.

255
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,497
Did you and your attending make
a conscious decision not to do this?

256
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,792
I don't see how your
question is relevant...

257
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,128
given the acinetobacter
did not originate...

258
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,533
It is relevant because
it is a teaching point.

259
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,333
It applies to abdominal
surgeries in general...

260
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,136
and this is a
teaching conference.

261
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,436
Carry on, Dr. Rasgotra.

262
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,917
You got no idea why this
guy was trying to off you?

263
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,246
I wanna make a phone
call. I get one, don't I?

264
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,479
- You're not under arrest.
- Then arrest me.

265
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,716
I'm not talking to you,
I wanna make a call.

266
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,225
Why don't you just back off for
a little while, let him calm down.

267
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,688
I don't feel so good.

268
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,892
My chest is tight. I think I'm
having one of my anxiety things.

269
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,661
Yeah, I can't imagine why.

270
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,668
Look, there's a
reason I left Chicago.

271
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,239
Let me guess, people
were trying to kill you.

272
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,267
Look, you saved my
life, I can trust you, right?

273
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,968
No, I'd rather you didn't, man.

274
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,075
Oh, son of a bitch.

275
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,343
Hey, Art. I hear you got
yourself into a little trouble.

276
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,850
- Rick.
- Who the hell are you?

277
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,544
- I'm sorry.
- Cops let you in?

278
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,383
It was my mother.
Gotta understand.

279
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,752
- We'll get him out.
- It's not that easy.

280
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,087
I'm not going back. I
can take care of myself.

281
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,093
Oh, is that what
you've been doing?

282
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,528
- Sir, you really need to step outside.
- Jeez.

283
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,939
- What's happening?
- I'm dying.

284
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,695
- You're agitating him.
- He's right.

285
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,436
Damn it.

286
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,974
- What do we got?
- He's in V-tach.

287
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,133
Charging to 360.

288
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,545
Here's the order
for the spiral CT.

289
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,212
Okay, could you tell Cars
we might need an echo too?

290
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,482
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

291
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,285
Okay.

292
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:28,231
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,461
- Can we talk for a minute?
- Let's not.

294
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,730
Look, Abby, I have
been trying to call you.

295
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:33,929
I know, but it's...

296
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:37,635
This is just not really a good
time, because I'm totally slammed.

297
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,405
- Then why are you walking out?
- I don't wanna do this.

298
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,573
- Can I talk to you for five minutes?
- No, my marriage is over.

299
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,742
- Can you leave me alone?
- Five minutes.

300
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,855
Abby, I didn't know about
you and Luka. I'm sorry.

301
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,319
Me too.

302
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,790
Look, I just wanted
to talk to you...

303
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,156
just for a sec, about
the way that I left.

304
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,854
It doesn't matter.

305
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,523
Well, my kid was
really sick, okay?

306
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,533
And I lost my
footing for a while.

307
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,501
Yes, I know how
that feels. Trust me.

308
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,540
Right, and he was in a
psych ward for eight weeks.

309
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,304
- He told me he wanted to die.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

310
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,776
- I am sorry, but...
- Thanks.

311
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,211
Anyway, in the middle
of it, his mother and I...

312
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,146
we started really talking.

313
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,549
And by the time we got out of the
hospital, we were a family again.

314
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,020
That's great for you.
It's really, really great.

315
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,659
Look, all I'm trying to
say is that every couple...

316
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,625
goes through some
awful and messed up stuff.

317
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,958
Kevin, are you feeling
guilty or responsible?

318
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,963
Because you're not.
You don't have to.

319
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,898
- I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry.
- You don't have to.

320
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,470
All you did was help me
ruin my life a bit faster.

321
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,540
I have to go back to work.

322
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:58,822
"Man is like a breath. His
days as a fleeting shadow."

323
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,559
"In the morning, he flourishes
and grows up like grass.

324
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,031
In the evening he is
cut down and withers."

325
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,710
Walter?

326
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,691
Walter?

327
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,760
- Walter?
- What? What is it?

328
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,201
Is the kitchen on
fire again? What?

329
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,467
What's the matter with you?

330
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,307
Why are you looking
at me like that?

331
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:57,211
I'm not dead yet,
you lanky bastard.

332
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,550
Pancakes. I feel like pancakes.

333
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:06,090
From the good place, not that
greasy spoon, hole-in-the-wall.

334
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,228
I don't think I can
take you out today.

335
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,919
Then go get me some.

336
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,088
And one scrambled egg.

337
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,496
Maybe on my break, I will.

338
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,470
Someone's coming
to see me, you know.

339
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,071
No, I didn't.

340
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,139
My nephew.

341
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,300
My brother's son,
lives in Philadelphia.

342
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,936
Second-rate town if
ever there was one.

343
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,447
People say it's not a bad city.

344
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,608
People lie.

345
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,717
But he's a good kid.

346
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:43,321
He got a sweet wife
and two little girls.

347
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,761
Kids are great.

348
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:50,597
Yeah, my wife and
I never had any.

349
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,033
I regret that.

350
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,265
Sometimes I think if we had...

351
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,104
maybe she might have
hung around longer.

352
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,476
How's that?

353
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,884
Well, being a parent gives you strength
you didn't know you had, you know?

354
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,451
Places in yourself, reserves,
and they can keep you going.

355
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:16,028
They can drive you.
Make you fight harder.

356
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:23,168
Soldier on, keep rowing upriver.

357
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,399
Even though everything
else turns to crud.

358
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,772
Least I've heard that so...

359
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,044
- Epi's in.
- All right, clear.

360
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,319
Back in sinus.

361
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,479
- Oh, look at the ST segments.
- Damn.

362
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,751
All right, let's get aspirin, O2,
five of Lopresor and a 12-lead.

363
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,519
What the hell?

364
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,686
- You're having a heart attack.
- Holy crap.

365
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,059
- Is he okay?
- I'm having a heart attack, Rick.

366
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,259
- Maybe you can back off.
- You realize how complicated this is?

367
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,234
- I didn't plan on having a heart attack.
- Settle down.

368
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,271
You need to leave
the patient care area.

369
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,102
Oh, what a mess.
What happens now?

370
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,778
- I'm not talking to you, privacy issues.
- Listen, I...

371
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,346
Just wait outside. I'll
talk to you in a minute.

372
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,415
BP's good, 105/76.

373
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,678
All right, good. Call the cath
lab. Tell them we're on our way.

374
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,288
All right, thanks, guys.
We'll get this from here.

375
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,256
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

376
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,589
Well, I can't tell you.
It's privacy issues.

377
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,856
Who the hell are you?

378
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,866
Let's not waste any more time talking.
Do the cath so we can get him out.

379
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,630
Let me tell you, you're in
my ER, and that's my patient.

380
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,534
- You don't get to dictate how this goes.
- Actually, I do.

381
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,439
U.S. Marshal Service. Every
minute my guy sits in this hospital...

382
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,877
is putting him and everyone
else here in jeopardy.

383
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,183
So the king of crime
is up in the cath lab?

384
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,153
Yeah.

385
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,062
Hey, so nobody gets in without
double-checking ID, right?

386
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,821
When in doubt, keep them out.

387
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,329
Anything else I should know?

388
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,967
No, not right now. Just
keep your eyes open.

389
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,193
These are all yours.

390
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,167
Curtain 3 and Exam 4?

391
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,533
Actually, the other way around.

392
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,205
- You good?
- Yeah, you?

393
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,812
Yeah, I'm fine.

394
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,005
All right. See you later.

395
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,083
So how are things
on the home front?

396
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,417
Oh, Sarah's well,
thanks for asking.

397
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,490
I was talking about Sam.

398
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,256
Oh, that. Well, you know,
we're just having fun right now.

399
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,594
Both kind of busy, unclaimed
baggage and whatnot.

400
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,999
You're worried if things don't
work out it'll turn into a big mess.

401
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,833
- Something like that.
- I'm here to tell you, it will.

402
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,531
- Come on now.
- What? What?

403
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,167
A hot-head Casanova like him
and a feisty little spitfire like Sam.

404
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,007
You think they have a chance?

405
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,173
- Hey, your shoulder lady's in Sutures.
- Thank you.

406
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,251
Love is hard, boys.
Be hard on love.

407
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,783
Seriously. I've
been where you are.

408
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,617
It can work out.
It does work out.

409
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,452
Just take the plunge.

410
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,387
Hey, Pratt.

411
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,860
Yeah.

412
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,896
Did you ever hear
of Arnie Markowitz?

413
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,967
No, why?

414
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,967
What kind of people can make
cops just disappear like that?

415
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,935
I'll tell you who. The feds.

416
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,904
- That got me thinking.
- Yeah, you see?

417
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,703
- That was your first mistake.
- No.

418
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:21,473
I wasn't on the force all that
time for nothing. Read this.

419
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,609
"Arnie Markowitz,
busted in '05...

420
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,877
for working with the
Turkish Deep State."

421
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,417
Whatever that is. Here.

422
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,815
That is the Mob.

423
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,753
This guy made a deal,
testified against the Turks...

424
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,189
then he disappeared,
probably into WitSec.

425
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,086
WitSec? What's WitSec?

426
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,596
WitSec is the Witness
Security Program.

427
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,757
Next page.

428
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,894
What are you saying?

429
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,301
That my patient, Art Masterson,
is this guy, Arnie Markowitz?

430
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,932
Don't say that out loud.
They are everywhere.

431
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:56,281
Mom's been sick a long time.
We've got the whole setup at home.

432
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,013
Any tenderness here?

433
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,913
No, it's fine.

434
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,078
I could never live at home.

435
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:07,522
I mean, my dad's dead now, but I
got out of there as fast as I could.

436
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,790
I lived alone for a while,
but I was never any good at it.

437
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,593
- Good at it?
- Yeah, it got boring.

438
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,669
I'm not much of a dater, you
know. Not into playing the game.

439
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,271
I hear that.

440
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,704
Plus, my work makes it difficult
to have a normal social life.

441
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,968
Me too.

442
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,443
I guess that's what we get for
pursuing careers in medicine, huh?

443
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,644
I'm an escort.

444
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,386
Um...

445
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,388
Could I...? Could you...?

446
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,858
Raise your arm up in the air.

447
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,557
Now try to resist my pressure.

448
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,270
- I thought you said...
- Yeah, I was...

449
00:22:56,342 --> 00:23:00,177
I was trying to finish
college when Mom got sick.

450
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,713
No insurance, she
needed money...

451
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,910
but she also wanted me home
with her during the day, and...

452
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,482
Somebody told me
about an agency...

453
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,853
where I could work five to
10 hours a week, nights...

454
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:17,929
and, uh, make 10
to 15,000 dollars.

455
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,932
You'd be amazed how much men
are willing to pay for the illusion...

456
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,072
of a submissive Asian concubine.

457
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,002
It just sounded really easy.

458
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,177
Dr. Morris, it's Mrs.
Barcenilla. We lost her pulse.

459
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,874
Oh, my God.

460
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,074
Page Abby, 911.

461
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,843
- You wanna wait outside.
- No way.

462
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,818
Her sats suddenly dropped into
the 60s and she went into PEA.

463
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,868
- Mig of epi, MAC 3 and
7-O. CHRISTINE: Oh, God.

464
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,788
Mom, please don't do this.

465
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,825
Ready to intubate?

466
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,373
Sorry. Can't let anybody by.

467
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,305
You wanna get him out of
here. You better let me in there.

468
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,705
It's okay.

469
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,847
Cromley cleared him.

470
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:16,151
Well, Arnie, there are no more telebeds,
so we're shipping you back to the ER.

471
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,148
I can't go back. I
can't move forward.

472
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,787
I messed up, man. I did
some things I got in trouble for.

473
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,228
Yeah, you know, I'm
starting to get that idea.

474
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,062
I wasn't much of a lawyer, but I
knew how to make things work.

475
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:35,367
My firm had some clients
that needed special help.

476
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:40,072
Money laundering, visas,
imports. That type of thing.

477
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,182
When I got snagged,
the feds said:

478
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,852
"Do the right thing
and we'll protect you.

479
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,851
Protect your family." So...

480
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,182
You did the right thing.

481
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,385
Did I?

482
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:57,161
End up trapped between two
worlds, like ET or something.

483
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,431
Can't be honest with anybody.

484
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,261
Gotta hide who you
are, who you were.

485
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,461
I had to teach my own kid
his new name. Drill it into him.

486
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,169
I kept thinking this is
the price of being good...

487
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,640
teaching your kid to lie.

488
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,936
He'll understand one day.

489
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:17,675
Well, he's 12. Sure
doesn't understand now.

490
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,316
- Hey.
- Yeah?

491
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,222
- Who are you?
- I'm Anthony. I'm restocking the cart.

492
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,190
Where's your ID?

493
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,026
I'm new.

494
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,724
So?

495
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,460
They gave me a temp.

496
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,471
- I must've left...
- What do you think you're doing?

497
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,973
- Hey, relax, man.
- No, you relax. Where's the ID?

498
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,635
- I just started last week.
- How did you get in here?

499
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:50,305
Dr. Pratt, he's one of our
new techs. Take it easy.

500
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,487
Welcome to my life.

501
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,567
I débrided the area,
and attempted a closure.

502
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,227
- Attempted?
- Executed.

503
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,532
I executed a primary repair.

504
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,039
Did you consider resection?

505
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:20,338
Yes, but I thought the
best possible, um, option...

506
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,878
was primary closure.

507
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,777
And Dr. Dubenko
was in agreement?

508
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,178
Oh, come on, once
again, I remind you...

509
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,253
this patient died of
pan-resistant bacterial sepsis...

510
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,084
which had nothing to
do with Neela's repair.

511
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,887
A concomitant infection with bowel
flora could have overwhelmed her system.

512
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,223
What are you talking
about? Show me the data.

513
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,263
Her post-op course could have...

514
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,526
Reign yourself in,
Dusty. It's embarrassing.

515
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,728
You're the junior attending.
She's the person you can dump on.

516
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,483
- I'm not dumping.
- Sit down. You're out of line.

517
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,533
I won't sit down,
and I'm not out of line.

518
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,371
I'm not out of
line. That's a joke.

519
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,775
Wanna know what's
out of line? I'll tell you.

520
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,415
A system so under-funded...

521
00:26:56,582 --> 00:27:01,111
that we have a single trauma attending
to cover the entire hospital at night.

522
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,222
That's out of line, letting a
patient bleed out in the ICU...

523
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,824
because of a stupid
rule, that's out of line.

524
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,460
And you wanna know what
else? Wanna know what else?

525
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,496
Sitting by and watching my
resident try and hide the fact...

526
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,259
that I left her in the
O.R., that's out of line.

527
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,494
It's all out of line.

528
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,901
Radiology read the scan.
Massive embolist in the pulmonary.

529
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,304
- That's what you thought, right?
- Right.

530
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,909
Fix it. Can't you fix it?

531
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,945
She's acidotic, 7.02.

532
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,353
Hold compressions.

533
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,244
Asystole?

534
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,937
- Another epi?
- Somewhere in six.

535
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,917
Resume.

536
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,690
- We're running out of options here.
- No, don't say that.

537
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,699
We've given her rounds of
drugs to restart her heart...

538
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,930
but her body has been
deprived of oxygen for too long.

539
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,867
There's always another
option. That's what you said.

540
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,141
Christine.

541
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,344
Do you wanna say goodbye?

542
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,291
Mom... I can't.

543
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,367
Everybody out.

544
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,397
Right now, please. Go.

545
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,092
I heard you were working here...

546
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,758
and I wondered if I might
be able to talk to you.

547
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,565
You really have the balls to
show up here and ask for anything.

548
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,301
Look, I've had a very
difficult time in my life.

549
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,570
Really? Me too.

550
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:43,749
I know that. And I'm sorry for
any part that I played in that.

551
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,148
But I just wanted
to tell you that...

552
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,914
you know, whatever
happened with me and Abby...

553
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:54,924
was just the misguided,
messed-up flailings...

554
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,119
of two people, two
very troubled people.

555
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,230
That's beautiful.

556
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,296
Look, she loves you.

557
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,596
Anybody can see that.

558
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,768
As somebody who has squandered that
kind of thing before in his own life...

559
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,969
I wanna implore you not to
make the same mistake, so that's...

560
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,711
- You done?
- Yes, I think... Yeah, I think so.

561
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,019
Guess I had that coming, huh?

562
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,321
Thanks for stopping by.

563
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,256
How fast can he be ready to go?

564
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,096
He's not stable, he had an MI.

565
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,362
I'm not going anywhere.

566
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:41,200
Art, you did this to
yourself. I'm trying to fix it.

567
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,602
Whatever I do, I'm dead.

568
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,869
Dead on the street or dead on
the inside. What's the difference?

569
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,139
Don't let other people in, all
right? Got enough in harm's way.

570
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,549
I'll be right back.

571
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,647
- Sorry to pull you out.
- It's all good. You all right?

572
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,121
- You need something?
- No, no, everything's good.

573
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,989
We're having a family dinner,
and it'd be great if you came.

574
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,493
Okay. What's the occasion?

575
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,359
What's this?

576
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,369
- You got in. Yeah.
- Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

577
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,306
Congratulations,
man. That's good stuff.

578
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:20,878
- Thank you.
- That's good.

579
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,073
A couple months from now,
I'll be a first-year med student.

580
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,910
- It's all thanks to you, Greg.
- No.

581
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,643
No, no, no. That's real.

582
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,880
And I really want you to
come, and I'm bringing my guy.

583
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,422
I want you to meet him.

584
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,651
Yeah? What's Charlie
got to say about that?

585
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,587
He's mellowing out in his old age.
Wanting all the kids around him.

586
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,324
- I'll come by as soon as I'm done here.
- Thank you.

587
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,565
Good stuff, baby. Great job.

588
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,603
- See you in a minute.
- All right.

589
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,241
We've never lost a witness
who followed protocol...

590
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,173
and we're not ending our streak.

591
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,540
I'm done with testifying.

592
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,909
Okay, then, Art.

593
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,914
I leave now and
you're out forever.

594
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,077
You ready for that? On your own?

595
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,916
You ready to do
that to you family?

596
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,354
You're not in this
alone. They're with you.

597
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:10,018
All right, look, Arnie,
this is the deal, man...

598
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,755
I'm gonna make sure
that you get fixed up.

599
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,797
But staying here
isn't helping you.

600
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,457
You know, in fact...

601
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,836
you're putting other people
in danger, man, my people.

602
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:25,336
Look, you did the right
thing once, just do it again.

603
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,000
Hey, you got my food?

604
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,336
What's going on?

605
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,742
What, this? It's
SOP for leaving.

606
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,075
Well, what did
you do? Step on it?

607
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,945
It's all smashed up.

608
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,951
- Well, what do you mean, leaving?
- Oh.

609
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,989
Hospice policy. There's
a six month's limit.

610
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,684
My nephew's taking me to Philly.

611
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,693
They're kicking you out because
you didn't die soon enough?

612
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,526
It's pretty
discouraging, isn't it?

613
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,198
- Why didn't you say something?
- I didn't wanna depress you.

614
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:30,273
You're depressive enough as it
is. I don't wanna see you bawl.

615
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:41,109
I'm sorry I never got
to meet your family.

616
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,822
Next time.

617
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,194
Yeah, next time.

618
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:59,361
Hey, he's taking me fishing.

619
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,168
He says if I row us
out, he'll row us in.

620
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,511
Hey, Walter.

621
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,449
Don't worry, kid.

622
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,884
You'll figure it out.

623
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,089
I got faith in you.

624
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,204
Let's hurry up with this thing.

625
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,642
Absolutely. Absolutely.

626
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,817
Now, when it comes to
an investment like this...

627
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,284
you have to be concerned
about the four Cs.

628
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:54,984
You got your carats, your
color, your clarity and your cut.

629
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,992
You want white gold or platinum?

630
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,597
- I don't know.
- Platinum, it's the only way to go.

631
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,733
It's the gold standard.

632
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,803
Now, I brought this
especially with you in mind.

633
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:12,138
It's a three-stoned platinum setting
with a 2-carat princess cut in the center.

634
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,905
Top of the line, a real sweetie.

635
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,140
Here, take a look
at that. Oh, boy.

636
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:22,479
Uh, it's a little on the pricey side,
but for you, there will be a discount...

637
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:27,115
because I understand that
you're a member of the tribe.

638
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,921
- What?
- Yeah, I told him you were part Semite.

639
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:32,326
Who called in the bling man?
- Pratt.

640
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,489
Here we go. What? Frank.

641
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,658
Oh, Bettina's a lucky girl.

642
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,395
Everybody calm down,
all right? I'm only browsing.

643
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,473
Hey, Abby.

644
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,515
It's a beautiful spring day...

645
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:56,485
the Cubs are playing in Wrigley
Field, and we live in America.

646
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,557
I think I solved the case
of the missing Lexapro.

647
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,389
I was looking for some
undepressed person...

648
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,029
that I could be happy
around, and, uh...

649
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,056
You chose me?

650
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,431
Must be slim pickings.

651
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,133
What's the good news?

652
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,830
You know, things are
just falling into place.

653
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,567
Well, that's great,
you deserve that.

654
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,006
Yeah, you sound thrilled.

655
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,737
I am.

656
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,241
Really.

657
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,948
So, what's up with Luka?

658
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,654
I don't know, it's been a month.

659
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,583
Ah. He'll come
around. I know him.

660
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,990
And I know you too.

661
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,591
I hope you're right.

662
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,738
Just come find me
later, I'll buy you a coffee.

663
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,500
Ah, there he is, my old mentor.

664
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,112
- How you been? What you been up to?
- Keeping busy.

665
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,010
It's like an Egyptian
market here.

666
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,549
Chickens, guys are selling
diamonds at the desk.

667
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:04,052
Diamonds, really?
Wow, that's weird.

668
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,786
Well, keep it real.

669
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,858
She's in there.

670
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,893
It's not a request, it's
not optional. Unhook him.

671
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,368
- Not without doctor's orders.
- Somebody call me?

672
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,270
- Keeping him isn't helping anybody.
- All right, Sam, give us a minute, okay?

673
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,772
What's the plan?

674
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,883
We've got a facility secured
where he can get medical care...

675
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,109
until we regroup.

676
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,244
I'm gonna have a tech over and expunge
the medical record from your system.

677
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,056
All right.

678
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:42,251
Hey, Arnie. How we doing?

679
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,419
- Ready to roll.
- Good.

680
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,430
- You got everything...?
- You don't care what happens to him?

681
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:50,231
Sam, I got this.

682
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,926
My job is to keep him alive.

683
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,902
That's what I promised when
he came into the program.

684
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,133
My only concern is
him coding on the way.

685
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,503
We got a paramedic.

686
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,145
- Why don't you let me ride along?
- No.

687
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,476
If anything, I'll go.

688
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,448
- Greg, I have transport training.
- Yeah, I'm his doctor.

689
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,814
We need you on the floor.

690
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,285
No, Morris can cover.

691
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,789
- Are you two fighting over me?
- Look, neither one of you are coming.

692
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,952
I've got room enough in the rig for
one paramedic team and two of my guys.

693
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,122
And as soon as we roll out
the door, this never happened.

694
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,996
This patient was
never here. Get it?

695
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,973
This is crazy.

696
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:36,045
Don't. You're the one person
who might actually talk me out of it.

697
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:38,376
You're gonna walk away
after one bad outcome?

698
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,449
No. It's a million
little things.

699
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,783
It isn't like you to give up.

700
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,981
What am I giving
up? A dumpy O.R.?

701
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,058
Overnight call?
Below-market pay?

702
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,627
You can't abandon me
in the middle of training.

703
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,821
You're not my responsibility.

704
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,625
This is not what you want.

705
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,995
Don't pretend to
know what I want.

706
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,638
- Hey.
- Hey.

707
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,540
- You all right?
- What do you care?

708
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,874
That was a pretty
tough little teaching thing.

709
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:14,247
- You're worried about me.
- Well, you can hold your own, but yeah.

710
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,386
See, I'm not a heartless beast.

711
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,354
I never said beast.

712
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,354
You know what?

713
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,354
I'm not trying to win
a popularity contest.

714
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,432
Doesn't mean I enjoy being
treated like I crashed some party.

715
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,728
You're the product of flagrant
nepotism, and you're a tosser.

716
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:34,134
Nobody really wants you here.

717
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,363
Wow.

718
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,237
- Don't sugarcoat it, babe.
- Don't call me babe.

719
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,572
You know what your problem is?

720
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,445
No, but you'd be the first person
I'd go to if I wanted to hear it.

721
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,743
You need to get a life.

722
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:50,753
You need to get out, which is my
polite way of saying you need to get laid.

723
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,687
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah, I'm pretty certain of it.

724
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,542
I was thinking about that night.

725
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,447
That first night that we kissed
out in the ambulance bay.

726
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:26,786
You mean the night I totally geeked
out and kissed you out of nowhere?

727
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:34,293
I remember feeling you were
someone who was so full of hope.

728
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,800
I needed someone
to teach me that again.

729
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,636
- I think that part was mutual.
- What, did we lose that?

730
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,972
I mean, did we turn
into some other people?

731
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,714
I hope not.

732
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:56,520
I realized today I have this idea
of us, of you and me and Joe...

733
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,520
as something static,
you know, concrete.

734
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,750
But it's not.

735
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:09,224
It's more like we're out there
on the lake, on choppy water.

736
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:11,997
- Or, like, uh...
- In a rowboat.

737
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,699
Yeah, in a rowboat,
trying to get across.

738
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:23,303
But when you told me what
happened, I felt like something died.

739
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:28,681
I was mourning. I couldn't see that
what we have is always changing.

740
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,515
It's moving.

741
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,388
So for better or for worse,
as long as we keep rowing...

742
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,994
we're gonna be okay.

743
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,692
So let's just get past it.

744
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,200
You know, let's just go someplace
new, somewhere nobody knows us.

745
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,202
I know we have good
friends in Chicago.

746
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:50,001
And I know you've
got this great job...

747
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,406
Do you know that I love you
more than I could ever explain?

748
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,196
Let's get out of here.

749
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,676
Nice bumper sticker,
Bardelli. It's that against regs?

750
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,116
It's not my rig. Mechanic says
something's wrong with my alternator.

751
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,949
What if you lose his pulse?
What if he goes into V-tach?

752
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,285
I'm good now. You've
done enough, doc.

753
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:42,791
More than that, actually.

754
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,724
You my guy? BARDELLI: Yep.

755
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,092
If he goes south, it's
gonna come back on us.

756
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,461
We're on your side.
Let us do our job.

757
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,602
Okay, then, we got room for
one more. Who's it gonna be?
