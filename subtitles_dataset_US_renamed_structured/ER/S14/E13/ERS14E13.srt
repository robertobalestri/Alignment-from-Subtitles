00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,371
If we're gonna do this...

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,100
we have to do this together.

4
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,541
Remembering a dream I
had last night. Sam was in it.

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,681
- I don't beg.
- In my dream you did.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,440
- This is Ortho.
- I start today.

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,916
Dr. Rasgotra, I'd like you to
meet doctors Ramsey, Craig.

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,430
Heard great things about you.

9
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,432
What position did you play?
- Center forward.

10
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,858
Love, trust, truth,
higher power.

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,962
You can't have any of those
without faith. Especially love.

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,621
No, this is your office.

13
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:35,926
Nice desk.

14
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,544
Ah. Imagine waking
up here every morning.

15
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:48,307
- Bettina, I can't afford this.
- Yes, you can. I did the math.

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,845
- You did the math?
- Mm-hm.

17
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:55,149
Time to move out of your med school
apartment and invest in something.

18
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,755
My apartment is fine.

19
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,324
- So, what do you think?
- Oh, it's beautiful.

20
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:03,897
Told you. The sellers did a
great job on the renovation.

21
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,034
The kitchen, the moldings,
these yummy floors.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,066
Bamboo flown in from Brazil.

23
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,398
And there's a gym and a children's
game room in the basement.

24
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,666
You two got kids?

25
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:14,967
- No.
- No.

26
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,542
Listen, don't rush it.

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,147
When you're newlyweds and it's
just the two of you against the world...

28
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,476
well, you can't beat that.

29
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,817
Okay.

30
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,717
It'll be gone by the end of the
week, so if you're at all interested...

31
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:29,982
make an offer.

32
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,887
No, thanks.

33
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,427
- It's, uh, the first place he's seen.
- Think about it.

34
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,656
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- No, don't, please.

35
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,859
I'm just looking.

36
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,999
Hey, Sam.

37
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,732
- It wasn't just the battery.
- Where'd you get my keys?

38
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,242
- You also had alternator issues.
- You stole my keys and fixed my car?

39
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,108
I think the proper response
would be, "Thank you, Tony."

40
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,783
Also, I tightened the connections
and got you all charged up.

41
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,249
Ooh. That sounds like fun.

42
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,583
- Thought you were dating the chaplain.
- He's talking about my car.

43
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,849
Car.

44
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,789
She made a reasonable
assumption about our relationship...

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,189
and you had a seizure.

46
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,729
I wasn't feeling the
realtor. I wanted to get out.

47
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,890
We're adults. The topic of
commitment shouldn't be off-limits.

48
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,467
- It's not off-limits.
- Really?

49
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,901
You haven't looked me
in the eye since we left.

50
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,132
Come on, it's not like that.
- Pratt.

51
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,142
Hey, Pratt. There's a kid and an old
guy who've been pulled out of the lake.

52
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,246
- Take one with Grady.
- You got it.

53
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,076
Let's talk about
this later, okay?

54
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,582
You're admitting there's
something to talk about.

55
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,778
- Hey, Chaz, how you doing?
- Fine, thanks.

56
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,047
What up?

57
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,283
Robert Truman, 68. Jumped in
after a kid who fell into the lake.

58
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,450
Thought I could get
in and out. Too cold.

59
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,721
Heart rate's 68, pulse
ox good. Temp was 90.

60
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,889
- My lungs froze up, couldn't swim.
- Does anything hurt, sir?

61
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,830
I'm fine. Take care of the boy.
- Barely moving air.

62
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,995
- Too cold, can't get a sat.
- Twenty-four gauge PIV, that's it?

63
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,573
- He needs central access.
- Mom is here. It's okay.

64
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,801
This is your fault.
You made this happen.

65
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,412
He needed my help. I
thought if I could only do...

66
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,741
Why won't you leave us alone?

67
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,112
- No, I'm sorry, I tried to...
- Stay away from my son.

68
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,480
- He's hypoventilating.
- We need to bag him.

69
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,250
- Doctor, please take care of that child.
- We're gonna concentrate on you now.

70
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,690
If you wanna help me,
you need to help that boy.

71
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,487
- Mr. Truman...
- Please save him.

72
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,598
Save him or I'm going to hell.

73
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,834
The nurse wants to bump our
meniscus repair until tomorrow.

74
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,503
Tell her to kiss your ass,
or maybe mine. She's cute.

75
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,411
- What's up, Ortho girl?
- Morris, what are you doing here?

76
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,518
- I'm a surgeon for the day.
- What?

77
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,154
Yep, it's the ER's new
trauma-exchange program.

78
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,587
- I never heard anything about this.
- ER staff can spend a day...

79
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,624
following trauma
patients to the O.R.

80
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,625
- You gonna scrub in on cases?
- Hope so.

81
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,094
Be good and Harold might
let you hold his retractor.

82
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,698
Definitely. MORRIS: Ha-ha.

83
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:56,325
Dude, I gotta go. There's
like a hundred doctors here.

84
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,997
- After you.
- No, after you.

85
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,798
Rasgotra, you're up.

86
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,138
Silas is our snowmobile versus
brick wall. Post op day one...

87
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,006
She's so cute, isn't she?

88
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,106
- Day one from laparotomy...
- With her little accent.

89
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,443
Hemoglobin's stable, slept well.

90
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,021
Got a chest x-ray. No infiltrates.
Mild atelectasis bilaterally.

91
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,216
- Okay.
- That means areas of collapsed alveoli.

92
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,792
We know what atelectasis is.

93
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:24,022
It's probably nothing, but I can
repeat the film this afternoon.

94
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,290
Okay.

95
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,060
Hey, what's the definition
of a double-blind study?

96
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,170
- Two ortho docs looking at a chest film.
- Zing.

97
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,202
Don't pretend that's not
funny. You taught me that joke.

98
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,277
Oh, my God, I love this girl.

99
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,341
He was collecting samples
from the lake for a science project.

100
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:46,715
- Something about algae in winter.
- Core temp's 74.3.

101
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,378
More suction, please.

102
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,854
Then that man just appears
out of nowhere again.

103
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,048
Tube.

104
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,024
He's been to the store,
trying to talk to me while I work.

105
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,424
I thought he was just
some lonely old guy.

106
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,396
And yesterday, I saw
him outside of my house.

107
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,900
Then when he saw me
looking, he just walked away.

108
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,166
And then today at the lake...

109
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,341
I went there to tell
him to stay away.

110
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,067
I told him I was
gonna call the police.

111
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,178
Gabriel must have slipped
in while my back was turned.

112
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,941
I have no idea how long he
was there before I realized.

113
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,583
That man jumped in after him?

114
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,913
He said, "Call 911,"
and then he just jumped.

115
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,579
Sam, call Respiratory for a vent
and set up for bilateral chest tubes.

116
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:26,352
Have Central bring in a
circulating-water blanket.

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,859
- He'll do better with a Bair Hugger.
- Both work.

118
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,293
- Bair Hugger's better.
- Show me the data.

119
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,933
You kids work it out.

120
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,466
You guys all right in here?

121
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:39,402
Yeah, his core temp's up to 94, but
his EKG shows ischemic changes.

122
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,907
Could have been caused
by the strain of the cold swim.

123
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,101
- Hey.
- These flattened T waves.

124
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,908
I've had those for years.
It's definitely not an MI.

125
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,984
I'm a doctor. Retired six years,
but I can still read an EKG.

126
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,782
Okay, well, let us check
your troponins just in case.

127
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,652
- Yeah, just knock yourself out.
- Where'd you practice?

128
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,623
Stateville, 12 years.

129
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,163
- Stateville Penitentiary?
- Yes.

130
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,332
Bet that was intense.
You guys seem fine.

131
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,899
- I'm going back in with the kid.
- How is he?

132
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,102
- I can't talk about his treatment.
- Of course.

133
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,832
Hey. Fun rounding
with you this morning.

134
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,476
- Hi, Archie.
- Want some advice?

135
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,408
- No.
- You need to work on your style.

136
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,343
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, you're too serious.

137
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,312
Have fun, take
some joy in your work.

138
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,951
- I'm fun.
- You're English.

139
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,316
I get it. It's hard to let your hair
down. You are in America now.

140
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,685
You know, I don't know what
you're basing this on since...

141
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,753
You know how hard it was
to find a jersey that small?

142
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,659
- Hockey?
- See? I'm fun.

143
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,800
We're gonna finish
then head to the rink.

144
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,332
Oh, Neela, this is so hot.

145
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,528
- Can you do a triple axel?
- Dude, that's figure skating.

146
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,706
- Oh. GROSSMAN:
You friends with that guy?

147
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,934
- Sort of.
- Oh, tell the truth. We slept together.

148
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,476
She gave me a rash.

149
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,950
- Hey, I'm sorry about the last few days.
- Oh, hey.

150
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:01,714
I've been working 11 a.m. to 11
p.m., which is like falling off the planet.

151
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,515
It's okay. I've
been slammed too.

152
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,127
I'm leading a seminar at the
CAHC tomorrow and I'm way behind.

153
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,785
What's CAHC?

154
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,022
Complementary Alternative
Health Conference.

155
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,995
- I told you all about it.
- You didn't.

156
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,158
You may have been
in a post-coital stupor.

157
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:19,568
But I am presenting data on
the effects of prayer on healing.

158
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,402
- They actually have data on that?
- Yes. Ahem.

159
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,410
Several studies have shown that patients
who have people praying for them...

160
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,480
get well faster than
those who don't.

161
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,015
- Ooh. Spooky.
- Shut up, the results are cool.

162
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,676
When you get a minute, I
got a guy for you in Trauma.

163
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,515
No, no, not another consult.

164
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,988
I have to get this talk
together or I'm screwed.

165
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,990
He saved a kid from
drowning in a lake.

166
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,493
The kid's not doing so
well and he's freaked out.

167
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,426
Come on, now.

168
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,829
Okay. I have a baby-naming
ceremony in the NICU...

169
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,869
and then I am meeting
with a statistician...

170
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,768
to go over the
slides for the talk.

171
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,102
I'll come back after that.
- Thank you.

172
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:59,735
- Chest x-ray on Robert Truman.
- Good.

173
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,242
- You're kidding me.
- Ugly, right?

174
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,215
- Yeesh. Who's that?
- Old lake guy.

175
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,379
Order a chest CT and I'll
get an official read on that.

176
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,753
Tell me you don't need a
radiologist to see this film is abnormal.

177
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:16,920
- Diffuse lung nodules, I know.
- Lung mets.

178
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,589
I called you to get your
take on the differential...

179
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,930
before I go in there and tell the
man he has metastatic cancer.

180
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:28,201
Couldn't it be miliary TB or
cocci or sarcoid or something?

181
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:33,109
Yeah, but in a 68-year-old
guy, odds are it's gonna be mets.

182
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,306
- Great.
- So anything else?

183
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,516
Guess not.

184
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,720
Thanks for the consult.

185
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,891
Dr. Truman.

186
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,827
Robert, please.

187
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,902
In your days as a prison doc, did
you ever get tested positive for TB?

188
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,735
No, I had the PPD
every four months.

189
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,310
Any coughing,
fevers, night sweats?

190
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,778
Huh. The chest x-ray.

191
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,110
Metastatic prostate cancer.

192
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:16,051
It spread to my lungs and my
bones before I even knew I had it.

193
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:22,494
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I guess it's my retribution.

194
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,188
Excuse me?

195
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:30,961
When men try to do God's
work, bad things happen.

196
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,136
I wish I'd realized this
before I killed that boy's father.

197
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,837
Another run of V-tach.

198
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,278
Two hundred of bretylium
and start an infusion.

199
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,816
- Core temp's down to 71.
- He's getting colder?

200
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,543
Cold blood in his extremities...

201
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,154
rushes up to his heart
and drops the core temp.

202
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,382
Your Bair Hugger
worked a little too well.

203
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,151
His heart can't beat
normally at this temperature.

204
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,091
Sam, call the ECMO tech.

205
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,863
Don't you think that's jumping the
gun? What about peritoneal lavage?

206
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,502
- What's ECMO?
- Cardiac bypass.

207
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,900
It's the only thing that's
gonna warm the core.

208
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,698
It's too dangerous.

209
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,240
His temperature is 71.
He's having runs of V-tach.

210
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,002
- We're there.
- Bleeding, infection...

211
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,737
- He knows the risks.
- Thank you.

212
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,643
But I'm with Sam. Gabriel's
got a pulse and a decent BP.

213
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,909
Exhaust all options
before jumping to ECMO.

214
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,210
I'll get the stuff.

215
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,981
Put a tube in belly and flush warm fluids
to see if we can raise his core temp.

216
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,388
- Hey, Sam, what's with you today?
- Nothing.

217
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,154
- Then why do you have to plan B me?
- Plan B you?

218
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,161
Whatever I say, you
have a better idea.

219
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,266
- That's not true.
- Yeah, Sam, it is true.

220
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,267
Bair Hugger versus water
blanket. Morphine versus fentanyl.

221
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,927
Okay, come on, you sound crazy.

222
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,232
Whatever I want,
you give me that look.

223
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,602
- What look?
- That look, that one, right there.

224
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,573
I don't accept orders
from someone...

225
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,906
because they come
from a doctor or a man.

226
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,548
I've been doing this a
lot longer than you have.

227
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:53,209
If you don't like
that, it's too bad.

228
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,723
Back at Stateville, my job
was to give lethal injections...

229
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,227
to death-row inmates.

230
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,992
- Wow, that's heavy.
- Yes.

231
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,731
People could watch
through a window.

232
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,566
And I remember...
I remember her.

233
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:20,511
Trying to be brave for the
baby as I injected the thiopental...

234
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,308
the Pavulon...

235
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,042
potassium.

236
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,687
Gabriel was only 2.

237
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,153
He never knew his dad.

238
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,482
Dr. Truman, you don't
really have to talk about this.

239
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,720
No.

240
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,332
Back then, I thought
it was the right thing.

241
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,991
I thought there were
criminals who deserved to die...

242
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,536
and lethal injection was
the most humane way.

243
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,574
As time went on, my
thinking's changed.

244
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,234
About the death penalty?

245
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:58,249
Who lives and dies should
be decided by God, not a jury.

246
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,046
I've spent the
last five years...

247
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,621
tracking the loved ones
of the men I've killed.

248
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,021
Trying to make amends
with those families.

249
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,388
And how do you make amends?

250
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,693
Financial aid, mostly.
It's all I have to offer.

251
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,634
I paid a mortgage, bought
a car, sent a child to college.

252
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,570
Some people told me to get lost.

253
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,872
Others took what I could offer.

254
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,109
Well, that's really brave.

255
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,617
- And generous.
- No.

256
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,381
They're all acts of contrition.

257
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,047
Small things.

258
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:44,626
Nothing will ever bring back
a husband or a son, father.

259
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,392
Saving a kid's life
isn't a small thing.

260
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:54,071
I'm just trying to tell God how
sorry I am for what I've done.

261
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,607
Please.

262
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,144
I need that boy to live.

263
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,516
Tell that freak to
stop staring at me.

264
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,485
Not many people would jump
in a frozen lake for a stranger.

265
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,922
- He's not a stranger, he's a stalker.
- V-tach, lost the pulse.

266
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,096
- Starting compressions.
- Oh, my God. What's happening?

267
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,288
His heart has stopped
beating effectively.

268
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,524
We can't shock it
back until he's warmer.

269
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,465
This looks like the right room.
- Who called for ECMO?

270
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,697
The conservative route wouldn't
work so I gave Teddy the heads-up.

271
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,809
Put him on. This is a
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

272
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,445
It will function as
Gabriel's heart and lungs.

273
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,707
- Sam, you should've listened to me.
- Well, let's hope it works.

274
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,078
Celia, do you have any
family we need to call?

275
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,308
Or Gabriel's dad?

276
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,546
- His dad's been dead a couple years.
- How about your family?

277
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,191
Father's out of the picture.
Haven't talked to my mother.

278
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,657
Anspaugh's on his way to cannulate.
- Do it here.

279
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,286
- Surgery has to. It's protocol.
- Chief is coming for a central line?

280
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,544
They're a little short-staffed today.
All up at a big conference or something.

281
00:13:56,703 --> 00:14:00,868
- Yeah, let's do this, let's go.
- Rasgotra, isn't this fun?

282
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,000
Uh, especially the part where I get
to see my Attending in his jock strap.

283
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,340
Okay, go.

284
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,005
I'm streaking to the blue
line in the dump and chase.

285
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,982
- What do you do?
- Head to the far corner, dump in the net.

286
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,054
- That is exactly right.
- Okay, everybody, listen up.

287
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,024
Smart, aggressive, no mercy.

288
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,824
Smart, aggressive, no mercy.
Smart, aggressive, no mercy. Smart...

289
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,365
Machine is doing the
work for his heart and lungs.

290
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,400
We're gonna take
out the breathing tube.

291
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,936
I see.

292
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,040
When his temp's up, his
own heart will kick back in.

293
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,437
Well, that's the hope.

294
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,838
What do you mean,
that's the hope?

295
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,578
Well, I'm sure Dr. Gates has
explained that Gabriel's tissues...

296
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,117
may be permanently
damaged because of the cold.

297
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,084
I explained that, but we're
trying to think positive here.

298
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,723
Right.

299
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,619
Look, we all hope this brings him
back, but he's been down for a long time.

300
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,889
Did over an hour of CPR.

301
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,964
Celia, call someone.

302
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,794
A friend, family, it doesn't matter.
You just need some support.

303
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,098
You don't know what I need.

304
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,403
I'm a single mom.

305
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,704
I know asking for help feels
like cheating sometimes.

306
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,948
Jimmy, Gabriel's dad...

307
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,883
he was one of those guys
who couldn't stay out of trouble.

308
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:29,085
Running drugs, stealing cars.

309
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,787
I was an idiot. I
thought he'd change.

310
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,593
That's human.

311
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:41,498
And I told my mom Jimmy and I
were gonna raise the baby together...

312
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,767
and she kicked
me out of the house.

313
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,679
She said, "You may be lost...

314
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:51,216
but I am not gonna have a guy
like that around the rest of my kids."

315
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,253
Looking back, she
was probably right.

316
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:01,156
Celia, there's a very good chance
that Gabriel's heart won't start up again.

317
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,664
No, please, please don't
say that. This is gonna work.

318
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,666
Guys, I need another
liter of NS and an ABG kit.

319
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,637
Okay. Yeah, I got it.

320
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,472
And check an ionized calcium while
you're at it. The last one was low.

321
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,714
555-0172.

322
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:26,751
That's my mom.
Could you call her?

323
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,119
Right away.

324
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,997
Yeah!

325
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,499
Game on.

326
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,672
- Who are we playing?
- Pedes, I think.

327
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,070
I saw the pathologists
practicing in the parking lot.

328
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,577
<i>And now, the starting lineup...</i>

329
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,644
<i>of County General's very own.</i>

330
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:59,980
<i>Unstoppable, irrepressible,
the Mighty Docs.</i>

331
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,919
<i>Playing right wing,
Lucien Dubenko.</i>

332
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,356
They are such drama queens.

333
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,656
We're playing the
trauma surgeons?

334
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,698
Beat them in the last five
seconds of the finals last year.

335
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,098
<i>Left wing, Dusty Crenshaw.</i>

336
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,239
Oh, my God.

337
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,870
<i>On defense, Harold Zelinsky.</i>

338
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,416
<i>Playing center:</i>

339
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,953
<i>- Archie Morris.</i>
- Oh, no way.

340
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,957
- Way.
- Oh, this explains everything.

341
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,620
Weird behavior, the program...

342
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,197
Ruse to play on this
team and kick your ass.

343
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,734
- He's a ringer.
- Yeah, baby, huh?

344
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:57,603
I had a 26-year-old kid on the
table, convicted of killing a cop.

345
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,236
I could see his family,
pleading, praying.

346
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:06,614
I injected the drugs
and he didn't die.

347
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,948
He lay there, awake, quivering.

348
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,958
Lethal doses of three different
agents and he was still alive.

349
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,427
Parents were crying,
claiming a miracle.

350
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:23,266
- What happened?
- The IV infiltrated.

351
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:29,470
The drugs pooled in his soft tissues
instead of going into his bloodstream.

352
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:36,014
So I placed another IV, drew up
another round of meds and pushed.

353
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,010
And this time...

354
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,584
it took him 90 seconds to die.

355
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:49,254
Seven months later, a
police officer came forward.

356
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,489
The boy was framed
for the murder. Hm?

357
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,699
He didn't do it.

358
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,339
You couldn't have known that.

359
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,534
God tried to stop me from
killing an innocent man...

360
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,680
and I ignored the sign.

361
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,783
How can I even
hope for forgiveness?

362
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,846
I think...

363
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,981
sometimes it's easier to
feel guilty than forgiven.

364
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,058
Which means what?

365
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:31,737
That maybe your guilt over these
deaths has become your reason for living.

366
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,339
Maybe you need a
new reason to go on.

367
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,068
I don't want to go on.

368
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:43,581
Can't you see I'm old? I
have cancer. I've had enough.

369
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,878
The only thing that is holding
me back is that I am afraid.

370
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:51,388
- I'm afraid of what comes next.
- And what do you think that is?

371
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,650
Oh, you tell me.

372
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,194
Is atonement even possible?
What does God want from me?

373
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,198
I think it's up to each one of
us to interpret what God wants.

374
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,892
So people can do anything?

375
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,700
They can rape, murder, steal, all
in the name of God and it's okay?

376
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,502
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

377
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:17,515
Because all I'm hearing is some new-age,
God-is-love, one-size-fits-all crap.

378
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,347
- Hey, Dr. Truman...
- No, I don't have time for this now.

379
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,546
Greg, it's okay.

380
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,124
- Look, I understand...
- No, you don't understand.

381
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,284
You don't understand.

382
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,396
How could you possibly say
that? Now, you listen to me.

383
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,899
I want a real chaplain who
believes in a real God and a real hell.

384
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,027
You're frustrated, but
you need to ask yourself...

385
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:43,870
No, I don't need to ask
myself. I need answers.

386
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,480
And all your questions
and your uncertainty...

387
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,047
are only making things worse.

388
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,647
- I know you're upset.
- God.

389
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,482
I need someone who
will look me in the eye...

390
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:02,754
and tell me how to find forgiveness
because I am running out of time.

391
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,301
- I'm trying to help.
- Well, don't. Just get out.

392
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,536
Get out! Get out!

393
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,800
Hey, Julia. Julia, come
on. Listen, come on.

394
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,572
Come on, the guy's just freaking
out. He didn't mean what he said.

395
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,685
Yeah, he did. He absolutely did.

396
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,426
Okay, don't choke,
Neela. Don't cough it up.

397
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,359
It would be real embarrassing
if you lost that puck to me.

398
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,467
Neela. MAN 2: Yes. Stay down.

399
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,897
Yes!

400
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,466
Get up!

401
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,338
Oh, let's see. Your eye, crap.

402
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,518
Concentration, crap.
Coordination, crap.

403
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,209
How do we let this girl operate?

404
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,166
Hit me. Come on, hit me.

405
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,328
- You know you wanna.
- I don't.

406
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,733
- Come on, hit me.
- Lucien.

407
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,536
Everybody wants to take a
shot at their mentor, don't they?

408
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,050
Ha!

409
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:39,386
Come on, Neela. Untie the
piano, you'll skate faster, huh?

410
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,456
Ah! Oh, no.

411
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,087
Go, go, go.

412
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,666
I got it. I got it.

413
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,706
I got it.

414
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,676
Neela, you're dead.

415
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,414
Whoo!

416
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,718
Hey, Gates, hold on. Have
you seen Julia around?

417
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,022
- No, not since this morning.
- She's not answering her pager.

418
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,563
She usually turns it off
when she's with patients.

419
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:24,136
This guy in 1, it's a mess.

420
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,465
Do you have any questions
for us, Mrs. Davies?

421
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:31,873
No, Celia explained it all. She
always had a head for science.

422
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,070
Gabriel does too.

423
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,147
He wants to be a
marine biologist.

424
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,079
ACT is 224.

425
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:42,221
- Let's keep the heparin where it's at.
- You sure you wanna do that?

426
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,221
Never mind.

427
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,624
What are you doing here?

428
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,457
I wanted to let you know...

429
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,394
- You can't be here.
- Please, I want to say...

430
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,399
Get out. Please, just go.

431
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,630
- Maybe you should just go back to bed.
- Hold on, Sam, hold on.

432
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,935
Look, ma'am, he tried
to save your son's life.

433
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,172
Just give him a chance to
say what he came to say.

434
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,908
And afterwards you'll give
this family their privacy, right?

435
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,986
Yes.

436
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,854
Sorry.

437
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,926
I'm sorry for all the
trouble I've caused.

438
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:32,070
I'm praying for your boy.

439
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:36,806
Sir, thank you for your
bravery. I'm very grateful.

440
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,207
So is my daughter.

441
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,205
Right, Celia?

442
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,146
Celia, tell him.

443
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:51,722
Tell this man thank you.

444
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,319
Thank you.

445
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,722
Like you mean it.

446
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,204
I am not 3 years old
anymore. I have to call work.

447
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,834
That's... That's all.

448
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,108
Come on, let me get
you back on the monitor.

449
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,043
- Lucien, five hole or top shelf?
- I don't care, just make it count.

450
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,921
We need a goalie here.

451
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,696
Hey, you guys ever
seen Neela drunk?

452
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,362
You should have seen her
at the ER Christmas party.

453
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,770
She gave Anspaugh
a lap dance. Woo-hoo.

454
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,510
Could have blocked that with
a wad of toilet paper, Morris.

455
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,912
I hear she still sleeps with a
blankie. She calls it her nubbie.

456
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,848
What the hell are
you talking about?

457
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,182
Whoa!

458
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,084
Nice. MORRIS: That's right.

459
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,019
Your career as a
goalie doesn't pan out...

460
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,461
you can go back to
work at the Jumbo Mart.

461
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,066
You guys know she used to
work at the Jumbo Mart, right?

462
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,114
Hey, Skye.

463
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,622
Have you seen Julia around?

464
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,314
- No.
- She had trouble...

465
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,460
with one of my patients
and went AWOL.

466
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,653
- What happened?
- Are you ready for this one?

467
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:43,827
My guy in 1 gave a lethal injection
to the father of your boy in 2.

468
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,499
- What?
- He was a prison doctor.

469
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,265
He used to push the drugs
into the guys on death row.

470
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,603
I guess he's had a change
of heart. Excuse me.

471
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,508
Hey, Chaz, hey. Hey, man.

472
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,081
Hey, Celia.

473
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,118
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

474
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,759
Yeah, it's just work, you know?

475
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,335
I guess she wants a
commitment, but I don't know.

476
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:19,472
Maybe I'm not that kind of guy.

477
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,504
So why don't you
just tell her that?

478
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,766
Bettina's great.

479
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,172
It's not like I'm looking
for something better.

480
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,108
You been together
for a while now.

481
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,680
- Yeah, nine months.
- Hm!

482
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,441
That must be a record for you.

483
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:34,451
I like her, all right?
So that's not the issue.

484
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,613
Well, why don't you just give
it a try and see what happens?

485
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,984
It's easy for you to say.

486
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,992
You're 20 years old
and still playing the field.

487
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,858
Greg, I've been with the
same guy for almost a year now.

488
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,157
Really? Why didn't
you tell me that before?

489
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,968
- You never asked.
- All right, well, I should take these.

490
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,333
- Cool, thanks for the coffee.
- Oh, anytime.

491
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,997
Hey, what's his name?

492
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,473
- Andrew.
- Well, I'd like to meet him sometime.

493
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,078
We can all go to a
drag club or something.

494
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:04,306
Ha! Just kidding,
man. That'd be cool.

495
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,542
What you got?

496
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,312
Mass cas at the ice rink.
Ortho versus Trauma.

497
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,547
What? CRENSHAW: You.

498
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,485
You were a complete
goon out there.

499
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,217
- I hit you because you elbowed me.
- Headhunter.

500
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,726
- Octopus - Slasher.

501
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,807
- Can't we all just get along?
- Rasgotra, this isn't over.

502
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,266
I saved your ass so
many times out there.

503
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,105
Well, maybe I wouldn't have
to if you weren't such a goon.

504
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,002
You should
practice a little more.

505
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,439
You've had plenty of
practice swinging stick.

506
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,306
Could you lay down? I don't
recognize you standing up.

507
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,412
Hey, get off of him, you wanker.

508
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:48,854
The ECMO tech needs you in
T-2 right away. That kid's awake.

509
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,324
Cripes!

510
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,791
What's going on?

511
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:58,597
We see this after a few hours on
the machine. They just wake up.

512
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,972
Sat's okay on room air.

513
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,770
Mommy? What happened?

514
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,639
Oh, baby.

515
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,872
Hi, baby, hi. You're okay.

516
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,415
- Attaboy, Gabriel.
- Oh, thank God.

517
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,588
- He's okay. He's gonna be okay.
- I know, baby.

518
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,450
Core temp's up to 94.

519
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,718
This family will never forget
what you did here today.

520
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,087
Just doing our job.

521
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,162
Well, I don't care what
you say. It's a miracle.

522
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,097
What do you say we take
this kid off the machine?

523
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,429
- Sounds good.
- Size 8 gloves okay?

524
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,162
Looks like good news in there.

525
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,803
This doesn't absolve you.

526
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,870
Don't think it does.

527
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,443
I don't forgive you.

528
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,915
I will never forgive you.

529
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,919
You have to live with
what you've done.

530
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,979
Julia.

531
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,516
Well, the lake
kid is doing great.

532
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,580
But our guy...

533
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,991
He needs you in there.

534
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,759
I can't.

535
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,826
All right, well, I
need you in there.

536
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,961
He's asking me all kind of questions
that I don't know how to answer.

537
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:49,037
You know, doubt...
it's uncomfortable.

538
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,877
But certainty...

539
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,251
I don't think it's real.

540
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,520
I mean, I went to seminary.

541
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:05,429
I studied Buddhism, I
spent time at an ashram.

542
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:11,534
Who really knows anything
with absolute certainty?

543
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,901
Not me, that's for sure.

544
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,975
That's why I thought an
inclusive approach to spirituality...

545
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,112
would work well
in a place like this.

546
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,803
It does. It does.

547
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,005
The patients, they
appreciate what you do.

548
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,381
No, people in crisis want
rules. They want structure.

549
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,546
Something to
lean on, I get that.

550
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,791
But it's not me.

551
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,392
You know, we all wonder what
we're doing here sometimes.

552
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,427
That guy needs help.

553
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,468
So come on.

554
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,075
Come back in there with
me. Let's go talk to him.

555
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,039
I don't think so.

556
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,179
All right.

557
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,760
Ramsey, did you
trip over the blue line?

558
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,487
Yeah, fell on me.

559
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,678
Morris, hurt yourself
doing a triple axel?

560
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:15,702
So who won?

561
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,360
It was a mutual forfeit.

562
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,038
- Didn't know you had it in you, Mayday.
- Me neither.

563
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:23,198
- X-ray's negative, home with splint.
- All right, who's next?

564
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,674
Hey, Neela, how's your boo-boo?

565
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,607
It's my dominant hand.

566
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,010
- If I can't operate, you're dead.
- Wuss.

567
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:31,262
You hack.

568
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,476
Beyotch.

569
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,553
- Who are you yelling at, Harold?
- I don't really know.

570
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,623
- No tenderness, bearing weight.
- Hey, how's my team?

571
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,351
They need ibuprofen, a
hot tub and a glass of wine.

572
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,691
- I like the way you think.
- Okay, listen up, everyone, fun's over.

573
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:47,833
Orthopods are rounding
on the hall in 10.

574
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,865
- Trauma to the ICU.
- What about me?

575
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,528
There's an ingrown toenail in
Exam 3 with your name on it.

576
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:57,005
Sam. What's up, buddy,
you sick of us down here?

577
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,609
No, I like it.

578
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,406
- You like it? You're a weird kid.
- He likes the Jell-O.

579
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:03,809
Thanks again, doctor.

580
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,575
You're welcome. You take
care of your mom, okay?

581
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,912
Sam, any beds open up?

582
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,248
Well, I had to threaten the
charge nurse with physical violence.

583
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,584
But something opened up.

584
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,386
All right, we're going to Ike
Ryan's. You should come.

585
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,686
- Should I?
- Yeah.

586
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:20,731
As long as if I order you a beer,
you don't change it to vodka gimlet.

587
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,097
I don't know. I have to report
upstairs. I gotta do stuff here.

588
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,238
How often do we get
an outcome like this?

589
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,106
A pulseless ice
cube turned into a

590
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,364
Jell-O-loving 11-year-old
in the same shift.

591
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:34,171
- That doesn't happen every day.
- That's for sure.

592
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:39,516
- Well?
- Well, I'll see if I can make it.

593
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,402
<i>I have sinned against heaven.</i>

594
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:42,441
And in your sight
are no more worthy.

595
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,642
Gracious God.

596
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:54,486
My mortal sentence I accept.

597
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,794
Stop.

598
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,628
- What the hell are you doing?
- I am in hell.

599
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:07,466
Do you understand? I am in
hell already. I might as well go.

600
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,836
Listen to me. You
saved a little boy's life.

601
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,773
No, it is not enough. I
can't change my destiny.

602
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,345
There isn't time.

603
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,709
Did it ever occur to
you that your destiny...

604
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,511
was for you to be on
that pier this morning?

605
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,780
That maybe your life's path and
all the choices that you made...

606
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,048
led you right there.

607
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,815
- Why?
- So you could save that kid.

608
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:29,052
Why? Why would God do that?

609
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,197
Why would he have me
kill 17 people to save one?

610
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,730
You may not understand it...

611
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,562
but that little boy is alive
because you were there.

612
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,198
Now, whatever you need
that to count for, it counts.

613
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,884
It doesn't make sense.

614
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,788
It doesn't have to make sense.

615
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,985
That's why it's called faith.

616
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,445
All right.

617
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,417
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Sam, great job today.

618
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,388
- Thank you, you too.
- Hey, Gabriel all tucked in?

619
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,428
Yes. The ICU nurses
are fawning all over him.

620
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,065
- My turn to win some money.
- All right.

621
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,196
- So, what are you drinking?
- Actually, I can't stay.

622
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,100
So you came here to tell
me that you can't come here?

623
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,401
- Yeah.
- Really?

624
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,737
Have you heard
of the cell phone?

625
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:57,246
You know what, you're right. It's dumb.
I shouldn't have come. I wasn't thinking.

626
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,408
Wow, she admits that she
wasn't thinking. Alert the media.

627
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,485
- Screw you, Gates.
- Come on, stay here.

628
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:06,716
Will you get her a beer, please?
- You got it.

629
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,588
Vodka gimlet with a twist.
- Okay.

630
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:18,626
Definitely the most insane shift
I've worked since I started here.

631
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,602
You said that exact
same thing yesterday.

632
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,469
I did not.

633
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,778
So are you going
to Ike's after this?

634
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,678
No, I'm not much
of a group person.

635
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,819
I need my alone time
at the end of the day.

636
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,020
Is that why you're not married?

637
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,593
No.

638
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:48,124
Then why isn't a hot, smart woman
such as yourself shacked up by now?

639
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,995
And I'm not hitting on you.

640
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,629
Just wondering if some people
aren't cut out for commitment.

641
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,404
Nobody's cut out for commitment.

642
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,110
It fights our DNA.

643
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:07,611
- You don't believe in monogamy?
- No, I believe in monogamy.

644
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:12,019
I just don't believe in
the concept of forever.

645
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:16,985
People force the issue and then
act surprised when it doesn't work out.

646
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:21,065
You know, some people
might say that your theory...

647
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,861
is a cover for a
fear of commitment.

648
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:30,301
Well, it takes a lot
of courage to reject...

649
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,343
the widely embraced
social construct of marriage.

650
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,344
Most people assume you've
got some kind of problem.

651
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,252
Well, seems like you've
got it all figured out.

652
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,157
Some days.

653
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,992
- Night, Skye.
- Night.

654
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,231
How'd you hurt your shoulder?

655
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:08,278
Checked by Grossman after the
face-off. But I hurt him worse later.

656
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,908
Ever seen bonobos at the zoo?

657
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,417
What's a bonobo?

658
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,715
Pygmy chimp.

659
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:23,522
Famous in the primate world
for their social-sexual behavior.

660
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,888
How fascinating.

661
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,568
In bonobo communities...

662
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,634
sex is a way to say hello.

663
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,268
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hm.

664
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,209
Hello.

665
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,084
- This is so awesome. NEELA:
I didn't know these were here.

666
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,449
Hot tubs are for therapy
during the day, but night?

667
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,216
They belong to the hockey team.

668
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,757
Lucien, Skye, how's the water?

669
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,459
Hot, very hot.

670
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,932
Guys, this job rocks.

671
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,575
I'm not sure what the
point of that would be...

672
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:18,342
other than to make him feel
guilty on top of everything else.

673
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,816
Uh, I gotta go. Okay, bye.

674
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,582
- Hey.
- Hey.

675
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,555
What's up?

676
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,918
We need to talk.

677
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:39,202
I'm sorry about this morning,
okay? You had the right to be mad.

678
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,703
Apology accepted.

679
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,099
Look...

680
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:50,374
This is all new to me, okay?

681
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,709
I haven't been down
this path before.

682
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,881
But I really, really
want this to work.

683
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:05,287
Do you know if you stare at an
x-ray for more than 38 seconds...

684
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,694
you start to see
things that aren't there?

685
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,896
Because that's
what's this is, Greg.

686
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,161
We've stared at
this thing too long...

687
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:15,671
and tricked ourselves into
seeing something that isn't there.

688
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,639
You're not listening,
okay? I wanna do this.

689
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,540
This morning, you
seemed totally unsure.

690
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,306
Who's sure about anything?

691
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,347
This shouldn't
have to be this hard.

692
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:30,182
Eventually you know we would
end up right back in the same place.

693
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:35,017
And frankly, I
don't have the time.

694
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,770
- Thank you for waiting with me.
- No problem.

695
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,842
Oh.

696
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,771
ECMO was a good
call with that kid.

697
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,779
We probably should
have done it sooner.

698
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,919
It's annoying but
you were right.

699
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,211
Thank you.

700
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,653
And, Sam, I do like
working with you.

701
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,517
Other than the relentless
interrogation and second-guessing...

702
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,526
and you constantly
blowing me off...

703
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,188
- Shut up.
- When I give you orders.

704
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,775
I hate you.

705
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,305
I hate you too.
