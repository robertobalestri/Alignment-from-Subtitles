1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:06,672
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,103
Too much has happened.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,270
I have to move out.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,438
Bettina's pushing you away
because she's afraid to depend on you.

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,379
If you don't see
that you're an idiot.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,451
- I can't reach this.
- I don't know, Sam.

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,179
What if someone sees us?
They might get the wrong idea.

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,722
You got 14 candidates
going for one attending slot.

9
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,757
It'll be gone before
you reschedule.

10
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,395
I wanna be an attending
here. I think I'd be a good one.

11
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,896
So I was wondering if you could
squeeze me in tomorrow. Or the next day.

12
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,432
I have a few minutes right now.

13
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,761
Watch out.

14
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,965
Come on, Marquez. Talk to me.

15
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,934
Got the fiber optic.

16
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,300
There's too much blood
and swelling. Bag him.

17
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,637
- Was the driver drunk?
- No. This was a hit-and-run.

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,870
- Eighty systolic.
- Can I get a central line?

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,310
- Maybe I can try.
- This is not a teaching case.

20
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,575
Dr. Brenner will show
his techniques to you.

21
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,310
- Sats are up.
- All right, suction on high.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,785
Laverne, I'm prepping
with antibacterial soap.

23
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,788
Don't wanna get any nasty
bacteria into the bloodstream...

24
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,292
or it could cause
a serious infection.

25
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,695
Hi, it's Dr. Gates.
Where's the chopper?

26
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,295
Fifteen minutes? No,
that's cool. We can wait.

27
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,368
- Looks like we have some time to kill.
- Uh-huh.

28
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,142
- Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:57,644
Luka asked me to pick him up.

30
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:58,979
Where is he, in the car?

31
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,314
- At the park.
- He's not downstairs?

32
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,854
I'm supposed to meet him
there. He said you knew.

33
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,253
I did know about the park.

34
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,395
I just didn't know he was
gonna send a courier, that's all.

35
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,927
He wanted to make sure
you packed Joe's pajamas.

36
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,229
They're in there.
Come here, sweetie.

37
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:26,446
Um... Can you
just have him, uh...?

38
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,709
- Drop him off at the hospital tomorrow.
- Sure.

39
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:34,287
Okay. Or you can
do it, or whoever.

40
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,684
- I'm sorry, Abby.
- It's all right.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,035
Ready for a crash innovation?

42
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,903
You know me, I'm always ready.

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,073
- Oh, God.
- What?

44
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,552
I already know.
Get over yourselves.

45
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,890
Rebecca Smith. Front-seat
passenger with PSI, tachy at 120.

46
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,466
- Systolic up to 110.
- Pulse ox, 95.

47
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,967
- Hi, welcome to County.
- How's your breathing?

48
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,128
- It hurts.
- Boyfriend, Daniel, the driver.

49
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,503
- Why doesn't he have a backboard?
- Refused it. He's got an arm lac.

50
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,200
Get a wheelchair.

51
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,641
Grab a wheelchair.

52
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,982
- Come on.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

53
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,524
Oh, Abby, good.

54
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,190
We got a lacrosse-ball-versus-chest
waiting on film.

55
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,427
We got a 6-year-old
kid who ate a live frog.

56
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,095
- Chewed or swallowed?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

57
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,834
And we got a guy who turned
blue from drinking colloidal silver.

58
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,807
Argyria.

59
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,338
I saw a photographer who tried
to poison himself by drinking...

60
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,710
Wow, that's really great.

61
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,751
I'm sure that Larry and Laverne
would love to hear about it.

62
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,946
- What's the rush, Dr. Pratt?
- It's a personal appointment.

63
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,919
- Well, how much is she?
- Ha, ha, ha.

64
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,583
Luckily, your mom
gives me a discount.

65
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,456
Watch it. That's Anspaugh's
sister you're talking about.

66
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,225
- You got a minute?
- Yeah, but you gotta make it quick.

67
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,561
Paramedics bring in a
20-year-old hit-and-run?

68
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,034
Yeah, he's on the
second floor in Surgery.

69
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,695
Two from the chopper.

70
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,104
One abdomen with
guarding. Call Surgery.

71
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,301
- Upper extremity lacs.
- Abby, we need you.

72
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,244
I'm in the middle of something
now. Brenner, your genius is required.

73
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,973
- Thanks, Abby.
- Okay.

74
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,086
Laverne, Larry, let's
go learn together.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,588
- So, what's the word?
- What did you hear from upstairs?

76
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,725
Well, you're still
in limbo land.

77
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,384
- What are they doing?
- They're cutting down the list.

78
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,723
Started out with 14,
now they're down to five.

79
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,560
- But you're still standing.
- Do you think it looks good?

80
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,628
Yeah, it looks good, but I wouldn't
put all my eggs in one basket.

81
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,630
- Do you know something?
- Abby, I don't know anything.

82
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,438
But nothing will make them focus
on you like getting another offer.

83
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,136
See you.

84
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,075
Breath sounds clear.

85
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,410
Sats are borderline.
She needs a chest tube.

86
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,984
With the mechanism on the...

87
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,485
- She's stable, she may not need it.
- Need what?

88
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,853
- If you have a collapsed lung.
- But our x-ray vision isn't working.

89
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,324
- You were the front-seat passenger?
- Ungh. Yeah.

90
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,325
You must have
been going pretty fast.

91
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,193
We found out Daniel's mom
might not make it through the night.

92
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,096
- We were trying to get there.
- What do you want for labs?

93
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,601
Trauma panel, type and
cross four, dip her urine.

94
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,673
- What's his mom got?
- Cancer.

95
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,332
Is he all right?

96
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,274
Well, they're still working
on him. I'll go check.

97
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,782
- I'll prep the chest, just in case.
- But don't cut.

98
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,544
- I'll be a resident in two months.
- Wait for the films.

99
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,310
- No sign of head trauma.
- 122/72.

100
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,887
- Abdomen's non-tender.
- Four-centimeter lac.

101
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,149
Neck's clear.

102
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,884
- How's she doing?
- We're waiting on some labs.

103
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,494
Can I wait with her?

104
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,790
- Primary survey's benign.
- HemoCue's 15.1.

105
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,993
You can visit as soon as
we get a few stitches in you.

106
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,729
Simon, Gates, go clear
some patients off the board.

107
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,531
- You sure?
- Not done checking him.

108
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,936
No, I'll finish up here.
Laverne can suture.

109
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,212
Sam, I'm sure Gates
could use an assistant.

110
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,681
How long have you and
Rebecca been together?

111
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,552
Six years.

112
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,928
People keep telling
us to get married.

113
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,259
But who needs a ring, right? We
know how we feel about each other.

114
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,899
I hear that.

115
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,729
- You have someone special?
- Uh, I did.

116
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,735
But she moved.

117
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:49,409
Come on, doc. You find the right
person, you don't let them get away.

118
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,102
Yeah, well, maybe
she wasn't the one.

119
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,045
Four-oh nylon interrupted,
single-layer closure.

120
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,513
- One percent, would that be okay?
- Yep.

121
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,380
Sorry to hear about your mom.

122
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,289
Yeah.

123
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,634
It's open.

124
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,279
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

125
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,617
My job was horrible.

126
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,385
The boss would yell. He'd
be nice, and then he'd yell:

127
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,221
"Jenkins, Jenkins,
get over here."

128
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,956
I mean, if I wasn't sick with the
flu, my hair would fall off from stress.

129
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,600
- So you started drinking silver?
- Colloidal silver.

130
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,033
- I mean, it's like a natural antibiotic.
- It's not a good idea.

131
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,331
Well, I thought my
sinuses would clear up.

132
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,735
I had a date last week...

133
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,468
and this woman actually
thought I was a Blue Man.

134
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,135
Well, you kind of are.

135
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,645
No, I mean, like with the
group. Blue Man Group.

136
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,579
Abby, lacrosse
girl's ready to...

137
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,243
- Wow.
- You see that? I get a lot of wows.

138
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,650
You look like that
guy I saw on <i>Oprah.</i>

139
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,520
- Isn't there something I can do?
- Yeah, quit drinking it.

140
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:16,129
The silver is deposited into your
skin like a tattoo. Nothing can help.

141
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,425
Dr. Morris? Larry's
doing a chest tube.

142
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,295
Give him Solaquin.

143
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,265
- What is that?
- Fading cream.

144
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,803
What Michael Jackson
used. I told him to wait.

145
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,440
Larry is a free spirit.

146
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,168
Now, a little pain is
normal as the tube passes.

147
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,370
- What's he doing?
- I had the same question.

148
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,958
- I couldn't find you.
- Where's the chest x-ray?

149
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,349
Not back yet, but her sats
are down and she lost...

150
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,986
Stop. It could be a contusion.

151
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,019
Take care of the house
and see your mom.

152
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,623
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Another liter of saline.

153
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,625
- And up the oxygen.
- Please, I don't need you here.

154
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,060
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'd never do that. Come on.

155
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,500
- Yo, what's happening?
- Her lung collapsed. Larry, push it.

156
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,969
- Oh, God.
- No, no. This is gonna help.

157
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,709
See? Much better.

158
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,048
Pulse ox is treading up.

159
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,321
Thank you.

160
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,551
Are you all right,
babe? You all right?

161
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,697
Better. Much better.

162
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,662
- I'll be right back, all right?
- Okay.

163
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,893
I'll be right back. I gotta call my
family and let them know where we are.

164
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,905
- Is there a phone I could use?
- Yeah, front desk. I'll show you.

165
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,935
I asked you not to come.

166
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,668
Did you expect me to
pretend this isn't happening?

167
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,007
You could have sent a
card. It's more your style.

168
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,048
You know why you
didn't know I was sick?

169
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,113
- Because you never dug deep.
- That's not true.

170
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,950
If we weren't talking about
who makes the best drinks...

171
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,022
we were talking
about the Bulls game.

172
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,751
You never once asked about me.

173
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,225
Oh, come on. We spent
a lot of time together.

174
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,523
Doing what? Avoiding opening up?

175
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,223
Avoiding getting personal?

176
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,201
Look, I don't think
it was like that.

177
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,634
You're one of those guys
that likes someone on his arm...

178
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:14,042
but the moment they start
opening up their heart, you freeze.

179
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,717
All right, look, I...

180
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:22,120
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- No, you came out of obligation.

181
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,250
So do us both a
favor and get out.

182
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,792
Get out.

183
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:35,060
- So how's it going?
- Oh, pretty good.

184
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,965
Considering Luka moved out.

185
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,301
He what? Why?

186
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,775
I don't know, these past few months,
between my stuff and his dad...

187
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,073
he just needs some
time and space.

188
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,240
- How much space?
- A lot of space.

189
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,907
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,611
I'm trying not to
freak out about it.

191
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,983
I'm sure things will get
back to normal soon.

192
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,023
Why don't we have
dinner tomorrow night?

193
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,161
- That would be nice.
- Okay, good. I'll call you.

194
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,352
Frank...

195
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,659
- here's the chart for the gymnast.
- You forget where to put it?

196
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,233
Out of nowhere and hit us.

197
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,837
No, I told you I was gonna
meet you, but I need another car.

198
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,366
Just wait there. We should
be out of here in an hour.

199
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,242
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

200
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,483
Excuse me. Do you know
where I can get some coffee?

201
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,709
Jumbo Mart.

202
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,496
<i>Being described as a
modern-day Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

203
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,319
- What did Britney do now?
- Jumbo Mart's across the street.

204
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,154
<i>Young couple ran into this jewelry
store and robbed the place at gunpoint.</i>

205
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,627
<i>There's still a lot more questions
than there are answers right now.</i>

206
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,959
<i>This is a very active crime scene.
The police have put up the tape.</i>

207
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,334
You Americans and your guns.
- Scumbag kids.

208
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,369
That's what too many
time-outs gets you.

209
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,667
<i>The owner of this local favorite
to nearby St. Jude's hospital.</i>

210
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,333
<i>Police still are looking
for the pair who got away...</i>

211
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,538
<i>with an estimated $40,000
worth of diamonds...</i>

212
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,207
Sir, if you wanted
coffee, it's that way.

213
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,148
That's okay. I'm good.

214
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,224
- SonoSite's ready.
- That was scary.

215
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,884
You okay?

216
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,691
Yeah. When I made
my call, the news was on.

217
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,995
Something happened downtown.
Jewelry store was robbed or something.

218
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,035
- You saw it on the news?
- Everything looks okay.

219
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,232
Supermarket down the street
got robbed. So did the gas station.

220
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,240
It's the economy.
People are desperate.

221
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,470
- You guys live nearby?
- In Wheaton.

222
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,912
Wheaton? It's nice out
there. All those old houses.

223
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,451
Yeah, I worked my butt off for a
two-bedroom. Fixed up the kitchen.

224
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,623
- He did the roof too.
- I couldn't put a shelf up from IKEA.

225
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,817
Yeah, I wasn't gonna pay 10 grand for
something I could do myself, you know?

226
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,019
Hey, you got a sec?

227
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,393
- What do you need?
- It's about an MVC.

228
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,731
The hit-and-run? COLE:
Yeah, the kid's still up in surgery.

229
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,532
We wanted to know if
he got a license plate.

230
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,471
Uh, find Dr. Brenner.
He worked on him.

231
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,735
Thanks.

232
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,983
You guys all right?

233
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,986
Yeah. Just thinking
about my mom, you know?

234
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,449
I don't know where I should be. I
feel like I need to be here and there.

235
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,029
- Get Surgery.
- I just called. They're closing up.

236
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,824
Shouldn't be long.

237
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,968
- Daniel, please go. WESTON:
Looks like a liver hematoma.

238
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,297
- What's that?
- Some bleeding around the liver.

239
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,701
- Usually heals without surgery.
- All right.

240
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:31,208
Listen, Rebecca's gonna be a
while. So maybe you should go.

241
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,572
I'm the only family
that Rebecca's got.

242
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,339
She's... She's stable.

243
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,180
Take my cell number, okay? Call
me when you get to your mom's.

244
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:44,017
- I'll give you a full update.
- Daniel, listen to the doctor.

245
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,284
Dawn, take him off of
Rebecca's admin forms.

246
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,021
- And you call me, okay? I mean it.
- Thanks, doc.

247
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,461
Here. We need
Rebecca's doctor's info.

248
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:58,298
- Is this it? I've really gotta go.
- Yeah, just sign here and here.

249
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,064
Oh, Sam. They
ordered a splint...

250
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,799
- on your carpal-tunnel lady in 2.
- Got it.

251
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,478
He wouldn't let me leave
if she wasn't okay, right?

252
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,171
Don't worry, Dr. Morris
knows his stuff.

253
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,216
- What you looking at?
- None of your business.

254
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,980
Headhunters? What,
are you leaving us?

255
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,022
Frank, can you get the numbers
to Rush, Mercy and St. Joe's?

256
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,524
You wanna find out who
dumped the meth head in 3?

257
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,093
- No, it's personal.
- Oh, good.

258
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,695
Then find the numbers yourself.

259
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,422
<i>We have an update.</i>

260
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,791
Maybe they caught these guys.

261
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,425
<i>Police have now released
a sketch of the suspects...</i>

262
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,570
<i>in the jewelry heist downtown.</i>

263
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,708
<i>If you have any information,
please call their hotline.</i>

264
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,275
<i>- Again, the owner of the
jewelry store...</i> DAWN: Here.

265
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,844
This is the hospital number in
case you can't get ahold of Dr. Morris.

266
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,278
<i>He is expected to survive.</i>

267
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,940
Good luck.

268
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,234
- What room?
- Trauma 2.

269
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,233
- Full eight units? SAM:
Who's bleeding out?

270
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,803
Woman in 2 took a bad turn.

271
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,802
I want four of FFP and 10-pack
of platelets. Hold an O.R.

272
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,307
- Fourth unit of O-neg's up.
- Pressure down to 60.

273
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,638
- Let's look at the liver again.
- Where are we?

274
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,872
Rebecca? Why is
the tube in her mouth?

275
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,040
- She stopped breathing.
- She's got the platelets swamped there.

276
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,262
We've got persistent
hypotension. Chest is clean.

277
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,811
Whoa.

278
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,449
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong? What's happening?

279
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,956
- Belly's full of blood.
- Must have blown a clot.

280
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,561
- She was all right.
- She was.

281
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,923
We lost the pulse. PEA.

282
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,928
- Compressions.
- Thoracotomy tray.

283
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,395
What are you doing?

284
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,593
We need to open the chest and
clamp the aorta at the diaphragm.

285
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,399
If that works, I can repair
the abdominal injuries.

286
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,575
- Sterile drapes.
- Ten blade.

287
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,144
Come on, baby. Come on.

288
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,507
- Spread them.
- Like this?

289
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,979
Don't let me close them.
That's the ulnar nerve.

290
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,483
- Very cool.
- I got a kid who fell off a unicycle.

291
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,122
I'm teaching. Can
you find a resident?

292
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,281
- Hey.
- What's up, Mommy dearest?

293
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,690
Unicycle boy. A few leg
lacs and a probable fracture.

294
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:05,161
- Pretty uncomfortable.
- I see what the problem is.

295
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,323
Your bicycle's missing a wheel.

296
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,662
Very funny. It hurts.

297
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:13,932
- This is Dr. Gates.
- All right. Can you feel this?

298
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,302
Can you wiggle your toes?
- Argh.

299
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,935
- Why do you ride that thing, anyway?
- I'm into all types of weird stuff.

300
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,115
So is she.

301
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,975
I need a tib-fib
and an ankle, okay?

302
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,610
- We're gonna call your parents.
- No, don't bother them.

303
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,984
My dad's probably
snaking a toilet somewhere.

304
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,126
In order to give you an x-ray
and meds, we need consent.

305
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,387
I'm consenting. Where do I sign?

306
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,827
It's the law. In the meantime,
we'll keep you in this splint, okay?

307
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,058
I'll be right back.

308
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,236
Forty thousand dollars
worth of diamonds.

309
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,564
You know where I'd be
with that kind of dough?

310
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,572
At home, with a big bag of chips,
watching a ginormous flat screen?

311
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,209
Bingo.

312
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,741
What else can you do?

313
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,043
Come on, there's gotta be
something else you can do.

314
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,810
We're gonna try, Daniel.

315
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,820
Aorta's been clamped
for 45 minutes.

316
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,854
She's been given a
massive transfusion.

317
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,188
If she hasn't responded by
now, I don't think we can save her.

318
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,695
She was fine an hour
ago. You said I could go.

319
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,068
We could explore the right chest.
- She's bleeding in the belly.

320
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,829
- Then operate on her belly.
- What about it?

321
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,201
Can't send a woman
without a pulse to the O.R.

322
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,344
- She's young and healthy.
- Listen to him.

323
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,411
You don't know Rebecca.

324
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,013
- Sorry.
- No, don't say you're sorry.

325
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,553
Keep working.

326
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,420
Neela, the guy's mother is
dying. Let's at least give it a try.

327
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,427
We've already done
everything. We really have.

328
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,889
No, you haven't.

329
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,330
Whatever's wrong with
her, you're gonna fix it.

330
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,234
And you're gonna fix it now.

331
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,148
- Close those blinds.
- What are you doing?

332
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,648
You, close those blinds.
- I'll get it.

333
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,614
You stay there.

334
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,051
Get that. What about these?

335
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,814
Daniel, why are you doing this?

336
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,218
What about these windows?

337
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,825
- Cover them.
- Come on, man.

338
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,519
It doesn't need to happen.
You don't need to do this.

339
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,028
- Let's just talk for a minute.
- Get this one.

340
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,689
- Up here.
- There's nothing to...

341
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,732
- Just do it.
- The sheet. Use the sheet.

342
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:26,030
Get up there. MORRIS:
Daniel, look at me. Come here.

343
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:30,040
- Come here just for a second.
- You, come here. Help her.

344
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,837
Okay, okay, okay.

345
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,838
Daniel, look at me. I think
you misunderstood me.

346
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,381
- Listen, I need you to operate.
- Okay, okay.

347
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,052
- Do it now.
- I am.

348
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,448
Now.

349
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,815
Here.

350
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,525
Ladies, come on.
You've gotta hurry up.

351
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,160
Quickly.

352
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:52,465
- Got it. I've got it.
- Let's go. Get down. Operate.

353
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,760
- We haven't got the right supplies here.
- Then get what you need.

354
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,737
- Whoa, what are you doing?
- I'm calling O.R. for supplies.

355
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,998
No, no phones.

356
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,268
- You have to come upstairs with me.
- I'm not leaving this room.

357
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,502
- She has to.
- We don't have a choice.

358
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,549
Fine. Dial.

359
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,681
You do something
stupid, I'm gonna use this.

360
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,119
This is Dr. Rasgotra. I
need a laparotomy tray.

361
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,384
Whatever is going
on, we can work it out.

362
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,721
- No, we can't, man.
- Yes, we can. We can.

363
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,921
I need it right now.
Dawn, prep the belly.

364
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,761
I know you love this
woman, okay? I know you do.

365
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,927
But if you wanna help Rebecca,
we need to take her to the O.R.

366
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,538
You have to let us take her...

367
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,870
Did you hear me? I'm
not leaving this room!

368
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,409
I'm on the news. They
know who I am, all right?

369
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,547
Morris, I need you to assist.

370
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,381
Please, doc. Don't push me.

371
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,775
All right.

372
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,749
Listen, what did you do?

373
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,447
Did you hurt someone?
Did you rob someone?

374
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,320
Let me help.

375
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,756
- The guys from the jewelry store?
- Oh, my God.

376
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,988
Shut up. Shut up.

377
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,258
Everyone needs to focus on Rebecca.
- Okay.

378
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,459
We're gonna do that. But I
need you to settle down, please.

379
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,274
- We're out of masks. DAWN:
I'll get some from next door.

380
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,500
No, stop. Where you
going? Get back here.

381
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,769
Okay, okay.

382
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,039
We need to have masks.
We have to have them.

383
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:16,974
I said forget it.

384
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,845
- All right.
- You're gonna save her.

385
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,818
You're gonna save her right
here. Right now, or no one's leaving.

386
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,585
Okay.

387
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,531
I don't understand why
you're even in Chicago.

388
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,867
Oleg Popov was
speaking at the art institute.

389
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,133
Morphine's on board.

390
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,607
Who's Popov? FATHER: A clown.

391
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,603
You missed your mathlete
competition for a clown?

392
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,112
- Five-oh nylon?
- Go for it.

393
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,944
You're willing to give up
nationals for a Russian clown?

394
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,279
Dad. GATES: Mathlete?

395
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,581
- Sounds serious, huh?
- MIT's already got their eye on this kid.

396
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,124
- Dad, Popov never comes to Chicago.
- I thought you were finished with this.

397
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,627
Didn't tightrope walking across a
football field teach you anything?

398
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,699
- You did not.
- It was so cool.

399
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm gonna get a few stitches in here.
Can you check if his x-rays are ready?

400
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,232
- Sure, I'll check.
- Okay.

401
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,501
Down to the symphysis pubis.
- Okay.

402
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,703
Let's drop an NG to
decompress the stomach.

403
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,179
- Why aren't you operating?
- We don't have everything.

404
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,513
It's okay, all right? We're
prepping for surgery.

405
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,850
What's going on?

406
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:30,922
Thank you, Jacy.

407
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,119
- Are you guys actually gonna op...?
- Yes, we are.

408
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,026
- Do you need some help?
- Just leave the tray.

409
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,196
- Does Crenshaw know about this?
- Yes, he does. Now go.

410
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:22,867
How you feeling?

411
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,236
It didn't go exactly as planned.

412
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:31,111
I had polyps in the
distal sigmoid colon.

413
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,718
They couldn't do a
simple anastomosis.

414
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,749
So that means a colostomy?

415
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,659
No, you can't
call it a colostomy.

416
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,593
They removed my entire colon.

417
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,790
I have a loop ileostomy.

418
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,067
Well, that's not that
bad. It's only temporary.

419
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,571
- It won't last forever.
- It's disgusting.

420
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:01,178
Well, you know, we could
put a little Gucci bag around it.

421
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,407
Make it a little bit more vogue.

422
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:12,315
They said you sat there and
waited through the whole thing.

423
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,359
Yeah, well...

424
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,127
You know me.

425
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,931
Sometimes I'm hardheaded.

426
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,966
You know, what you
said to me earlier...

427
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,303
Yeah, let's talk about it later.

428
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,976
You were right.

429
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,786
I don't go there. I never have.

430
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:46,893
I kind of used what I learned
for patients in my personal life.

431
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:52,388
Don't get too involved.
Don't get too attached.

432
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,298
But I don't want that anymore.

433
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:05,137
Remember that day we
went to see that condo?

434
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,337
I was thinking:

435
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,845
"Why the hell am
I buying a condo?

436
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,149
Pretty soon,
Bettina and I, we...

437
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,519
We could be getting a house."

438
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,484
You never told me that.

439
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,792
I know.

440
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,392
I ignored it...

441
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,236
but that little voice in my
head, it wouldn't go away.

442
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,538
So I'm here.

443
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,575
And not out of obligation,
but because I'm...

444
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:50,856
Because I'm in love.

445
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,921
Okay?

446
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,023
I'm in love with you.

447
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,783
Metz. Elevate the peritoneum.

448
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,390
Like this?

449
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,152
- Does he know what he's doing?
- He's doing fine.

450
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,353
- I don't want a student operating on her.
- I need an assistant.

451
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,000
Well, then you do it.
You're more senior.

452
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:37,328
- No problem.
- Come on, switch it up.

453
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,473
I need exposure in the
right upper quadrant.

454
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,867
Bovie.

455
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:45,301
We were this close.
Everything was gonna be done.

456
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,275
Looks like a bad
hepatic laceration.

457
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,075
We get this house,
friend gets us a loan.

458
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,741
Two years later, payments double.
- Deep instellate.

459
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,912
Came home and found a
foreclosure notice on my door.

460
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,513
I don't know.

461
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,955
Doc, hey, we never
meant to hurt that old guy.

462
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,426
We just wanted to get the rocks,
sell them off, keep the house.

463
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,156
- Guys, look at this.
- What?

464
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,031
Cardiac activity.

465
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,206
- What, is she better? MORRIS:
The heart's beating on its own.

466
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,342
See? I knew it.

467
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,944
You were right. He was right.

468
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,842
Now all you guys need to do...

469
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,279
is finish operating on her so
Rebecca and I can get out of here.

470
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,011
All right? Come on.

471
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,985
We'll, uh...

472
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,284
We'll get a helicopter
or something.

473
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,555
- Something to take us somewhere.
- All we did was open her up.

474
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,497
We haven't repaired anything yet.
- No, it's working.

475
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,298
Right, doc? It's working.
It's working, right?

476
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,465
Yep. Yep, it's working.

477
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,645
If we can fix the liver,
we have a chance.

478
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,811
Then keep going. Because she's
gonna make it. Come on, keep going.

479
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,349
Pick up some needle driver.

480
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,748
You broke both your bones in
your lower leg, your tibia and fibula.

481
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,361
Shoot. I was gonna take
pantomime class next week.

482
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,658
We're gonna take him into Trauma
and do a reduction under fluoro.

483
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:14,925
Uh, what?

484
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,592
They put the bones in
place using x-ray guidance.

485
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,465
- Does it hurt?
- We'll put some good stuff in your IV.

486
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,538
- How about some etomidate?
- Twelve mics.

487
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:27,009
I'll see you. I'm gonna call Charlie and
tell him I need the rest of the day off.

488
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:28,605
My dad doesn't get me.

489
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,682
I'd give my left testicle to
go to clown college in Florida.

490
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,752
- All the greats study there.
- He's just looking out for you.

491
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,412
He doesn't like clowns,
and he doesn't like circuses.

492
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,287
- I feel like he found me on a doorstep.
- Every kid says that at some point.

493
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,191
I don't wanna sit around miserable
all day working for retirement.

494
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,857
Sounds pretty insightful. You must
have given this a lot of thought, huh?

495
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,627
I pay attention. That's all.

496
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,794
All right. Here's
what we're gonna do.

497
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,702
Watch that monitor back
there and look at the x-rays...

498
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,434
while I manipulate
your leg, okay?

499
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,812
- Impressive.
- You got a deck of cards?

500
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,880
Not on me.

501
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,450
I also don't have a
tubular stockinette.

502
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,386
All right, I'll be right back.
Don't juggle any needles.

503
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,059
- I need a suture pack.
- Cut.

504
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,559
- Now the liver's oversewn.
- What are you guys doing?

505
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,790
- Exploratory laparotomy.
- Why aren't you in the O.R.?

506
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,800
It's too busy. All right, let's check
hemostasis and unclamp the aorta.

507
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,734
Okay. There.

508
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,636
- Whoa, whoa. Clamp it.
- What happened? Did you mess up?

509
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,333
- I thought you fixed it. MORRIS:
We're trying, Daniel, okay?

510
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,171
We need more blood. Eight units.

511
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,780
No cardiac activity.
Resuming compressions.

512
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:40,146
- Did her heart stop again?
- It's a retro-hepatic injury.

513
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,651
She's torn the liver off the vena cava.
- What?

514
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,188
- Someone's gotta spell that out for me.
- We need to isolate the liver.

515
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,827
The main blood vessel
from the liver has been torn.

516
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,862
It connects to an even bigger
vein. It's very complicated.

517
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,159
Well, you can do that. Come
on, doc. You can do that.

518
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,565
- Two-oh silk and an SH needle.
- Come on, doc.

519
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,102
Vascular clamp.

520
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,467
All right, gently.

521
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,806
Elevate the left lobe.

522
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,347
How's that?

523
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,955
Come on, you did the
other thing. You can do this.

524
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,787
- I'm trying. Five-oh Prolene.
- Come on, try harder.

525
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,963
You see this thread?

526
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,866
If we can sew the veins back together
and stop the leaks, she will have a...

527
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:39,903
Run, Neela!

528
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,415
You take another
step, I'll shoot you.

529
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,319
You hear me? I'll kill you all.

530
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,126
- Okay, everyone, this way. This way.
- What happened?

531
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,462
We'll explain everything
when you get outside.

532
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,833
- Please, through the doors.
- You in charge? Sergeant Deturno.

533
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,167
- Where are the people who got out?
- Over here.

534
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,936
- Are we gonna get seen?
- Sophie, can you help him out?

535
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,807
- We have shuttle buses.
- Have you called County Dispatch?

536
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,471
Yes. Close us to trauma.

537
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,482
Close us to all paramedic
traffic due to internal disaster.

538
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,278
Dawn was in there. So was Larry.

539
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,719
I want you guys down the hall.
Make sure the patients are cleared.

540
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,983
Tell me about the guy.

541
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,151
He's out of his mind. He thinks
his girlfriend's gonna wake up.

542
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,660
- Who's still in there?
- Neela, Morris and Gates.

543
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,889
They're playing along.

544
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,466
Come through here,
please, and exit to the street.

545
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,796
- Have you seen my son?
- Uh, he's probably outside.

546
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,133
- No, no, I checked. He's not there.
- What room was he in?

547
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,868
- Trauma 1 with Gates.
- Then he's still back there.

548
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,410
- You left my son?
- Sir. Sir.

549
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:50,548
- Sir. Hey. Hold up.
- My kid is back there.

550
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,311
- The police will get him.
- After this loony kills him?

551
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:56,182
- He's got nothing to do with this.
- Sir, listen.

552
00:30:56,388 --> 00:31:00,223
You're putting him in greater
danger. Now, let us do our job.

553
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,795
Come on. I'll take you outside, okay?
- High chromic.

554
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,360
- Where is everyone? MORRIS:
They're evacuating the building.

555
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,560
They probably have the
place surrounded, man.

556
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,935
If you had minded your own business,
everything would've been okay.

557
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:18,043
This is about Rebecca. Don't
do anything you're gonna regret.

558
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,734
A little late for that
now, you think?

559
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,041
What was that?

560
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,711
It's my patient. I
gotta get him upstairs.

561
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,322
No way. No way.

562
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,825
- His leg, it's broke in four places.
- Yeah, that's not my problem, is it?

563
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,021
Look, the kid can't move.
He can't get blood to his foot.

564
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,894
He'll lose his leg.
You want that?

565
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,434
No one is leaving
here till Rebecca's fixed.

566
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,333
You understand me?

567
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,107
Damn it.

568
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,943
Let me take a look at that.

569
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,445
Cut short, right to the knot.
- All right.

570
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,980
What are you doing?

571
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,756
Look, Gates is right.

572
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,761
You want him to be
able to walk, right?

573
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,889
Yeah, don't put this on me, doc. I
just wanna get my girl help, all right?

574
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,765
Daniel, Daniel, he's
a kid who's petrified.

575
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,439
You ever been petrified?

576
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,083
How's the repair
coming, Dr. Rasgotra?

577
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,953
Not bad. I'm just
tying off the bleeders.

578
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,487
Yeah. Heart's filling
well now that it's clamped.

579
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,818
See? We're doing okay.

580
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,154
Let's not get the kid into this.

581
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,531
All right, get her in there.
Out of the way, out of the way.

582
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,399
Sam, we need the
criticals taken care of first.

583
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,869
Okay. I'll be right back
as soon as I can, okay?

584
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,838
Hey, Frank, can you
help me with this?

585
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,534
- Excuse me. FRANK:
Let me through here, guys.

586
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,873
Okay. I'll take it.

587
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,913
Were you inside? What happened?

588
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,675
- Can you move out of the way?
- Do you mind? Excuse us.

589
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,047
Have you guys seen Neela?

590
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,779
- She's inside.
- What do you mean?

591
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,947
She's in trying to
repair a cable injury.

592
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,149
- In the trauma room?
- She told me you knew.

593
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,521
Why would I let her do that?

594
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,424
- He had a gun on her.
- What?

595
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,564
Why don't you fill
him in? Excuse me.

596
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,790
- We need this area cleared.
- Excuse me.

597
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:24,562
- Is there any news?
- No, nothing at all.

598
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,195
If he gets out of this alive, he
can unicycle to Russia for all I care.

599
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,468
If I find out anything, you'll be
the first to know, okay? Excuse me.

600
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,915
Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

601
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,144
<i>Stay behind the barricade.</i>

602
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:47,022
- Hey, you guys can't go back there.
- This guy's good. He's a doctor.

603
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,936
Get him to the
ortho clinic next door.

604
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,087
Thank you.

605
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,456
- It's gonna be okay.
- Hey. You all right?

606
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,399
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good. Glad you're okay.

607
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,226
Go.

608
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,614
Talk.

609
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,784
Hello?

610
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,524
Uh, yes, good, okay.

611
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,763
The blood-bank
tech's in the hall.

612
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:33,136
No, no. Tell him to go.

613
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,603
She needs it, Daniel.

614
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,709
She needs more transfusions.

615
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,608
We'll stay here.
You go. You get it.

616
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,760
Kick it. Kick it down here.

617
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,929
- Is there anything else I can get you?
- Just give me the blood.

618
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,266
We wanna work this out.

619
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,673
- This doesn't have to happen like this.
- Give me the damn blood.

620
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,754
- Unclamp the aorta.
- Okay. There.

621
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,999
Clamping again.

622
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,647
- Hello? DETURNO:
<i>This is Sergeant Deturno.</i>

623
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,188
<i>I'd like to talk to Daniel.</i>

624
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,451
Okay. Hold on.

625
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,187
They wanna talk to you.

626
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:12,366
- Hello?
- Daniel. Sergeant Deturno.

627
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,164
- Yeah, what do you want?
- We wanna help you, Daniel.

628
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,308
If you wanna help,
figure out a way...

629
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,377
to get me and my girl out of
here as soon as she's better.

630
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,638
Then nobody gets
hurt. How about that?

631
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,749
We can't get you anything
until you let me come in and talk.

632
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,543
I don't wanna talk to you.

633
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:32,053
Daniel, this is the hard way.
Let's make this easier, huh?

634
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:35,193
Yeah, yeah, you wanna see
hard? Keep running your yap.

635
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:38,688
Daniel...

636
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,411
- If we could wake her up, we would.
- Shut up.

637
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,211
This sucks, I know.

638
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,547
- I know losing someone...
- We had plans.

639
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,952
We were gonna
get our house back.

640
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,154
We were gonna put
a patio in the yard.

641
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,921
She wanted to plant a garden.

642
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,765
You should say
goodbye to her, Daniel.

643
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,402
It's time to say goodbye.

644
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,673
The sooner you do this,
the sooner she can let go.

645
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,573
- Then you can go see your mom.
- My mom?

646
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,306
She died five years ago.

647
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,282
Pancreatic cancer. I was with
her when she took her final breath.

648
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,753
Okay, okay. So you've
been through this before.

649
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,256
- I get it.
- Doc, I won't do it again.

650
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,951
You don't have a choice, Daniel.

651
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,189
Okay? Because
she is not waking up.

652
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,332
Okay, now, you
have done everything.

653
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,336
Everything that a man would
do for his family, even today.

654
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:58,000
You were trying to get your life back.
I get it. Anyone can understand that.

655
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:03,113
- I never meant to hurt anybody.
- I know, so why start now?

656
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,016
Even if we could get her back...

657
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,317
her brain has been
deprived of so much oxygen...

658
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:18,224
she would be bedridden,
unable to talk or function.

659
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,364
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

660
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,328
Don't say that. - It's true.

661
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,729
Is that what you want?

662
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,666
Or what she would want?

663
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,114
When I stop these
compressions...

664
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,783
she's gonna leave us.

665
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,951
And you'll do what's right.

666
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,890
You remember when we met
at the coffee shop that night?

667
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,397
That wasn't the first
time I'd seen you.

668
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:35,000
The day before, I was
walking down Hill Street...

669
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,335
and I noticed you
going into the bookstore.

670
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:44,244
So I went in and hid behind a
bookshelf and watched you work all day.

671
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:48,182
I remember you were reading
<i>Goodnight Moon</i> to some kids.

672
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,581
And I thought, "How
can I get a girl like that?"

673
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,322
You know?

674
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,534
I'm so s... I tried to fix it.

675
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,901
I tried to make it better.

676
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,135
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

677
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,327
Daniel.

678
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,700
Why don't you hand me the gun?

679
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,170
And I can tell the
police it's over.

680
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,031
I'm sorry for putting
you guys through this.

681
00:41:56,581 --> 00:42:00,018
You tried, doc.
I know you tried.

682
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,846
It's okay.

683
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,382
Just pass it to me.

684
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,740
Daniel.

685
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,076
Daniel?
