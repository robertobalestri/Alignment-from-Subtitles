1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,720
Hey, Sam, have you seen Gates?

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,280
Uh... Who?

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,480
Gates. Is he working today?

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,280
How would I know?

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,520
Broken tib-fib is next in the O.R.,
meniscus guy needs crutches...

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
and hip lady can go to the floor.
- You look different.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,560
Discharge Curtain
3, give him a Vicodin.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,760
I'm with Sam, something's
going on with you.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,400
Well, I kicked ass in my
overnight, what can I say?

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,640
I need you to look at
my bike crash guy in 2.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,480
- Well, call Ortho.
- I'm looking at Ortho.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,040
Not anymore, I am officially
done with my rotation.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,960
The next time you see me, I
will be back on General Surgery.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,720
Big plans for your day off?

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Well, it is a big day.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,000
Is it? What do you mean?

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,320
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm not sure.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,280
If nothing comes up, it'll be my couch,
moo goo gai pan, and "Project Runway."

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,960
- Which is good enough.
- You're not caught up?

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,200
- Oh, it's awesome.
- No, don't tell me.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm gonna watch the repeats.

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,600
Cable guy should be
arriving in two to six hours.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,120
- You don't have cable?
- It went out three weeks ago.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,560
- You look nice.
- So do you.

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,440
We on for lunch? Switch day,
you're supposed to take me.

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,080
Oh, right. After Pete's surgery.

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,160
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,800
I promise, we'll do it soon.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,880
Neela?

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,600
Are you decent?

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm coming in.

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,280
Neela?

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
What is it?

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,960
There was a little mix-up.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,200
Your shift in General Surgery
started 15 minutes ago.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,800
Please, not today.

37
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,560
Come on. Dry
off, put clothes on.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,440
We got a non-versive
waffle-iron waiting for us in the ER.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,120
Ah! Six-two.

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,120
You're getting beat
by an old codger.

41
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,920
Hank, that's your granddaughter.

42
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,360
It's okay, Grandma,
I'm about "to..."

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,880
- Goal!
- I gave you that one.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,000
Hank, calm down. I swear,
he acts like a child sometimes.

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,280
It keeps him young.

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Sarah seems very happy.

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,360
She's with her old
group of "friends..."

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,960
she's doing well in school, even
in math, which is almost a miracle.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,280
You've done a good job, Tony.

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,480
But wait till she's 16, starts
dating, ignores everything you say.

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,560
I'm already looking
into boarding schools.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,040
- Game over. Beat by your grandpa.
- Come on, best two out of three.

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,600
Grandpa?

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
White meat is better. Says who?

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,720
FDA. Ever heard of them?

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
Jump in, Dr. Pratt.

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,840
Start with a cleansing breath.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,759
All right, look, let's
try to relax, okay?

59
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:23,680
Names, Dr. Pratt. Use names.

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,760
All right, look, Ted, Jim...

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,040
My name's not Jim.
Don't call me Jim.

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,520
He's Jack Spratt,
he eats no fat.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,240
That's the exercise.

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Help Mr. Spratt reframe his
position using "I" statements.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,520
- "L" statements?
- Mm-hm.

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,640
I prefer white meat
because it's healthier.

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,760
I prefer dark meat
because it tastes better.

68
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,600
- Okay, look, Mr. Spratt...
- I think I should be Mr. Spratt.

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,240
No, I've committed to this role.

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,360
- Sounds like your phoning it in.
- Excuse me, Mr. De Niro.

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,600
This isn't working.

72
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,520
Are you talking to
me? You talking to me?

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Of course. What's your problem?

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,760
What's your problem?
- What's your problem?

75
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,240
Oop. I warned you.

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,480
- No food in the patient care area.
- Hostile work environment.

77
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,000
- Stop, I can't hear myself think.
- See what he did?

78
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,720
It's a J Code violation to
have food in the desk area.

79
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,600
Come on, Pratt,
help a brother out.

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, show me a brother.

81
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,760
- Hey, how was chief camp?
- Chief camp?

82
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,400
- Did you get a medal, wear a badge?
- No, it was a management seminar.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,440
- Thank you, Morris.
- Mr. Yunji got kicked out of his band.

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,800
They said his blood pressure
medication was making him tone deaf.

85
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,240
He should discuss it
with his cardiologist.

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,960
I accessed the port for our cancer
patient. That line is impossible to flush.

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,320
Yeah. Have Interventional
Radiology take a look.

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,560
- Want a chest x-ray?
- Have IR deal with it.

89
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
- They're the ones who put it in.
- That's easy.

90
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,520
Oh, Frank, you shouldn't have.

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,760
They're for Sam.

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,240
What?

93
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,360
- "What a beautiful..."
- Excuse me.

94
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,880
Sam, you little...
You little minx.

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
Who are they from?

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Um... The lady with the kid
who had that fistful of splinters.

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,520
- Red roses from a woman? You're lying.
- County General.

98
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,760
- Who are the flowers from?
- I'm never telling.

99
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,720
- Okay.
- I tell you about my love life.

100
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Margot, sounded like a
howler monkey in bed.

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,360
Got it. We got a trauma coming in.
Why don't you make yourself useful?

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,400
It's bedsores guy from last week,
isn't it? I saw him giving you that grin.

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,960
Hey. Thought you were leaving.

104
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,040
Scheduling mix-up.
So much for my day off.

105
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,760
- Hey, pretty flowers.
- Oh, thank you.

106
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
New boyfriend?

107
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,760
No.

108
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,040
Hey, Frank, what's
the date today?

109
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
- April 17th.
- Already?

110
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,840
Did you pay your taxes, or are
you exempt because you're "from..."

111
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
across the pond?

112
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Don't. Is this from Abby?

113
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
I kept bugging
her for a picture.

114
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,680
My God, he's getting so big.

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
You should get one of those.
- A husband or a baby?

116
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,920
- Yeah. Neela, over here.

117
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
What you got?

118
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,920
- You're still here?
Don't remind me.

119
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,600
"Sheryl Hawkins, restrained driver.
High-speed Mv C, car rolled three times."

120
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,360
Tachy to 120. Sat, 98.

121
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,880
- Five of MS, positive seatbelt sign.
- Does this mean we can have lunch?

122
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,000
Hi, Sheryl, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
Do we need to call anyone?

123
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,240
My husband. He'll have to
pick up our kids after school.

124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,320
- Number's in my notes.
- It's meatloaf day.

125
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,440
Call her husband and
meet us back here. Go.

126
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,760
One eighteen over 72.

127
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,640
He's got a small forehead lac.

128
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,480
How long you been on the 42s?

129
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,680
It'll be a year, May.

130
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,440
- Hey, is Lou Honeycutt still there?
- Let him do his job.

131
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,800
- And what is this?
- EKG lead, sir.

132
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,040
No, I don't need that.

133
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
We gotta monitor your heart.

134
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
- I'm not going to the hospital.
- You fainted, Grandpa.

135
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,720
I lost my balance.

136
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,920
You could have a condition that
could lead to your heart shutting down.

137
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
I skipped breakfast.
All I need is some food.

138
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,240
Well, he's got a
strong "pulse..."

139
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,560
blood pressure's good,
normal neuro exam.

140
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,440
Are we going in or not?

141
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,320
You ever send a woman roses?

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,360
Only if it's serious.

143
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,440
- Is it serious?
- No.

144
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,040
Well, either he's trying
to get you into bed, or...

145
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,440
He already got you into bed and
he thinks you need the reassurance...

146
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,480
"that" it wasn't just
a one-night stand.

147
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,280
- Okay. That's what I thought.
- Heh.

148
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,920
Hold up, I'll be right back.

149
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,840
Hey.

150
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,080
Hey, I've been calling you.

151
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,480
Yeah, I'm sorry, things
have been a little crazy.

152
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,560
I left you messages.
Everything all right?

153
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, just work.

154
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,360
I'm running late, and I'm guessing
you should be inside saving lives.

155
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,280
- I'm waiting on a paramedic run.
- There you go.

156
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,920
Hey, look, you wanna
grab some coffee later or...?

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
I'm sorry, I have to go.

158
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,880
I was running late for my
art history class at UIC...

159
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,800
when this guy cut me off.

160
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,200
You're a professor?

161
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Freshman.

162
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,520
College is a little difficult...

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,200
"when" you're pregnant
right out of high school.

164
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,960
Four kids, 23 years
later, here I am.

165
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,640
Your children must be proud.

166
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Yeah.

167
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,160
My son, Chris, is a sophomore.

168
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,280
He loves the fact that
his mother's "fresh..."

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,080
Sheryl, everything okay?

170
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,840
- A little woozy.
- What's wrong?

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,840
She's tachy with a dropping
crit and we're standing around.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
One-twelve, not that bad.

173
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,600
Well, it's too fast,
considering she's so calm.

174
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,120
We did that five minutes
ago. Ultrasound was fine.

175
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,200
Aorta seems a
little wide, doesn't it?

176
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,400
- You're hallucinating.
- See for yourself.

177
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,040
Where?

178
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,680
You were up all night,
you start imagining things.

179
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,040
No, it's subtle, but it's there.

180
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,520
With a rupture,
she'd be "dead..."

181
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,600
but a dissection with a slow leak...
- Dead?

182
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,240
Don't listen to her.

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,760
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

184
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,600
Morris, they need you in 2.

185
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay, she's stable.

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,400
Lily will stay
and monitor her...

187
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,600
while you grab a cup of
coffee, or a nap or something.

188
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,360
Abdominal CT
with a contrast now.

189
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,560
If they make you wait more than half
an hour, bring her straight to the O.R.

190
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
Hey, are you okay?

191
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,200
Something's not right.

192
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
What the hell?

193
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,520
I read a study where
smelling one's "breath..."

194
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,880
you can tell what's
missing in their diet.

195
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,680
Well, stop it.

196
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,040
Make sure they're
getting serial crits on her.

197
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,560
Then we can go get a coffee.

198
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,600
- Why so persistent?
- No reason.

199
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
Neela, we need you for
a trauma consult here.

200
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,520
And check co-ags too.
And stop hitting on me.

201
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,760
- I don't need oxygen.
It's just a precaution.

202
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,800
- Hank, for God sake.
- You're making this harder on everyone.

203
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,440
I thought you were off.
- This is Sarah's grandfather.

204
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
- Spending the day together.
- Pulse ox, 98.

205
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Fix her.

206
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,760
Sometimes, you can't fix
people if they're technically...

207
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,840
Shut up! Go away.

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,080
Why are you even here?
We don't want you here.

209
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,160
She doesn't want you
here. We don't want you!

210
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,720
Hello, sir, I'm
Dr. Rasgotra from Surgery.

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,040
Ow. I'm sorry,
it's the last one.

212
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,560
Looks like he's afib at 130.

213
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,960
Okay, there's an electrical
problem in the heart.

214
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,560
Causing a fast irregular pulse.

215
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,720
- You said his pulse was normal.
- It's possible to go out of afib.

216
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,720
We'll give medicine to slow the heart
and thin the blood to reduce the risk.

217
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,280
Twenty of dope?
- Yeah.

218
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,160
Neela, pressure's
dropping in here.

219
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Go.

220
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,400
The head trauma was minor, all
the problems seem to be cardiac.

221
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,680
Thank you for your help.

222
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,040
Once you give me the
medicine, I can go home?

223
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,440
In a day or two. We gotta make
sure you didn't have a heart attack.

224
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Sarah.

225
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,080
Look, this is very common.

226
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,280
- There's treatments that will fix him.
- Kathy's uncle died from a heart attack.

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
I know this looks scary, but
we're gonna be extra careful, okay?

228
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,000
- Okay?
- Okay.

229
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,760
- Six thousand heparin?
- Start a drip at 1400 an hour.

230
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,080
Heart rate's at 80.
You feeling better?

231
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,440
I guess.
- I'm gonna order a telebed, all right?

232
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,720
X- rays for Martin Sinula.

233
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,800
- This is Hank Riley.
- Sorry.

234
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
I got it. Your film's cooking.

235
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,880
Thanks, Sam.

236
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,000
- You get a special delivery?
- No. Uh, yes.

237
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,840
Thank you.

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,760
Wanna go ahead and
open your mouth for me?

239
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,360
Okay, good, now close.

240
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,840
- Blank films?
- Go ahead and open your eyes, sir.

241
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
No film. I have
a digital camera.

242
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,080
His head CT was normal.

243
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,960
Let's go see if
those labs are back.

244
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,520
- Sit tight, Mr. Sinula.
I'd rather lie down.

245
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,960
A bad concussion?

246
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,520
Fractured radius and ulna.

247
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,480
- Femoral head too.
- Yeah, and look at this.

248
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,680
Compression fractures of T12, L4
and 5, all in different stages of healing.

249
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,960
That's never good.

250
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,240
Your signature, please.

251
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
What is this?

252
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,840
I'm filing a grievance against
Dr. Morris and his aftershave.

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,520
- What's with you
two? I think it's love.

254
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,800
Have you smelled him? He's
like a violation of the Clean Air Act.

255
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
People in glass houses, Frank.

256
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,360
Hey, did you get my
labs back on Exam 2?

257
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,320
The Chem-20 machine
is down for an hour.

258
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,480
The Radiology Attending wants
you to call about the MRI in 3.

259
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,160
- Bettina?
- Some guy named Cohen.

260
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Your squeeze
isn't working today.

261
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,400
I saw her walk in. And
don't say "squeeze," Frank.

262
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,920
So shoot the messenger. Oh.

263
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,520
That kid's been loitering a good
hour. The son of your broken bone guy.

264
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,280
- I got it.
- Thanks.

265
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,360
Oh, and another thing.
Golden boy called.

266
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,040
His flight was canceled,
he won't be in until tonight.

267
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,280
Brenner? He was at a
conference in South Bend.

268
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,280
If by conference, you mean fashion
show, and by South Bend, you mean Milan.

269
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,200
- I'm Dr. Pratt.
- Nick.

270
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,400
How's my dad?

271
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,080
Well, he's got multiple
fractures and a broken back.

272
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
That's pretty bad.

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,520
- Is your mom around?
- No, it's just the two of us.

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,440
Okay, would you have any
relatives that live nearby?

275
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,760
My aunt.

276
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,440
- Do you mind if we give her a call?
- I don't have her number on me, "so..."

277
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Can you get it?

278
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,240
Come on, we'll walk you over.

279
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
You know of anyone who
might wanna hurt your dad?

280
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,640
Um, no.

281
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,680
He ever talk about
anybody bothering him?

282
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,960
Like at work maybe?

283
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,160
He lost his job
about a month ago.

284
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
- What about drugs?
- What?

285
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,800
His injuries are
consistent with violence.

286
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,520
Like somebody's
been hitting him.

287
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,200
- Yeah, if he owed somebody...
- My dad's not like that.

288
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,280
Can I see him now?

289
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,640
We're trying to help you.
- I'm sure you are.

290
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,440
Do you know who called 911?

291
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,640
I don't know, I was at school.

292
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,840
So everything was
fine before you left?

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,880
Yeah, fine. He was fine and
now his arms are all busted, okay?

294
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,080
I don't get it either.

295
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
Go in. He's in there.

296
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,680
We never said anything about
his dad's arms being broken.

297
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,520
Dr. Gates?

298
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,480
I hung a second
liter, I need Regulan.

299
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,920
All right, start with 10.
- Oh, God.

300
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,840
- Oh, my God.
- Take it easy, Hank.

301
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,640
- Any belly pain? All over.

302
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,320
Open up the saline, he
needs an abdominal CT.

303
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,240
- What's going on?
- It's possible that...

304
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,760
- Dr. Morris, what's happening?
- With afib, you get a clot in the heart.

305
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,880
A piece can break, travel to the belly,
block the blood supply to his intestines.

306
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,816
- I need something.
- Four of Morphine.

307
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,040
We should start with
two. Pressure's borderline.

308
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,960
- Lf we open up...
- Listen to the doctor.

309
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,200
Get him on a monitor. I want
him in the scanner in five minutes.

310
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,320
Don't worry, sweetie.
Mommy's gonna be fine.

311
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,840
I'll see you when I wake up.

312
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,480
Bye. I love you.

313
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,840
Thank you.

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,160
I really needed to
hear their voices.

315
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,560
Lucy, my 5-year-old,
is very worried.

316
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,840
You also have a 5-year old?

317
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,800
It was a surprise. A great
surprise, but a surprise.

318
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,400
Well, Lucy has
nothing to worry about.

319
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,560
You're getting the best surgeon
County has to offer, okay?

320
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,680
- Someone thinks very highly
of herself. I was referring to you.

321
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,400
Scrub in. You're
first assistant.

322
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,520
I've been awake for,
like, over 30 hours.

323
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,480
I'll let you do
the aortic repair.

324
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,560
How many residents
get that opportunity?

325
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,800
None. Neela, you have to do it.

326
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,400
Sweet. What a great way to
spend our last case together.

327
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,400
You're only going to Pedes
Surgery. I'll still see you.

328
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,040
Actually, I'm going
to Pedes ICU.

329
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,440
- What? Doing a non-surgical rotation?
- I wanted to talk to you about...

330
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,960
You're gonna spend the whole month
dialing dopamine and weighing diapers.

331
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,600
- You're letting him do this?
- It's his call.

332
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,320
- Well, that's crap. You had to sign off.
- Neela, I...

333
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,360
You only have five years here.
You need to make every month count.

334
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
You know I'm right.

335
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay, let's talk about this
later. I'll see you inside.

336
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,440
- Have you seen my case of Groovitas?
- I don't know, ask Frank.

337
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,040
No, that's exactly
what he wants me to do.

338
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,000
We agreed, no food on the floor.

339
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
Groovitas is not food,
it's a liquid life force.

340
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,600
Have my first can at the start of my
shift, second one midway through my shift.

341
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,440
Uhhh. I can't do this. I can't.

342
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,800
I cannot work under
these conditions.

343
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,360
That's it. This is war.

344
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,920
What great war
wasn't fought with tape?

345
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,720
I don't know. Maybe
you misdialed.

346
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,280
I called twice, both times it was
wrong. So do you have an aunt or not?

347
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,320
Look, all you're doing is
asking stupid questions.

348
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,520
- So fix him up and let us go home!
- That is not gonna happen soon.

349
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,080
His x-rays show he's been beaten.
We need to figure out who's doing this.

350
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,120
You don't know what
you're talking about.

351
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,440
- When you fight, does it get physical?
- Sam.

352
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,080
- Do you lose temper, throw punches?
- We don't fight.

353
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,896
Come on, now.

354
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,960
It's you that's hurting
your dad, isn't it?

355
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,120
Just wait. Stupid bitch.

356
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,760
- Hey, what the hell was that?
- I'm just doing my job.

357
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
By berating the kid in
the middle of the ER.

358
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,880
Something's going on. I'm
trying to figure what the story is.

359
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,440
You do not storm into the
hallway making accusations.

360
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,760
If you have a problem,
you discuss it calmly.

361
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,760
- Or just run it by me.
- Somebody has to take the initiative.

362
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,640
What's that supposed to mean?

363
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,320
While you moved on to the next
patient, I'm the one who's in the trenches.

364
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,920
I deal with the family...

365
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,440
follow up to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

366
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,880
And now, I'm the one trying to
figure out what's wrong with this guy.

367
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,760
You learn that in chief camp?
Might wanna ask for your money back.

368
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,600
All right, back to work.

369
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,720
Mind if I sit down?

370
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,440
First of all, Nurse Taggart,
she had no right to accuse you.

371
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,760
She overstepped her
bounds and I'm sorry.

372
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,800
But some of what you told
us, it just doesn't add up.

373
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,440
Look, the last thing
any of us want...

374
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,960
is for your dad to come back here
in a month with more broken bones.

375
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,040
- Lf you know anyone who could have...
- Look, no one hit him.

376
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,560
You know that for a fact?

377
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,440
Yeah. He fell in
the kitchen, all right?

378
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,360
- I'm the one who called 911.
- Paramedics said it was anonymous.

379
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,240
Yeah, well, I disguised my
voice, tried to sound older.

380
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,520
Why would you do that?

381
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,760
Okay, about two years ago,
my dad was in a car accident...

382
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,320
and they made me
stay with a foster family.

383
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,120
I'm not going again.

384
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,200
So there's no aunt.

385
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,720
I was hoping if you thought I had
someone you'd just leave me alone.

386
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,520
And you say your dad was
just standing there and then fell?

387
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,840
Yeah.

388
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,280
- You gotta give me something more.
- Look, I don't know, all right?

389
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,120
I guess he has been
acting kind of weird lately.

390
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,480
He's fallen a couple of times.

391
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,920
Today was definitely the worst.

392
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Look, he was making a
sandwich in the kitchen...

393
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,560
I hear a thud, I look
over and he's on the floor.

394
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,200
Just let me run a few more tests
and see what I can come up with.

395
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,640
Hey, wait a second.

396
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,040
You're not gonna
snitch to Social Services?

397
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,840
Let's just see what I can figure
out about your dad first, okay?

398
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,120
You had to tube him?
- Dropped his sats in Radiology.

399
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
- What are you talking about?
- We're helping your husband breathe.

400
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,560
- They read the scan?
- Big clot in the SMA.

401
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,760
Hank? Hank?
- No, we had to sedate him for the CT.

402
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,920
The scan shows a large clot blocking
the main artery to his intestines.

403
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,600
- What do you do?
- We need to...

404
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,160
Dr. Morris?

405
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,320
We need to restore blood flow to
his bowels. That means surgery.

406
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,120
- Surgery? Today?
- Not necessarily.

407
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,760
What about TPA?

408
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,000
No, I don't think that's
the best option here.

409
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,840
What's TPA?

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,560
It's a clot-busting
medicine that could help.

411
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,200
But if it doesn't, we've
delayed an inevitable operation.

412
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,040
That could cause a stroke or MI.

413
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,360
Surgery is the best option here.

414
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,520
If that's what you think.

415
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,160
Page Neela.
- I want a hematology consult too.

416
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
- You are wasting time.
- Not if it prevents...

417
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
Stop it. Just stop.

418
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,800
I want co-ags, serial crits and
neurovascular checks q-hour.

419
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,360
- Got it.
- And stay on the vent.

420
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,400
- Acidosis is the last thing she needs.
- Got it.

421
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,760
Why neurovascular checks?

422
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,920
To make sure she's perfusing
her extremities distal to the graft.

423
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,840
Still haven't forgotten what you said
about Pedes. I'll talk to Lucien soon.

424
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,760
- That's not necessary.
- The Pedes ward.

425
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,640
- Sabotage your career.
- He's not...

426
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,720
You need 10 months
of surgical electives.

427
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,040
- There isn't time to fool around.
- It's okay.

428
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,440
No, it's not.

429
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,240
You won't graduate on time.

430
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,800
When you're looking for
jobs, you'll be behind...

431
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm not taking
it as an elective.

432
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm switching specialties.

433
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,920
What are you talking about?

434
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,040
I don't wanna be a surgeon.

435
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,480
What did he say to you?

436
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,840
Dr. Dubenko's been
very supportive about this.

437
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,320
I told him I would work with
you, mentor you, and for what?

438
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,520
So he could eventually
squeeze you out.

439
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,120
Damn, it's the ER.

440
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,480
Stay here and call me
with Sheryl's next crit.

441
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,000
- Don't worry, I'll handle this.
- I'm not worried.

442
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,640
Harold Zelinsky, you
will be a great surgeon.

443
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,520
You're supposed to be. I'm not gonna
let one person get in the way of that.

444
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,280
- Is that for Hank?
- Yeah.

445
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,240
His K's 3.2, so Morris
wants 40 in the bag.

446
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,320
You okay?

447
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah, just, he's not the
best surgical "candidate..."

448
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
"but" I can't get
Becky to listen to me.

449
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,400
Well, you know what your problem is.
You don't know how to talk to women.

450
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,520
- Yeah, that's my problem.
- Mm-hm.

451
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,400
Well, I'd teach you, but it's
gonna take a really long time.

452
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,280
I'll put this up.

453
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,160
Onset of pain was an hour ago.

454
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,080
He's infarcting everything from the
duodenum to the transverse colon.

455
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,040
- We have to correct this.
- With surgery?

456
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,720
Well, we were discussing
TPA as an alternative.

457
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm talking about local TPA.

458
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,000
Well, it's a good
idea in theory.

459
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
It might not work?

460
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,880
And we would lose valuable time.

461
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,280
Mrs. Riley, if we get Radiology
here, you can get another opinion.

462
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,400
If they have a good record with TPA with
catheter it might be worth considering.

463
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,160
But if we wait too long and his
bowel dies, he's at risk for sepsis.

464
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
What's sepsis?

465
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's an infection.

466
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,640
- I just wanna do what's best for Hank.
- Why don't we talk to Radiology?

467
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,520
- Enough, why won't you listen?
- Surgery is not the best...

468
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,120
You'll never change. You can't
ever let someone else be right.

469
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,320
Let's do a liter of saline
an hour for two hours.

470
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,200
- Hey, Dr. Pratt.
- Hey.

471
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Any news?

472
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,920
His hormone's causing too
much calcium in his blood.

473
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,560
- That made his bones break.
- His bones are brittle.

474
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,360
It doesn't take
much to fracture.

475
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,000
- This is just gonna keep happening?
- No.

476
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,400
He can have surgery
to remove some glands...

477
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,360
and his bones will
be strong again.

478
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,080
- How long is he gonna be in the hospital?
- About a week.

479
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,600
I really don't wanna
stay with a foster family.

480
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,560
All right, tell me something.

481
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,160
How do you get to school?

482
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,000
My friend's mom.
She picks me up.

483
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,880
- What do you do after school?
- Bus tables at a diner.

484
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,320
Get home around 7.

485
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,920
You could take care of yourself
while your dad is in the hospital.

486
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Seriously?

487
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,320
What about the social worker?

488
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,640
As long as you come in every day
and visit your dad and check in with me...

489
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,400
"I'll" take care of
the social worker.

490
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,400
- Thanks, Dr. Pratt.
- No problem.

491
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,840
Hey, what's going on
with Sarah's granddad?

492
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,840
- Eh. Could be better.
- All right, well, keep me posted.

493
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,880
I hope you're right about this.

494
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,080
Me too.

495
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,880
Sorry to hear about Julia.

496
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,120
Oh, thanks. I'm fine.

497
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,120
Seems that way.

498
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,040
Julia's plane hasn't landed in Bangkok
and you've already moved on to Sam.

499
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
Actually, she went to Nepal.

500
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,120
Whatever.

501
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,000
- What are you, jealous?
- Please.

502
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,160
- You go from relationship to relationship.
- Lf it doesn't work out, I move on.

503
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,880
Yeah, well, think about
someone other than yourself.

504
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
What does that mean?

505
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,000
- Sarah, maybe.
- You wanna go there?

506
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,480
You would rather be with the
wrong person than be on your own.

507
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,440
In the wake of these failed relationships,
it's a girl in need of stability.

508
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,240
I give stability. I help with her homework.
She can talk to me about anything.

509
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,800
About how there's a different
woman in your bed every month.

510
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,160
Mrs. Riley. The
surgical consent forms.

511
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,920
Before you sign anything,
please read it carefully...

512
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,160
and understand all the risks
involved with Hank's surgery.

513
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,480
I, "uh..." I'm not sure.

514
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,120
Well, there are always
potential complications.

515
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,000
This says brain damage,
death. You said...

516
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Well, right now, the benefits
of surgery outweigh the risks.

517
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,800
But he could die,
this says he could die.

518
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
No, no, there's
gotta be a better way.

519
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,160
This is not how we were
supposed to spend the day.

520
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,240
We were supposed to be
out with our granddaughter.

521
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Not stuck in this
godforsaken hospital.

522
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,840
I know it's a lot to absorb.

523
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
Maybe you were right.

524
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,360
Do the TPA thing, then
he won't need surgery.

525
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,840
Hank should have the surgery.

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,920
You said it wasn't
necessary. You said...

527
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,320
Becky, Dr. Rasgotra
is an excellent surgeon.

528
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,040
If she and Dr. Morris recommend
this, then we go for it and we trust them.

529
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,440
We'll all do everything we can
to make sure this turns out right.

530
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Okay?

531
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,760
More traction on the pancreas.

532
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,440
- Where do we access
the SMA? Neela?

533
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,640
Neela, course the artery.

534
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Neela.

535
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,160
Inferior to the uncinate process,
superior to the duodenum.

536
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Exactly.

537
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,800
Vessel loops, help
me get distal control.

538
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,240
Oh, crap. Lap pads.

539
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,680
- Suction. Systolic down to 90.

540
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,600
Hang another unit. I can't
see a damn thing in here.

541
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,920
Did we nick the IVC?

542
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,840
We sheered some
venous tributaries.

543
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,400
Start with hematocrit 5-0
protein on a C-1 needle...

544
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,480
and cut into the
vessel wall. Let's go.

545
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,520
Was I acting crazy?

546
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,720
It was the calcium
talking, but no worries.

547
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,880
So when I get home, Nicky has
to wait on me hand and foot, right?

548
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,160
It couldn't hurt, just
to be on the safe side.

549
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,240
Yeah, sure, of course.

550
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Right after school.

551
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,600
- I just gotta be at work by 4.
- All right.

552
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,200
- Thanks again.
- You got it.

553
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,680
Never have I been
so happy to be wrong.

554
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,200
Sometimes go with your gut...

555
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,960
other times, you gotta
force yourself to be objective.

556
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,520
Yeah, I should've slowed down.

557
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,040
Yeah, and I could've taken
a few cleansing breaths.

558
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,520
I'm taking this new
management course.

559
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,200
So how's that going for you?

560
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,840
Well, I'm working
on conflict resolution.

561
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,360
So you got a few
weeks to go, huh?

562
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,280
Stop breathing so loud.

563
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,480
- Stop tapping your pen.
- Mouth-breather.

564
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,000
- Pen-tapping garden gnome.
- Garden gnome?

565
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,960
All right, guys,
guys, come on, now.

566
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,000
All right, wait, look.

567
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,680
Archie, Frank, just
tell me what's wrong.

568
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,600
- Morris is an idiot.
- One at a time.

569
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,520
- Frank's a hypocrite.
- Okay, look.

570
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,080
Starting your
sentences with "I feel."

571
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,560
- I feel like Frank is a big, fat
hypocrite. That's not what I meant.

572
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,280
I feel hurt.

573
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,600
Because Archie had a party
and he invited everyone but me.

574
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,680
That's very good, Frank.

575
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,920
Can I go again?

576
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
I feel...

577
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,360
like Frank is hypocritical, because
he told me he hated sushi and karaoke.

578
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,040
I didn't think you'd wanna go.

579
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
I could've grabbed a
burger on the way over there.

580
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,000
- What about the karaoke?
- I don't wanna do it.

581
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,680
I don't mind watching you
make an ass out of yourself.

582
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,120
I'm sorry. I'm so...

583
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,480
Come here, you
big lug. I'm sorry.

584
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,320
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

585
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

586
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,400
Keep his fluids at 125
and CBC in an hour.

587
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Hey.

588
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,840
- Surgery is over, Hank.
- We got the clot out.

589
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,480
Neela. Can we talk?

590
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,240
All right, I'll buy you lunch.
I'll meet you in recovery.

591
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Whatever you want.

592
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,200
I have 52 cents.

593
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
I haven't spoken
to Lucien either...

594
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,080
It was my decision to leave.
Lucien had nothing to do with it.

595
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,200
- What?
- I'm not cut out for surgery.

596
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,600
- Of course, you are, you...
- No, listen, I'm not.

597
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,640
I see how much you've given up.

598
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,560
And I admire that,
but I wanna have a life.

599
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,520
Harold.

600
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,760
I don't wanna end
up alone. No offense.

601
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,760
Oh, come on, you're young.

602
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,120
By the time I finish
my residency, I'll be 26.

603
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,120
If I wanna do a fellowship,
I won't be done until I'm 29.

604
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,680
Twenty-nine, Neela. You might
as well just put a bullet in my head.

605
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
You're over-stressed,
you just need a break.

606
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,480
Neela, it's over.

607
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,360
Was I not a good teacher?
Did we not spend time together?

608
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,040
We both did our best.

609
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,880
Well, was it something
I said or didn't say?

610
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,160
It's not you, Neela.

611
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
It's me.

612
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,920
So you think they can do the
pull-through at the same time?

613
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,760
They do everything they can.

614
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,320
- Just give me one minute.
- But it's a real possibility.

615
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,600
I see.

616
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,240
- Hey.
- Hey, Greg.

617
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,880
I didn't know you were on today.

618
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm not, I'm just going over a case here
with Grant. You know each other, right?

619
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,640
- Grant Hayward. Oncology.
- Yeah, I've seen you around.

620
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,440
What were you talking about?
That Wilms kid we scanned?

621
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,760
No.

622
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,080
It's a crazy adrenal tumor. Took
up the whole abdominal cavity.

623
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,080
We're talking about me, Greg.

624
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,080
- You're not allergic to roses, are you?
- No.

625
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,160
These are really beautiful.
And kind of embarrassing.

626
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
I had a good time, I
wanted to let you know.

627
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,560
Yeah, well, I heard that the
other night, loud and clear.

628
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,880
No, you know, I like you.
You know, it's not just about...

629
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,320
- Keeping a full dance card?
- Right, it's not just about that.

630
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,160
Shoot. I was gonna use you and
abuse you and then throw you out.

631
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,600
Why would you do that?

632
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,400
Doctors have been doing that to
nurses for years. It's karmic retribution.

633
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,800
You want me to play
nurse? I'll try anything once.

634
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,800
- Hey, Archie.
- Hi, Archie.

635
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,400
Sam, I figured it out.

636
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,320
You're sending them
to yourself, right?

637
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,120
- You got me.
- Ha!

638
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,400
Good night, guys.

639
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,920
No.

640
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,800
Hey.

641
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,960
Everything okay?

642
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,920
Last weekend, my college roommate
had a baby shower for her third kid.

643
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,720
Who does that?

644
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,800
I don't know, somebody
desperate for attention.

645
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,200
Maybe Sheryl had it right.

646
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,240
I should have popped out four
kids and then gone to med school.

647
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,560
Kids? You want four kids?

648
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,280
Oh, I don't even know if I want kids,
but if I did, I couldn't have them now.

649
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,400
I don't have time to
do laundry, have sex...

650
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,760
Wait, meet someone,
then have sex.

651
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,200
You could meet someone.

652
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,080
You know, I turned down a
date last week so I could sleep.

653
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,560
The closest thing I have to a personal
relationship is Harold Zelinsky...

654
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,360
a 19-year-old intern,
and he just dumped me.

655
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,400
You have a personal
relationship with me, right?

656
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,640
We're friends.

657
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,480
You know what? Go
home. You're tired.

658
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm 31 today.

659
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,800
It's your birthday?

660
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,360
Oh, Neela, I'm
sorry. I didn't realize.

661
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,200
Oh, don't worry, nobody did.

662
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,760
Here.

663
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,960
Happy birthday.

664
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm sorry I don't have a candle.

665
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,120
Thank you.

666
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,360
No, don't eat it. That's
disgust... That's disgusting.

667
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,640
It's been out since
morning. Spit that out.

668
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,480
God. I can't do this.

669
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,840
You know, I fell asleep in
the shower this morning and...

670
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Well, it doesn't matter.

671
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,880
But I realized, I'm going
through life as if everything's okay.

672
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,480
But it's not.

673
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
Come on.

674
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,400
Well, what are you doing?

675
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,000
Pity party's over.

676
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,440
- Here. What do you see?
- A happy family...

677
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,440
I see a mom who was this
close to dying from a torn aorta.

678
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,080
You made a critical diagnosis...

679
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,000
and performed a flawless
anastomosis of a bifemoral y-graft.

680
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,880
And in there...

681
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
I see a grandfather who could
have died from an ischemic bowel.

682
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,720
Thanks to you, he'll be
eating filet mignon soon.

683
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
- Yeah, but...
- I don't "care..."

684
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,480
how many babies people have
or how many dates you miss.

685
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,960
Very few people could have
done what you did today.

686
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,000
Hey.

687
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,480
You have a gift, Neela.

688
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,680
You have a gift.

689
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,040
The minute you start comparing yourself
to others is the minute that you forget...

690
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,680
you're doing exactly
what you were meant to do.

691
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,000
Your shift ended 15 minutes
ago, you should go home.

692
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,200
You look like hell.

693
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,920
Will he be able to
walk his horses?

694
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,720
For shorter distances
to start with, but yes.

695
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,760
Good. He loves that.

696
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,560
Maybe lay off the air
hockey for a little while.

697
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,160
He kept beating me, anyway.

698
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Thanks, Neela.

699
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,920
Sure thing.

700
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,520
I get a colonoscopy,
and every year, it's fine.

701
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,560
I guess I was starting to believe
that it wasn't gonna happen.

702
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,960
Which is ridiculous, because in my
family it's not a question of if, but when.

703
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,320
If you get the surgery, you'll have
no chance of getting colon cancer.

704
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,440
So you'll be okay,
everything will be fine.

705
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,760
Until I develop a post-op
desmoid or hepatablastoma.

706
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,120
- Or thyroid cancer.
- Oh, you don't know that.

707
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,480
I was born with a defective
tumor-suppressor gene.

708
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,880
Colon cancer is
just the beginning.

709
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,240
Why didn't you tell me?

710
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,880
You showed your hand.

711
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,040
- I knew you weren't cut out for this.
- I can handle it.

712
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,840
Really? You wanna
change my colostomy bag?

713
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,880
That's touching,
but I don't think so.

714
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,040
Look, maybe in the past...

715
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,400
You weren't a hundred percent
committed when things were easy.

716
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,200
So don't try to tell me now all of
a sudden that you can handle it.

717
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,960
- I don't need your pity.
- It's not pity.

718
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,960
You shouldn't go
through this alone.

719
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,760
It was my choice to
end our relationship.

720
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,200
You don't have to call,
don't have to check on me.

721
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,040
- This is not your problem, Greg.
- Bettina.

722
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,600
I'm letting you off the hook.

723
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,880
I got you some food. I figured you and
Sarah must be hungry for dinner, huh?

724
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,520
Oh, thank you.

725
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,040
Listen, Hank is gonna
be here for a week.

726
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,400
So until then, I think Sarah would
love it if you would stay with us.

727
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,280
Thank you, that's very generous.

728
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,840
I'm sorry for how I treated you.

729
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,240
It's been a stressful day.

730
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,480
Not just today.

731
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,760
I remember the
first time I met you.

732
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,520
You were this messed-up vet back from
the war running around with my daughter.

733
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,800
Yes, I was.

734
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,200
Meg used to say you
changed, that you grew up...

735
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,880
"but" I didn't
believe it, not really.

736
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,200
Until today.

737
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,200
Thank you.

738
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,960
- How's he doing?
- Very well.

739
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,360
When we restored the blood
supply to his intestines they pinked up.

740
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,120
- That's a good sign.
- Thank you, Dr. Rasgotra.

741
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Well, I'm about to go off duty,
so I'll check on him first thing.

742
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,840
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

743
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,240
Listen, about what you
said, me dating Sam.

744
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,600
Yeah, um, about that.

745
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,680
I said some awful
things, and I'm sorry.

746
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,080
To say I'm sleep-deprived would
be a massive understatement...

747
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,480
so I would just like to blame it on the
frontal lobe malfunction and call it a day.

748
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,520
- Lf it's okay with you.
- Sure.

749
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,200
Hey, Mayday.

750
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,200
Happy birthday.

751
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
Thank you.

752
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,320
Neela Rasgotra.

753
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,520
Oh, I know, I'm sorry.

754
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,520
And I was stuck at work.

755
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,080
Well, can they come tomorrow?

756
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,280
Well, how hard is
it to hook up cable?

757
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,760
Three weeks?

758
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,000
Well, I'll leave a
key under the mat.

759
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,800
Yes, I'm serious.

760
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,160
Look, I'm a doctor.

761
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,360
And I'm single. All I
have is "Project Runway."

762
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,640
Hello?

763
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,760
Hello?

764
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
