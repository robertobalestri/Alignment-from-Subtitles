1
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,906
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,907
You did this, you selfish
bitch. So you live with that.

3
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,004
Listen, I talked to the
guys at Hopkins and

4
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:12,979
we're trying to get
you in the IGF-1 trial.

5
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,877
- IGF-1, what's that?
- Insulin-like growth factor.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,627
Could slow down the
progression of the disease.

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,517
I'm applying for
a part-time job...

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,531
and it'd help if you could
write a letter or something.

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,387
- What kind of work?
- An EMT.

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,721
In City Fire, you need someone on the
inside to help you move up, you know.

11
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,239
- I'll help your brother out, no worries.
- Guy's an alcoholic.

12
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,993
Yeah, well, so am I.

13
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,284
Luka's father got sick, he
had to fly back to Croatia.

14
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,962
Chemo could take, like, six
months, and we have a life here.

15
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,305
Yes.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,547
It's crazy how much
he loves that book.

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,414
Yeah. He must
really miss Dr. Kovac.

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,249
Well, it won't be
too much longer.

19
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:00,656
I hope not. Don't want
him to forget who his dad is.

20
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,891
Okay, Joe-Joe. Here we go.

21
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,629
Try to get him to eat some kale today.
- Mm-hm.

22
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,108
- All right. I'll see you guys at 5.
- We'll be here. Have a good day.

23
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,110
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

24
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,145
- Bye.
- Bye.

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,416
Mrs. Fratelli, that's
really not necessary.

26
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,851
It's the least I can do.
You people are saints.

27
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,455
Oh. I appreciate
the thought but...

28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,216
Nurse Taggart, you know,
my little Paulie, my angel...

29
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,054
he's my only child.

30
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:38,028
So if it weren't for you and
the other doctors, I mean...

31
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,259
- he wouldn't be here right now.
- We were just doing our jobs.

32
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,405
No, I insist. Come on,
my salon, it's full service.

33
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,769
Manis, pedis,
makeovers, massages.

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,072
Whatever your staff wants,
on the house, all day. Come on.

35
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,237
You spend every day
taking care of people.

36
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,815
Let somebody take
care of you for once.

37
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,544
Okay. I guess you can
set up in the break room.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,212
Great. You ever thought
about going blond?

39
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,254
Might look great on you.

40
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,086
Hey, guys. PRATT AND SAM: Hey.

41
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,387
Oh, my God, Dr. Lockhart.

42
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,053
- Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,495
- How are you?
- Good.

44
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,463
- How are you?
- I'm fabulous.

45
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,933
And Paulie's doing great.

46
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,436
He wanted to come, you
know. But he's got school.

47
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,471
Guess what? Free
makeovers today.

48
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,473
- We'll start with you first.
- I'm good.

49
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,774
No, no, no. I got some great,
wonderful, natural treatments.

50
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:30,247
- I think you would love it.
- No, really, I'm fine. And I'm sorry...

51
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:34,582
- but who are you?
- Angie. I came in with my son, Paulie.

52
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,281
Oh, look at those
brown eyes. Oh, my God.

53
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:41,121
I can make these... Sheila,
did you see her eyes?

54
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,160
- Talk to me.
- Willy Archibald, he's 59.

55
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,424
Ground-level fall,
complains of hip pain.

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,865
Denies head trauma or LOC.
Good vitals, no meds or allergies.

57
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,699
- How'd you fall, sir?
- I must have tripped on something.

58
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,536
Before you fell, did you have chest
pain, shortness of breath, palpitations?

59
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,337
No, nothing like that. My
hip's killing me, though.

60
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:02,676
All right, let's get him 4 of morphine.
Get a full hip-and-pelvis series.

61
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,977
So how you doing, man?

62
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,485
Oh, he's doing great. I
love breaking in rookies.

63
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,952
Have we met?

64
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,819
Zach Flaherty. Just
transferred in from Rogers Park.

65
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,019
Must be nice. Wish I had a doctor
for a brother when I was coming up.

66
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,329
Please do what you can. He's a
great kid. He really deserves this.

67
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,335
Okay, I'll hold. Right.

68
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:29,000
Hi, Mr. Rios. Yes,
this is Dr. Tony Gates.

69
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,577
Right. Yes, from County General.

70
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:36,682
Yeah, unfortunately,
it's true. It's terminal.

71
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,217
Yeah, his name is Josh Lipnicki
and... Well, he's leaving tomorrow...

72
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,253
so I guess it would
have to be today.

73
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,722
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know
it's short notice, but...

74
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,886
Yeah. Oh, thank you. I really
appreciate you trying to work this out.

75
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,225
All right, thank
you, sir. Thank you.

76
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,730
Free makeovers, huh?

77
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,497
Yeah, it's a good idea,
Sam. Be good for morale.

78
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:02,439
Oh, I can't take the credit. I don't
even remember treating that lady's kid.

79
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,078
- What?
- What "what?"

80
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,908
Like you remember every
patient who comes through here.

81
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,073
Pratt, you guys got a
hyponatremic for me?

82
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,584
She's altered and electrolytes are
out of whack after gastric bypass.

83
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,916
Curtain 4. She's almost ready.

84
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,923
Dr. Morris, the broken-leg
kid is ready to go...

85
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,425
and the crackhead in 2
won't keep his gown on.

86
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,724
- The broken-leg kid can be discharged.
- What about the crackhead?

87
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,561
I don't know. Avert your eyes.
What do you want from me?

88
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,203
Everybody, this is
Javier, the new desk clerk.

89
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,465
- Javier, this is everybody.
- Nice to meet you.

90
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,209
- Ooh. Girl...
- Wow, nice feathers.

91
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,276
Next person that says
a word is dead meat.

92
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,459
Mr. Grant has right flank
pain times three days.

93
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,795
Did you fall? Injure your back?

94
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,028
No. But I'm a building super.

95
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:08,574
I bend over all day, fixing stuff.
Never bothered me before, though.

96
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,735
Any allergies or
medical conditions?

97
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,380
Anything make the
pain better or worse?

98
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,313
No. I just can't get
comfortable, you know?

99
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,680
I have a little pain
in my groin too.

100
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,846
- He had hematuria yesterday.
- Any fever?

101
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,551
- No.
- Well, sounds like a kidney stone.

102
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,323
Oh, no, sweet cakes. Our trip.

103
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,831
- Our 20th anniversary's next week.
- Well, you should be fine by then.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,902
We'll give you something for
the pain while we do some tests.

105
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,333
- Be right back.
- Thanks.

106
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,098
- What's your plan?
- Morphine.

107
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:44,677
With an NSAID. Prostaglandin inhibitors
block the ureteral spasm of renal colic.

108
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,679
- Labs?
- Just a UA to rule out infection.

109
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,578
CT KUB, no contrast.

110
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,719
Got it. And, by the way, I love
what you've done with your...

111
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,855
Shut up, Grady.

112
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,448
- Two more.
- Okay, go.

113
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,217
Forty-five-year-old male,
renal colic, waiting for CT.

114
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,591
Our diarrhea-and-fever guy is
better after hydration, ready to fly.

115
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,255
- You have a stool culture? C. diff?
- Yep. Yep.

116
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,732
You all set for your
yearbook pictures later?

117
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:09,926
Bite me.

118
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,607
- So how we feeling, Mr. Archibald?
- Better, thanks.

119
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,438
- Films are back.
- Okay, good.

120
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,080
Well, you got no fracture.

121
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,978
But you got complete loss
of joint space, bilaterally.

122
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,051
- Add a sed rate and rheumatoid factor.
- Copy that.

123
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,921
- What's all that mean?
- You got bad arthritis in your hip joints.

124
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:35,755
All your cartilage is gone. Basically,
you got bone grinding on bone.

125
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,228
Tell me something I
don't already know.

126
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,560
Actually, I'm surprised
you can still walk.

127
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,794
How the heck do
you manage the pain?

128
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,804
Take little steps and
just tough it out, I guess.

129
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,805
Well, we can help you with that.

130
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,570
Plus, I'm gonna refer you
to the orthopedics clinic.

131
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,737
You might need
a hip replacement.

132
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,576
That's what they told me
when I was up there last time.

133
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,152
- Can't afford the insurance or surgery.
- How old did you say you were?

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,154
Fifty-nine. Too
young for Medicare.

135
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,991
Frank, can I help you
with something, man?

136
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,459
Could I please have an
autograph, Mr. Archibald?

137
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,598
My pleasure.

138
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,766
Been years since anyone
asked me for one of these.

139
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,459
I used to be from Cleveland.

140
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,164
The only reason I became a Miami fan
is because you got traded down there.

141
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,708
Appreciate that. Who's this to?

142
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:28,144
- Frank. F-R-A-N-K.
- Uh-huh.

143
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:32,513
You never heard of Willy Archibald?
He was great. Ate quarterbacks alive.

144
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,712
Running up the middle?
You can forget that.

145
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,050
- You played pro ball, huh?
- For 10 years.

146
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,055
They don't make
them like you anymore.

147
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,127
- Hey, thanks a lot.
- No, no. Thank you.

148
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,828
Holy Mother of God,
is that what I think it is?

149
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,365
Super Bowl VIII. Long time ago.

150
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,233
- You had three sacks in that game.
- Heh.

151
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,736
Well, I'll let you
two reminisce.

152
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,205
I'll be back to talk
about that clinic referral.

153
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,708
- What's it like playing for Shula?
- Oh, my God.

154
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,676
- My cousin used to live in the 9th Ward.
- Get out of here.

155
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,009
- I can't. I'm serious.
- Uh...

156
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:07,211
Dr. Pratt, GYN has a bed but they
can't take your PID for two hours.

157
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,879
Two? She's been
down here for six.

158
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,922
That was my old 'hood.

159
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,993
- Small world. JAVIER:
You're telling me.

160
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,995
- Dr. Pratt, can you hand me that chart?
- What? Your arms broken?

161
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,802
- I just got my nails done.
- Oh, don't worry, girl. I got it.

162
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,698
Those tips look fierce on you.
- Thank you, baby.

163
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,574
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

164
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:38,685
Hey, listen. Keep the NS running at
150 an hour till I get up there, okay?

165
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,253
- You're back.
- Yeah. First day.

166
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,619
Every time I think I'm
out, they pull me back in.

167
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,226
- You look good. How do you feel?
- Well, ask me at the end of my shift.

168
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,921
Oh, thanks for the flowers
and the get-well card.

169
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,895
Least I could do.

170
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,967
So how's Ray?

171
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,699
Oh, as far as I know, he's good.
You know, all things considered.

172
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,241
- He sent me a letter last week.
- Send him my best, huh, Mayday?

173
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,106
Hey, are you ever gonna
tell me why you call me that?

174
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,841
Mayday? Well, she
was my favorite Bond girl.

175
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,485
Grace Jones in <i>A View to a Kill.</i>

176
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,645
Started off as a bad guy,
then she saved the whole world.

177
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,718
Hey, you're lucky. Could
have been Pussy Galore.

178
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,795
I'll see you later.

179
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,897
- Yo, Gates.
- Bards, what's up, man?

180
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,661
- Haven't seen you. Where you been?
- Stuck up in the ICU.

181
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,394
So, dude, what's
up with your boy?

182
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,133
- Pratt's brother, Chaz.
- Why? What'd he do?

183
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,436
You didn't hear?

184
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,476
Wow. Love the 'do,
Sam. Looks good on you.

185
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,514
- Thanks. It's just a little something.
- Angie's good, huh?

186
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,846
I wish I'd known when I went
brunette. Could have saved 200 bucks.

187
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,488
- Find anybody who remembers her kid?
- Not a soul.

188
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm getting my pretty boy
on for my last night with Hope.

189
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,420
I ordered the
works. I can't wait.

190
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,960
Gonna take more than
the works to save that mug.

191
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,098
Oh, my God. So mean.

192
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,290
That's his baseline.
You'll get used to it.

193
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,301
- I hope not.
- Hey, guys. Care package for Ray.

194
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,133
Whatever you want to send,
put it in here by end of day.

195
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,832
Oh. That's really
thoughtful, Katey. How is he?

196
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,137
Pretty incognito. I think I'm gonna
go see him in a couple weeks.

197
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,612
- Well, look who it is.
- Ah. Welcome back.

198
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,842
Hi, stranger. NEELA: Hi, guys.

199
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:22,318
- So how you feeling?
- Oh, a little sore, you know.

200
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,355
Oh, my God.

201
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,823
- Hi.
- I know. Just don't. I'll explain later.

202
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,490
Okay. Well, I have a few
things left at your place.

203
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,395
So I'll just come and pick
everything up tomorrow.

204
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,195
Okay.

205
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,169
- Stop looking at me like that.
- I can't help it.

206
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,242
I think it looks good. I'm
serious. Farrah was my favorite.

207
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,139
- Yeah, mine too.
- Same here.

208
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,338
I used to love that poster. The
one with the red bathing suit.

209
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,075
Yeah, with the Mexican
blanket-thing background.

210
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,685
We had that up at the precinct.
I used to look at that every day.

211
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,847
Did I have some boyhood fantasies
about her. God, she was hot.

212
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,323
- This is totally creeping me out.
- You and me.

213
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,826
- I'll be in the ladies room.
- I'll walk with you.

214
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,865
Hey, Frank, would you please
get the lab results for Mr. Archibald?

215
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,436
Hey, Pratt, can I
talk to you a second?

216
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,366
What's up, Gates?

217
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,508
Don't you think you should
have told me about your brother?

218
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:19,408
I mean, I still would have sponsored him.
But, been nice if you'd said something.

219
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,208
- What are you talking about now?
- He's gay.

220
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,378
Yeah, so what?
Oh, you interested?

221
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,544
- Come on, Greg.
- "Come on, Greg" what?

222
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,589
- What exactly was I supposed to say?
- I don't know. "My brother's gay"?

223
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,124
Okay, and then what
would you have done?

224
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,423
- Something. Gave him some advice.
- Really? Like what?

225
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:41,090
I don't know, you know. But now
his whole station's on to it, you know.

226
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,760
I could have done something,
made it easier on him. I'm just saying.

227
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:49,069
Just say your way back up to the
ICU and mind your own damn business.

228
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,701
- Lab results for Mr. Willy Archibald.
- Ah.

229
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,577
Mr. Archibald, listen to me. I
cannot help you unless you talk to me.

230
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,448
Now, what is it?
Percocet? Demerol?

231
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,652
- Heroin?
- Hell, no.

232
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,659
I don't mess with that stuff.

233
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,826
It's Vicodin.

234
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,464
Where'd you get
the prescription?

235
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,005
My mom gets it for
me. She's on Medicare.

236
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,576
I can't afford that
stuff on 7.50 an hour.

237
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,679
- Mr. Archibald...
- You don't know how I feel.

238
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,451
I can barely walk,
it hurts so much.

239
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:35,487
Got laid off because I couldn't
patrol the damn warehouse.

240
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,921
So I get a messenger job.
Figured I could still drive, right?

241
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,921
- Now I can barely do that.
- How long have you been on Vicodin?

242
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,266
Years. I need three, four a day.

243
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,764
It used to knock me out,
but it doesn't do that anymore.

244
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,964
Mr. Archibald, painkillers
are very, very addictive.

245
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,142
What the hell you
want me to do, doc?

246
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,803
Soon my mom is gonna be
driving me around. She's 80, man.

247
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,109
I can get you on the surgery
list here. It's free of charge.

248
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,482
I'm on the damn list.
It's an 18-month wait.

249
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,214
A private hospital would take
you tomorrow if you had the money.

250
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,851
Are you saying that you
have absolutely no assets?

251
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,796
Just the house I bought my
mom. And I'm not selling that.

252
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,737
Well, I can't allow you to keep
popping Vicodin like it's candy.

253
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:31,503
I'll see what I can do to get you
bumped up on the County list.

254
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,185
Here.

255
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,885
It's worth a lot.

256
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,121
It's real diamonds and gold.

257
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,360
Maybe someone will take it
as a payment for the surgery.

258
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:58,167
- Put it up on that eBay or something.
- Mr. Archibald, I cannot...

259
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,340
Please, doc.

260
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,941
I can't live with
this pain any longer.

261
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,633
Please.

262
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,186
Hello?

263
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,064
Wait, wait, wait. What happened?

264
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,896
Is he okay? Where are you?

265
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,299
All right. I'm on my way.

266
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,268
- Dr. Lockhart, I really need...
- Ask Pratt.

267
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,879
He told me to ask you.

268
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:45,212
Hey, Abby, what's up with your foot
lac in 2? It's not gonna suture itself.

269
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,247
He fell. I don't know how
it happened. He just...

270
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,451
Give him to me. Give
him to me. Come on.

271
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,097
Get the door. Get the door!

272
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,473
Excuse me, have you seen our
doctor? She said she'd be right back.

273
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,808
- I got the pedes cuff.
- Come on, baby, wake up.

274
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,470
- Pupils are equal and reactive.
- How far did he fall?

275
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,411
- From the jungle gym.
- How many feet?

276
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,744
- I don't know. Maybe 6.
- Spontaneous resps...

277
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,513
- but have that bag ready.
- Did he just move? Morris?

278
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,622
- He sure did.
- Extremities look good.

279
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,918
Come on, Joe. Come
on, Joe, open your eyes.

280
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,856
- He's gonna be all right?
- Don't know.

281
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,327
- Got a BP, 78/42.
- Did he move or cry or anything?

282
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,521
No. SAM: Sats 98.

283
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,530
Three-centimeter
lac on the forehead.

284
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,965
- I'll irrigate.
- Did he fall on his head?

285
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,536
I don't know. I didn't see.

286
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,037
What do you mean you didn't see?
Were you watching? That's your job.

287
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,506
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

288
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,044
- You should just go.
- Oh, please, I want to stay.

289
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,273
- I'll let you know how he is.
- We're gonna do everything, okay?

290
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,748
He's gonna get
the best that we got.

291
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,155
- So you sure you got everything?
- Yeah. Let's get out of here.

292
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,552
Hey, not so fast, speedy.

293
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,023
We got a few things to
discuss before you leave.

294
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,164
It's Johns Hopkins. Something
went wrong. I didn't get in.

295
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,232
- I anticipated this.
- Just relax. I faxed your consent forms.

296
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,665
I warned them about
you, you little card shark.

297
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,203
I gotta go over there just
to win my money back.

298
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,738
Texas hold'em isn't your game.

299
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,307
I got some news.

300
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,705
Good news, bad news.
What do you want first?

301
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,814
Bad. I like to end on an up.

302
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,510
Well, the bad news is, you can't
go home and pack for Baltimore.

303
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:29,520
There's something you have to
do. And the good news is a surprise.

304
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,482
What is it?

305
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,388
If I tell you, it will ruin the
whole surprise element.

306
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,859
Don't worry.
You're gonna love it.

307
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,396
- You're in on this too?
- Enough yakking. Let's go.

308
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,535
Come on, we got stuff
to do. Look out. Clear out.

309
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,035
Too bad they don't
take care of the old guys.

310
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,868
If it wasn't for guys like Willy
putting their bodies on the line...

311
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,272
there wouldn't be an
NFL. It's a damn shame.

312
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,936
It's a damn shame he didn't
save some of that money.

313
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,412
A guy was lucky to make
35 G's a year back then.

314
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,881
Not like these
multimillion-dollar clowns today.

315
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,577
Half of them
crybabies and criminals.

316
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,825
May I hold it?

317
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,087
Wow.

318
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,692
I heard Ditka himself auctioned
off his NFC Championship ring...

319
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,600
to help out some
of the old players.

320
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,405
This is priceless.

321
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:28,207
This is earned with sweat and
blood in the trenches of the gridiron.

322
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,872
You can't sell it.

323
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,078
Chemo boy pulled his central
line. He's bleeding all over Curtain 4.

324
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,155
- And there's a rig 10 minutes out.
- All right.

325
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,327
Hey, how's Joe? I could get somebody
else to take that rig if you need me.

326
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,871
Woke up crying, purposeful
movements. Morris has got him.

327
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,402
I brought two gowns in
case he throws up again.

328
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,570
- Six-0 nylon.
- Luka, hi, it's me.

329
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,183
Joe fell and hit his
head in the park today.

330
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,649
But he's awake now.
We're at the hospital. He...

331
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,482
Oh... I know it hurts.

332
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,784
Could you just call me as soon
as you get this message? Bye.

333
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,690
It's okay, Abby.
He'll call you back.

334
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:20,127
- Could you hold his head still?
- Wait, wait. What are you doing?

335
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,202
- Closing the lac.
- No, I'll do it. He's an intern.

336
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,770
Yeah, who knows how to
Dermabond a laceration.

337
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,272
What if it gets infected
or he gets a giant scar?

338
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,105
- You wanna be responsible for that?
- Better me than you.

339
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,645
- Sure about that?
- He's right, Abby.

340
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,839
Call CT, let them
know we're on our way.

341
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:40,817
- No CT. We agreed we'd just observe.
- Yeah, before he vomited.

342
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:44,389
Yeah. No, it's too much radiation.
No one knows the long-term effects.

343
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:48,050
Morris, we over-CT kids. We've
had this discussion a thousand times.

344
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,129
Yeah. LOC, vomiting.
You know he needs a scan.

345
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,664
His vitals are good, his mental
status is fine, the LOC was transient.

346
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,133
Observation is enough.
It's not a head bleed.

347
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,966
- The mechanism isn't there.
- If this was your patient...

348
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,540
and not your son,
what would you do?

349
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,705
All right. No peeking.

350
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,539
- I'm not.
- You better not be.

351
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,079
- Are you ready?
- I was ready a half hour ago.

352
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,513
All right, take your hands down.

353
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,150
Look at this. Front row, third base
line, right behind the on-deck circle.

354
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,222
You can't afford those tickets.

355
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:23,523
It's not how much you make, my
young friend, it's who you know.

356
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,857
We'll get him in and out soon as we
can. I'll give you an immediate read.

357
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,732
Thanks. BETTINA: No IV?

358
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,736
We didn't think we needed one.

359
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,502
We should get one in. Usually, a
little whiff of ketamine does the trick.

360
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,079
Yeah. I don't wanna sedate him.

361
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,673
It's only gonna take
a few seconds, right?

362
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,183
I've scanned a lot of toddlers.
Trust me, you want the drugs.

363
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,019
I can do it in one needle
stick, Abby. I promise.

364
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,217
Hypoventilation, drug allergies,
it's just not worth the risk.

365
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,557
We can't get a good look
unless he holds completely still.

366
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,197
Yeah. Can you pass me that?

367
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:05,527
Shh. Thank you. I just
wanna try something, okay?

368
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,732
Shh, shh, shh. Here you go. If it
doesn't work, you can sedate him.

369
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:12,401
- Just let me try, okay?
- Okay.

370
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,240
Yeah. And this one too.

371
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,283
And what about this? Oh.

372
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:23,951
Remember this book?
<i>Daddy Takes a Trip.</i>

373
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,784
Huh? Hah.

374
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,225
"This is me when I
was your age, Joe."

375
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,991
What do you think? Do
you...? Hah. What's that?

376
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:38,468
"This is me and your Uncle
Niko. We loved the beach."

377
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,335
Do you see them on the
beach, right there? Right in here?

378
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,640
Who's that? Who's that?

379
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:51,307
"This is me, your dad, missing
you, wishing you were here."

380
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,153
These seats are exceptional.

381
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,484
We never sat this close before.

382
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,126
- You're welcome.
- Man.

383
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,095
Excuse me. You Josh?

384
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,068
Stand up. Yeah, this is Josh.

385
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,932
- I'm Tony Gates.
- Nice to meet you.

386
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,700
Josh Lipnicki. His mom, Serena.
- Hey, Josh.

387
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,437
- Derrek Lee.
- This is for you. Whole team signed it.

388
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,106
- Wow, thanks, Mr. Lee.
- Good luck in Baltimore.

389
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,280
- Mr. Lee.
- Yeah?

390
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,650
I gotta tell you, your opponents
have a statistical tendency...

391
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,655
to pitch you high and outside.

392
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:37,354
And the wind's blowing out today,
so lay off that stuff, you'll murder them.

393
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,690
All right. I'll
keep that in mind.

394
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,805
- I don't know what to say.
- That's a first.

395
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,170
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yes. This definitely qualifies as cool.

396
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,337
Nice.

397
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,849
No answer?

398
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,616
Well, by the time you reach him,
all you're gonna have is good news.

399
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,890
You know, I thought
the NICU was tough...

400
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,655
but at least both
of us were there.

401
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,928
And he was brand new. I
didn't even know him yet.

402
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:18,229
But now he's... now he's Joe.

403
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,599
Okay. So Abby... What?

404
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,438
There's no
subdural, no epidural.

405
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,670
The grey-white junctions
and sulci look sharp.

406
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,339
And there's no evidence
of diffuse axonal injury.

407
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,747
- Well, that's good, right?
- But...?

408
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,117
There's a subtle high-density
irregularity in the left parietal region.

409
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,953
It's small and it could be nothing.
Since it correlates with the location...

410
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,359
of his injury, I think we're
obliged to check it out with an MRI.

411
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,594
After all this, we have
to sedate him anyway.

412
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,702
We need him
still for 45 minutes.

413
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,532
- I know.
- We'll take him to the ER.

414
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,300
We'll have Chuny start the
IV. She's the best in town.

415
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,107
I want LMX cream.

416
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,178
Okay, I'll put it on
now, give it time to work.

417
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,873
He's got an 18 gauge in
the right antecubital fossa.

418
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,248
- Got 40 of Lasix en route.
- All right, we got it.

419
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,720
Make yourself useful and
go refill the airway box, rookie.

420
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,257
Hey, come hit me
later. We gotta talk.

421
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,258
BP, 194/126.

422
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,557
So CHF exacerbation. We
already got Lasix. What's next?

423
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,598
After load
reduction? Nitro drip?

424
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,760
- Hey.
- Hey, man, what the hell is this?

425
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,735
You got something
you wanna say to me?

426
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,636
You can wear them
for your boyfriend.

427
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,936
Man, I swear to God, I'll beat
your punk ass into next week.

428
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,272
I'm right here, rook.
Come on, let's go.

429
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,316
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

430
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,918
Jeez, I was just kidding around.

431
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,853
- Greg, can you get out of here?
- What?

432
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,526
Get out of here, man. I'm fine.

433
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,163
I always open up a second kit.
That way I'll never need it, you know?

434
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,134
Here's your flush.

435
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,836
- I hate this.
- I'll make it quick.

436
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,542
- Shh, shh.
- Okay.

437
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,315
- Come on, baby.
- It's okay.

438
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,542
Oh, my God. I don't
think I can watch this.

439
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,880
Look, you don't have
to be in here, you know.

440
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,852
I know. But I don't
wanna desert him.

441
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,423
You won't be the first
mom that can't watch, Abby.

442
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,856
Come on. We'll be right next
door. I'll sit with you, okay?

443
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,622
Listen to me. Listen,
baby, I love you.

444
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:48,617
I remember when Alex was 3.

445
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,588
I took him to one of those
bounce houses at the carnival.

446
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:56,456
And of course he's in there
with 5-and 6-year-old kids.

447
00:24:56,662 --> 00:25:00,429
So he gets knocked down, right?
And every time he tries to get up...

448
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,299
he keeps getting knocked down again,
and he's crying, "Mommy! Mommy!"

449
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:11,473
The attendant won't let me in because
he thinks I'm some stupid teenager.

450
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,737
So, what'd you do?

451
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:21,376
I stood there and
I cheered him on.

452
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,782
And every time he got knocked
down, I told him, "I know you can get up."

453
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:32,122
But that's when it hit me.

454
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,502
They fall.

455
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,903
And all you can do is be there
and hope they keep getting up.

456
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,846
Just keep some ice on
it. You should be fine.

457
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,081
I was just breaking the kid's
balls, you know? It was a joke.

458
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,919
Jokes are supposed to be funny.

459
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,857
Come back in a few days and
I'll check your eye out again.

460
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,521
Hey, I got empty chairs in there.
Come on, who's up for some pampering?

461
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:10,362
- It's not really my style.
- End of my shift, I am there, Ang.

462
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:12,004
How about you, huh?

463
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,834
I could wax those brows,
make you look 10 years younger.

464
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,967
You should do it. It's like you've
got two caterpillars over your eyes.

465
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,340
No, thank you. Unlike
you good-for-nothings...

466
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,848
- I'm not vain about my appearance.
- Well, that must make it easier. Heh-heh.

467
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,180
How'd you get this
bum wing, Reggie?

468
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,821
Fell out of my desk.

469
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,015
He dozed off at school, fell
out of his desk during math.

470
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,161
He hasn't been
sleeping well at home.

471
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,990
He's afraid the bogeyman's
gonna get him. Baby.

472
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,155
Tommy. MORRIS:
Hey, does this hurt?

473
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,131
Bogeyman, huh? You know,
there's no such thing, buddy.

474
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,504
- I've seen him. MORRIS:
You've seen him?

475
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:50,405
- What's he look like?
- He's green, big eyes, crazy hair.

476
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,510
Well, no point tenderness.
He's got full range of motion.

477
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,975
I don't think it's broken.

478
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,309
Why didn't you say it
was a green bogeyman?

479
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,543
I got something that
will fix that right up.

480
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,811
Kidney stone guy in 2
doesn't look so good.

481
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,979
I'll be right back.
What kidney stone guy?

482
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,388
Abby's patient. Gross hematuria,
dropped his pressure, diaphoretic.

483
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,323
- Where's my doctor?
- BP, 80/50.

484
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,862
- What's wrong? He was fine.
- Did he get narcotics?

485
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,090
Five milligrams of
morphine three hours ago.

486
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,530
Bolus a liter of saline.
What are his labs?

487
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,193
- They only sent a
UA. GRANT: My back.

488
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,271
Stat HemoCue, chemistry and EKG.

489
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,601
- Are those films? DAWN:
Yeah, Abby didn't see them.

490
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,368
Dr. Lockhart said it was a
kidney stone, he'd be fine.

491
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:29,174
Hello, ma'am, I'm Dr. Morris. I'm
afraid a kidney stone isn't the problem.

492
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,045
- Get Surgery down here right away.
- He needs surgery?

493
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,744
- Your husband has a mass in the kidney.
- A mass? Like, a tumor?

494
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,550
- HemoCue 8.1.
- Too soon to say, but maybe.

495
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:42,354
- Type and cross, two units.
- Oh, my God. She said he was okay.

496
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,138
Like I said, the program
is free of charge.

497
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,282
Meets three times a
week at the hospital.

498
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,419
If you can commit to that,
get weaned off the Vicodin...

499
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,578
then we can do this.

500
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,657
I don't know, doc. What if
the procedure don't work?

501
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,920
It will. Just promise
me you'll lay off the pills.

502
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,127
- Okay, deal. What do I gotta do?
- I pulled some strings.

503
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,963
Ortho bumped you high on
the list for hip replacement.

504
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:27,766
But for now, we're gonna put a needle
into your joint under x-ray guidance.

505
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,910
- Come on. I'll help you.
- Yeah?

506
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,945
- Team doc used to stick us all the time.
- Well, this isn't quite the same.

507
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,447
What we're gonna do is something
called an intra-articular injection.

508
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,677
We put a long-acting
anesthetic and steroid.

509
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,014
- It kills the pain for a month.
- Damn.

510
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:48,252
If you don't get your surgery by then,
you come back, we do it all over again.

511
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,255
Cool?

512
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,327
- Thanks, doc.
- You're welcome.

513
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,470
Now, I just need you
to sign here to consent.

514
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:06,677
All right. Now let's get you on your
side so I can prep you. Come on.

515
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,381
- All right.
- I just gotta let you know...

516
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,279
that there's a small chance
of bleeding and infection.

517
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,716
But the benefits far
outweigh the risks.

518
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,982
- Is it gonna hurt?
- No. We numb the skin up first.

519
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,386
- Hey.
- Hey there.

520
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,460
How many of these
have you done before?

521
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,654
Oh, I'm not doing this. She is.

522
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,028
Hello, Mr. Archibald.
I'm Dr. DeJesus.

523
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,198
Well, in that case, you may
have to leave the room, doc.

524
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:35,233
- Pressure's 75/40.
- Call for another two units.

525
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,207
Oh, no, no, sweetie.
There's so much blood.

526
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,142
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

527
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,373
Dawn, take her to the
family room, please.

528
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,541
- Is it blunt trauma?
- No, renal mass eroding into the vessels.

529
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,187
- Hemorrhaging around his kidney.
- He needs surgery.

530
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,222
- A central line kit.
- Crit's dropping despite transfusions.

531
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,724
He doesn't need a central
line, he needs the O.R.

532
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,863
- Hang a unit of FFP.
- If we sit on him, he's gonna crash.

533
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,434
- What's your plan, Neela?
- Angioplasty balloon in the renal artery.

534
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,570
I cut the blood
supply to his kidney...

535
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,365
get his pressure up, he'll
have a chance in the O.R.

536
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,768
- Ballsy.
- Or stupid.

537
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:13,002
Okay. Let's call for a
C-arm. Neela, you're up.

538
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,238
<i>And now, batting
third, first baseman...</i>

539
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,510
<i>number 4</i> 5<i>, Derrek Lee.</i>

540
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,209
Guide wire's in
the femoral artery.

541
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,880
Excellent.

542
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,380
Advancing a
6-millimeter balloon.

543
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,748
- Last hemoglobin is 8.5.
- Dropping. He's losing more blood.

544
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,084
Not for long. Morris, can you
inflate the balloon, please?

545
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,821
Looks good. Okay, fluoro off.

546
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,931
Could have done a
nephrectomy by now.

547
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,162
He could have had an MI or a
stroke because he was too unstable.

548
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,306
Blood pressure's up, 95/60.

549
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,008
Best it's been. Rasgotra
shoots and scores. Nice job.

550
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:22,409
- Move him to the O.R. I'll be right up.
- Have the blood bank ahead four units.

551
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:26,746
- You got lucky.
- So this is about the patient, is it?

552
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:33,289
You know, when Ray got
hurt, I was in a lot of shock.

553
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,359
- We all were.
- Poor you.

554
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,859
What happened to Ray
had nothing to do with me.

555
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,032
He got piss drunk
at Abby's wedding.

556
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,997
He's the one who stumbled
in front of that truck, not me.

557
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,171
- Even he says that.
- You done?

558
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,831
You know, you can hate me as
much as you like. I couldn't care less.

559
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,342
But I will not take the blame for
what happened to Ray. You got that?

560
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:16,124
- So how's he doing?
- Oh, he's just coming out of it.

561
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,067
- How about you?
- Mm. I've been better.

562
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:24,739
You get in touch with Luka yet?

563
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:30,979
You know, it's totally different
when it's your kid on the table.

564
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:37,480
And it would be a lot easier
if I wasn't doing this alone.

565
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,216
Baby Joe's gonna be just fine.

566
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:42,851
And you are not alone.

567
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,863
I just got this from Bettina. She
apologized for not coming down.

568
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,406
Normal parenchymal tissue.

569
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,600
- No blood or edema.
- Okay.

570
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:58,835
What did I tell you?

571
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,812
No, really, I feel
much better. I just...

572
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,615
- I have to be there when he wakes up.
- I understand.

573
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,486
Oh, God. What if it's malignant?

574
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,651
One thing at a time. Let's get
him through the operation first.

575
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:21,163
I'll take you upstairs. The surgeons
will answer all your questions.

576
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,799
- We missed a 6-centimeter mass?
- You can't catch everything.

577
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,236
That thing was gigantic.

578
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,638
Was that my kidney
stone patient's wife?

579
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,804
Uh... Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

580
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:39,008
I've got some charts
I should go finish.

581
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,654
- Where is he?
- Who?

582
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,519
- Oh! Well, he needed surgery.
- What?

583
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,751
- No, it was nothing. We caught it.
- Morris.

584
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:53,228
- You didn't have enough on your plate?
- Morris, what is it? Come on.

585
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:59,099
Probable renal-cell carcinoma.

586
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:04,006
- Oh, my God.
- That guy's tumor was not your fault.

587
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,009
- We're not sure if it's malignant.
- I told him he was fine.

588
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,738
Well, we handled
it. We're a team.

589
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,578
We back each other up.

590
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,118
Now go home. Get some
rest, take care of your boy.

591
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,551
Don't beat yourself
up over this.

592
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,554
- See you later.
- Thanks for everything.

593
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,920
- Bye, sweetie.
- Thank you.

594
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,141
Twenty minutes and I will be
in the capable hands of Angie...

595
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,039
- upgraded to the premium package.
- What are you doing?

596
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:44,239
Oh, it's for a kid I got who can't
sleep. Chronic bogeyman problem.

597
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,327
So you're giving him candy?
- No.

598
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,616
Well, yes. But he doesn't
know that it's candy.

599
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,484
I'm gonna tell him it's
bogeyman repellent.

600
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,421
- Genius, right?
- It's a lie.

601
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:59,327
Sam, let me tell you about a little thing
that we like to call the placebo effect.

602
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,227
- They look like M&M's.
- Yeah.

603
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,391
Yeah, they do that
to cover up the taste.

604
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:09,166
The methyl chloride anti-noxazine
is very bitter in pure form.

605
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,313
- They taste like M&M's too.
- Cool, huh?

606
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,940
No, no, no, never take more than
two. Right before you brush your teeth.

607
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,088
Okay, there's a three-week
supply there, so make them last.

608
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,850
- Thanks, Dr. Morris.
- You bet. Hang for a little while longer.

609
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,961
We'll get you guys moving
out as soon as we can.

610
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,363
Hi. It's me again.

611
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,125
Uh... Um...

612
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,329
I still don't know
where you are.

613
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:43,373
Maybe you're at the hospital.
I hope everything's okay.

614
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,511
But Joe is fine.
The MRI was clear.

615
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:52,117
So you can just ignore all
my other panicked messages.

616
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,048
We're on our way home. We'll
be there in about 20 minutes.

617
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,553
So call us. Bye.

618
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,723
Shh, shh.

619
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,845
I don't worry about it.

620
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,642
You gotta be what you are.

621
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,080
You said it, girl.

622
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,378
Hey, guys. Excuse me.

623
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,683
Hey, Pratt, what's going on?

624
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,826
And this one? He's cute.

625
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:39,522
- Boo.
- Heh-heh-heh.

626
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:46,435
Excuse me, Dr. Pratt?

627
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,073
- Yup.
- Is your brother single?

628
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,835
Ah. You're gonna
have to check with him.

629
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,073
- Good night.
- Good night.

630
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,612
And I will.

631
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,546
See you tomorrow, buddy.

632
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,516
Morris? MORRIS: Yeah.

633
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,250
- What are you doing there?
- I'm getting my treatments.

634
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,691
You should really stay
and have something done.

635
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:14,026
No, I'm good. You take it easy.
- Suit yourself.

636
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,301
Oh, hey, Dr. Moretti, welcome
back. How was the conference?

637
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,870
Oh. You know, the EM
Research Symposium...

638
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,065
is no mere
conference, Dr. Pratt.

639
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,040
It is a magical week where
the greatest research minds...

640
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,409
get together to exchange
ideas and knowledge.

641
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:32,978
- Big waste of time, huh?
- Yeah.

642
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:38,317
Oh, hey. Your boy Gates picked up
von Willebrand's on a trauma patient.

643
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,151
ICU must be doing him some good.

644
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,653
Always a pleasure
talking to you.

645
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,227
Hey.

646
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:59,776
- So where's your partner?
- Lunch.

647
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,075
Chaz, why are you
ignoring me, man?

648
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,612
You really don't know?

649
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,357
- You made me look like a bitch, Greg.
- What?

650
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,260
I don't need you to fight my
battles. I can take care of myself.

651
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,698
Come on, man. It
wasn't even like that.

652
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,964
How you gonna sit there
and try to tell me what it's like?

653
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,973
Do they call you faggot here?

654
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,634
Do they whistle at
you in the shower too?

655
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:37,373
Listen, I just reacted, man.

656
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,450
I saw my little brother
getting pushed around, man.

657
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,348
A switch flipped.

658
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,649
Come on, man, you know what
I'm saying. You're my family.

659
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,622
I know you probably
thought you were helping...

660
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,819
and I appreciate it...

661
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,696
but if my big brother the
doctor, comes to the rescue...

662
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,835
then they're gonna respect you.

663
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,396
If I stand up for myself, then
they're gonna respect me.

664
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,533
You're right.

665
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,680
Whatever you
need, man, I got you.

666
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,861
Then I was a personal
shopper at Barneys.

667
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,735
Dr. Morris, the asthmatic...

668
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,970
in Exam 2 dropped his sats.

669
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,997
I think he needs a tube.
- Coming.

670
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,375
Start continuous
albuterol. Solu-Medrol, 125.

671
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,452
- It's ready. Sats down to 89.
- Point-one milligram epi IV...

672
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,373
- infuse a milligram over an hour.
- Aah!

673
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:51,753
You don't wanna tube him?

674
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:56,088
Reg. Wha...? It's okay, Reg.
What's the matter, buddy?

675
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,889
You e-mail me from Baltimore.
Let me know how it goes.

676
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:03,091
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of needle
sticks and an endless supply of tests.

677
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,568
You'll be fine. Fly safe.

678
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,368
Yeah, I hope they let me on the plane
with a week's worth of urine samples.

679
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,369
Go on and pack,
sweetie. We leave early.

680
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:19,446
Hey, thanks for today, Tony.

681
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,384
- I had a great time.
- My pleasure, buddy.

682
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,892
I don't know how to thank you.

683
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,901
I haven't seen him
that happy in so long.

684
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,901
It was nothing.

685
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,596
No.

686
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,473
It was most
definitely something.

687
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,652
I'll probably be up
packing all night.

688
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,862
I better go home. I have
an early shift tomorrow.

689
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,767
- Will you keep me posted?
- Yeah, we will.

690
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,238
Good night, Tony.

691
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,491
<i>Hi, Abby. This is Sally in
Dr. Murphy's office. Just a reminder...</i>

692
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:43,362
<i>that you have an appointment
with the hygienist, Friday at 9 a.m.</i>

693
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,368
Hello?

694
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,515
<i>Would you like to lower your
interest rate by 2.</i>5 <i>percent?</i>

695
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,242
- No, I'm not interested.
<i>- Hear me out, here.</i>

696
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:01,909
<i>We offer debt consolidation...</i>
