00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,903
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,736
Ready for crash innovation?

3
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,604
I'm in love with you.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,438
I don't know why
I'm being so crazy?

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,013
I don't know why
I couldn't tell you.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,377
Because we've become friends.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,180
Started out with 14, now they're
down to five. But you're still standing.

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,449
But nothing will make them
focus on you like getting an offer.

9
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,456
Headhunters? Why?
You're leaving us?

10
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,452
I have to move out.

11
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,194
You're gonna save her. You're
gonna save her right here.

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,094
Right now or no one's leaving.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,613
But I don't know
what else to tell you.

14
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,648
It's up to you.

15
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,785
I got nothing.

16
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,489
No, I'm sleeping fine,
work's good, I'm good.

17
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,356
Surprised, you
know, that I'm okay.

18
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,692
Didn't think I would
be. I mean, who would?

19
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,966
But I am.

20
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,071
Hostage situations
are very traumatizing.

21
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,333
Especially when
there's a fatality involved.

22
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,239
Yeah. No doubt, no doubt.

23
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:26,016
- Are we done?
- If you wanna be.

24
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,982
- Okay, then, yeah, yeah.
- I'm here anytime, Dr. Morris.

25
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,993
Feel free to drop by or call
and set up an appointment.

26
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,562
Whatever.

27
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,327
I don't wanna go
to school today.

28
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,531
Well, I don't wanna have
surgery today, but look at me.

29
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,870
Come here, give
Mommy a kiss. Come here.

30
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,504
All right, babe. Be back in an hour.
- Mm-hm.

31
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,410
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

32
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,983
Be good today. CHRIS: I will.

33
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,089
You all right?

34
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,289
Yeah, yeah. Fourth
time's the charm, right?

35
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,429
Yep. I think I heard
that somewhere too.

36
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,537
So you've been at County
since you were a nurse, right?

37
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,604
- Well, you must like it here.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,640
Amazing people. It's hard to
imagine being anyplace else.

39
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,711
- Well, it feels like home?
- Yeah, sad but true.

40
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,110
Yeah, I did some time
in a county hospital.

41
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,719
In the trenches, the adrenaline.
It's great and frustrating.

42
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,755
Constantly fighting the system or
trapped in some bureaucratic quagmire.

43
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,327
- Am I right?
- Yeah. You're pretty right.

44
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,453
Here, no bureaucracy,
no broken system.

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,498
Just the best care we can
provide every patient we treat.

46
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,465
I mean, County's a dinosaur.

47
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,298
We'd love to have you
come here in the 21st century.

48
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,440
That sound like something
you might be interested in?

49
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,236
Yes, definitely.

50
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,145
- Usual wound dressing?
- Excellent work, Nurse Taggart.

51
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,077
So when do you
get your next break?

52
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,086
Again? Wow.

53
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,125
- I'll come meet you in a half an hour?
- Okay.

54
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,194
Hey, Frank, can you get
me a V/Q scan for Exam 2?

55
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,194
Do I not look busy to you?

56
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,765
Figured out how to beat
the computer at solitaire?

57
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,097
If you have to know, I'm adjusting
the patient through-put database.

58
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,439
Always ask your nurse
for preemptive orders.

59
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,472
You won't have to
wait for an attending.

60
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,474
- Thank you, Chuny.
- You're welcome.

61
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,808
Do you have the PowerPoint CD
and the notes for the conference?

62
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,108
- Check and check. RANDALL:
Go away from me, woman!

63
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,774
Put the gown on!

64
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,351
Hey! DAWN: Mr. Randall.

65
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,045
- You owe me 5 bucks!
- Mr. Randall!

66
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,556
- You're presenting at the conference?
- Yeah, hemostatic resuscitation.

67
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,524
- Sounds boring.
- Did I do this right?

68
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,528
Hey, I'd like to introduce a
new fourth year, Kaya Montoya.

69
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,131
Hi. SAM: Hi, I'm Sam.

70
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,961
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Chuny.

71
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,660
Kaya comes to us from the
University of New Mexico.

72
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,533
Be gentle. It's her first day.

73
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,970
- You're a Lobo, huh?
- Sure am.

74
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,508
I'm a big fan. Spent a
lot of time there as a kid.

75
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:07,341
- Used to go to football games.
- My dad has season tickets.

76
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,542
Hi.

77
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,650
What time did you leave? I must
have fallen asleep. Red wine...

78
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,553
Dr. Montoya, care to assist
me on a corneal foreign body?

79
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,853
- Mr. Randall.
- "No" means "no"!

80
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,689
No. Ugh!

81
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,858
What? You couldn't
wait a half hour?

82
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,343
BP, 175/100.

83
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,312
I know my pressure's
high. I ran out of my pills.

84
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:47,079
Yeah, for the third time. The ER
is not the place to go for med refills.

85
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,916
- Bless you.
- Oh, God bless you.

86
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,150
My doctor died five years ago and
I haven't found another one I like.

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,990
- I can refer you to the county clinic.
- Oh, six months' wait.

88
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,190
Don't know if you
noticed, sweet cakes...

89
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,268
but time ain't
exactly on my side.

90
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,334
Oh, it's okay, Purdy. Come
on, come on. It's okay, it's okay.

91
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,772
Hey, you are not supposed
to have that in here.

92
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,037
Oh, she's just a baby.

93
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,341
You know what? I'm gonna give you
a two-week supply of meds, no refills.

94
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,020
Get a regular doctor.

95
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,214
Abby, got a couple rigs coming
in. Brenner told me to get you.

96
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,552
You qualify for Medicare.
We'll find somebody.

97
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,785
Won't find anyone I like.

98
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,898
Can you make sure Social
Work gets down here?

99
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,297
Bless you.

100
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,464
Who has 27 cats?

101
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:42,200
That's disgusting. I hate
cats. Did I mention that?

102
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,709
- So, what's up, girl? How are you doing?
- I'm fine. This will go away.

103
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,044
No, I mean with you.
Something's on your mind. I can tell.

104
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,210
No, not more than usual, really.

105
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,821
- Is it Luka?
- No.

106
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,687
Well, yeah. But
it's not just that.

107
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,988
- I got a job offer.
- What? Where?

108
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,860
- Payton Medical Center.
- Ooh. Fancy.

109
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,365
Don't you go and
get all stuck up on us.

110
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,901
It is nice.

111
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,768
- Bet the pay is nice too.
- Pay's good, the hours are good.

112
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,843
They use a portion of their profits
to provide free care to the uninsured.

113
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,776
- It's all good.
- Wow, look at you, girl.

114
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,348
I remember back when
we were nurses together.

115
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,452
And now, you're about to
go off and be an attending.

116
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,920
- I'm happy for you. I'm proud too.
- Thanks, Chuny.

117
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,217
Glad you could join us.

118
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,231
- Got here soon as I could.
- Of course.

119
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,192
Says her name's Lois. She
was staggering, she passed out.

120
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,458
- Is she drunk?
- Nothing on the breath. No head trauma.

121
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,932
One-fifty over 90.
Normal time's at 62.

122
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,799
You been partying,
Lois? We got this one.

123
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,566
- What do you got?
- Manny Bonilla, male truck driver.

124
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,107
Swerved to avoid the lady.

125
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,109
You're gonna want four units of O-neg,
a surgery consult, auto versus pole...

126
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:59,447
abdominal and pelvic
trauma. All right. On my count.

127
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,487
One, two, three.

128
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,455
- Hi, I'm Dr. Morris.
- I'm Manny.

129
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,993
Uh, trauma panel,
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

130
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,289
- UA and 12 lead?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,830
I can't believe this.

132
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,628
One second, I'm driving
along, minding my business...

133
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,503
and there she is, right
in the middle of the street.

134
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,403
- I got the HemoCue.
- Scleral icterus. Bradying to 55.

135
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,478
- Slow heart rate. That why she fainted?
- No, her BP's fine.

136
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,081
CBC, chem panel,
type and hold, coags.

137
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,514
Go through her stuff,
see if there's any family.

138
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,517
Kaya, do you
appreciate the jaundice?

139
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,247
- HemoCue, 11.2. BRENNER:
How do we put it all together?

140
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,448
- Maybe she...
- I didn't ask you, Laverne.

141
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,921
Put the patient in a gown.

142
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,186
- Is it a head bleed?
- No, no sign of trauma.

143
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,624
But we do have asterixis.

144
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,299
Jaundice means liver.
What lab's gonna help us?

145
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,832
No.

146
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,095
- ALT?
- It's ammonia.

147
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,034
That's right. So
she may have...?

148
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,935
Encephalopathy
from liver failure?

149
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,440
Very good. Forty-five
cc's of oral lactulose.

150
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,771
- You're quite the teacher.
- You should try it.

151
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,039
Oh, I teach. I'm
just very selective.

152
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,987
- Distal aorta's closed. Clamp.
- EBL, 250 cc's. Pressure is good.

153
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,237
- It's not pretty.
- How did this happen?

154
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,454
Just one of those things.
- O.R. 2.

155
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,188
- Send this for cultures.
- ICU's got a postop heart...

156
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,891
bleeding through the chest tube.
- Be right there.

157
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,559
You'll what? DUBENKO:
Yup. The hard stuff's done.

158
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,329
Keep the heparin at 18
cc's per kilo per hour...

159
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,635
and check coags
P4. You'll be fine.

160
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,007
- Okay, hip's back in.
- Pressure's up to 130/82.

161
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,176
All right, have Surgery meet
him at the CT to review the scan.

162
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,754
I need to go up to
Psych for my debriefing.

163
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,153
Total waste of time. I don't know
why they're making it mandatory.

164
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,591
I don't mind. That man
could have killed us all.

165
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,527
You know these people
out here are crazy.

166
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,759
Your liver is pretty
damaged, Lois.

167
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,835
Have you had a fever?

168
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,903
No, just weak and achy for a
few weeks. Thought it was the flu.

169
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,067
Okay, everybody goes
right to hep A and B.

170
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,236
You should consider
other infectious etiologies...

171
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:11,044
Mm-hm. Like CMV, HSV,
paramyxovirus, hemorrhagic fever.

172
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,187
I'll send serologies. Are you
on any prescription medication?

173
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,599
What kinds were
you thinking about?

174
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,182
Certain antibiotics.

175
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,123
Antivirals, antidepressants,
oral hypoglycemics...

176
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,729
seizure meds, and NSAIDs.

177
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,634
I gave grand rounds on
fulminant hepatic failure last year.

178
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,261
Grand rounds?

179
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,100
- I guess I don't have to teach you.
- I guess you don't.

180
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,265
How long am I gonna
be? I work tonight.

181
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,610
You're probably gonna have to
stay in the hospital for a little while.

182
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,408
We went ahead and
contacted your family.

183
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,647
- You what?
- We found your wallet.

184
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,620
Our clerk was able to get in touch
with your mom, and she's on her way.

185
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,122
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry, we'll figure this out.

186
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,059
You had no right to go through
my things. I don't want anyone here.

187
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,088
Well, you're pretty sick, and...

188
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,757
I'm fine on my own. I
don't need any help.

189
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,436
Everybody needs
some help sometimes.

190
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,971
Nothing to be ashamed of.

191
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,971
Saline at the splenic flexure.
She's got some abscesses.

192
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,237
Fourth liter's up.

193
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,643
Crap. I think the bowel's
perfed. Page Dubenko.

194
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,575
You nick it removing the graft?
- Injury's old and ratty.

195
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,176
Maybe we missed
it. Page Lucien yet?

196
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,346
Yeah. What do you
wanna do? GIA stapler?

197
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,449
Lesion's less than 30 percent.

198
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,653
Better off with débridement
and primary closure.

199
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,061
Okay, 15 blade pickups
and 3-0 vicryl. Let's go.

200
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,536
I'm keeping my hand in the
midline. Now elicit a fluid wipe.

201
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,972
Laverne, would you mind calling
the lab for our results, please?

202
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:48,212
After that, I'll show you how
to check for urine bilinogen.

203
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,611
So, Lois, you said you first
got sick a few weeks ago?

204
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,816
You live with somebody?

205
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,482
Alone. I left home
a long time ago.

206
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,563
Abby? I've got the mother here.

207
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,895
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart. Lois
passed out on the crosswalk.

208
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,366
We think she's having
problems with her liver.

209
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,596
Lois? Who is Lois?
Where is my son?

210
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,803
- I'm sorry?
- I'm Edith Landry.

211
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,503
They said you had my son, Loni.

212
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,405
I'm right here, Mom.

213
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,958
- Let's get Pete's Village.
- No, no, let's get some beef.

214
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,830
- You guys like sweet peppers or hot?
- Both.

215
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,903
Me too. And dip twice.

216
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,836
Shut up. You're
making me hungry.

217
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,601
I haven't had
normal food in days.

218
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,142
You got a little fever.

219
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,747
I've had a fever for weeks.

220
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,907
- I'm not worried.
- Good. We'll check back in a bit, okay?

221
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,178
Thank you.

222
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,281
Why's she still spiking?

223
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,323
It's to be expected when you've
manipulated infected tissue.

224
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,427
Fever, shifting vital signs.
All part of the healing process.

225
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,757
Should have done a
resection and anastomosis.

226
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,458
- Primary repair was the right thing.
- Maybe my sutures were too loose.

227
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,658
Stop it.

228
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,272
I've watched you do primary repair
of a bowel perf a hundred times.

229
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,102
- But I just can't be positive...
- Neela, you stepped up.

230
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,641
You made the right calls.

231
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,780
I told you I didn't
want anyone here.

232
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,514
She's upset.

233
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,154
You know, sometimes...

234
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,899
the people closest are the ones that
have the hardest time with the truth.

235
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,410
I'll be right back.

236
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,712
Don't worry. Look, we'll talk
about it when I get home, okay?

237
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,652
Okay. Bye.

238
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,887
That was my husband.

239
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,361
I lied to him.

240
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,833
He doesn't know
that Loni is here.

241
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,401
We're not sure yet, but
I think her liver is failing.

242
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,703
- Her?
- I know. It's a lot, I know.

243
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:38,514
When you people called
me, you said my son was here.

244
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:42,416
There was a driver's license
in the personal belongings bag.

245
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:46,525
Our clerk used it to
contact you. We had no idea.

246
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,398
Loni always had a
flair for the dramatic.

247
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,441
We woke up one
morning six years ago...

248
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,170
and he was just gone.

249
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,545
My strange, sweet little boy...

250
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,148
just gone.

251
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,777
He never had many friends,
you know. Kept to himself.

252
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,418
His father, they
never saw eye to eye.

253
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,322
Um...

254
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,505
I have to go check on
some of Loni's tests.

255
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,107
But you can go in there
if you like. I'm sure...

256
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,768
your child could
use the company.

257
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,811
- What are you doing?
- I don't see anything.

258
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,649
- Surveillance footage.
- Right there.

259
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:53,259
Charlie's crew caught some couple
knocking boots all over the hospital.

260
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,122
I've seen more
steam in a shower.

261
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,126
You don't see the
gyrating? Look.

262
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,788
- Is that a leg?
- We gotta get the picture enhanced...

263
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,366
bring up the sound levels.

264
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,799
- You've got cameras wired for sound?
- Some.

265
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,496
- God.
- What a tease.

266
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,540
Hey, Morris, you need
to sign off on my CHFer.

267
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,507
- What are you guys looking at?
- Surveillance footage.

268
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,394
Of what?

269
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:16,672
People getting busy
all over the hospital.

270
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,784
- What?
- No idea who they are, huh?

271
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,975
Uh-uh.

272
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,884
Well, hang onto the DVD, look
again, see if you recognize anyone.

273
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,523
Will do.

274
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,622
That look like sex to you?
- Yeah.

275
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,796
- I mean, no.
- Well, not good sex, anyway.

276
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,454
Hey, Morris, I gotta go to
Psych to do my debriefing.

277
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,624
- Did you do yours yet?
- Yeah, it was lame.

278
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,703
Hey, Gates, come here a sec.

279
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,537
What?

280
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,231
It's surveillance footage
of people having sex...

281
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,240
in different rooms
in the hospital.

282
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,007
I know it's been a long, but
that does not look like sex to me.

283
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,546
Frank, I've been waiting forever
on LFTs. Can you check on that?

284
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,020
- Yeah. Sure.
- Hey, do you have a minute?

285
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,682
Yeah. Come on, walk with me.

286
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:03,694
- What's going on with the attending job?
- You still haven't heard anything yet?

287
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,923
- I got another job offer.
- What? Where?

288
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,431
Payton Medical Center.
They want an answer today.

289
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,730
- Can't you get them to wait?
- They've been waiting for two weeks.

290
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,397
- Get them to wait one more day.
- You told me to get out there, so I did.

291
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,373
I need a plan or
end up in Lubbock.

292
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,207
Abby, got Lois' labs back. They put
them in the system under the wrong name.

293
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,110
Bilirubin's, 8. AST, 10,000.

294
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,184
Look, I'll get an
answer as soon as I can.

295
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:34,318
Mrs. Landry, I
got the test results.

296
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,459
That's him.

297
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,199
- Abby, just got the coags. ProTime's 96.
- Okay, hang an FFP.

298
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,966
- What's happening?
- We give plasma because her liver...

299
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,043
is not making proteins to clot
blood. I need to talk to her about this.

300
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,203
I think you should come.

301
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,315
Last HemoCue was 11.

302
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,320
Okay, stay ahead.
Four pack cells.

303
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,253
Hi, Mom.

304
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,894
It's just me.

305
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,496
Don't worry, your
father's not coming.

306
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:20,631
It's been so long. You
didn't call or even write.

307
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,306
I didn't know what to say.

308
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,570
We didn't know where you were.

309
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,442
If you were even alive.

310
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,510
Six years.

311
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,685
I'm sorry. Please,
don't hate me.

312
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,459
Honey, honey, I
could never hate you.

313
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,800
Lois. Lois?

314
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,873
Your test results show
that you're in liver failure.

315
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,510
Do you take hormones?

316
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,804
Estrogen injections,
twice a week.

317
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,347
Where do you get them?

318
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,614
- From a friend of a friend.
- A doctor?

319
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,915
It's this guy who brings them
back from Mexico. They're...

320
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,826
They're way cheaper. I'm
just trying to save money.

321
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,394
That's okay. Is there a
way we can get a sample?

322
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,497
Do you have any at home?

323
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,359
I have a vial in my
purse. I had it with me.

324
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,629
It's right here.

325
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,211
I'm sorry. I know
they're in here.

326
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,937
There.

327
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,316
- Can you get that to Toxicology?
- Yeah.

328
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,390
- You think it's the estrogen.
- We'll find out.

329
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,858
Have you had the
reassignment surgery yet?

330
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,826
No. That's what
I'm saving up for.

331
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
Hey, Abby, can you
wait till next Wednesday?

332
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,329
They only do gas
chromatography once a week.

333
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,336
- Since when?
- Since budget cuts.

334
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,700
I love County.

335
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,741
What do you mean
you didn't get it?

336
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,072
- Do I have to get it myself?
- No, I'll get it.

337
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,215
- It's right there on the desk.
- I see it.

338
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:13,217
Aren't you the cutest thing. Oh!

339
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,720
You going soft on me, Frank?
- Well, look at the face.

340
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,552
- Not doing it for me.
- Let me see, let me see.

341
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,023
- Please.
- Oh, that's so...

342
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,219
What's the matter with you?
- I'll get it.

343
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,076
No, I'll get it. - I'll get it.

344
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,895
No, I've got it. Scram.
You've done enough.

345
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,698
Dr. Gates, broken-arm
kid is ready to go.

346
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,775
- All right.
- Oh, my God, look how cute.

347
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,502
Her name is Purdy.

348
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,249
- Mrs. Gaines, what are you doing here?
- Stretching my legs.

349
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,116
Well, you left me
back there for forever.

350
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:50,416
I wrote the discharge at 10 a.m. What
does it take to send someone home?

351
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,423
- What? You forget where you work?
- Would you mind?

352
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,595
- Right this way, ma'am.
- Thank you, miss.

353
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,390
Messenger from Payton
picked up your toxicology sample.

354
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,726
Abby, Lois is vomiting blood.

355
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,834
- Suction's on high.
- Push the pack cells.

356
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,162
What's happening?

357
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,340
- She had FFP?
- Two units.

358
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,101
Call GI. We're gonna heat
coagulate with an endoscope.

359
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,076
All right, hold on. Let's use
recombinant factor VIII-A.

360
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,578
It's a brand new drug.

361
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,082
It can normalize the PT in
20 minutes if the FFP fails.

362
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,587
Okay, grand rounds, your show.

363
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,960
Sensitivities on Sheryl Hawkins.

364
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,290
Cultures came back
positive for Acinetobacter.

365
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,933
Resistant to vanco, imipenem
Nasalide, everything...

366
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,762
- What are you doing?
- Calling ID

367
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,769
- There must be another
drug - No, Neela, there's not

368
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,541
She is septic If we can't
treat this, we lose her

369
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,472
I understand that

370
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,771
- Why are you not upset?
- Who says I'm not?

371
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,677
- I don't need to indulge it -
What do you suggest I do?

372
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,785
Take a deep breath, gather
yourself, and go back in there

373
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,184
and find out how
aggressive she wants us to be

374
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,559
Hey there How are you feeling?

375
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,226
The same

376
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,366
Eyes and nose look good

377
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,541
How's PCA working
out? You in any pain?

378
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,010
No Should that have changed?

379
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,639
Not necessarily

380
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,014
You already did your
rounds Why are you back?

381
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,981
I've been here a month
You never just check in

382
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,490
Well, there's a first
time for everything

383
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,023
Neela

384
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,390
I'm a mother of four

385
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:45,498
Do you really think I don't know
when someone's not telling the truth?

386
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,902
Where's your family?

387
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,437
Getting lunch

388
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,546
We should get them back

389
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,591
- Angi output has slowed down -
Looks like your factor VIII-A worked

390
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,730
Repeat CBC and coags

391
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,660
Abby, this is Mr. Landry

392
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,233
And a Dr. Jensen called
Said he'd try your cell

393
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,401
Mike MIKE: Edith I
told you not to come

394
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,631
You said, "Hospital"
I thought you got hurt

395
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,570
- Look, I'm fine ABBY:
Keep her NPO, D5

396
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,142
What's going? If you're
okay, what are you doing?

397
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,836
Mr. Landry, I'm Dr. Lockhart

398
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,982
And maybe you two might wanna
talk about this outside, okay?

399
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,618
Chuny, show them the family room?
- Sure thing

400
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,687
- Wanna follow me this way, please?
- Check your KUB film and do plasma

401
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,990
This case got more
interesting, didn't it?

402
00:22:39,014 --> 00:22:39,624
You got this?

403
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,658
Absolutely

404
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,963
Hi Dr. Jensen, hi

405
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,827
Listen, I really appreciate
you running that for me

406
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,960
Our lab is It's a mess, you know

407
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,800
Yeah, about that I need
to ask you for a favor

408
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,175
Yeah, I...

409
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:02,008
I was hoping that you would give
me one more day to make a decision

410
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,006
Yeah, I know, I know I...

411
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,950
Right now?

412
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,021
No, you're right,
you're right Yeah

413
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,193
I accept

414
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,154
Yeah

415
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,500
I'll take the job

416
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,000
Sats only 77 on 100 percent

417
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:27,799
Lungs are wet Send a blood gas
and get her on a non-rebreather

418
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,503
Translation, please

419
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:37,839
The infection is causing
fluid to collect in your lungs

420
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,083
So, what now?

421
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:47,284
Without a breathing tube,
your oxygen will continue to drop

422
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,653
and you'll eventually
fall into a comatose state

423
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,066
Get the tube

424
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,535
Okay, then

425
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,303
Give me the tube

426
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,079
But you don't think
it's a good idea?

427
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,821
You won't be able to talk

428
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,727
You got a point there Yeah

429
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,393
Sheryl

430
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,097
if we put this tube in,
we may never get it out

431
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:34,203
So I shouldn't even
try to get better?

432
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:38,366
It's not a matter of trying
The antibiotics aren't working

433
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:45,384
Maybe my immune system
can fight the infection on its own

434
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,052
It would take a miracle

435
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,214
I believe in those

436
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:02,065
I need to be sure you
understand exactly what I'm saying

437
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:11,370
If I don't try, what
does that say?

438
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,805
That's what I teach my kids

439
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,819
Put the bed... I want the bed up

440
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,122
I want you to be in my blog

441
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:33,026
Can't say no Can't say no

442
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,466
Course I... Okay

443
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,596
Hi Hi, everyone

444
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:48,180
This is the beautiful

445
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:54,145
and talented Dr. Neela Rasgotra

446
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,885
She's the one always
avoiding the camera

447
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,930
She saved my life

448
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,729
- Don't you say that - What
the hell am I supposed to say?

449
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,233
Excuse me

450
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:14,202
We got the toxicology
results back It's not great news

451
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,074
Okay

452
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:30,687
The estrogen you've been
injecting contains tetrachloroethane

453
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,485
It's an organic solvent
extremely toxic to the liver

454
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,690
How can we fix it?

455
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:39,696
Well, the medicine I
gave is only a temporary fix

456
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,163
It's okay to look at me, Dad

457
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,170
Lois

458
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,741
Lois

459
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:03,014
I don't think your liver can
recover from the damage

460
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:07,592
We've already seen bleeding
complications, encephalopathy

461
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:13,027
If it's very serious, it can
cause seizures, a coma or death

462
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,202
So, what do we do?

463
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,270
Your best hope is
for a liver transplant

464
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,268
- Transplant?
- How do we do that?

465
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,642
There's some kind of list, right?
- Yes

466
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,745
But that could take a long time

467
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:35,046
There's something called LDLT
If a family member or a friend

468
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,247
is a tissue match, they can
donate a portion of their liver

469
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,756
Siblings have the highest
odds of being a match

470
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:44,590
- We don't have any other children -
The odds are also good for a parent

471
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,994
- We're not doing
that Let's go - Mike

472
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,101
Damn it, Edith, no We're leaving

473
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,070
Mr. Landry, please
- Please, what?

474
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,743
You're her only parents
You already lost her once

475
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,903
- How many times I gotta say no?
- You're gonna let her die?

476
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,638
- I'll do it - Edith

477
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:09,112
I'll do it Test me

478
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,414
- Frank?
- Hm?

479
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:16,551
If you're not too busy, could
you help me with something?

480
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,655
I need somebody big and strong

481
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,289
to help me put a box
on a shelf in Sutures

482
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,926
- Okay, Sam -
Chivalry's not dead

483
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,632
Oh, I have to forward the phones

484
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,671
For the back pain, I have
an MVA waiting on LS films

485
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,873
Got a guy in Exam
2 who is pain-free

486
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,143
Troponin is negative
Last but not least

487
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,517
first-trimester bleed, ultrasound
and quant-beta HCG pending

488
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:46,887
Hey, so I heard you
made the short list for chief

489
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,118
- When's your final interview?
- Next week

490
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,230
- You ready? You got your game face?
- Oh, yeah, I'm good

491
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,832
- Where you going, anyway?
- It's personal, Morris

492
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,993
Ooh Okay International
man of mystery

493
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,197
All right, it's Bettina She
needs a few things and can't wait

494
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,638
- Postop things - Cupcakes
worked, didn't they?

495
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,901
It's cool Don't give me credit

496
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,377
My advice worked I know you
know And I know you know I know

497
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:13,007
- Hey, Pratt Did you talk to Anspaugh?
- No I haven't had a chance Why?

498
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:15,916
- Because I took the
other job - What? Why?

499
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,216
They wouldn't give me another
day And it's a really good job

500
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,691
All right, look, I gotta go, but
when I get back, we're gonna fix this

501
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,832
Okay, everyone,
let's get started

502
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,504
The five-year war in Iraq hasn't
yielded weapons of mass destruction

503
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,869
but it has given us some
advances in trauma resuscitation

504
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,438
Hemostatic
resuscitation is about

505
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:41,910
replacing coagulation
factors and platelets early

506
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,611
So soldiers who received
plasma on a one-to-one ratio

507
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,754
with PRBC transfusion,
have lower mortality

508
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,053
Lights, please

509
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,070
<i>You're such a tiger.</i>

510
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,263
<i>Is it coming?</i>

511
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:00,592
<i>- Louder.
- You're a tiger.</i>

512
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,029
<i>- What?
- Yes.</i>

513
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,032
That's my kind of presentation

514
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,467
<i>- That's how tigers play.
- That's right.</i>

515
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:07,799
<i>Oh, mama.</i>

516
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,474
- Hey - Hey Got everything

517
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:14,772
Drainable pouches, no-stink
prep wipes, Stomahesive powder

518
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,744
You romantic fool

519
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,941
So you need anything?
I gotta get back

520
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,710
- More water?
- Sure

521
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,190
Oh, with ice, please

522
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,121
Sure, no problem

523
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,459
- Is there anything else I can get you?
- Kiss, please

524
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:42,400
So I was thinking, I should
stay here for a few days

525
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,403
Why?

526
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:48,809
Look, we both know that you
shouldn't be alone right now

527
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,246
I can sleep here on the couch
and tend to your every need

528
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:58,818
And not because I'm supposed
to, but because I want to

529
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,221
- Get it?
- Got it

530
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,720
Good

531
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,091
Come here

532
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,534
I missed you, Mommy
I missed you too

533
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,873
Mrs. Landry, we got
your lab results back

534
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,641
- And they show you are a
tissue match - Oh, thank God

535
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,148
How soon can we start?
- We can't

536
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:29,311
The tests also show
that you have cirrhosis

537
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,488
I used to be a drinker but I thought
I was okay I haven't been sick

538
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,557
You are okay now, but it's
too risky for you to donate

539
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,232
- Mr. Landry...?
- Don't say it

540
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,731
Mike MARQUEZ: V-tach, no pulse

541
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,034
She's still ours
ABBY: Charging 300

542
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,866
That is not my kid

543
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,064
Clear - I don't know who that is

544
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,574
No change - Mike Don't
you walk out of here

545
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,974
She's still ours, Mike

546
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,513
Pulse is V-tach ABBY: All right

547
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:03,678
Continue compressions
Intubation kit, 80 ET tube and suction

548
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:11,026
Chuny, what was her last creatinine?
- Two-point-nine

549
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,525
All right, push
an amp of calcium

550
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,326
- On the outer...
- Just push it

551
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,196
Can I have a crash cart?

552
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,033
Were you thinking hypokalemia?
- Hypo what?

553
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,074
- Too much potassium -
You said it was her heart

554
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,734
She's had six units of
blood A huge potassium load

555
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,846
If she's in hepatorenal
syndrome?

556
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,983
Kidneys can't clear
Her heart will stop

557
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,640
Oh, God ABBY: Calcium's in

558
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:35,049
All right, hold compressions

559
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,354
- Got a pulse - Nice work, Abby

560
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,995
Amp of D50, amp of
bicarb, 10 units of insulin

561
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,030
- Pressure, 100/60
- Oh, thank God

562
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,862
- Oh, thank you -
Great work, guys

563
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,367
All right, send out a
chem panel and call Renal

564
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,516
- He's okay, right?
- Lois is in critical condition

565
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:10,520
She's gonna keep arresting
or die until she gets a new liver

566
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,731
Hey, what's up, man?
What are you doing out here?

567
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,266
Oh, it's slow Just
taking a breather

568
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:27,202
So how'd that trauma
conference go?

569
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,467
Oh, probably the best one ever

570
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,271
- Really?
- Oh, yeah

571
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,913
How's Bettina?

572
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,744
She's a little sore,
but she'll be all right

573
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,047
You did the right
thing going back to her

574
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,623
Well, actually, it's weird You
know, I've never felt like this before

575
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:51,991
I used to think that falling in love
was like getting sick or something

576
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,132
So we try to avoid it, right?

577
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,632
I know what you mean

578
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:03,397
You know, I was thinking about
the thing that happened to you

579
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,235
- You know, the
hostage thing - Oh, yeah?

580
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,574
Yeah, well, you know
how things like that go

581
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,684
You keep thinking about them,
even when you don't want to

582
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,751
So if you wanna talk,
man, it's cool with me

583
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,853
What is there to talk about?

584
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:27,330
I don't know It's just sometimes
it helps I know I've had to do it

585
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:34,133
So if you want, you could talk to
me or somebody more qualified

586
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,366
There's no shame in that

587
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:40,440
You know, I already did their
mandatory little psych debrief

588
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,843
I don't need it I'm good

589
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:48,276
All right Cool I'll
see you inside

590
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,350
Oh, that's right, tiger Yes, yes

591
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,360
- No way - We kid
you not It was great

592
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,625
- I didn't know you had it in you
- Yeah, now you do, you all do

593
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,894
Sorry, still doesn't
look like sex to me

594
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,503
Oh, my favorite part
was the linen cart

595
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,231
All right You know what?

596
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,479
There You got us
Gates is my boyfriend

597
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,741
Are you happy now? Show's
over! Now go back to work

598
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,546
Yeah, what she said

599
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,189
Cover for me, will you? I
gotta go see Uncle Donny

600
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,723
Sure I've been covering
all day Why stop now?

601
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,985
Dr. Brenner, we're
ready to present

602
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,129
The dutiful young fourth years

603
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,766
- I'm all ears Present away -
Fifty-six-year old woman with a history...

604
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,664
Let's start with the chief
complaint that brought her in

605
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:41,534
Chief complaint is "headache,
backache, nausea, dizziness..."

606
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,038
That's four complaints

607
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,676
Go back and find out
what the biggest problem is

608
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,745
Kaya, take a look
at the nosebleed in 2

609
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,744
- We're gonna pack
it together - Okay

610
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,712
Dr. Brenner

611
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,883
Yes?

612
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,180
Why are you
treating me like this?

613
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,588
Look at me

614
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,262
Well, what the hell
was last night, huh?

615
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,522
Boring

616
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,897
To be honest, dull,
mundane, mechanical

617
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,595
Thank God I had two
bottles of Bordeaux in me

618
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,765
I thought you'd be a better
student in bed than you are here

619
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,139
but I guess the Bordeaux
helped with that as well

620
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,780
You don't wanna see me? Fine

621
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,609
But you still have to teach me

622
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:28,413
For that to be possible, you'd
actually have to have the ability to learn

623
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,156
- I could get you
fired for this - Really?

624
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,622
And risk sullying that
spotless reputation

625
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:38,490
to become the student that sleeps
with attendings and then rats them out?

626
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,928
That would be
something, wouldn't it?

627
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,336
You can fill out all the
admit papers up in the ICU

628
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,000
Nurse Marquez
will show you there

629
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,282
I think she's saying thank you

630
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,644
Hey, Mr. Landry, can I
talk to you for a second?

631
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,323
The people you love, they
can't always help who they are

632
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:15,456
And they do stuff we don't understand
But you have to try and get past that

633
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,329
Especially when they need you

634
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,639
Okay

635
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,372
Okay There is a clinical trial
It's called a bioartificial liver...

636
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:37,752
Okay Okay I'll donate if I can

637
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,322
How do I get tested?

638
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,060
We could do it here

639
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,019
<i>Come here my love. Come here.</i>

640
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,354
<i>You got no moves, Dad.</i>

641
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,519
<i>He's got moves.</i>

642
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,222
<i>Shake it, baby.</i> CLETUS: <i>Yeah.</i>

643
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,630
<i>- Those are moves. Those are moves.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

644
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,335
<i>Look at Mom move.</i>

645
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,329
Family seems
to be taking it well

646
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,623
Should have been in
attending this morning

647
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,892
- Would have been the
same - You don't know

648
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,298
Been operating with
you three years I do know

649
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:35,998
- The patient in the ICU would have
died - What? So instead it's Sheryl?

650
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,636
You're emotional
because you got close

651
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,075
That's okay But it's
clouding your judgment

652
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,839
If wanting her to get the
best treatment is clouded

653
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,347
then, yes, you're right

654
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,111
You could have approached
the perf differently

655
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,016
- I can't be sure I got all
the abscesses - Stop, okay?

656
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:55,092
I know what it's like to be close
But you're not a little intern anymore

657
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,923
I expect you to handle bad
outcomes like a professional

658
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,588
What does that mean? I
should stop giving a damn?

659
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,824
No, it means, no matter
how much we care

660
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,835
sometimes the people
we try to save die

661
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,940
Are you trying to
rationalize this?

662
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,872
Because we both know you
should never have left that room

663
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,909
That's enough

664
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:17,705
Please, there are more patients
than there are doctors in this place

665
