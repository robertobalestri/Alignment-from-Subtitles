1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,352
Is it okay if I stop
by the apartment?

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,909
Sure. You've got
some stuff in the closet.

4
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,604
Where have you
been? I was worried.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,990
I wanted to say thanks
for suggesting I look

6
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:19,346
into the transfer
program. I'm going for it.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,453
You're one of those
smart girls, aren't you?

8
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:22,477
You just noticed?

9
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,484
Why do you do that? - Do what?

10
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:29,859
Drink in front of me. You never once asked
was that okay or did that bother me...

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,431
You used to have a problem.
You're much better now.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,327
My father died.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,444
Luka.

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,102
Is the stroller in the car?

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,273
No, it's down here
in the living room.

16
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,583
Can we carry it on the plane?

17
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,849
No.

18
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,584
We're gonna have
to check it at the gate.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,128
"And all through the house
not a creature was stirring...

20
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,890
not even a mouse."

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,768
Mouse.

22
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,903
Okay.

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,009
Hey, the flight's
at 10 tonight, right?

24
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,104
I'm gonna run errands.
Dry cleaners, bank.

25
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,611
It shouldn't take long.

26
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,148
No, sweetheart, you stay
here with Daddy, okay?

27
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,582
Let Daddy finish the book.
- Joe, let's go.

28
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:26,913
Look at the tree, huh?

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,455
Help me how to count
how many Santas we got.

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,529
- You okay?
- Yeah, are you?

31
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,459
Yeah.

32
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,227
I'll be back in an
hour or two, okay?

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,459
Bye.

34
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,805
Mama, mama, mama.

35
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,806
I saw <i>Frosty the
Snowman</i> on TV last night.

36
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,443
- It's December 6.
- I know.

37
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,637
By the time the Yuletide gets
here, you're already sick of it.

38
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,647
We work for the County,
they all gotta get equal time.

39
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,149
Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza.

40
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,015
Why can't people agree on
one date and be done with it?

41
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,679
Damn, what a messed up board.

42
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,155
Messed up floor. It's
like Calcutta around here.

43
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,760
Calcutta on a bad day.

44
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,023
We signed in 142
on the night shift.

45
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,326
- That's a new record.
- You must be proud.

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,493
I'm too tired to go home. I'm
gonna sleep in the call room.

47
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,797
Poor kid's a zombie.

48
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,997
A hundred and forty-two, huh?

49
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,642
Hey, we keep this thing
cranking, we could hit 300.

50
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,471
Yeah, that'd be
quite a milestone.

51
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,809
- Forget it.
- Never had over 250 in a 24-hour period.

52
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,040
Dream big, Frank.

53
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,653
We have to sign in, what, 14
patients an hour for the next 12 hours?

54
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,878
Never gonna happen.

55
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,955
Bet you 300 bucks we hit that
mark by the end of this shift.

56
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,389
- Too rich for me.
- No, you guys could split it.

57
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,619
Put up a hundred
each against my three.

58
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,855
- I'm in.
- Oh, Lord, when is he gonna learn?

59
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,968
Looks like I'm gonna be able to get the
wife that toaster she's been hinting for.

60
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,161
Frank, you romantic fool.

61
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,897
- Admin sent this down.
- Oh, put that by Trauma.

62
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,369
New portable CT scanner.

63
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,036
That's the holiday gift for the ER, in
lieu of the T-shirts we normally get.

64
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,874
Oh, too bad. I
love those shirts.

65
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,176
Hey, guys. Everybody
see my memo?

66
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,682
I saw your memo.

67
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,149
- What memo?
- What memo?

68
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,311
I'm going around to
all the departments...

69
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,219
and I'm doing blessing
ceremonies and memorials.

70
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,156
And today is the ER's turn.

71
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,492
Well, you know, that sounds
nice and very cleansing, but no.

72
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,691
- We're busy.
- It's not really our thing.

73
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,360
Yeah, why don't your try Oncology.
They love all that touchy-feely crap.

74
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,200
Come on, guys.
This could be cool.

75
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,171
Enlightening. Gratifying.

76
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,037
Don't shoot the kid down.

77
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,872
How open-minded
of you, Dr. Gates.

78
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,946
Thank you. I do my
best, Miss Dupree.

79
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,948
Good, so I'll see you all later.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,689
- Are you and her...?
- Wait a second.

81
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,381
Are you banging the chaplain?
- Pratt?

82
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,925
Hey, Pratt.

83
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,427
Yeah? SAM: Melissa Tanner, 61.

84
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,259
Restrained driver, TC
in respiratory distress.

85
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,096
- You're on the chopper today, huh?
- Logging hours, part of Transpo training.

86
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,135
- She's unresponsive.
- What's this scar?

87
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,399
Looks like a thoracotomy.
Sats are dropping.

88
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,408
All right, 100 percent
non-rebreather and a portable chest.

89
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,739
- Morris? MORRIS:
What do we got here?

90
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,710
That's her son, Lowell.

91
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,975
Down syndrome, facial
lac, a few contusions.

92
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,448
- Found walking on the scene.
- Is Mommy okay?

93
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,485
- Yeah, we're helping her now.
- Need me?

94
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,816
No, I got this.
Push some charts.

95
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,792
Harold?

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,087
Who are you
supposed to be, Merlin?

97
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,163
- I need a ladder out in the bay.
- You need a ladder for what?

98
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,129
Holy cow! Is that
what I think it is?

99
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,268
It's not a cow, no.

100
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,232
What is this?

101
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,066
We had a dress rehearsal
for a hospital holiday pageant.

102
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,903
Surgery got the Nativity scene.
- Congratulations.

103
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,570
And this camel they got from
somewhere bit Lucien on the leg.

104
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,739
Well, why the hell
did you bring it here?

105
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,976
Oh, we were just
down the street.

106
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,848
Well, we need to take a culture.

107
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,783
You need a shave.

108
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,858
There might be an exotic organism
that needs targeted therapy, so...

109
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,728
All right, let's
give this a shot.

110
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,034
My dad raised horses.

111
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,140
Allow me.

112
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,210
Okay, buddy, this
won't hurt. Just a little bit.

113
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,279
No, this will be easy. Come on.

114
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,343
Hold it. I'll
get it. I'll get it.

115
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,436
All right.

116
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,399
Let me just... All right.

117
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,837
Come here.

118
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,980
You know, I'm starting to think
this is not such a good idea.

119
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,616
Well, we've gotta
get a swab, Tony.

120
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,114
All right.

121
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,484
Easy there, big fellow.

122
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,256
Oh, Harold, can you grab my
phone from my back pocket?

123
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,127
Sure thing.

124
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,795
We'll still have noon
conference, Neela.

125
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,530
Make that fat embolus
presentation without me.

126
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,470
You have it on
your laptop, right?

127
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,802
"Missed call. Abby."

128
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,001
Yeah, but I left it at home.

129
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,080
Okay, well, you go home
after morning rounds and get it.

130
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,215
Sorry about this.

131
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:30,219
Hey, Neela. I left a
message on your cell.

132
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,853
I was just wondering if
you were home right now.

133
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,361
Luka's father died and
we're flying to Croatia tonight.

134
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,294
I left a few things
in the closet...

135
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,833
so I thought I'd just
come by and pick them up.

136
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,630
All right, talk to you later.

137
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,329
Thanks for helping sell
those guys on the ceremony.

138
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,307
- Oh, I'll proselytize for you any day.
- Nice to know I have an acolyte.

139
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,374
- Pulse ox down to 84.
- No pneumothorax.

140
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,539
- Any rib fractures?
- Don't think so.

141
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,809
Intubation tray.

142
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,509
Hey, mind if I try?

143
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:00,847
I need 10 supervised...

144
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:04,549
- No, this isn't a good teaching case.
- Patent airway, shouldn't be tricky.

145
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,886
She's had thoracic
surgery with lousy reserve.

146
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,859
- Once we paralyze, every second counts.
- Give Sam a try.

147
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,823
Here.

148
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,266
Suction. PRATT: Twenty
of etomidate, 100 of sux.

149
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,996
Oh, guys, this CT is cool.

150
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,165
- Hey, what's up with her kid?
- Oh, just a few scratches.

151
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,075
Whoa, noncontrast
scan in 15 seconds.

152
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,440
- She's out.
- Go, go.

153
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,383
How about we fire this baby up?
- Quiet, Morris.

154
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,777
Got it. GATES: Nice.

155
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,720
We're not radiating every
patient because we got a toy.

156
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,950
- Good breath sounds.
- End-tidal is yellow.

157
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,685
Good, let's call for a vent.

158
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,888
Hey, Morris, see if you can
get the history from her son.

159
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,124
Kid doesn't say much.

160
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,269
I talked to him on the chopper.
Call for a portable chest.

161
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:53,737
- Okay, 151, 152, 153.
- What are you doing?

162
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,467
- Just tracking the census.
- Sam, how's my mommy?

163
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,407
She's doing better. We're
helping her breathe right now.

164
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,741
Do you know if your
mom takes any medicine?

165
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,213
Lots of pills. She's sick.

166
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,317
Do you remember when
she had an operation?

167
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,887
How about the
name of her doctor?

168
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,488
It's okay.

169
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,056
The husband's number was
in her wallet, so I'll call him.

170
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,961
- You're gonna call my dad?
- Mm-hm.

171
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:26,669
Continuous NG, recheck lytes,
write the order, then go get your file.

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,933
Oh, will do.

173
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:31,476
I'm gonna be upstairs in my office
while my anti-camel drip kicks in.

174
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,670
I'm running home.
Be about half an hour.

175
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,783
Dr. Zelinsky will start up any
consult orders you might need.

176
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,680
You mean Harold?
Please hurry back.

177
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,754
The husband of the woman we
choppered in is on his way here.

178
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,253
- Okay.
- Hey, Sam.

179
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,618
Coming to my séance?

180
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,124
I'm off shift. I'm pretty beat.

181
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,625
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

182
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,254
Plus, to be honest, my relationship
with religion's kind of complicated.

183
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,627
So is mine.

184
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,827
But you know, it's not
exactly a religious ceremony.

185
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,370
Well, I was raised in a
pretty strict household.

186
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,135
A lot of talk about sin and damnation,
and it never did that much for me.

187
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,642
Do you believe in God?

188
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,872
Some days, it's tough.

189
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,175
And other days?

190
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,214
Other days, I thank
him for showing up.

191
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,977
Or her. Or whatever.

192
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,954
Well, if you change your
mind about our get-together...

193
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,888
we'll be here.

194
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,960
I hear you've been
riding rigs all over town.

195
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,621
- You never asked me.
- I go where they tell me, Zades.

196
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,498
Wish I could get into that
paramedic conference.

197
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,294
What? Sternback's case review?

198
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,994
Yeah, I hear it's interesting.

199
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,164
He goes through every
tough ambulance run.

200
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,866
Yeah, you can learn a lot.

201
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,777
So you coming or not?

202
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,545
- Can you get me in?
- I got connections.

203
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,048
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

204
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,352
- Hi.
- Abby.

205
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,025
- I didn't know you were coming over.
- I left you messages.

206
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,665
Oh, no problem. I just
need to pick up my computer.

207
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:02,098
- You're watching TV?
- Yeah, I was just checking the weather.

208
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,703
- What's going on?
- I was running a few errands.

209
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,312
And I remembered there was a
coat I left here that I wanted to pick up.

210
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,907
I had a drink.

211
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,446
You had a drink?

212
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,011
Yeah.

213
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,390
What are you doing?

214
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,852
Oh, jeez.

215
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,552
Just forget it, I'm gonna go.

216
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,220
- Abby.
- Yeah.

217
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,889
I'm just gonna go, okay?

218
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,536
Is this what's been going
on these last few weeks?

219
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,570
What's been going on
the past couple of weeks?

220
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,732
The way you've been acting? At
Ike's, how far away you seemed?

221
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,708
- That time you asked to...
- Sometimes you are such a child.

222
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,872
- Stop it, I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need it, really.

223
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:52,382
You've gotta stop this. Think
about Joe, think about Luka.

224
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,646
And I really don't expect you
to even begin to understand this.

225
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,485
- If you love them, you'll do something...
- If I love them?

226
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,088
Please, I'm your friend.

227
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,597
Are you about to lecture me
on love with your track record?

228
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,892
Don't.

229
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,936
Because I'm thinking right now, Ray
is really wishing he didn't meet you.

230
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,070
You don't live here anymore.

231
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,402
Get out.

232
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,457
She has end-stage emphysema.

233
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,686
Used to smoke three packs a day.

234
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,160
She still tries to sneak
one every now and then.

235
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,163
Yeah, we noticed
the scar on her chest.

236
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:44,498
Yeah, she had lung reduction
surgery about 10 years ago.

237
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,936
It worked. I mean,
it worked for a while.

238
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:51,669
But she's been on home
oxygen 24/7 for almost a year now.

239
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,335
I... We didn't realize.

240
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,483
We thought maybe her lungs
were bruised in the collision.

241
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,981
No.

242
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,552
She shouldn't have been driving.

243
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,314
She knows that.

244
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,980
I offered to hire a driver.

245
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,855
Well, the ventilator's
helping her to breathe.

246
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,157
No, no, she's a DNR.

247
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,961
She does not wanna be
kept alive by a machine.

248
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,628
Well, we can take off the support if
that's what you and your son decide.

249
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,742
- He didn't say anything about it.
- My what?

250
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,877
Your son. Lowell.

251
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,041
He's right there
in the next room.

252
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,643
I don't know who that is.

253
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,379
So you thinking of
making a change?

254
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,251
Maybe.

255
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,687
Had enough, huh?

256
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,918
I don't know.

257
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,225
I was a traveler for a long
time before I got to Chicago.

258
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,697
Been a nurse at County
for over four years now.

259
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,927
Kind of weird for me.

260
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,662
I used to be wired for change.

261
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,998
Whoa, hold on!

262
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,361
Hey, you okay, Sam?

263
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,588
Yeah. You?

264
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,699
Banged up my knee.

265
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,706
You all right?

266
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,038
I think.

267
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,340
There's a kid.

268
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,210
Hey, Zadro!

269
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,352
Stay in the car.

270
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,547
Evie! SAM: Hey, I'm a nurse.

271
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,089
I'm gonna help you, okay?

272
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,022
- Evie! ZADRO: Hey,
honey, what's your name?

273
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,273
Oh, God. EVIE: Evie.

274
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,589
Where do you hurt, Evie?

275
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,061
- Evie.
- Down there.

276
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,392
No obvious head trauma.

277
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,592
- Did that car hit her?
- I'm all right, Mom.

278
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,737
- Where's Nina?
- Who's Nina?

279
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,530
My dog. JOYCE: Is she okay?

280
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,531
A broken bone in her
pelvis. Everything else, good.

281
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,234
- Her neck? ZADRO:
Bruised it on the way down.

282
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,243
- You breathing okay?
- Yeah.

283
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,644
Sats are good. BP 118 over 76.

284
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,978
Hey! Stay there, sir!

285
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,418
Is that brother drunk?

286
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,615
I bet his dumb ass is drunk.
- Evie.

287
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,257
Nothing but liquor stores
and churches around here.

288
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,791
Hey, Sam, go check
him. I'll call for backup.

289
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,828
Excuse me, coming through.

290
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,157
Excuse me. VAN: Asshole.

291
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,799
- You hit a kid.
- Been drinking?

292
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,434
Hey, come, on, back off, okay?

293
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,230
- You hit a little girl.
- What is your name, sir?

294
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,731
Del.

295
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,499
Del, do you remember anything?

296
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,176
Do you know what happened?

297
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,005
When?

298
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,241
Here you go.

299
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,317
Oh, thank you.

300
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,578
Mind if I...?

301
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,119
Oh, no.

302
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,915
Thanks.

303
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,125
What's his name?

304
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,464
His name is Lowell.

305
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,359
Lowell.

306
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,633
Look, I'm sorry you
had to find out this way.

307
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,506
That your wife had a
kid with someone else.

308
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,837
Oh, no. No.

309
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,004
No, that wasn't it.

310
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:20,015
Melissa and I were...
We were in our 40s.

311
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:25,653
We thought we were past
our having-children time.

312
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,785
Then she got pregnant.

313
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,055
That was in 1983.

314
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,301
I knew something
was wrong right away.

315
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,074
I could tell by the looks
on the doctors' faces.

316
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,078
They told us about
Down syndrome.

317
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:51,412
We realized how
hard it would be.

318
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,785
We weren't ready for it.

319
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,589
I convinced her that
it would be better...

320
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:06,228
That it would be
better for all of us...

321
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,298
What would?

322
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:10,895
Giving him up?

323
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,108
Do you know why he
was in the car with her?

324
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,339
Hey, Pratt.

325
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,448
You seen Skye?

326
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,683
You should ask him.

327
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,350
- What? ABBY:
She's not in her office.

328
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,026
She's not on today. What's up?

329
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,389
Luka's father passed away.

330
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,292
What? Oh, I'm
sorry to hear that.

331
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,899
Yeah, so we're leaving
for Croatia tonight.

332
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,366
I need to take a
leave of absence.

333
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,936
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

334
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,367
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

335
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,770
I mean, his father just
died. Give me a break.

336
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,876
All right. Well...

337
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,612
fill out the paperwork.
And I'll tell Skye about it.

338
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,373
Thanks.

339
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,110
- A little oxygen in your nose.
- Okay.

340
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,553
- I think the girl stopped moving.
- I saw her get hit, it was bad.

341
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,215
- You think she could die?
- No.

342
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,758
- Go help with the girl.
- Paramedics are with her.

343
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,294
This jerk's feeling no pain.

344
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,124
He's concussed. He's not drunk.

345
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,732
- Come on, that girl needs you more.
- Hey!

346
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,463
Why don't you back off and
let me do my work, okay?

347
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,106
- Okay. EMILIO:
Give her some room.

348
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,741
Yeah, thank you. VAN: Cool.

349
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,902
Hey!

350
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,307
- Little drunk bitch!
- Hey.

351
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,911
Hey, Zadro!

352
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,749
Frank? I need two more charts.

353
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,425
- You're pathetic.
- No, no, it's the funniest thing.

354
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,960
As I was getting my coffee, I noticed
that Conchita has carpal tunnel.

355
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,392
From working the register.

356
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,769
Yeah, and Bheru here has a
bad back from lifting heavy boxes.

357
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:53,338
I'm thinking I slipped a disk.

358
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,032
- Bring it on, we haven't even hit 200.
- Are you serious?

359
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,976
Yeah, give me your card and
PIN. I'll save you a trip to the ATM.

360
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,945
It's not over till
it's over, Frank.

361
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,778
A fool and his money
are soon parted, Morris!

362
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,011
Labs are back.

363
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,212
Vitals are stable.

364
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,021
Yeah, everything looks good.

365
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,854
No serious injuries, Lowell.

366
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:19,727
Mommy was taking me
to a new place to live.

367
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,131
You know, your
mom's not doing well.

368
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,707
- She needs air.
- Yeah.

369
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,204
She's getting sicker.

370
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,212
Mommy comes every Thursday.

371
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,940
But she's too sick now.

372
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,552
Is my dad here?

373
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,052
I heard he's coming.

374
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,654
Which one is he?

375
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,257
I can find out and
I'll bring you to him.

376
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,089
No.

377
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,659
No, you don't you
wanna meet him?

378
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,390
He didn't want me
when I was a baby.

379
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,102
Well, you know, dads
can change their minds.

380
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,898
- Really?
- Really.

381
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,041
Yep.

382
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,702
My dad was kind
of like your dad.

383
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,904
Did he change his mind?

384
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,982
I like to think he did.

385
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,784
- Oh, hi, Abby.
- Hi.

386
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,893
- Sorry, do you mind? I have to...
- Yeah.

387
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,122
What are you doing?

388
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,526
Oh, you haven't heard?

389
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,534
We're doing a memorial
and blessing ceremony.

390
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,231
- Who's bringing the Kool-Aid?
- It's nothing scary.

391
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,309
Don't worry.

392
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,070
You should come, check it out.

393
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,813
I don't think so.

394
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,543
Oh, everyone could use
a blessing now and then.

395
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,950
Or a memorial.

396
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,751
Abby, do I piss you off?

397
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,655
- Excuse me?
- I was wondering.

398
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,064
No, you don't piss me off.

399
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,827
I don't know you, really, so...

400
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,161
If there was ever anything
you needed to talk about...

401
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,930
Why would I need that?

402
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,132
It's kind of why I'm here.

403
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:11,904
Okay.

404
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,285
You know, there's this story...

405
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,754
I know, I know, bear with me.

406
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:29,089
It's about this little boy
who asks his mother...

407
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,595
"Do you think I can pick
up that big rock over there?"

408
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,428
And she says, "Yes,
I'm certain you can lift it.

409
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,161
If you use all your strength."

410
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,637
So he goes over and
he tries to lift the rock.

411
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:46,768
He tries a bunch of times, until
finally he says, "I couldn't do it."

412
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,675
So she goes over there.

413
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,943
And together,
they lift the rock.

414
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,177
Wow, that's great.

415
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,153
And she explains to him...

416
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:03,092
that sometimes using all your
strength means asking for help.

417
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,390
The floor's under control.
We got no incoming traumas.

418
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,300
- Want us to round up the troops?
- Yeah, let's get while the getting's good.

419
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,309
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Neela.

420
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,643
No, it's my fault. My
mind is somewhere else.

421
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,376
Oh, me too.

422
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,347
I heard about
your father. Sorry.

423
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,580
Thanks. Yeah.

424
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,589
Just when I thought he was
out of the woods for a while.

425
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,317
Have you seen Abby today?

426
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,825
Something the matter?

427
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,521
She was just supposed
to be home a while ago.

428
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,030
She must've gotten caught
up with something here.

429
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,693
Yeah, maybe she got
caught up with some work.

430
00:21:56,215 --> 00:22:00,915
The names of those who've
passed on while under our care.

431
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,285
We take time
from our busy day...

432
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,894
to pay respect to the
mothers and fathers...

433
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:15,125
husbands and wives,
sisters and brothers...

434
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:20,865
sons and daughters
who are no longer with us.

435
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,775
Think of one patient who's
changed you in some way.

436
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,742
Hold them in your memory.

437
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,549
Were they inspiring?

438
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,876
Funny?

439
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,817
Courageous?

440
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,319
Did they challenge you?

441
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,392
Teach you something
about yourself?

442
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,962
Were they searching
for something?

443
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:53,132
Was their heart
filled with love?

444
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,941
As you hold them in
your mind, ask yourself:

445
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,707
"Which of their qualities
can become part of my life?"

446
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,615
Sorry, multiple trauma rolling
in. I waited as long as I could.

447
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,981
- Another time. PRATT:
Gates, Morris, let's go.

448
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,146
Two ORs on standby.
- Page Dubenko.

449
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,985
Yeah, I got it. What is it?

450
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,787
Blunt trauma. Auto versus peds.

451
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,543
You said you'd be back an hour
ago. I didn't know where you were.

452
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,609
Well, here I am.

453
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,521
There's no way.
Anatomy is distorted.

454
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,924
- I thought her breathing was okay.
- It was.

455
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,564
Gonna grab the fiber-optic scope.
- I'll bag her.

456
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,064
Is there a problem? What
are you doing? Tell me.

457
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,863
- Joyce, wait outside.
- No, I need to be here.

458
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,597
Just give us a
few minutes, okay?

459
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,503
You said it was a scratch.

460
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,201
There's more
swelling in her throat.

461
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,009
So she can't breathe?

462
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,171
We're helping her.

463
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,544
Would you like to sit down?

464
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,920
- Sorry.
- Oh, God.

465
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,282
Oh, my God.

466
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,356
My baby.

467
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,118
My baby.

468
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,591
Oh, my God.

469
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,264
My baby's hurt?

470
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,069
God. No. Oh, God.

471
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,264
You're Lowell's dad?

472
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,068
Yeah.

473
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,800
Have the balls to go in there.

474
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,442
I don't know what to tell you.
- What's going on?

475
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,985
- Nothing!
- If you don't wanna come to Croatia...

476
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,621
- No, that's not it.
- Then what?

477
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,758
I just have a lot to
deal with it. That's all.

478
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,956
Since I got back, you
haven't seemed happy.

479
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,655
You avoid me, hardly
touch. Do you think I'm blind?

480
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,392
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Am I?

481
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,336
Look, you were just gone
forever. It was a lot of stress.

482
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,100
- Taking care of Joe and supporting us.
- Supporting us?

483
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,005
Yeah, there were bills to
pay. All we had was my salary.

484
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,908
- So you're mad I wasn't working?
- No, that's not it, no.

485
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,606
It's just hard for me
to just turn it back on.

486
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,182
Turn what back on?

487
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,445
When did it turn off?

488
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,226
I know you. I know
when something's wrong.

489
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,263
- Do you still love me?
- Of course, I still love you.

490
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,596
- Why would you ask me that?
- Why do you think?

491
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,102
Just talk to me. Hey.

492
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,106
Look, I have to go and
finish my leave request.

493
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,476
And then we'll go to Croatia and
then everything will be different.

494
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,310
Okay?

495
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,279
You can't just hide
forever, you know. You can't.

496
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,964
- Hey, what...
- I'll see you at home.

497
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,038
- All I can see are arytenoid folds.
- Sats are way down.

498
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,836
- Let's do a surgical airway.
- She's too young to crike.

499
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,410
Formal trake? Prep the neck.

500
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,546
- Will take too long.
- Twenty minutes.

501
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,908
She doesn't have 20
minutes. Jet ventilation?

502
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,027
- Requires a regulator.
- Release valve.

503
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,145
By the time you get
that, she'll be traked.

504
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,652
- I can do it with a cannula.
- Get out of here.

505
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,415
- Will take me 30 seconds.
- Fine.

506
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,358
Lost the pulse. PEA.
I'm starting compressions.

507
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:43,024
Are you sure he
wants to meet me?

508
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,001
He was asking the same question.

509
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,601
Will...?

510
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,878
Will you come in with me?

511
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,507
That's not a problem.

512
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,624
Someone's here to see you.

513
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,597
Hello.

514
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,366
My name is Pierce.

515
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:25,101
My name is Lowell.

516
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,107
Lowell.

517
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:39,054
Lowell, I'm your father.

518
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,561
Nice to meet you.

519
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,633
Okay, Morris, steady the hub.

520
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,965
Nasal cannula at 15.

521
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,399
Okay, 10 blade. - Tip suction.

522
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:58,772
Okay, when I cover the open prong,
she's gonna get a blast of oxygen.

523
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,003
Hold CPR.

524
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,940
That's hot.

525
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,518
- One second on, four off.
- Where'd you learn this?

526
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,178
- Transport.
- Got a pulse.

527
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,186
- Gates needs a surgeon now.
- I got it.

528
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:15,486
- BP 110 over 60.
- Big epidural, he blew a pupil.

529
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,472
Heart rate's dropping.
- Atropine?

530
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,192
- Two amps.
- He needs the OR.

531
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,697
- He'll never make it to the OR.
- Seventy over 50.

532
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,402
Dopamine.

533
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,128
- Hey, what about a burr hole?
- We need a drill.

534
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:27,773
He got kicked in the head.

535
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,772
Can you show me bone windows?

536
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,841
- He's seizing.
- Four of Ativan.

537
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,606
- Looks like a circular skull fracture.
- Brilliant, prep for a cut down.

538
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:39,449
Sorry your thing
got interrupted.

539
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,211
Life in the ER, I guess.

540
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,355
We'll finish later.

541
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,660
Why did you tell
me that story before?

542
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:49,886
I like it.

543
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,530
I thought you might too.

544
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,360
Hey, Frank, did that fax
come in yet for Melissa Tanner?

545
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,628
Greg, thanks for taking care
of this thing with Skye for me.

546
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,635
Let Luka know we're
thinking about him.

547
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:03,003
- Okay.
- Fax is right here on the chart.

548
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,905
- That the DNR?
- Yup.

549
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,876
"No intubation, no CPR."

550
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:10,572
Is her husband comfortable
honoring her wishes?

551
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,548
Yeah. So I guess we extubate.

552
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,746
And she's gonna
die in a few hours.

553
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,753
Lowell needs to understand that.

554
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,220
It doesn't seem right.

555
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,860
Kid's never had a real family.

556
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:25,054
And on the same day that
they finally get together...

557
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,199
he's gonna lose his mom.

558
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,892
Makes me wanna call my folks.

559
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,502
You okay?

560
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,543
My mom died when I was a kid.

561
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,736
Breast cancer.

562
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,411
We were close.

563
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,017
And I lost her pretty early.

564
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,048
I don't know why I'm
even talking about this.

565
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,088
Must be that time
of year, you know?

566
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,385
I'll go talk to them.

567
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,523
Heart rate's down, 20.

568
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,063
Start pacing him. You
know he's gonna arrest soon.

569
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,633
Elevating the fragment. Suction.

570
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:07,604
- What the hell is all this?
- Draining an epidural bleed.

571
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,206
You did a burr hole?

572
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,894
We didn't have to. JARVIK:
Heart rate's 80, bounding pulse.

573
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,036
Mayday hits a
three-pointer at the buzzer.

574
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,646
You people are crazy.

575
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,043
I'm gonna go and help
Dubenko with the trake.

576
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,377
I'll be right back.

577
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,713
Heard you were a
seasoned pro out there today.

578
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,617
You'd think that.
I hit somebody.

579
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,381
How is that? How are you?

580
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,650
Yeah, I've had worse.

581
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,427
- Harold, what's next?
- Chuny, I got this.

582
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,066
A vertical incision
through the third and fourth.

583
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,759
- You bitch!
- Remember the girl you're worried about?

584
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,667
- We're trying to save her now.
- Yeah, plenty of doctors.

585
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,171
- You messed me up. DUBENKO:
This is a sterile procedure.

586
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,036
- I need you to step back!
- Hey!

587
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,481
Let go! Get off me!

588
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,652
- Hey, let go of me!
- Stay down!

589
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,344
- Stay there! Don't move!
- Get off me!

590
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:57,989
Get off me!

591
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,556
Not so tough now, are you?

592
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,987
Lowell, a long time ago...

593
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,962
your mom decided she didn't
wanna be put on a breathing machine.

594
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:10,102
- She wants to die?
- Not exactly, no.

595
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:14,501
And son, living
on the machine...

596
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,932
she wouldn't...

597
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:20,511
She wouldn't be able to
do things that she loved.

598
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,882
She wouldn't be
able to visit you.

599
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:33,119
And she'd be stuck in a bed,
unable to walk or talk or eat.

600
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,192
She'd just get
sicker and sicker.

601
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,523
Mommy?

602
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,635
Are you sure you
don't want the machine?

603
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,003
She doesn't want it.

604
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:55,137
That means in a little while,
we're gonna pull out that tube.

605
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:56,975
Okay.

606
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,513
And she'll probably die
not too long after that.

607
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,120
Could she get better?

608
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,419
I don't think so, Lowell.

609
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,751
But she might.

610
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,554
Well...

611
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,863
Lowell, we'll pray for that.

612
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,396
We'll pray for that.

613
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:18,533
Mommy, you don't
have to die today.

614
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,040
And we're gonna
go on the airplane.

615
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,546
Can you say airplane, huh?

616
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,354
- Hey.
- Hey.

617
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,449
And the propeller.

618
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,428
Yeah. Put it here.

619
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,032
Where's Niko?

620
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,729
He went to buy a
present for his wife.

621
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,442
And are we ready to fly now?

622
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,639
Ready to fly.

623
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,579
We're gonna fly.

624
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,776
Where are we gonna
put Joe in the airplane?

625
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:11,117
On a window seat, huh?

626
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,225
Joe. Come.

627
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,477
Luka, I need help.

628
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,273
I started drinking again.

629
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,115
When?

630
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,657
The night Joe got hurt.

631
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,862
And I...

632
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,294
I can't stop.

633
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,576
I thought when I came back...

634
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,014
we just needed to get
used to being married again.

635
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:53,383
But then things didn't
get better and I thought...

636
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,695
- So, what do we do?
- I need to fix it.

637
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,939
I need to go somewhere.

638
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,407
A facility with
professionals and get better.

639
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,447
And I need to believe it this
time, and I need you to believe it.

640
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,143
And I need you to help me.

641
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,522
So...

642
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,224
So take Joe...

643
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:39,404
go to Croatia for your
father while I do that.

644
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,369
- You want us to go without you?
- Yeah.

645
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,031
- You're his mother.
- I know that.

646
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,235
I know that.

647
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,749
But I haven't been
a very good one.

648
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,984
And I honestly don't think I
can be until I deal with this.

649
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,417
Can't we do this together?

650
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:04,222
This is how we do it together.
You have to help me do it alone.

651
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,399
That's it?

652
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,437
Is there anything else?

653
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,850
What do you mean?

654
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,580
That you wanna tell me?

655
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,855
You know, I just...

656
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,487
I was out of control.

657
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:42,794
I got out of control and I...

658
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,537
I did some things.

659
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,437
What kind of things?

660
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,769
Things I'm ashamed of.

661
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,736
Okay, just tell me everything.

662
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,253
Luka.

663
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,484
And after all this, after
everything, you don't wanna tell me?

664
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,687
Not tonight.

665
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:44,186
- It's my fault, isn't it?
- No, don't, please don't.

666
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,997
I should've come home earlier.

667
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,329
- I shouldn't have left.
- No, I should've been able to handle this.

668
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,835
- I broke my promise.
- Don't do that, okay?

669
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,439
Don't. I screwed up.

670
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,940
I screwed up because I
couldn't keep it together.

671
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,737
- This is my fault.
- I'm so sorry.

672
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,004
And please don't.

673
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,410
Don't. Just don't.

674
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,216
I'm sorry.

675
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,723
- Hey.
- Hi.

676
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:22,390
Neurosurgery finished with
the driver from your MVC.

677
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:25,366
- He's waking up.
- Oh, that's good to know.

678
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,906
Nice move in there. You okay?

679
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,131
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

680
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,969
I did a little cage fighting
back in medical school, so.

681
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,806
It showed, good thing Harold
was there to save your ass.

682
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,140
Is that what happened?

683
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,782
Come on, Harold.

684
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,919
Seriously, thank you.

685
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,614
And I don't care what
anybody says, Gates.

686
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,421
- I think you're a half-decent guy.
- Sam, is that a new patient?

687
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,660
- No.
- Damn.

688
00:38:56,301 --> 00:39:01,638
With 15 minutes to go,
the patient count is 263.

689
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,401
I need another two nurses here.

690
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,936
Food poisoning at
the Christmas potluck.

691
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,147
Hallelujah!

692
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,285
And now take a deep breath in.

693
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,152
And blow it out.

694
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,692
Good. Good.

695
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,757
Well, that's good.

696
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,032
Hi, Mommy.

697
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,463
Hi, baby.

698
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,099
I love you.

699
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,540
I love you too.

700
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,711
I couldn't forget him.

701
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,918
I never knew how to tell you.

702
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,522
Don't worry about anything now.

703
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,555
He's our son.

704
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,428
I'll take care of him.

705
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,940
Ha...

706
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,680
Ladies and gentlemen.

707
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,408
The official census
for the past 24 hours...

708
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:23,248
stands at 299.

709
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,252
Triage is empty.

710
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,154
Which means, we will
each be $100 richer...

711
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:37,327
in 10, nine, eight...
seven, six, five...

712
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:44,471
four, three, two...

713
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,611
Ah! Son of a bitch!

714
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,372
Lily, make a chart for Frank!

715
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,344
You have a serious
gambling problem.

716
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,213
Three-view hand x-ray,
ibuprofen and an ice pack.

717
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,853
Three hundred!

718
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,956
Yes, yes, yes, it's me!

719
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,752
Julia's ready, we
moved to Trauma 2.

720
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:08,290
Water is the source of all life.

721
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,025
It's used in healing
rituals all over the world...

722
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,727
in almost every faith.

723
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:19,576
Water is an element of
cleansing and purification.

724
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,212
Today, we use sterile saline.

725
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,076
It's what we work with.

726
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,615
And water doesn't get
much cleaner than that.

727
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:32,087
<i>Earlier, we talked about
what our patients do for us.</i>

728
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,384
<i>How they affect us.</i>

729
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,755
<i>Stay with us.</i>

730
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:39,989
Now we'll honor
what we do for them.

731
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,134
And pay thanks for the
abilities we've been given...

732
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:47,500
hoping that we may continue to
use them to serve our community.

733
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,937
So let's each dip our
hands in the water.

734
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:56,639
May we all have the strength,
dexterity and sensitivity...

735
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,784
to carry out the
mission of healing.

736
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,620
And may our hands be blessed.

737
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,910
<i>We have our dead.</i>

738
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,242
<i>And we have let them go.</i>

739
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:18,394
<i>Now, let's turn our attention
back to the work of the living.</i>
