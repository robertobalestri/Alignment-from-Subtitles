1
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,798
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,134
Pupils are equal an
reactive. What year is it?

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,201
- Seven.
- Good. Let's go to Trauma 1.

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,634
Quick and concise. How is she?

5
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:14,418
Hypertensive, anemic,
with abdominal pain.

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,447
- Extensive crush injuries.
- Neela.

7
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,610
- It's been great.
- Your day might have been a lot better...

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,415
- if you never met me.
- No so sure about that.

9
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,751
- Hope I see you around.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,985
- You can check yourself in the ICU.
- What?

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,616
There are lots of
good lessons for a guy

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,306
like you up there. Trust
me, you should know.

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,458
- You're kidding, right?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

14
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,070
Luka's not the chief anymore.
Moretti's the man now.

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,899
Well, someone should
talk to Anspaugh.

16
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,174
- All right, good luck,
Mr. Stoll. MAN: Thanks, doc.

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,686
Hey, Dr. Anspaugh.

18
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,882
You know, you're one busy guy.

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,687
I've been calling all week
to schedule an appointment.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,193
My assistant can fit you
in as soon as possible.

21
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,696
Do you have a few
minutes? I need to talk to you.

22
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,735
I need to get to a council meeting. If
there is a God, I can beat this traffic.

23
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,166
It's about Dr. Moretti.

24
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,331
He's all wrong for the ER. He
doesn't understand how it works.

25
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,501
Kevin is a brilliant physician
certified in emergency medicine.

26
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:21,911
The guy is smart, I'll give him that,
but he's in way over his head, and...

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,641
And what?

28
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,254
You should replace him with someone
who knows how to do the job: me.

29
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,083
Well, I admire your chutzpah.

30
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,225
Well, you call it what
you want, but I'm serious.

31
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,760
Look, change is always hard.
I'm sure he's gonna settle in.

32
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,833
- Dr. Anspaugh, I can do this.
- Ask me in another year or two.

33
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,200
<i>And next, go from
trash to treasure...</i>

34
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,651
<i>when we learn how
to make lamps...</i>

35
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,007
- Hi.
<i>- Out of egg cartons.</i>

36
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,372
<i>Won't that be fun?</i>

37
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,344
- Got some magazines. MAN:
<i>That just sounds "eggcellent," Tina.</i>

38
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,279
- And your favorite, gummy worms.
- Thank you.

39
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,716
<i>Okay, okay, why can't
you tease egg whites?</i>

40
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,286
And Brad Pitt.

41
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,050
<i>- They can't take a "yolk."</i>
- He's outside.

42
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,784
He's over Angelina and
the whole adoption thing...

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,088
and he wants you.

44
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,032
Are you okay?

45
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,930
I think I'm addicted to
<i>Mornings With Phil and Tina.</i>

46
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,971
Oh. Well, hang in there.
You'll be home tomorrow.

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,198
Correction: today.

48
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,037
My staples came out, and
my creatinine's down to 0.9.

49
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,542
- Worm?
- No, thank you.

50
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,873
- Who sent you these flowers?
- ER nurses.

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,413
- Think they went a little bit overboard.
- No.

52
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,484
- Everyone's just happy you're doing well.
- Yeah.

53
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,590
- Any luck with Joe's passport?
- It's so crazy.

54
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,988
I mean, there's all
these new travel rules...

55
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,391
so even with an expedited
passport, it takes like four weeks.

56
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,829
- What time are you getting out of here?
- Oh, I'm not sure.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,731
Lucien wants me to stay home
for a week before I go back.

58
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,600
- Lucky you.
- What I am gonna do sitting at home?

59
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,106
Um, relax, recuperate...

60
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,437
try and kick your <i>Phil
and Tina</i> addiction.

61
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:04,407
- Okay, I'm late. See you later.
- Okay, bye.

62
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,450
<i>Take the light
cord...</i> MAN: <i>Right.</i>

63
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,114
<i>And pull it through the base.</i>

64
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:15,318
And that means no more boarding
admitted patients in the ER hallways.

65
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,987
If there aren't enough
beds, they can wait upstairs.

66
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:22,830
Oh, Lord, it's me, your
servant, Bernie. I'm dying, Lord.

67
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,438
- Do the nurses upstairs know about this?
- Sam, your hair is brown.

68
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,044
And from now on, I want all patients
to have full physical examinations.

69
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,807
- Take me, Lord. It's my time.
- You're kidding me, right?

70
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,951
No. Clothes off. No more
of these half-assed exams.

71
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,054
And we need to have more
consistent treatment protocols...

72
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,213
in line with
evidence-based guidelines.

73
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,892
- Here I come.
- Should we go help that guy?

74
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,291
Mr. Zucker? Comes in every week
with a hangover, claims he's dying.

75
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,023
He offered to put me in
his will if I gave him a bath.

76
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,861
These are standard order sets...

77
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,502
for acute coronary
syndrome, stroke...

78
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,663
sepsis, alcohol withdrawal,
and procedural sedation.

79
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,367
I expect you all to
make use of them.

80
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,064
- Get to work. BERNIE:
I'm coming home.

81
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,841
Now we're doing
cookbook medicine?

82
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,677
Why don't they just hire
trained monkeys to work the ER?

83
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,821
Hey, Morris, do you have any
known relatives in Bulgaria?

84
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,047
- What?
- Frank's new hobby is genealogy.

85
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,818
He discovered I'm a
descendant of Spanish royalty.

86
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,190
Yeah, then I found this
Archibald Morrisnov in Plovdiv.

87
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,355
No, I don't think we're
related, but check Venezuela.

88
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,763
I may have a cousin who
runs a kidnapping ring.

89
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,496
Crime is just the desperate
cry of the poor, Archie.

90
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,198
- Gates? I thought we got rid of you.
- I left my otoscope here.

91
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,241
Yeah, I was about
to auction it on eBay.

92
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,743
Oh, stop pretending. You
know you miss me, Frank.

93
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,677
Hey, Abby, have you
seen Neela today?

94
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,044
Yeah, I was just there.
She's going home.

95
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,346
- That's great.
- So this is your last chance to visit her.

96
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,716
- I've visited her.
- When she was unconscious.

97
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,950
I'm busy and starting
my first shift in ICU.

98
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,788
Tony, go see her.

99
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,055
- It's a little...
- Yeah, weird.

100
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,893
I know, stuff happened.
But you just gotta get over it.

101
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,126
Know what? This is
Sarah. I gotta take this.

102
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:07,605
- Hey, Sarah. What's up? Yeah.
- Here I go. Here I go.

103
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,902
Dr. Lockhart.

104
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,972
So nice of you to take time out
of your busy schedule to join us.

105
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,984
- I was visiting a friend of mine...
- Fascinating.

106
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,147
I'm instituting a new system,
and I need a volunteer: you.

107
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,986
Today you'll be working
your shift in the waiting area.

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,288
- Lord, it's me again.
- Do you mean Triage?

109
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,293
- No, Waiting.
- Here I come.

110
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,057
It's a chance to intervene
at the earliest stage.

111
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,635
Do you really think
that this is the best use?

112
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,072
- Open your eyes, Abby.
- This is the end.

113
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,936
- Take a fresh look.
- Just say the word.

114
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,168
Excuse me.

115
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,082
Bernie, this is God.

116
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,751
Hurry it up already.

117
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:14,001
Yeah, your toe is infected, ma'am.
We're gonna have to remove the nail.

118
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,042
- Is there anything you're allergic to?
- I don't like cheese.

119
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,873
Okay, someone will be
here shortly to take you back.

120
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,845
- Then we'll see about some shoes.
- Oh, I like Jimmy Choos.

121
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,713
Hey, how much longer do I
have to wait around this place?

122
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,084
- Sir, you have to sit down. Sit down.
- Don't you know who I am?

123
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,094
"Carlos Vega."

124
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,819
- Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,228
I'm Dr. Lockhart. What
seems to be the problem?

126
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,458
He threw up all night.

127
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,036
We thought it might be something
he ate, but he's getting worse.

128
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:48,869
Maybe you can give me something
for my stomach, and we can go.

129
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,501
Yeah, I think you have a fever.
It's probably not food poisoning.

130
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,841
Oh, no. He played with
our baby all day yesterday.

131
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,315
Honey, Tyler's fine.

132
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,512
Doctor, I gotta get to work.

133
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,713
How long do we have to wait?

134
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,523
Um...

135
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,364
You know, why don't we just
take you back right now, okay?

136
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,834
- Oh, thank you.
- Come on. You all right?

137
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,273
All right. Let's do this.

138
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,021
I was thinking about going down
to Baton Rouge and visit Ray.

139
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,747
Yeah. We'll go together.

140
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,017
The three of us could
catch a Saints game.

141
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,593
That sounds good.
We should do that.

142
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,165
"Seaweed Scalp Mist."

143
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,790
Ray was a little hair-obsessed.

144
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,938
But I gotta say, the man's
lid always looked good.

145
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,736
Oh, boy.

146
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,976
- Are these a size nine?
- Don't even go there, Morris.

147
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,242
Well, what's he gonna
do with them? I mean...

148
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,387
Sir, back away from
the shoes, all right?

149
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,490
Guys, is that locker available?

150
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,216
- What?
- I haven't been assigned one yet.

151
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,761
- Stop. No one's using this locker.
- It's retired.

152
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,993
You can't retire an ER locker.

153
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,003
Can you?

154
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,264
You can use one of
those lockers over there.

155
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,907
This one's off-limits.

156
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,009
So, what can we bring to
dinner tonight at Chez Pratt?

157
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,310
It's not necessary, but
maybe some red wine.

158
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,454
Vino it is. Thanks
again for the invite.

159
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,782
It was Bettina's idea
to do this double date.

160
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,824
- She really likes you, man.
- Hey, Pratt, mazel tov.

161
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,085
You having a stroke?

162
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,627
Did you know your
great-great-great-grandmother...

163
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,992
on your mother's side
was an Ethiopian Jew?

164
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,463
Wow, black and Jewish.

165
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,795
You're like County's
own Sammy Davis, Jr.

166
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:56,993
Get out of here.

167
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,435
<i>Who can take a rainbow
Wrap it in the sky?</i>

168
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,938
- Archie.
<i>- The Pratt man can</i>

169
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,372
Sam, you said you wanted
to get out there again.

170
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,602
Oh, I don't know.

171
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,213
You and your new hair
need to come with us tonight.

172
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,144
- Where you gals going?
- Speed dating.

173
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,339
What is speed dating?

174
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,884
It's a way for losers to
meet other losers fast.

175
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,215
No, you get six minutes,
you sit at a table...

176
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,879
and talk to a bunch of guys.

177
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,219
How are you supposed
to get to know somebody?

178
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,361
- Chemistry. MORRIS:
Seems more like desperation.

179
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,724
- Sam, are you in or not?
- It sounds like fun.

180
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,061
Maybe she doesn't want to because
she has her eye on someone else.

181
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,202
- What? Who?
- Officer Litchman.

182
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,362
Oh, he is so cute. I thought I
noticed a spark between you two.

183
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,905
Yeah? I mean, no.

184
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,511
I mean, yes, I think he's cute,
but I would never date a cop.

185
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,236
Frank, you got it wrong, man.

186
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,881
My grandfather was
Steven with a V. Look.

187
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,573
MVC, second victim behind me.

188
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,412
Sixteen-year-old unrestrained
driver ejected from vehicle.

189
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,248
- What's your name?
- Where's Joanna?

190
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,890
Casey Barnes, blunt head
trauma, awake but altered.

191
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,151
CBC, chem panel,
type and cross four units.

192
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,886
Twenty-five-year-old
passenger. No LOC, vitals stable.

193
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,930
- How's Casey? Is he all right?
- Let's worry about you first.

194
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,658
CBC, type and screen, UA.

195
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,029
- Joanna.
- Airway's patent. Spontaneous resps.

196
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,398
- IV blew.
- Regular rhythm.

197
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,700
Carotid pulse is thready. Look at
me. Do you know where you are?

198
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,467
Sam, he's tachy.
Get that bolus up.

199
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,736
I can't get a flash.
His pressure's too low.

200
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,683
We need access.

201
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:14,813
I'll go central. Cordis
and sterile sevens.

202
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,450
When a trauma rolls in,
you're supposed to jump on.

203
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,781
- Thought you could handle it.
- I'm handling it fine.

204
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,152
- Agitation could be a sign of ICH.
- I'll call for a head CT.

205
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,488
Pupils equal but sluggish.
Sorry about earlier.

206
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,925
I can't stop thinking
about the mosquito thing.

207
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,089
- Mosquitoes love redheads.
- We'll talk about it later tonight.

208
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,428
Somebody hand me
the introducer? I'm sterile.

209
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,663
Not sterile enough. No
drape, no gown, no mask.

210
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,934
We prophylactically remove all ER lines
because your rate of infection is so high.

211
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,185
My fault. Kid was
crashing. I asked her...

212
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,307
That's not true, I...

213
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,278
Spare me. Just do it right.

214
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,953
- All right, pupils equal and reactive.
- Guarding a little.

215
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,955
- How's she doing?
- Well, airways good. GCS 15.

216
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,752
I'm Dr. Moretti.
How you feeling?

217
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,259
- Been better.
- She's tachy. You got a pressure?

218
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,296
- 126/76.
- Please, is Casey okay?

219
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,409
Doctors are working on him.
- Oh, God.

220
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,457
Her pelvis is stable.

221
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,934
We got superficial
abrasions to the right thigh.

222
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,835
- I should've never let him drive.
- Is he your brother?

223
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,475
No, my student. I teach
math at Edgewater.

224
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,477
I was tutoring
him before school.

225
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,478
- In the car? JOANNA:
He just got his license.

226
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,048
Begged me to go driving.

227
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,808
- Chest film's back.
- Okay.

228
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,647
My son was in the National
Math Olympiad in high school.

229
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,653
Now he's squandering his
talents as a comp. lit. major.

230
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,758
Go figure. What do you see?

231
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,719
- Is that a little pneumo?
- Yep.

232
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,662
Let's put her on a high flow of
O2 and set up her for a chest tube.

233
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,857
- Whoa, whoa. Overkill.
- She's got a 20 percent pneumothorax.

234
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,036
What does that
mean? Is that bad?

235
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,765
It means part of your lung has
collapsed, and we need to reinflate it.

236
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,967
- Okay, Dr. Pratt. Your patient.
- All right, lido and 10 blade to me.

237
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,071
- Why don't you take off your shirt?
- No, that's okay.

238
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,581
I need to examine your abdomen.
Do we really need to make a big deal?

239
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,014
My boss is a real pain.

240
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,553
- He won't like that I'm late.
- It won't take long.

241
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,420
My boss is a real pain, and he
won't like if I don't do a thorough exam.

242
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,867
- What's that?
- Oh, he got hurt at work.

243
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,399
It's nothing. I was stupid.

244
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,936
- Elena helped me clean it up.
- Still, I need to check it out.

245
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,572
No, you don't, really.

246
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,439
How'd this happen again?

247
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,584
Funny, this doesn't
look like the waiting area.

248
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,212
So, sir, how'd you manage
to get yourself shot?

249
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,754
There was a
drive-by, and I got hit.

250
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,785
- When did this happen?
- Three nights ago.

251
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,625
- Why didn't you go to the hospital?
- Well, he doesn't like doctors.

252
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,858
It's all right. I don't
take that personally.

253
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,628
It's not what it looks like.

254
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,698
All right. I'll be right back.

255
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,433
Start with a plain film,
find out where the bullet is?

256
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,907
And notify the police.

257
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,546
- Morning, Neela.
- Morning.

258
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,206
- What happened to you?
- Field hockey. Your LFTs look good.

259
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,716
You should be able to
go home in an hour or two.

260
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,981
That's what they said four hours ago.
- Any trouble voiding?

261
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,990
- No, my Foley is out.
- Are you still passing gas?

262
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,492
Would you stop, Dusty?
She's been through enough.

263
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,654
No going home until
Neela makes a poo-poo.

264
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,423
You know, my postop
ileus has resolved.

265
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,062
That's the ER. Let's go, Dusty.
It's good to see you up and around.

266
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:38,513
Okay. Thirteen-year-old.
Pneumonia, dysphagia, normal CT.

267
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:42,622
Chang, what crucial historical
detail did Dr. Udesky omit?

268
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,087
Weight loss? Night sweats?

269
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:48,456
No, no, no, the one thing we must
know to narrow down this vast differential.

270
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,494
- MRI results?
- You're breaking my heart.

271
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,258
- Excuse me.
- Duration of symptoms.

272
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,402
Sudden onset, we're thinking
stroke, infection, trauma.

273
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,031
Slow onset, we're
thinking tumor, metabolic...

274
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,833
- Yes?
- Dr. Shuster, I'm Dr. Gates.

275
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,670
- Moretti sent me here.
- Yet you show up 20 minutes late.

276
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,641
I was doing a
follow-up on a patient.

277
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,544
This is the Critical Care Unit. I don't
have time to potty-train ER rejects.

278
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:13,676
Get me an MRI. Call Neuro. I
want a diagnosis before lunch.

279
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,119
Looks like the boss lady
ripped you a new one.

280
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,694
Oh, you're too young to
know what flirting looks like.

281
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,455
See what's taking so long in CT.

282
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,657
- You don't even speak Spanish.
- I'll learn.

283
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,326
- Sats down to 82.
- Okay, get him on a non-rebreather.

284
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,904
And, Hope, get
ready to tube him.

285
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,133
- This is the kid's mom.
- Baby? Baby, it's Mom.

286
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,568
Honey, I'm right
here, right here.

287
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,579
Your son's been in a car
crash. He's lost a lot of blood.

288
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,341
- Run of 10.
- Casey, come on.

289
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,008
Throw me the bag.
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Morris.

290
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,552
We're gonna put a tube
in to breathe for him.

291
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,745
What happened?

292
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,676
He was driving, and
he hit a guardrail.

293
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,592
- He was ejected 20 feet.
- Driving? Casey doesn't have a car.

294
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,696
He came in with her.

295
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,387
- Do you know that woman?
- Yeah.

296
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,863
Darn, bulb's out. I need
a new scope, Mac 2.

297
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:05,169
Casey, honey, wake
up. Wake up. Talk to me.

298
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,773
I'll get it. BOBECK: He's
in V-tach. Lost the pulse.

299
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,967
Charge the paddles.
Starting compressions.

300
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,116
- Is Casey okay?
- He's pretty sick.

301
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,213
- How we doing?
- She's got a hemothorax.

302
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,255
- Good thing we put in a chest tube.
- It was the right call.

303
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,517
Systolic only 85.

304
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,752
Dawn, let CT know that we're
coming up for a chest and abdomen.

305
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,362
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

306
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,522
She's pregnant. PRATT: What?

307
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,235
Right there. That's
a fetal heartbeat.

308
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,561
Didn't you order an ICON?

309
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,467
Yeah, he did. The
lab's backed up.

310
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,403
I'm pregnant?

311
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,574
Looks like you weren't
the only one in the dark.

312
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,014
Small-caliber bullet in
the T12 vertebral body.

313
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,623
He's febrile, probably infected.
He needs the O.R. for débridement.

314
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,282
- Abby. The detectives are here.
- You called the police?

315
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,395
We're obligated to
report gunshot wounds.

316
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,124
Get a CT. Make sure there's
nothing in the spinal canal or abdomen.

317
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,491
Mr. Vega.

318
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,000
- Heard you were the victim of a drive-by.
- Yeah.

319
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,231
- Can you tell us when and where?
- Three nights ago, on my block.

320
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,000
That would be 3027 Pierce?

321
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,236
- Right.
- We don't have a report of that.

322
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,846
But there was a shooting
at a deli on Leavitt.

323
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,880
Owner was shot,
but he returned fire.

324
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,848
- Carlos had nothing to do with that.
- Elena.

325
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,353
Why don't you call your mom?
Have her take Tyler home.

326
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,721
- It's all right.
- Three Latino suspects got away.

327
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,885
But witnesses say one
of them was wounded.

328
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,554
- It wasn't me. Ask the store owner.
- He's in a coma.

329
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,668
As long as your bullet isn't a match
for his gun, you don't have a problem.

330
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,240
- Gross hematuria.
- We're taking her to the scanner.

331
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,605
- Is that okay in the first trimester?
- Nope. Too much radiation.

332
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,542
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- We need to focus on you now.

333
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,683
Please, someone go
see how Casey's doing.

334
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,181
- I need to know.
- I'll check.

335
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,614
- What?
- You can't do a CT.

336
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,947
- She'll never consent.
- She's not competent.

337
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,853
Let's follow with a formal ultrasound.
We'll get a good look at the kidneys.

338
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,187
We cannot do the
formal ultrasound that fast.

339
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,862
Why? You're a resourceful guy.

340
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,363
So you expect the radiologist to be
at my beck and call Q 15 minutes?

341
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,264
- Yeah, I do.
- They don't have enough machines or...

342
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,404
Hey, guys. They
need help in here.

343
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,039
What's wrong with Casey?

344
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,539
Make it happen, Dr. Pratt.

345
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,707
Charged to 360. Clear.

346
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,243
Still no pulse. V-fib.

347
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,212
Resume CPR. SAM: Epi's in.

348
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,376
How many rounds of meds?
- It's the fifth.

349
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,612
- Amiodarone?
- Yes.

350
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,947
No.

351
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,751
You're coding a patient in here, and
nobody bothered to come and get me?

352
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,394
I'm on top of it.

353
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,721
Really? You're blasting
the myocardium with drugs...

354
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,992
and you're hoping for a miracle.

355
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,660
- Please, you've gotta save him.
- Sam, give the amio.

356
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,737
Did you hear what I just said?

357
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,081
- He's a kid.
- I am aware of that.

358
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,616
Mom? Come here.

359
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,973
We've been trying to restart his
heart for over half an hour now.

360
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,812
- You have to keep going.
- His injuries are too severe.

361
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,812
He's lost too much blood.

362
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,154
No. No, this isn't happening.

363
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,023
I'm gonna stop CPR
now, which means... No!

364
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,390
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't stop.

365
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,007
But he's just a boy.

366
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,037
He's my baby.

367
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,316
Casey.

368
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,384
So where's your mom?

369
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,927
Oh, she's at work.
She'll be here later.

370
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,000
Dr. Shuster was
obnoxious, no question...

371
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,695
but you could've been
a little more contrite.

372
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,772
- You know, played the game.
- I'm trying.

373
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,374
How about an eight?
Would an eight work here?

374
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,341
No. And I'm not
talking about Sudoku.

375
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,942
You know, the game, life.

376
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,778
Playing well with others. You
seem to have a problem with that.

377
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,218
How about a six?
Would a six work here?

378
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,756
Your evasiveness tells
me I'm onto something.

379
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,298
Did your dad hit you
when you were a kid?

380
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,933
What?

381
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,458
Parental abuse.

382
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,866
It's a common root of authority
and ego problems in adulthood.

383
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,638
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

384
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,107
I'm more of a Jungian.

385
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,607
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

386
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,806
No, I never watched <i>Star Trek.</i>

387
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,475
And you're starting
to freak me out, kid.

388
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,382
Yeah, I have that
effect on people.

389
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,058
I'm in college now at U of C.

390
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,888
When I raise my hand to ask a
question, the whole class stares.

391
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,547
That must be weird, huh?

392
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:34,124
Yeah, I kind of stick
out at frat parties.

393
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,635
Yeah, well...

394
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,905
I'm having troubles these days
trying to figure out where I fit in.

395
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,406
And you were right
about me and my dad.

396
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:56,111
If you wanna impress those
stuck-up ICU types, three words:

397
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,416
Fazio-Londe disease.

398
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,420
It's very rare.

399
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,357
Who knows how long it'll
take them to figure it out?

400
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,354
Is that what you think you have?

401
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,730
I don't think, I know.

402
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,701
Well, when you were admitted,
why didn't your mother tell them?

403
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,205
Well, she doesn't know.

404
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,343
I haven't told her.

405
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:22,212
That's not good enough. I need
that ultrasound now, not in 45 minutes.

406
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,317
Pratt, your <i>alter cocker</i> in 3
is kvetching about his kishke.

407
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,476
- What?
- It's the language of your people.

408
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,645
You want to get in
on a detached retina?

409
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,222
I have to go back to Waiting.

410
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,723
Mussolini was not happy
to see me out of my cage.

411
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,988
- Doctor, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

412
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:40,292
Carlos doesn't wanna
have the operation.

413
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,230
Why not?

414
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,303
Well, he was at
the deli that night.

415
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,133
- I don't need to hear this.
- Please.

416
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,673
- I don't wanna hear it.
- He was there to buy milk.

417
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,778
Please, you have
to listen. Please.

418
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,839
Okay.

419
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,576
That night in the deli,
two guys came in...

420
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,382
and they started making
trouble and pulled out guns.

421
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,581
Carlos told you this?

422
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,659
He tried to stop them, okay?
But they just started shooting.

423
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,321
And he ran so fast, he didn't even
realize he was hurt until he got home.

424
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,161
Why didn't you call the police
when you saw he was shot?

425
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,667
Well, Carlos wanted
to, but I didn't let him.

426
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,396
Why?

427
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:22,667
The guys who did this, they
are from our neighborhood, okay?

428
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,004
They know who we are.
They know where we live.

429
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:30,007
Well, that bullet is lodged in his
spine, and surgery really is the only...

430
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,741
He won't do it.

431
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,611
Some more fluid in
Morison's, but no hematoma.

432
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:36,914
Renal anatomy's intact.

433
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,957
- What of the fact she's peeing blood?
- Probably just parenchymal contusions.

434
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,858
If the urine doesn't clear in an hour,
do an IVP like Dr. Moretti suggested.

435
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,089
She's good.

436
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,427
I'll be back in 15 minutes
to repeat the scan.

437
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,762
I knew you'd find a way.

438
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,837
- He was 16, a child!
- Hey, hey, hey.

439
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,269
I have your e-mails,
photos. You're going to jail.

440
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,275
- I know this is hard, but you can't...
- She molested my son.

441
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,436
- You've got to leave.
- This is your fault.

442
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,241
He's dead because of you.

443
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,383
- What? JOANNA:
You saw the blood.

444
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,745
He was rushing me here.
That's why we crashed.

445
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,114
Oh, no.

446
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:11,416
You're gonna have to stop
hating me. I am having his baby.

447
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,956
- Okay, okay, okay.
- What?

448
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,993
Okay, come on. Come on,
you have to leave. I'm sorry.

449
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,960
If they take the bullet, cops
will place me at the scene.

450
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,656
Tell them what happened.

451
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,335
They won't believe me.
All they see is another spic.

452
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,836
Hopefully, the owner will come out
of his coma and back up your story.

453
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,305
If he doesn't, then
Carlos will go to jail.

454
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:34,140
I got a good job, Elena, the baby.
I mean, I don't wanna lose them.

455
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,746
Look, just get a lawyer...

456
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,383
The legal system doesn't
work for guys like me.

457
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,281
Do you understand that
you could be paralyzed?

458
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,925
I'll take my chances.

459
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,330
They talked to Carlos. Now
they wanna speak to the surgeon.

460
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,695
- He won't consent to the débridement?
- He's convinced he's screwed.

461
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,166
And he understands the risks?
It's his right to refuse. Detectives.

462
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,499
The DA just got off
the phone with a judge...

463
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:04,337
who's issuing a court order
compelling Carlos Vega to have surgery.

464
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,341
- What?
- It'll be here within the hour.

465
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:09,038
The state can't dictate treatment.
- It just did.

466
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,979
- The bullet will tell us if he's guilty.
- It doesn't matter if he's guilty.

467
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,678
This patient has rights.
We're not going to do it.

468
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,890
- It's not up to you.
- Really? What's next?

469
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,151
Forced sterilizations?
Mandated amputations?

470
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,989
Abby, maybe it's for the
best. Carlos needs the surgery.

471
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,188
These guys are only
trying to do their job.

472
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,627
We'll get an O.R. ready.

473
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,062
Thanks, doc.

474
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,294
You're kidding me.

475
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,372
- I don't like it, but it's done.
- He has the right to refuse.

476
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,135
If we leave the bullet in,
he ends up in a wheelchair.

477
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,368
Not immediately.

478
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,480
We can start him on IV
antibiotics and then talk to Legal...

479
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,979
Very high-minded, but naive.

480
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,845
If we refuse, they'll get
some other hospital to do it.

481
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,351
- You don't know that.
- As a matter of fact, I do.

482
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,718
Since a tricky spinal procedure
is inevitable, I'd rather I do it...

483
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,916
- How did this become about you?
- Let it go.

484
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:57,222
- You're not even gonna try.
- This case is no longer your concern.

485
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,729
Type and cross four
units and send him up.

486
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:07,436
- It's called Fazio-Londe syndrome.
- That's incredibly rare.

487
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,508
Yeah, only 30-something
cases in the literature.

488
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,338
It's a progressive
motor disorder.

489
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,141
Pneumonia is from decreased function
of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves.

490
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,477
I did an EMG, MRI. It all fits.

491
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,180
You need to confirm
this with a muscle biopsy.

492
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:25,381
- Well, Neuro's on it this afternoon.
- Way to be proactive, Dr. Gates.

493
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,049
- We'll round again at 3.
- Bye.

494
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:34,393
- So it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

495
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,467
What I wanna know is,
how did you figure this out?

496
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,371
At first it felt like a
lump in my throat.

497
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,706
Then it got to where solid
food made me throw up.

498
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,175
You didn't go to a doctor?

499
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,147
I convinced a grad
student in neurophysiology...

500
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,651
to do a muscle biopsy on the DL.

501
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,157
Confirmed what I already knew.

502
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,554
But your mom, you
didn't tell your mother?

503
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,095
What's the use in telling her
before she absolutely has to know?

504
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,231
Because she's your mother.

505
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:12,371
She wants to help you. She
wants to take care of you.

506
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,731
This news is pretty
much gonna ruin her life.

507
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,434
She'll spend everything she
has trying to keep me alive...

508
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:24,879
which is silly, because this
disease is invariably fatal.

509
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,349
Well, there must be some sort
of experimental treatments, right?

510
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,046
Trials?

511
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,855
Yeah.

512
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,028
Well, you know,
you have to tell her.

513
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,566
You have to tell her.

514
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,196
You know that, right?

515
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,209
Would you like me to be there?

516
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,345
It's okay.

517
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,119
I'll tell her tonight.

518
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,448
Did the doctor
tell you anything?

519
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,149
- Okay, what happened here?
- Killer bit me.

520
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,958
- What kind of dog is Killer?
- He's not a dog, he's a gerbil.

521
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,929
Wow. That's a good name for him.

522
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,160
Let's just clean him up,
give him some antibiotics.

523
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,270
And, ma'am, what
brings you here today?

524
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,771
I'm here for the air.

525
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,136
County air is very therapeutic.

526
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,107
Okay, so you don't wanna
see a doctor or anything?

527
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,372
You're just here to...

528
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,449
- Breathe.
- Right. Knock yourself out.

529
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:37,750
Uh, Chuny, the guy in the sunglasses
has been in the same position like all day.

530
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,822
Another drunk sleeping it off.

531
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,094
Hey, sir?

532
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,689
Sir?

533
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:51,893
Sir? Please don't
be dead. Sir? Hey.

534
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,632
I need a gurney over here, now.

535
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,838
So the drunk isn't drunk,
he's bleeding into his head.

536
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,445
- Yes, we know that. Thank you.
- Systolic's 182.

537
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,811
All right, bolus 50 of mannitol,
20 per kilo of Dilantin. Tube.

538
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,209
It's a classic example
of availability bias.

539
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,890
I have no idea what that means,
but I'm sure you're about to tell us.

540
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,526
The waiting area's full of
drunk homeless people...

541
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,993
- so that's what Chuny saw.
- I feel bad enough, all right?

542
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,130
All right, I'm in.
Toss me the bag.

543
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,667
- Call Respiratory for a vent.
- Nice pickup anyway.

544
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,168
Stabilize him and get
back into the waiting room.

545
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,068
Clearly, we need you out there.

546
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,075
Call CT, let them know we're on our
way, and get Neurosurge down here.

547
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:35,213
There's no ozone in the
Tropics. Our skin will melt off.

548
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,474
Okay, enough.
You don't wanna go.

549
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,550
- I'll go without you.
- Without me?

550
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,552
- It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- But I'll worry.

551
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,815
I'll miss you, and I
want us to be together.

552
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,222
- It's only for six months.
- Hope.

553
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,157
Morris.

554
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,527
Did you know your gal Hope there
descends from a tribe of Gypsy whores?

555
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,999
You obviously don't have
enough work to do here.

556
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,764
- Has anyone seen Sam?
- She's still in with the MVC mom.

557
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,669
We're going to Ike's early to
premedicate before speed dating.

558
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,902
- Wow. I could use a drink.
- I'll bring some extra Manischewitz.

559
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,775
Yeah, we know how your
tribe loves the fruit of the vine.

560
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,415
Will you knock it off already?

561
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,416
You know, you guys can
be a real pain in the <i>tokhes.</i>

562
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,759
Hey. Any news yet?

563
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,424
- No. It's been over two hours.
- Well, Carlos is gonna be all right.

564
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,900
They shouldn't have forced him
to have an operation. It isn't right.

565
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,504
Yeah.

566
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,198
I know you tried to
fight this. Thank you.

567
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,038
- Hey, the surgery went well.
- Oh, thank God.

568
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,373
- He has full function of his extremities.
- Well, that's good.

569
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,573
- I can take you to him if you'd like.
- Yes.

570
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,378
Abby, come walk with us.

571
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,544
- Did you get the bullet out?
- The strangest thing happened.

572
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,781
I removed the bullet,
placed it on a stand.

573
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:55,086
There was a bleeder, things got
hectic, stand got knocked over...

574
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,092
and the bullet
somehow went missing.

575
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,286
Went missing?

576
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,455
Cops have been
looking for it for an hour.

577
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,794
It just sort of vanished.

578
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,630
Oh.

579
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,630
- Well, can I go in?
- Yeah, absolutely.

580
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,604
Thank you.

581
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:19,078
- Vanished?
- Yeah. Weird, right?

582
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,460
Kidneys look good, and the
blood is clearing from your urine.

583
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,325
- So I don't need surgery?
- Doesn't look that way.

584
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,965
And the baby's gonna be okay?

585
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,459
No CT, no radiation.
Everything should be fine.

586
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,797
Thank you, doctors, so much.

587
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,998
We'll get you upstairs as
soon as the bed's ready.

588
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:47,640
- Hey, Dr. Moretti.
- Kevin.

589
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:51,511
All right, I just wanted to say that
the ultrasound was a good idea...

590
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,710
and it's a good thing that
we did it. So, you know.

591
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,218
- You're welcome.
- All right.

592
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,324
Maybe you'll think twice before
selling me out to Anspaugh...

593
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,959
and trying to steal my job.

594
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,095
- I wasn't trying to steal...
- Don't lie.

595
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:04,991
It belittles us both.

596
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,464
Um, we're gonna get
an ETA on your bed.

597
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,802
You think I'm some kind of
terrible person, don't you?

598
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,972
- He was a kid. You were his teacher.
- I'm only nine years older.

599
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,639
A few years from now,
no one would care.

600
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:25,875
But now they do.

601
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,384
I just can't believe he's gone.

602
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,760
Ma'am, you need some help.

603
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,156
His mom showed up at
my house this morning...

604
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,265
told me to stay
away from her son.

605
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,730
- You can't really blame her.
- It got heated. We had a fight.

606
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:49,832
I hit my head, and she ran
off. That's when I called Casey.

607
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,840
If only she had left us alone.

608
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,228
We were going
through a rough time.

609
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,740
He'd shut himself off.

610
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,372
Stayed in his room.

611
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,317
Things were getting better.

612
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,925
He was starting
to talk to me again.

613
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,670
I don't understand why
this is taking so long.

614
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,142
I thought my case for
custody was as strong as...

615
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:05,273
Because that's what you said.
Well, that's not good enough.

616
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,920
Sorry. I know you filed the
papers. You're doing all you can.

617
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,988
I gotta go. Thanks.

618
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,751
- You didn't have to do that.
- Yes, I did. Dr. Gates.

619
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,417
I know. Joshua's
been raving about you.

620
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,756
I'm Serena, his mom.

621
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,797
- He's a great kid.
- Yep. A handful.

622
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,993
Made me go to the library to pick
up some books he'd put on hold.

623
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,163
So has he talked
about what's going on?

624
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,609
Yeah. It sounds
pretty straightforward.

625
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,937
Straightforward?

626
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:37,013
I don't mean to sound cavalier about
pneumonia, but he's much better today.

627
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,410
I'm really relieved.

628
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,517
Excuse me, I have to fill out
some insurance thing for the clerk.

629
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,815
Okay, nice to meet you.

630
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:50,557
And don't let my kid run the place.
He's got that kind of personality.

631
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,662
I'll try to keep him in check.

632
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,501
You didn't tell her.

633
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,900
I started to, but I couldn't.

634
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:09,172
Joshua, she has to know.

635
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:13,011
So when she comes back later,
you and I will tell her together, okay?

636
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:18,815
I just... I can't see the look on her
face when she realizes I'm gonna die.

637
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,655
You do it.

638
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,162
I'm not really sure
I'm in the mood for this.

639
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,601
- You're just nervous.
- No, it's not that.

640
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:37,072
Come on, Sam, shake it
off. This is gonna be fun.

641
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,268
Come on.

642
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,038
Ladies, just let me say...

643
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,514
that we are the hottest
girls up in this place.

644
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,747
- Wow, a lot of people signed up for this.
- It's a numbers game, Sam.

645
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,550
And I like the odds.

646
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,853
You know, wouldn't it be great if
tonight we all met our soul mates?

647
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,257
Three cosmos, please.

648
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,898
I would just be happy to meet a
nice guy and go on a nice date.

649
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,730
- We're happy you came with us tonight.
- It's about time.

650
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:08,135
- I know, I gotta get out there.
- Girl, life is too damn short.

651
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,933
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah, I will drink to that.

652
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:16,538
- A toast. To meeting the nice guys.
- To falling in love.

653
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,718
To sex without batteries.

654
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,814
Come on, come on, come on now.

655
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,789
- That's it.
- I'm gonna go get me some.

656
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,292
Let's go.

657
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,987
I was thinking maybe you should
stay at our place until you get better.

658
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,567
- Oh, no. I can't do that.
- Well, at least while Luka's out of town.

659
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:41,332
- I don't want to impose.
- Hey, hold that elevator. Going down.

660
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,442
And I wouldn't want you to think
you'd have to wait on me hand and foot.

661
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,102
Believe me, that'll
never happen.

662
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:53,583
- Come on, it'll be fun. You, me and Joe.
- You already have a lot on your plate.

663
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,244
Neela, your taxi's out
front. Take care of yourself.

664
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,255
- Thanks, Frank.
- Yeah, but it's so quiet with Luka away.

665
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,791
And besides, I could
use some free babysitting.

666
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,429
I guess Joe needs to get
to know his Auntie Neela.

667
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,495
- Yeah.
- But isn't Luka coming home soon?

668
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,099
I hope so, but I don't know.

669
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,667
His trip is taking
longer than we thought.

670
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,100
It's gotta be hard for
him without you and Joe.

671
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,671
Yeah, I mean, he misses us...

672
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,970
but you know, on some level, I
think he's really happy in Croatia.

673
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:22,046
You know, he's comfortable
there. I can hear it in his voice.

674
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,047
- What do you think?
- Thank you. I'd love to stay.

675
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,981
Okay, great. Joe's
nanny will let you in.

676
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,850
There's Thai food in the
fridge. I'll be home in a while.

677
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,220
- Brilliant. I'll see you then.
- Okay, bye.

678
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,054
That waiting room
looks like a ghost town.

679
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,791
- You did a great job today.
- Thank you. And it was such a pleasure.

680
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,835
Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it,
because you'll be doing it again tomorrow.

681
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,503
Good night, Abby.

682
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,211
Dr. Lockhart, you got a minute?

683
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,476
It's an all-day bridge
tournament. You'll be bored.

684
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,983
- Teach me to play.
- I already have a partner.

685
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,486
- Yeah, but who's better-looking?
- It's a tossup.

686
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,990
He is 78, very distinguished,
and he knows what a shallot is.

687
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,028
- Well, what do you call that thing?
- It's an onion.

688
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,894
- Aren't they the same?
- No.

689
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,193
- Morris.
- Hey.

690
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,859
Look, now I can "challah"
at you all through dinner.

691
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,563
- Get it?
- Hi.

692
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,939
- Where's Hope?
- Oh, she's not coming. She's sick.

693
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:30,844
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Sick of me.

694
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,074
- What?
- I'm sorry.

695
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,845
Maybe I should go. I don't
wanna burden you with this.

696
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,079
- Oh, no, no, don't be silly. Stay.
- Okay.

697
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,453
But I've completely
lost my appetite, though.

698
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,863
I built a time
machine in my garage.

699
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,704
I really plan on sticking
with women this time.

700
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:02,780
What's the oldest guy
you've ever balled?

701
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,725
I hear you'd never date a cop.

702
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,987
How did...?

703
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,827
I am gonna kill Chuny and Dawn.

704
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,796
I like the new look.

705
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,432
Thanks.

706
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,744
So, what's your beef
with Chicago's finest?

707
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:41,946
Well, it's just, in my line of work, I
see you guys get hurt, shot and killed.

708
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,813
So you'd worry about me.

709
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,158
Yeah, I guess I would.

710
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,328
- I'd worry about you too.
- Really?

711
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,487
I see the people that
come into County.

712
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,531
The drunks, the drug seekers.
It's a pretty dangerous place.

713
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,602
On second thought, maybe
I shouldn't date a nurse.

714
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:05,970
You like Italian food?

715
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,942
- I love it.
- I know this great place over on State.

716
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,812
Hey, you're holding
everybody up. Time to go.

717
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:20,020
Yes, it is.

718
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:28,224
I think it's great that she wants to
go do a medical mission in Caracas...

719
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,526
I really do.

720
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:33,138
But I have a job,
okay? I have a life here.

721
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,968
- Do you have any more of this cake left?
- She'll be back before you know it.

722
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,634
I can't help but think that this trip
is an elaborate excuse to break up.

723
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,372
Have you ever considered
that it's not about you?

724
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,517
I mean, the long-distance
thing never ends well, does it?

725
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,882
Morris, you're not listening.
This isn't about your relationship.

726
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,422
It's about Hope and her doing
something that's important to her.

727
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,992
- I mean, you gotta respect that.
- I do, I do.

728
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,688
But living in a tent city without
running water or a toilet?

729
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:03,198
- That's not my idea of fun.
- All right, I get it, it's not your thing.

730
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,530
- That's okay.
- I know, but...

731
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,571
Look, just give her
some breathing room.

732
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,265
Hope is smart and independent...

733
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,741
and that's the reason why you
like her in the first place, right?

734
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:19,374
But what if she meets somebody
else? Some hunky humanitarian type?

735
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,610
You're just gonna
have to trust her.

736
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,728
Hey, Lucien. Hey.

737
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,097
The police found a large
sum of money and a gun...

738
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,204
in Carlos and Elena's apartment.

739
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,600
A lot of people have guns.

740
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:46,871
Yeah, $1830, the exact
amount stolen from the minimart.

741
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:50,447
You'd think after years of this,
you'd start to get a handle on people.

742
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,949
The reality is, everybody lies and
manipulates to get what they want.

743
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,748
- I believed them too.
- Everybody.

744
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,089
It's sad. Okay,
I'll call the police...

745
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,492
let them know somebody
found their bullet.

746
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,360
It was lodged into a crevice
in the anesthesia cart.

747
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,730
Strangest thing. Night, Abby.

748
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,068
Good night.

749
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,508
He looks like a little
boy when he sleeps.

750
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,977
He's a cool kid.

751
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:04,485
The antibiotics seem to be working.
You think he'll be coming home soon?

752
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,219
Serena, there's
something I need to tell you.

753
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,792
What?

754
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:13,398
Joshua has a
neuromuscular disease.

755
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:17,433
- What?
- It affects the nerves in the brain...
