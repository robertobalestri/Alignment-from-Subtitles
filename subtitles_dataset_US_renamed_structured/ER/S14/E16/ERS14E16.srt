1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,936
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,907
If you can handle a relationship with
no strings, sex with no commitments.

3
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,444
- I'm all good.
- These are really beautiful.

4
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,343
They're kind of embarrassing.

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,125
Well, I had a good time with
you, I just wanted to let you know.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,989
- I'm Simon Brenner.
- Seems like a nice bloke.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,610
- Is that what you call it?
- I quit.

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,550
Well, I need something else.

9
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,284
I'm talking about my marriage.
I just, I don't know if I can fix it.

10
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,825
Hi, Sheryl, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

11
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:30,795
Four kids, 23 years
later, here I am.

12
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,575
You shouldn't have to
go through this alone.

13
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,967
It was my choice to end our
relationship. I'm letting you off the hook.

14
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,708
Joe's still asleep.

15
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,316
- He had a rough night.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,520
How many times was he up? Three?

17
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,183
Four.

18
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:07,530
- You have your interview today, huh?
- Yep.

19
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,852
Are you looking at apartments?

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,255
What am I supposed to do?

21
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,693
I told you the truth,
that was not easy for me.

22
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,230
And you know how badly
I feel and how sorry I am.

23
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,697
We're not doing this now.

24
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,164
What? What do you want?

25
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,498
I swear, I don't care
what it is. I'll do it...

26
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,267
Did you think coming to Croatia
and apologizing was all it would take?

27
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,635
No, I didn't.

28
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,506
Well, you tell me you
were weak, you screwed up.

29
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,274
You broke my trust. You
put our son in jeopardy.

30
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,714
- What the hell do you expect?
- I don't know.

31
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:02,412
It... I have to get ready for this
thing. You... We'll talk about it later.

32
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,380
Will we? That's all I'm asking.

33
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,560
Well, we're not
doing it now, okay?

34
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,863
Hey.

35
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,107
- Hey.
- Long time no see.

36
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,438
I know, the shift gods have
been conspiring against us.

37
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,273
Well, I have the
perfect solution.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,416
How about a little romantic
getaway in Quebec?

39
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,711
- Quebec?
- The Little France of the Americas.

40
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,719
I booked us into a B & B this
weekend and I thought maybe...

41
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,256
Shoot. I made plans to do a wreck
dive in Lake Michigan with the guys.

42
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,552
- A wreck dive?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,628
Did I mention it's
called Little France?

44
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,059
I'll try to get out of it.

45
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,257
- Let's talk later, okay?
- Okay.

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,233
- Hey, Morris, doughnut?
- Yes.

47
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,065
- What's the occasion?
- Yeah, Gates.

48
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,933
No reports of
hell freezing over.

49
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,974
That hurts, Frank. If you don't
want any doughnuts, big guy.

50
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,136
Sorry I cast aspersions
on your generosity.

51
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,941
- Hey, Sam.
- Dr. Gates.

52
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,414
Frank? Labs back on
my deodorant eater?

53
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,746
- Negatory.
- Doughnut?

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,287
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, you want a jelly?

55
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,482
I thought we agreed
to keep it under wraps.

56
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,990
- Be cool about us.
- What?

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,789
It's a doughnut, not a dozen
roses. I bought for everyone.

58
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,022
Sometimes a doughnut is
not just a doughnut, okay?

59
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,325
So cut it out.

60
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,304
Ah, there she is, Ms. Croatia.

61
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,445
- So how was it?
- It was good, thanks.

62
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:36,549
- And you did actually go this time, right?
- Yes, I actually went.

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,809
Abby, hey. ABBY: Hey.

64
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,543
- Have a nice vacation?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,550
Great. PRATT: Damn.

66
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,493
Oh, you guys all right?

67
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,063
- Wow, what is that, gasoline?
- Underground tanker erupted in a geyser.

68
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,234
- Soaked head to toe.
- Tried to cap it off.

69
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,401
We hosed him off, but
the fumes were bad.

70
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,368
- He needs to be soaked.
- Call HAZMAT.

71
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,370
Clean him. You
need to be looked at.

72
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,304
We're fine.

73
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,006
Oh, somebody get a gurney.

74
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,238
- Hey, put those out.
- Reidy, you okay?

75
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,815
- Is he breathing?
- Wait, don't get up.

76
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,928
There's nothing wrong
with Internet dating but...

77
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,124
So, what's the problem?

78
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,168
Working in a hospital, the hours,
the intensity, it can be alienating.

79
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:35,002
There's just no way to date a
normal person in the real world.

80
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,474
You don't think that
there are doctors online?

81
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,137
Or, God forbid, other hard-working
professionals who might relate...

82
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,874
even though they've never
heard of gentinomium?

83
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,279
Gentamicin.

84
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,351
I'm just saying,
happiness takes up space.

85
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,484
Everyone has to make room
in their life for it, not just doctors.

86
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,826
Well, speaking of gentamicin...

87
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,400
the cultures are still
negative, which is good.

88
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,069
The fevers could
be atelectasis...

89
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,728
so three laps around
the ward today, okay?

90
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,497
Oh, hold on.

91
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,977
I'm posting a
profile of you online.

92
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,239
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

93
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,213
- I'm pretending to be you.
- All right, then.

94
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:24,154
I want a tall, dark, symphony conductor
who is fluent in Italian with abs of steel.

95
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,086
I'm on it.

96
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,368
- Hey, how's Mrs. Hawkins?
- Still running a low-grade temp.

97
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,197
The graft is infected.

98
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,202
Are you sure?

99
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,706
- Well, couldn't that be a hematoma?
- No.

100
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,901
Not with the stranding
and irregular density.

101
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,546
Switch her to linazolid. Take
her up to O.R. in the morning.

102
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,725
Go ahead, answer
that. I'll talk to Sheryl.

103
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,012
It should come from me.

104
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,120
It'd be weird if it came
from someone else.

105
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,746
It's the ICU again. Look,
let me take care of this.

106
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,586
- I'll come back and tell her.
- Okay.

107
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,093
Meet me in the ER when you're
finished. We got consults piling up.

108
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,523
- Hey, we need a line.
- I got it.

109
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,727
- Do I still have eyebrows?
- They'll grow back.

110
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,104
- Burn yourself?
- Yeah, a little bit.

111
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,741
Make sure you get that checked out.
- I got this.

112
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,468
No, she's fine. Sam, you
don't need coddling, right?

113
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,442
Human fireball in the
ambulance bay, I love this place.

114
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,207
Sats are good.

115
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,715
Some singed nasal hairs,
but the lungs are clear.

116
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,877
Partial thickness
burns to both the hands.

117
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,215
- Nothing circumferential.
- Burns are minimal.

118
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,223
Maybe 5 percent
BSA. You got lucky.

119
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,224
We need a doctor on the board.

120
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,454
- Brenner's not busy.
- He's about to be.

121
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,928
- Who's Brenner?
- New attending.

122
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,858
He thinks he's
God's gift to medicine.

123
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,391
And women. ABBY: Great.

124
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,969
- We can always use one of those.
- Abby, you're with me.

125
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,073
Admit Mr. Sucar to the burn
unit. Keep an eye on his airway.

126
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,640
All right.

127
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,302
I gotta say, I was
shocked when Luka quit.

128
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,778
- I always thought he'd be a lifer here.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,349
Well, change is probably
a good thing, right?

130
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,486
Is that why you
cancelled your interview?

131
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,951
I didn't cancel it.

132
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,421
I just postponed it. I'm gonna see
what's happening with Luka first.

133
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,026
You got 14 candidates
going for one attending slot.

134
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,355
Be gone before you get
a chance to reschedule.

135
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,192
In three months you're
gonna find yourself out of a job.

136
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,925
- Pratt, we need a doctor here.
- I'm on with Nephrology.

137
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,381
Got it. LAVERNE: Kwan Lee, 19.

138
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,630
He got jumped on the
El platform on Addison.

139
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,172
Hi, Kwan, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
What happened?

140
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:25,005
I was waiting for the train. These
guys pulled me off the bench.

141
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,044
Vitals stable, 18
gauge in the antecube.

142
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,274
All right, on my count.
Ready, one, two, three.

143
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,785
- I tried to run away.
- Pulse 122, sat 98.

144
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,322
Lungs sound good.

145
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,720
You have any family
you want us to call, Kwan?

146
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,124
- They're in Seoul.
- What's your plan?

147
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,390
CBC, trauma panel,
chest x-ray, see if...

148
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,296
A radioulnar series.

149
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,067
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

150
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,500
What's his sat?

151
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,141
Ninety-eight. I
think I said that.

152
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,176
Just a bit of blood. It's
probably from your nose.

153
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:02,043
I want to go back to Korea.
Chicago isn't working out.

154
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,877
Come on, more
about your new hottie.

155
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,542
- Hottie is too reductive a word.
- You're killing me.

156
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,918
If dialysis won't unlock your
A-V shunt, we'll revise it in the OR.

157
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,718
- Thanks, Lucien.
- Yeah, she's hot.

158
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,851
But she's also... She's
complex, innovative, she's...

159
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,589
She's kind of earthy. It's
completely unprecedented.

160
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,563
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Oh, shut up.

161
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,170
- Who is she?
- No comment.

162
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,396
Where did you meet?

163
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:29,907
- All I'll say is, I love this new job.
- I knew it, she works here.

164
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,410
Lucien, shampoo man's gonna follow
up with you as an outpatient, okay?

165
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,379
If he must. Lunch later?

166
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,014
- That could work.
- My office, 2:00?

167
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,121
I'll try to make it.

168
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,624
- Hey.
- Hey.

169
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,350
She's so hot.

170
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,520
Missy Voltaire, restrained driver,
minivan T-boned by an SUV.

171
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,928
Haleh, page OB and
let's get the ultrasound.

172
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,897
- When are you due, Missy?
- Next month.

173
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,402
My husband's gonna freak. He's
been superstitious about the pregnancy.

174
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,972
- Is this your first baby?
- No, it's our 13th.

175
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,906
You did break your arm.
There's a fracture right there.

176
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,478
No, no, no.

177
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,105
I've got a critique in a week and
I've got all those zDUBS to do.

178
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,841
What are you talking about?

179
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:17,114
I'm a freshman at the art
institute. I study animation.

180
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,589
- Can we take his collar off?
- Sure.

181
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,161
Laverne, come here and I'll
show you how to clear a C-spine.

182
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,632
I'm gonna work my way
down your vertebrae, okay?

183
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,827
- That sounds fun.
- Let me know if anything hurts.

184
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:34,498
All right, you're looking for tenderness,
step-offs, any other irregularities.

185
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,074
- How long have you had this?
- I'm not sure.

186
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,876
Yeah, it's a bit fluctuant.

187
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,781
- Is it infected?
- It could be a node or a cyst.

188
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,353
Abby, Morris could use
some extra hands in here.

189
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,615
- Okay.
- I'm coming.

190
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,268
- I'll talk to Surgery.
- Okay.

191
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,954
- Surgery?
- To get a second opinion.

192
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,891
I'll be back to
explain it to you.

193
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,291
I got this.

194
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,831
I just came over to meet
the famous Abby Lockhart.

195
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,332
I'm Simon Brenner. Your
reputation precedes you.

196
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,663
Right back at you.

197
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,948
- They all have D names?
- How can we help?

198
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:09,306
This is Missy, 35
weeks, G13, P12.

199
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,446
- Abby, will you do an ultrasound, please?
- Sure.

200
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,304
So are you Catholic? - No.

201
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,542
Mormon? MISSY: No.

202
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,119
Just really, really fertile.
- Yeah.

203
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,450
- Baby's very active.
- God, you should see after I eat.

204
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,150
- It's like Riverdance. MORRIS:
Chest and pelvis are stable.

205
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,558
After number eight, my
husband got a vasectomy.

206
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,789
Three months later,
poof, I'm pregnant again.

207
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,697
- His boys refuse to be held back?
- Yeah, took it as a sign to keep going.

208
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,531
- OB's here, what have you got?
- Thirty-five weeker, G13, P12.

209
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,141
Thirteen kids? Are you
out of your frigging mind?

210
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,302
Haleh, CBC, CHEM-7,
LFTs, type and cross for four.

211
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,539
Do you wanna add a
Kleihauer-Betke test?

212
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,547
ER docs never
remember to order that.

213
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,709
That's not true.

214
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:56,755
Fetal heart rate 156,
amniotic index, perfect.

215
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,926
Let's monitor the fetus for a
couple of hours just to be sure.

216
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,689
Continuous FHT. I'll be
back to check the strip.

217
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,092
- You got a minute?
- Mm-hm.

218
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,733
I'm very curious.

219
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,032
Why a physician with your experience
would wanna work in palliative care?

220
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,606
Why would you
wanna give up the...?

221
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:20,236
Emily, good morning.
- -the adrenaline rush of the ER?

222
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,248
I've reached a point where I feel I
need to make a change, you know?

223
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:29,185
I'm looking to
refocus my energies.

224
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,986
- Oh, I see.
- And my father died a short time ago.

225
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,060
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

226
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,358
I cared for him during his illness,
and I was with him when he died.

227
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,728
You calling me a liar?

228
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,234
- Made me appreciate...
- Excuse me for a moment.

229
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:49,104
- Sure, take your time.
- Please feel free to look around.

230
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,015
Hi, nice to see you.

231
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,522
Bull hockey!

232
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,596
Cheese and crackers.

233
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,131
Hey. Hey, do you play cards?

234
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,731
- Uh, sure.
- Good, I'm dying for some real action.

235
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,902
Actually, I'm dying
of cancer. Sit.

236
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:30,816
We'll play five-card draw.
Nothing wild but the dealer.

237
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,248
Sit!

238
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:46,824
- Luka Kovac.
- Walter Perkins.

239
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,861
You visiting family?

240
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,505
No, I'm actually here
for a job interview.

241
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:57,769
- Oh, what line of work are you in?
- I'm a doctor.

242
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,778
I used to work in the
ER at Country General.

243
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,350
- Can I have three?
- Used to?

244
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,679
What? Did you get fired?

245
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,781
No.

246
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,321
Well, why in Sam Hill
would you wanna work here?

247
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,086
Every morning I wake up,
there's another empty bed.

248
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,859
Let's just say I'm trying to make
some changes in my life, okay?

249
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:22,161
You want some advice, run
from this place and don't look back.

250
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,826
Take me with you when you go.

251
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,601
Straight flush.

252
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,077
You wanna play for money?

253
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,577
He's distant and angry.

254
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,080
It's like not one thing
I do or say isn't wrong.

255
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,243
It makes sense that there
would be a period of time like this.

256
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,255
After I got over there and I told
him, I kept waiting for it to get easier.

257
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,087
I kept thinking, okay, the
bad part's gonna be over now.

258
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,195
It's not easy to be patient.

259
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,594
I don't know, he's planning things.
You know, without including me.

260
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,257
He's applying for jobs
without discussing it with me.

261
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,769
He was looking at the real estate
section today. What does that mean?

262
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,702
This is what you signed up for.

263
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,638
He gets to make the
next move. You get to wait.

264
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,374
You always use
propofol for reductions?

265
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,677
Mm-hm. It's a great drug.

266
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,321
Short half-life, easy
to titrate. It's very safe.

267
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,135
Shoulder doesn't
seem to wanna go back.

268
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,221
Do you want some
countertraction, old boy?

269
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,693
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- Ortho prefer a scapula manipulation.

270
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,558
We should let Skye
here take a shot.

271
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,327
You look fit enough to pop
that thing back into place.

272
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:32,768
- I'm more about finesse than force.
- I'll remember that.

273
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,997
Fine, Dr. Wexler, take a shot.

274
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,506
Okay, Simon.

275
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,668
- We can take it from here.
- Then take it.

276
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,847
We're good here, thanks.

277
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,915
- The shoulder's in.
- Wow.

278
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,110
- Did you stop the propofol?
- That was fast.

279
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,447
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

280
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,590
Even the new attending
recognizes that.

281
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,124
- Brenner?
- He's the kind of guy you wanna hate.

282
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,591
But somehow can't.

283
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,526
- I totally know what you mean.
- Yeah, totally.

284
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,996
Hey, you gonna
fix my arm or what?

285
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,601
- It's all done.
- What?

286
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,135
The sedative we gave you...

287
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,638
can cause you to lose the minutes
before we gave you the medicine.

288
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,504
Milk of amnesia strikes again.

289
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,741
Okay, all done.

290
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,383
Can you run that
to the lab for me?

291
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,487
This is what I thought America
would look like before I came here.

292
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,920
I wanted to come here
ever since I was 10.

293
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,390
Sounds like you were
a very ambitious kid.

294
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,658
That's not what my parents thought.
They said art was a hobby, not a career.

295
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,165
Well, my family were the
same. Science or nothing.

296
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,396
Hi, I'm Dr. Rasgotra. I've come
to check out this neck thing.

297
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,672
I could not afford the tuition,
but I sent my portfolio anyway.

298
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:50,408
- And you got a scholarship?
- Partial.

299
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,553
My parents had to give
up a lot to send me here.

300
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,288
- I'm sure they're very proud, Kwan.
- I don't know.

301
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,920
I didn't expect
people to be so...

302
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,800
- I don't know. ABBY:
What do you think?

303
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,096
It's probably an infected cyst,
I can do an I and D if you want.

304
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,331
- What's an I and D?
- Incision and drainage.

305
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,373
I'll open up the
area and clean it out.

306
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,169
Open it up? I don't understand.

307
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,640
It's a simple procedure.

308
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,281
It's to make sure the
fluid doesn't reaccumulate.

309
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,145
- Can this wait until I'm home?
- It's hard to be far away.

310
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,049
But you're here now,
so let us take care of this.

311
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,952
Dr. Brenner, labs are back
on your guy with the ear worm.

312
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,523
One step ahead of you, Frank.

313
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,526
Wired to receive lab reports,
I get them anywhere, anytime.

314
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,323
- Really?
- Yeah, sure, take a look.

315
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,489
Doesn't that raise
confidentiality issues?

316
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,531
Loosen up, Greg. Oh, excuse me.

317
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,302
If I'm the uptight one,
then this is bizarro ER.

318
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,791
I was thinking about you.

319
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,831
Get a sputum sample
from the homeless guy.

320
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,499
Nursing man needs a new diaper.

321
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,838
And swab the dripping
ulcer on the diabetic.

322
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,141
I was gonna have Dawn help
you, but you could handle it yourself.

323
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,978
- Anyone seen Dr. Brenner?
- He's around here somewhere.

324
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,916
Yeah, he still has a
few more asses to pinch.

325
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,515
What was that, doctor?

326
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,057
Where did you find this
guy? He's a piece of work.

327
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,020
Is he? PRATT: Yeah.

328
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,164
I don't wanna be the
boy who cries wolf...

329
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,731
- He's a wolf.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

330
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,392
Did residency in the
finest hospital in Melbourne.

331
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,105
Maybe so, but he ended
up without a clue on how to...

332
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,868
Uncle Donny. To what
do we owe this pleasure?

333
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,103
- Uncle Donny?
- You're his uncle?

334
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,909
My sister had a brief disastrous
tryst with an Aussie back in the '70s.

335
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,382
I've been trying to lure Simon to
the Northern Hemisphere for years.

336
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,914
Squeeze in a lunch at the Faculty
Club? I'd like to introduce you around.

337
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,924
You can survive without Simon
for a few hours, right, Greg?

338
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,187
- Definitely.
- Excuse me.

339
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,661
Is my wife here? Car
crash, very pregnant?

340
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,294
Missy and the baby
are doing great.

341
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:54,867
And you, young lady,
you must be Daisy.

342
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,942
Aye? Your mum
told me all about you.

343
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,476
- I'll take you to her.
- Thank you.

344
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,240
Sam, can we get some videos
for these kids in the family room?

345
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:09,287
Meet me out front in five? I
am so glad this is all working out.

346
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,820
I heard the attending interviews
were today. What time is yours?

347
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,895
- I postponed it.
- Really, why?

348
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,999
I'm still trying to get used
to the time change, I mean.

349
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,259
- Well, it's good to have you back.
- Thanks.

350
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,064
It's a child-life
emergency, please.

351
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,934
I have the Swiss Family
Robinson here. I'm not kidding.

352
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,737
A DVD player, a Nintendo,
a coloring book, I...

353
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,437
Steal from the PICU.
Yeah, I don't care.

354
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,485
- Do you think we could talk later?
- I'm a little busy now.

355
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,817
That's why I said later.

356
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:50,654
If it's one of those amends
conversations, I'd rather not.

357
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,599
It's five minutes.
It's all I'm asking.

358
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,636
Look, Abby, this... It's not
a good day for me, okay?

359
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,681
When they told me it had spread,
there was no one for me to tell.

360
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,751
So I figured, that's it.
I'll go back to Cayeux.

361
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,344
Where?

362
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,684
Cayeux-sur-Mer. It's a little
town on the coast of France.

363
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:23,489
I spent some time there in
the service, right after D-day.

364
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,359
I met a girl.

365
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,296
I promised her when I left
I'd see her again someday.

366
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,468
- Did you?
- No.

367
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,336
But when they told me I
was dying, I wanted to go...

368
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,415
and then the doctor
said I couldn't.

369
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,551
There wasn't time.

370
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,883
Now look at me.
Stuck in this place.

371
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,888
Could've been to Europe
and back five times by now.

372
00:19:55,728 --> 00:20:00,530
I just made my first trip back
home to Croatia in almost 10 years.

373
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,559
And why did you stay
away so long? Two.

374
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,697
When I left, it
was a difficult time.

375
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,710
I was determined
to forget everything.

376
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,540
Forget what?

377
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,185
It's much better now,
it's an amazing place...

378
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,582
but back then, you
know, things were bad.

379
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,189
There was a lot of
chaos and destruction.

380
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,053
Oh, you mean the war?

381
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:32,559
When I left, I thought
I'd never go back.

382
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,633
It's called healing via
secondary intention.

383
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:42,240
The hole gets smaller as the
wound heals from the bottom up.

384
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,410
Did you like it there
when you first got there?

385
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,905
It was lonely, but it
gets better, give it time.

386
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,873
- Trauma 2. BRENNER:
<i>Hey, it's Simon, is that Sam?</i>

387
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,110
You got me.

388
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,619
<i>I just got a lab report back on my
new phone, wanted to let you know.</i>

389
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,248
<i>Sparkling's fine, and
the grilled radicchio.</i>

390
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,485
Cut.

391
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,222
<i>Anyway, cytology came back
on the Korean kid, Kwan Lee.</i>

392
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,731
- Dr. Brenner, you're on speakerphone.
<i>- High-grade large-cell lymphoma.</i>

393
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,494
- Dr. Brenner.
<i>- Kid's got cancer.</i>

394
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,138
<i>Node's full of blasts,
looks very aggressive.</i>

395
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,365
<i>Tough break for the...</i>

396
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:22,309
- It's an infection.
- Kwan.

397
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,276
That's what you said, you
said there was an infection.

398
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,148
- No big deal, that's what you said.
- It's probably early.

399
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,312
- It's good that we caught this...
- Shut up.

400
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,583
I don't have cancer.
I'm 19 years old.

401
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,990
I was mugged, I don't have cancer.
- Settle down, okay?

402
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,858
Get me out of here.

403
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,623
- Kwan.
- I don't have cancer.

404
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:44,169
I want to go home.
Get me out of here.

405
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,604
- What's going on?
- I want to go home.

406
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,539
What did you give him?
- Propofol.

407
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,178
This never happened.

408
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,741
After all he's been through...

409
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,321
he did not need to learn he had
cancer over the speakerphone.

410
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,515
Okay, so your plan
was to erase his memory.

411
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,852
He could be allergic,
he could stop breathing.

412
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:11,862
- I know the risks of propofol.
- He's waking up, come here.

413
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,493
- He's a terrified kid, all alone.
- We could've helped him deal with that.

414
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,038
This was gonna haunt
him for the rest of his life.

415
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,038
However long that
is. Why not take it?

416
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,870
- Start over, do it better.
- That's not how it works.

417
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,170
I know how it works.

418
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,781
It's our job to deal with
the consequences...

419
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,781
you can't pretend
it never happened.

420
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,250
Oh, well, thank
you for the lesson.

421
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,182
Look, I'll review the
slides at oncology...

422
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,850
and confirm the
diagnosis before I tell him.

423
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,826
He's my patient, how
about I deal with it?

424
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,190
- Hi.
- Hey.

425
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,408
So how long do I have to
stay here? I'm kind of starving.

426
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,270
Well, Sam could get you a tray.

427
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,806
No reason he has
to be NPO, right?

428
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:08,350
Listen, Kwan, is there anybody here
in Chicago that could pick you up?

429
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,648
Oh, I'm fine on the el.

430
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,690
I know, but just...

431
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,057
After the procedure and everything
I would feel more comfortable...

432
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,425
if there was someone
to drive you home.

433
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,158
Is there anybody from
school? A roommate, maybe?

434
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,597
My RA might come.

435
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,204
She's kind of weird, but
she's always been nice to me.

436
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,341
Okay, well, let's call her.

437
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,875
Thank you.

438
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,241
Sure.

439
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,816
So, what brought you to Chicago?

440
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,378
County General.

441
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,521
I thought I'd dive into work
and leave everything behind...

442
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,683
but it's not so easy, you know?

443
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,628
On a good day, you maybe
delay death for a while...

444
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,699
but you never really beat it.

445
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,700
You should try standup comedy.

446
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,976
- You're a gloomy bastard.
- Sorry.

447
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,843
So, what made you decide
to go back home then?

448
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,537
My father got sick.

449
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:14,244
And I thought I can
maybe fix things, you know?

450
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,824
Bring him back to Chicago,
find him the best oncologist.

451
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,584
He wouldn't leave.

452
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,591
You know? He wanted to...

453
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,664
He wanted to stay in his country,
surrounded by the people he loved.

454
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,597
He decided he wants
to die there, like that.

455
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,668
Good for him.

456
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,000
At first, I felt angry.

457
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,474
You know? Betrayed.

458
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,237
Why? Because he
didn't wanna fight?

459
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,509
But, eventually, I let
go of it, you know?

460
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,452
I just tried to
be there for him.

461
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,852
So, what? You learned
you can't fix things?

462
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,961
That made you feel this
might be a good place for you?

463
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,792
Kind of.

464
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,501
Two pair. Two
kings and two fours.

465
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,466
Aces over eights.

466
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,938
I believe they call that
the dead man's hand.

467
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,971
Hey, listen. If I'm canceling
the hotel, I should let them know.

468
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,682
It's the wreck of the <i>Northerner.</i>
Schooner from the 1800s.

469
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,345
It's been there for over 200 years, it
should still be there after this weekend.

470
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,546
Uh...

471
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,158
Okay, Little France
will have to wait.

472
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,386
I'm sorry you went
through all that trouble.

473
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:33,020
I feel bad bailing at the last minute,
and I really wanna do the dive.

474
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,858
Okay.

475
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,668
Hey. What if I came with you?

476
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,669
- Do you even dive?
- I have once, in Belize.

477
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,836
Kind of hated it, but I
could hang out on the boat...

478
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,744
mix martinis, wait
for you to come up.

479
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,077
It'll be cold and boring.

480
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,717
Really? I'll see
if there's room.

481
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:03,056
- I've had it with Brenner.
- Anspaugh's Australian love child?

482
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,027
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that
nephew story's just a cover-up.

483
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,532
Brenner's not so bad. You know,
I think he has a refreshing energy.

484
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,397
And I think you've
got a man-crush.

485
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,232
Don't be ridiculous. Wha...?

486
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,033
I see the way you look at him.

487
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,266
Just because I can see
the appeal of another man...

488
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:20,774
Forget it.

489
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:25,007
Having an extra attending might make
it so you can spend time with Bettina.

490
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,518
- When's the surgery?
- I have no idea.

491
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,922
- We broke up.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

492
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,753
Please tell me you didn't
bail on your sick girlfriend?

493
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,258
No, I didn't bail. She did.

494
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,591
- I have to respect what she wants.
- She wants flowers, cupcakes.

495
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,891
Women love cupcakes.

496
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,432
- Are you listening to what I'm saying?
- Yes, I am.

497
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,094
Bettina is pushing you away
because she's afraid to depend on you.

498
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,240
If you don't see
that, you're an idiot.

499
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,739
Oh, wow. Wow.

500
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,900
Thanks, Morris.
But you know what?

501
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,103
I don't need romantic
advice from a guy...

502
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,374
whose only lasting relationship
was with an inflatable doll.

503
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,452
Cupcakes. With sprinkles.

504
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,592
Damn it.

505
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,428
What, can't you help?

506
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,432
- Me?
- Yeah, I can't reach the Zofran.

507
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:20,562
I don't know, Sam, what if someone
sees us? They might get the wrong idea.

508
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,105
Do you have to be a dick?

509
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,689
This porridge is too
hot, this is too cold.

510
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:26,301
Porridge?

511
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,275
I don't know how
to act around you.

512
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,281
I gave you a doughnut, Sam.
A doughnut. Nobody cared.

513
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,852
And you're acting like I got down
on my knee and offered you up a ring.

514
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,046
Here. Stop being so nutty.

515
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,159
Sam, we need you in here, now.

516
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,788
Oh, God, it hurts.

517
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,828
- No bleeding.
- What happened?

518
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,160
I don't know. She was
fine five minutes ago.

519
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,325
Baby just had a
decel into the 70s.

520
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,334
- You're gonna be okay.
- Shut up.

521
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,665
No, it's not. I'm not okay.

522
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,365
What's going on? She
never did this the other times.

523
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,669
- She's having contractions.
- I can see that.

524
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,940
- You think she's abrupting?
- I don't know, seems to fit.

525
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,208
- Missy?
- She's hemorrhaging in her uterus.

526
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,444
- Pulse ox, 66. ABBY:
Okay, Sam, grab some O-neg.

527
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,111
- Get the airway box, we're going up.
- Up, where?

528
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,529
She needs an O.R. now. I'll
explain it to you on the way.

529
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,522
Honey, something's really wrong.
- Squeeze in the blood.

530
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,800
- I wanna see the kids.
- I know, I know, you're gonna be okay.

531
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,300
- What's going on?
- Oh, God, I need to push.

532
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,165
No, no, no, wait.
You have to wait.

533
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,136
I can't. I need to push.

534
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,798
Hang on.

535
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,878
- Damn it.
- Everybody out now, go, go, go!

536
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,312
We're going back.
We'll deliver here.

537
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,883
- That's an arm, Abby.
- It's way out of our league.

538
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,147
There's an increased risk of
cord prolapse shoulder dystocia.

539
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,847
- We're not set up to do that.
- She's gonna bleed out.

540
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,391
- By the...
- Treatment for abruption is delivery.

541
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,258
We can do it now or wait until both
mom and baby are hypoxic or dead.

542
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,911
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, people.

543
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,535
Move out of the
way. Coming through.

544
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,272
It's rotated at a weird angle.

545
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,103
Where's OB? Kid's gonna
have a brachial plexus injury.

546
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:07,075
- Systolic's 71.
- This is taking too long.

547
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,647
- Head's the biggest part, takes time.
- Heart rate's in the hundreds.

548
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,374
- Forceps?
- No.

549
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,577
Vacuum? ABBY: No, not
yet. I mean, I don't know.

550
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,881
Put her in McRoberts.

551
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,149
- What?
- Put her legs up.

552
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,487
- What's the matter, is the baby stuck?
- I just need to turn it.

553
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,256
- Have you done this before?
- Call OB, we're screwed.

554
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,456
You're not helping.
Is that meconium?

555
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:31,000
- Does anyone know what they're doing?
- Shut up, everybody shut up.

556
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:35,265
Morris, suprapubic pressure.
Sam, get her legs back now.

557
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,238
Brenner, get ready
to bag. And Missy.

558
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,877
- Missy, next contraction, you go.
- What?

559
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,842
Okay? Okay. MISSY: Okay.

560
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,123
Down and through.

561
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,022
Head's out. That's a girl.

562
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,954
- All right, bulb suction?
- Baby had a presenting arm.

563
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,633
And you delivered in the ER?

564
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,099
Mom was bleeding out,
baby was bradycardic.

565
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,862
You did it, you did good.

566
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:09,008
I told you 13th time's
the charm, right?

567
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,644
- Well, then, nice job.
- Why, thank you.

568
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,520
Did you hear what
we just did in there?

569
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:29,053
Well, what Abby did, rather.
Gotta give credit where credit's due.

570
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,287
- What is wrong with you?
- Excuse me?

571
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,432
Are you a sociopath?
A sadist, stoned?

572
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,728
I don't understand how anyone
can give a cancer diagnosis...

573
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,700
with such a lack of sensitivity.

574
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,470
I was talking to his
nurse, not the patient.

575
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,040
You were on speakerphone.

576
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,946
And I swear, it was like you
were smiling when you said it.

577
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,911
I didn't realize
that, and I'm sorry.

578
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,882
- But what's done is done.
- No, it's not, it's not done.

579
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,181
We have to live with what
happened today and it makes me sick.

580
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,485
You know, I heard that you were
tightly wound, but I had no idea.

581
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,685
Get the hell away, before I
throw that thing against the wall.

582
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,728
What's the deal with the chopper run?
We've been suited up for 15 minutes.

583
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,929
Dispatch called,
there's a wind advisory.

584
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,099
They closed our helipad,
so they sent it to the CALP.

585
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,608
Were you planning on
telling us, or leave us hanging?

586
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,269
Maybe he likes us in yellow.

587
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,120
Well, your secret's
safe with me.

588
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,374
It better be.

589
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,743
- Okay, I gotta work now.
- Okay.

590
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,184
Saved the last one for you.

591
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,292
Frank, you are an
officer and a gentleman.

592
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,356
Thank you.

593
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,126
- Lucien.
- Skye.

594
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,102
I don't think you should
join me on the dive.

595
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,363
I shouldn't?

596
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:49,030
You don't wanna be on
the boat all day by yourself.

597
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,937
It won't be any fun.

598
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,908
You mean, it wouldn't
be any fun for you.

599
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,209
- What?
- I might get in the way.

600
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,248
Spoil your playtime
with the boys.

601
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,645
Is that it?

602
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,084
- Lucien.
- What?

603
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,488
How come I've never
met any of these boys?

604
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,789
- You're not really doing this, are you?
- Doing what?

605
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,093
Look.

606
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:20,329
I've tried to be cool with your
fluidity and your independence.

607
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,441
I've scolded myself for being
envious of your dive buddies...

608
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,238
your climbing club,
your bike team.

609
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,443
You don't need to be
jealous. They're all friends.

610
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,176
- I happen to have a lot of guy friends.
- Yeah, you do.

611
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:38,289
You do. In fact, you have a
pathologic need to solicit male affection.

612
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,753
Excuse me?

613
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:45,762
You think I don't see the game
you're playing with Brenner?

614
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,297
Forgive me for being slow.

615
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,332
- I'm finally getting it now.
- Get what?

616
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,493
The whole
love-the-one-your-with thing...

617
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,766
is nothing but a bogus justification to
screw anything that catches your eye.

618
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,715
Well...

619
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:14,523
Good. Good, you
finally figured me out.

620
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,830
And you're absolutely
right. I've done everybody.

621
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,392
Pratt, Morris, Gates.

622
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,037
Security guards, Mel,
the Roach Coach guy.

623
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,041
And I'm having a damn
good time with Simon Brenner.

624
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,205
We've worn the
varnish right off my desk.

625
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,507
You know, it's
too bad. It really is.

626
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,645
I was starting to let my
guard down with you.

627
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,088
Bought this to keep
you company on my dive.

628
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,555
- Skye.
- Gotta run.

629
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:50,218
- Scheduled a quickie with Frank.
- Wait.

630
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,670
- I thought you left.
- I'm just working on a project.

631
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,401
- I really wanted to tell you...
- Yeah, you know what?

632
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:09,446
I am really not in the mood for your
righteous disapproval right now, okay?

633
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,514
- Abby...
- I know I'm supposed to take it.

634
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,551
But not tonight. And tomorrow,
I promise, I will bend over.

635
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,221
Abby, stop.

636
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,155
Good job today. That's
all I wanted to say.

637
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,567
All right, look, I know
I've been judgmental.

638
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:34,968
I just... That I grew up surrounded
by people with problems, big problems.

639
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,467
I watched them dig
themselves into a hole...

640
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,701
and not really
try to get out of it.

641
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,211
And maybe that's
not you. I hope it isn't.

642
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,317
I'm working really hard
for that not to be me.

643
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,980
I know.

644
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,057
Sometimes it's hard for me
to be real rah-rah about it.

645
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,328
I hate rah-rah.

646
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,738
- All right, well, night.
- Night.

647
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,489
Oh, Dr. Anspaugh.

648
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,029
- Hi, Abby.
- Hi.

649
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,359
Um...

650
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,526
I know I postponed my interview
today, but that was a mistake.

651
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:42,367
I don't know why I thought I
should wait, because I shouldn't.

652
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,874
I wanna be an attending here.
And I think I would be a good one.

653
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:49,037
So I was wondering if, maybe,
you could squeeze me in tomorrow.

654
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,183
- Or the next day...
- I have a few minutes right now.

655
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,376
Come on in.

656
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,781
Honey, listen, a B in history...

657
00:35:56,955 --> 00:36:00,483
does not ruin your chances of
being appointed to the Supreme Court.

658
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,027
Yeah, listen, my doctor's
here. I gotta go, okay, honey?

659
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,960
Okay, I'll call you
later. I love you.

660
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,734
My son, Tommy, is
so hard on himself.

661
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,803
I mean, it's sad.

662
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,305
When I was 15, my greatest
ambition was to date a boy with a car.

663
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,841
Sheryl...

664
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,046
Uh-oh. What?

665
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,710
I don't know how to tell
you this, so I'll just, uh...

666
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,153
You've developed a
postoperative infection.

667
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,196
Well, I knew that. That's
why I'm on the antibiotics now.

668
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,334
Right, but now the
aortic graft is involved.

669
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:48,669
And tomorrow we're gonna
have to do a surgery to clean it out.

670
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,603
Hopefully, that
will be it, but...

671
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,716
You know, Dr. Dubenko
was gonna tell you hours ago.

672
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,443
But I felt I should do it.

673
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,547
And then I couldn't.

674
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:09,851
All day long, I've avoided
this room and I'm sorry.

675
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,959
Don't worry.

676
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,964
It's not like I had big
plans for the morning.

677
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,139
Sheryl, I've given hundreds
of patients bad news.

678
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,143
I don't know why
I'm being so crazy.

679
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,974
- Don't know why I couldn't tell you.
- Because we've become friends.

680
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,744
It's sweet.

681
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:40,085
Damn it, I don't know
why you got infected.

682
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,120
Just...

683
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:51,596
Just bad luck, you know.
Something that statistically...

684
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,499
It's okay, Neela.

685
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,505
Don't cry. Don't.

686
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:02,241
- Yeah, but you've been doing so well.
- So?

687
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,611
You go back in tomorrow,
you do what you have to do.

688
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,777
I survived a
ruptured aorta, right?

689
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,520
I mean, not such a
big thing after that.

690
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,427
I'm gonna have the
same surgeon, right?

691
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:25,960
- Definitely.
- Then I'm gonna be fine.

692
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,633
I'm gonna be just fine.

693
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,996
- Hey.
- Hi.

694
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,408
- How did it go?
- Good, good, I took the job.

695
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,911
You did?

696
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,527
You don't know how badly
I wanna tell you I'm fine.

697
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:17,362
That we can work everything
through and find a way to fix it.

698
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:23,133
- Luka, you know you don't need to...
- Or that I could forget and go on.

699
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:26,434
But too much has happened.

700
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:35,085
I have to move out.
