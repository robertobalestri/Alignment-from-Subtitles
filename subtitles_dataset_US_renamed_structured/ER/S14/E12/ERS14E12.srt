1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,869
<i>Previously, on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,338
How would you feel
about an ortho rotation?

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,105
You have a surgical elective
requirement, so now you're all mine.

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,181
- I'm Jaspreet, Neela's cousin.
- My pleasure.

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,373
- Wait.
- Excuse me.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,741
Wait, but... I'm your friend...

7
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,684
Are you really about to lecture
me on love with your track record?

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,575
- Don't.
- Because I'm thinking right now...

9
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,422
Ray is really wishing
he didn't meet you.

10
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:29,391
I need to go somewhere,
a facility with professionals.

11
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:35,867
So take Joe, go to Croatia
for your father, while I do that.

12
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:02,788
<i>Your full reinstatement,
Dr. Lockhart, has yet to be determined.</i>

13
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:06,092
<i>You'll be allowed to work
shifts on a probationary status...</i>

14
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,633
<i>until several contingencies
have been met.</i>

15
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,771
<i>Okay.</i> MURTON: <i>A
minimum of two weekly...</i>

16
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:14,705
<i>physician diversion group meetings.
Plus at least three AA meetings a week.</i>

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,377
<i>- Okay, understood.
- Random urine tests...</i>

18
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,706
<i>- several times a month.
- Whatever it takes.</i>

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,883
<i>Under normal circumstances
this committee would require you...</i>

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,010
<i>to attend another 30 meetings in
30 days, before allowing you back.</i>

21
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,555
<i>In addition to the 30
you've already attended.</i>

22
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:34,489
But because you were so forthcoming,
and volunteered to check yourself...

23
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,530
into a domestic detox facility,
we've decided to make an exception.

24
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:43,060
Dr. Pratt also asked us to make
some concessions on your behalf.

25
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,196
So effective immediately, you
are cleared to return to work.

26
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:55,142
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.
But I need a little more time.

27
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,246
My husband, Dr. Kovac,
and our son are in Croatia.

28
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,855
They've been there... I just need
to spend some time with them.

29
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,458
And I think I would be better
for it when I come back to work.

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,561
We have no problem
with that. Dr. Pratt?

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,535
It's fine by me. I can
always adjust the schedule.

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,098
- How much time do you think you need?
- Couple weeks, maybe.

33
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,037
Since we won't be able
to monitor you in Europe...

34
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,873
you understand we'll have to ask
you to start over again when you return.

35
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:30,347
Sixty meetings, 60
days, diversion group.

36
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,985
Random urine tests.

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,613
Absolutely, agreed. Thank you.

38
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,994
Jaspreet, I gotta pee.

39
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,903
Jaspreet.

40
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,377
I heard you got
in late last night.

41
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,205
Where'd you end up going?

42
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,548
Where'd you end up going?

43
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:15,460
Some club called "Le
Passage"? DJ was wicked.

44
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,396
What are you doing? I have
to pay for hot water, you know.

45
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,260
Okay, no pronator drift.

46
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,788
Mrs. Smalls, hi, I'm Dr. Gates.

47
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,956
Oh, another cute doctor.
Must be my lucky day.

48
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,929
She's been having
trouble sleeping.

49
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,698
No past medical history,
and exam was normal.

50
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,307
I haven't had a
good night in weeks.

51
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,104
You have any
belly or chest pains?

52
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,542
This is all Marty's fault.

53
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,707
He's my husband. He's the
one that keeps waking me up.

54
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:14,013
I hear him calling me in
the middle of the night.

55
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,351
So I don't quite follow. He wakes
you up while you're sleeping?

56
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,890
Yes, every night.

57
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,325
Have you considered telling
him to stop waking you up?

58
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,831
It doesn't help. Then I
just dream about him.

59
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,502
Well, is he here?
Maybe we can talk to him.

60
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,695
He's been dead for six years.

61
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,509
Don't worry, Mrs. Smalls, we're
gonna take good care of you.

62
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,839
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

63
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,047
Psych consult?

64
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,549
Yeah, check the CBC,
chem panel and UA...

65
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,984
in case she has
hypercalcemia, okay?

66
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,751
- And call Julia Dupree.
- The chaplain?

67
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,053
She's pretty hot for a chaplain.

68
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,197
She's pretty hot period.
How's that working out?

69
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,164
- I'm gonna go order these labs.
- Sam, you seen any attendings?

70
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:06,932
- Oh, my God, please make it stop.
- What the hell happened to you?

71
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,268
Bad baba ganoush.

72
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,072
I need you to sign off on our CHF-er,
and the board's getting pretty full.

73
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,738
And I need one too.

74
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,075
Why don't you go
home? You look like ass.

75
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,212
Thank you. I was home
until Skye got sick with the flu.

76
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,188
Morris, are you sick?

77
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,351
No, Frank, I got this IV because
I'm feeling a little parched.

78
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,555
- I can't get sick, I got a date.
- Food poisoning, you can't catch that.

79
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,038
Gates, gyn has a bed, but they
can't take your PID for two hours.

80
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,903
- That's what they said four hours ago.
- Don't get uppity, I just work here.

81
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,307
- Sam, what's with my chemo lady in 4?
- Still waiting for Oncology.

82
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,415
Are we the only department
working today? I need a coffee.

83
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,280
Dr. Pratt and Abby need
some privacy for a few minutes.

84
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,819
- Abby's back?
- She was in Croatia.

85
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,957
What are they doing?
What's so private?

86
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,093
If they wanted you to know,
they would have invited you.

87
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,500
Where am I gonna get my coffee?
- Jumbo Mart.

88
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,498
In fact, you should
get us all one.

89
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,793
Oh, yeah. I'll
take a large latte.

90
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,769
- Mm. Black, regular, hold the cream.
- Get me a hot tea, will you?

91
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,141
Large, no foam, per
cent latte americano.

92
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,642
- What the hell's that, Frank?
- Tell Bheru to fix Frank's regular.

93
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,474
- I don't drink coffee.
- All right.

94
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,980
If anyone needs me,
I'll be at the Jumbo Mart.

95
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,908
Freeloaders.

96
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,346
Somebody help!

97
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,151
- What happened? EDDIE: I
heard some guy beating on her.

98
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,824
I broke in and fought him off.

99
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:35,989
All right, all right.
Get a gurney in here.

100
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,425
- What's her name?
- Sally.

101
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,089
Sally. Okay, Sally,
can you hear me?

102
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,829
He hurt her bad this time.
I think her arm is broken.

103
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,599
Okay, what are people saying?

104
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,778
Well, they think you've been
in Croatia since Christmas.

105
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,379
That's it?

106
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,880
I was sure the rumor
train would been running.

107
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,178
Thank you. Well,
you know how it is.

108
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,948
One minute it's Thanksgiving,
then all of a sudden it's next year.

109
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,058
People do their own thing.

110
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,657
Mm.

111
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,963
Listen, thank you very much
for your discretion, and...

112
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,331
And I'm sorry I had to
burden you with this stuff.

113
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,495
It's not a burden,
Abby. It's management.

114
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,908
The only reason I know the whole
story is because I'm your supervisor.

115
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,404
I gotta say it. I thought
we were friends.

116
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,640
Of course we're friends, Greg.

117
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,015
Then why wouldn't you
come to me for help?

118
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,886
You know, it didn't
have to go like this.

119
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:44,430
Well, it turns out I'm not so
great at asking for help. Heh, heh.

120
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,034
Well...

121
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,730
Well, I'm here, okay?
You do know that, right?

122
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,179
Chuny and the nurses sent a
condolence card for Luka's dad.

123
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:05,080
I told them I'd call when I got
back. And I just... I hate this.

124
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,346
I'm so embarrassed and ashamed.

125
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,718
Well, you shouldn't be.

126
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,725
Really? I was a bad friend.

127
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,529
I was a bad doctor.
I was a bad wife.

128
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,101
- I was a bad mother.
- No.

129
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,068
We see bad mothers come
through here all the time.

130
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,208
And you do not qualify.

131
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:34,104
We all have flaws, Abby, but how
many of us actually work to fix them?

132
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,943
Sorry to interrupt. Victims
from a building fire are en route.

133
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,922
All right, go ahead and prep the
trauma rooms. I'll be right there.

134
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,760
- Damn, terrible day for multiples.
- What's up?

135
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,990
We're short-staffed.

136
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,101
Hey, I can work
for a couple hours.

137
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,163
Really, I'm cool. My
flight's not till tomorrow.

138
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,840
Might even feel good.

139
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:07,572
Wow, your cousin, Neela, is truly
gifted. Do I look taller? I feel taller.

140
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,739
You know, my
advice is cut and run.

141
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,750
Are you insane? Cut and
run? I'm putting this on my blog.

142
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,581
Oh, God, that's just wrong.

143
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,121
If that's wrong, I
don't wanna be right.

144
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,118
Uh-oh. Surgeons are here.

145
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,352
- Hey, what's up, party people?
- Hi, guys.

146
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,623
Neela, how's Jaspreet doing?
She hasn't called me in a few days.

147
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,768
Jaspreet? She's doing
just fine, buddy. Trust me.

148
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,528
Somebody call for a doctor?
- Hey, you.

149
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,333
- Hey, welcome back. How was Croatia?
- You know, European.

150
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,975
Sorry for your loss. - Thanks.

151
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,340
- Harms, what's it look like?
- Dexter Jackson, 11, building fire.

152
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,676
Burns to hands and chest,
crush injuries from falling debris.

153
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,011
- Tachy to 160. BP, 100.
- Dex, don't worry.

154
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,849
We're gonna get you fixed up. Morris,
to Trauma 1. Grady, you go with him.

155
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,615
What we got here?

156
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,055
Kayla Weeks, 7,
smoke inhalation.

157
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:57,061
- Minor injuries, some wheezing, sats 92.
- Having trouble breathing?

158
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,290
- Firefighter behind is pretty bad.
- Okay.

159
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,697
Get her set up on nebs,
check a baseline chest.

160
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,496
Chuny, come with me. - Yup.

161
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,571
- Zades, talk to me.
- Jake Gleason, 28.

162
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,834
Floor gave way in the fire, 15-foot fall.
Burns to hands and face, spine injury.

163
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,843
- Jake, where you hurting at, man?
- Back mostly.

164
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,504
- Sats 91.
- All right, let's get him in Trauma 2.

165
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,844
Hey, do me a favor.
Wiggle those toes for me.

166
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,349
Like that?

167
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,589
I'm sorry, I know it's last
minute, but they surprised me.

168
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,922
- Well, that was nice, right?
- Yes, from a certain point of view...

169
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,896
one's big brother and his wife
showing up unannounced is nice, yes.

170
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,059
- Not nice?
- No... Yes, it's very nice.

171
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,866
It's just that usually by dessert,
they're telling me how worried they are.

172
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,532
Because, you know, I'm wasting
my life away as a chaplain.

173
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,009
Well, if the shoe fits...

174
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,910
- Kidding. What, are they not religious?
- Hardcore Catholic.

175
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,608
He's a hedge-fund millionaire...

176
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,515
so it doesn't help that I'm
a $35,000-a-year chaplain.

177
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,020
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you scared to meet my family?

178
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,786
Who, me? No, I would love to
meet your family. It's just that...

179
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,396
You know, I just don't know
what time I'm gonna be done here.

180
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,227
Well, if you can, I could
really use some backup.

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,301
All right, I'll let you know.

182
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,430
- How's she doing?
- Out cold.

183
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,404
Sally?

184
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,407
Sally?

185
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,910
- Got a little ETOH going here, huh?
- Yeah, don't light a match.

186
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,075
And it's not just alcohol.

187
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,982
All right, we still need a head
scan. Did the plain films come in yet?

188
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,752
Uh-huh. The CT will be ready for her
in a few minutes. I already paged Ortho.

189
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,260
- Okay.
- Is she gonna be okay?

190
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,455
I think so.

191
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,432
They're always fighting over there,
man. The guy, he's a real prick.

192
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,128
It's a good thing
you were close.

193
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,603
C-spine is clear.

194
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,270
How's her arm?

195
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:54,142
Well, it's broken pretty
bad, but it's fixable.

196
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,683
You get the finger traps
ready when they take her to CT.

197
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,182
Should I wait here?

198
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,251
That's fine.

199
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,684
Oh, your head's bleeding.

200
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,456
- Hey, don't worry about it.
- Well, we should look at it.

201
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,860
It's okay, we won't bite.

202
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:28,440
All right, let me take a look.
You wanna sit down here?

203
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,680
It doesn't look too bad. We can
fix that up with a couple staples.

204
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,786
- Mm-hm.
- Sam.

205
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,716
Car accident.

206
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,361
Head-on with a drunk driver.

207
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,996
I used to be a
grade-school music teacher.

208
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,334
Now I do courses online.

209
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,902
It's kind of hard to scare the
students that way, you see.

210
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,847
- Wait, wait, this is Ortho.
- Yeah, I start today.

211
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,245
I thought that was next
week. Dubenko hates me.

212
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:08,184
- Well, Dubenko's not on. Crenshaw is.
- Yeah, great, he hates me more.

213
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,150
Neela.

214
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,317
Aah! GROSSMAN: Ohh!

215
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,323
- Just a bit outside.
- Okay?

216
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:20,195
- Ow. Look at you, you're early.
- Well, you know, first impressions.

217
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,835
- Dr. Rasgotra, meet Doctors Ramsey.
- Hey.

218
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,095
- Craig.
- How's it going?

219
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,329
- Hi.
- And Pavelich.

220
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,270
- Hey, what's up? RAMSEY:
Heard great things about you.

221
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,273
What's that?

222
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,570
This is Dr. Zelinsky,
a surgical intern.

223
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,874
You okay, man? You
need a glass of water?

224
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,018
- You look a little dry.
- No, I'm good.

225
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,676
Yeah, Harold was just leaving.

226
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,378
Good luck.

227
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,719
Hockey, I used to play a
little at school. Field, not ice.

228
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,355
- Take a shot.
- I couldn't, it's been years.

229
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,021
- Come on.
- Come on, take a shot.

230
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,689
Let's see it.

231
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:02,371
Yes. Girl power, come on. Yes.

232
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,037
First albuterol's done.
You want continuous?

233
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,409
No, sats are up to 97,
and the wheezing's better.

234
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,881
Repeat treatment in half an
hour. Is that your brother in there?

235
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,988
No, he's not my real brother,
but he's nice to me so far.

236
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,488
- Are you guys foster kids?
- Yeah.

237
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,922
Okay, you sit tight. I'm
gonna go check on him.

238
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:24,553
My name is Abby, this is Malik.
Let us know if you need anything.

239
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,599
- BP's up a little to 85.
- How's he doing?

240
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,670
- Not great, still taching away.
- Blood in the belly?

241
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,967
No free blood, but look at the liver.
- Subscapular hematoma.

242
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,406
Films are back.

243
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,474
- How's Luka holding up?
- You know, it's hard.

244
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,776
- My dad died when I was 19.
- At least, you're back in the States.

245
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,853
Always nice to come
home after a long trip, huh?

246
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,855
- Okay, C-spine looks clear.
- Nothing on the chest or pelvis.

247
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,085
- Kids' foster mom is here.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

248
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,754
We were in the laundry room when
the fire broke out. Are they okay?

249
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,423
Kayla has some smoke
inhalation, she's gonna be fine.

250
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,366
Dexter's more serious. He's
got bleeding around his liver.

251
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,130
It's probably stupid's fault.

252
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,850
You leave the oven on again?

253
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,174
Keisha, I told you,
stop calling her that.

254
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,677
You got a phone? I need to
get somebody to cover my shift.

255
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,178
Right there. Dial 9 first.

256
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,045
- Pratt could use a hand in here.
- I'll go.

257
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:24,350
Solu-Medrol, 2.4 grams over 15 minutes,
then infuse at 430 milligrams per hour.

258
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,289
Somebody page Neurosurge.
Can you get central line going?

259
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,980
- Good. MARQUEZ:
Nice to have you back.

260
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,460
We missed you. How's Luka?

261
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,895
He's good. Sterile 6's, please.

262
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,693
- Neurosurgery's on the way.
- Good.

263
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,031
If you're gonna have a funeral,
Croatia's a good place to do it.

264
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,002
- How is he?
- Fracture at T11.

265
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,873
T11, what's that mean?

266
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,670
Well, it looks like you've
got a fractured vertebrae...

267
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,540
with bruises of the spinal cord.

268
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,477
Will it get better? I'm not
gonna be paralyzed, am I?

269
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,809
It's just a little too
early to tell right now.

270
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,514
- Those kids I saved, are they okay?
- So far, so good.

271
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,249
If that girl hadn't broken
that window and screamed...

272
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,917
- we wouldn't know they were in there.
- Damn it!

273
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,562
All right, go, just go, go.

274
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,858
- Okay, prep and drape, I'll be right back.
- All right.

275
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,592
Another 600 cc bolus.

276
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,499
- Hemoglobin's down to 12.4, BP, 70.
- Type and cross two more units.

277
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,033
See what you did, stupid?
- Keisha.

278
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,370
- I didn't leave the oven on.
- Liar, you know...

279
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,774
- Stop.
- Dexter's gonna die and it's your fault.

280
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,211
I hate you.

281
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,209
Kayla, wait.

282
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,555
Kayla.

283
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,593
Oh, my God, are you okay, honey?

284
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,728
Okay, come here,
sweetie. Are you okay?

285
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:39,059
It's not my fault. I
didn't leave the oven on.

286
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,860
I didn't.

287
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,741
How many fingers
am I holding up?

288
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,841
- Um, three?
- Okay, what about here?

289
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,248
No, sorry. Two.

290
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,321
Can you follow my finger?

291
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,854
Okay.

292
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:17,295
- How long have your eyes been like that?
- I don't know. Forever.

293
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,500
You ever seen a doctor for it?

294
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,541
No, I keep it a secret
so people won't hate me.

295
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,474
Sweetheart, nobody hates you.

296
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,710
All my foster families do.
That's why I keep getting moved.

297
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,385
Listen to me, grownups can
be really weird sometimes.

298
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,020
It may seem like
they don't like you...

299
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,591
but that's probably
because they're really busy...

300
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,489
or they're sad, or they're mad.

301
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,826
But I guarantee you, it's not
about you. You understand?

302
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,194
And for what it's
worth, I like you.

303
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,439
I left the oven on once, but I
turned it off all the way this time.

304
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,700
I know I did.

305
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,842
Ortho's here.

306
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,052
Hey, Mayday. NEELA: Hey.

307
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,182
Since when are you Ortho?
- This morning.

308
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,717
You guys mind if maybe we
catch up later? I can see some films.

309
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,515
- Here you go.
- Who are these guys?

310
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,091
Orthopedic specialists,
here to look at her arm.

311
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,127
What ligaments are disrupted
in a perilunate dislocation?

312
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,094
Scapholunate and the
lunotriquetral interosseous ligament.

313
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,858
And?

314
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,434
- Back from X-ray?
- Never went, sats are dropping.

315
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,937
- Down to 91.
- Tube him before he goes to CT.

316
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,699
- Grady, you're up.
- Is he okay?

317
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,208
He might have smoke damage to his
lungs. We're gonna help him breathe.

318
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,437
Suction please.

319
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,912
You know anything about
Kayla's vision problems?

320
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,746
- Vision problems? No.
- Cricoid pressure.

321
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,081
She's only been with
me for a couple of weeks.

322
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,984
That explains a
lot. She's clumsy.

323
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,057
- You see the cords?
- Yup.

324
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,217
Now why would they
send me a disabled kid?

325
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:51,364
They should know better
that I can't handle that.

326
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,264
I'm a single foster mom,
and I got five of them.

327
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,164
- I'm in.
- I don't think they knew.

328
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,238
She's been keeping this to herself.
- Sats are up, 96.

329
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,488
I'd like to run a few
tests if that's okay.

330
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:03,308
Surgery's here.

331
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,935
- What do you need us to fix?
- Twenty-five percent surface area burns.

332
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,480
Crush injury with liver
hematoma on FAST scan.

333
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,311
- Pressure's down.
- What's happening?

334
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,578
Following the Parkland
formula? Four cc's...

335
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,982
Yes, we know.

336
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,114
Hematoma could be
expanding. Let's look.

337
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,749
Throw in a central line. I
want his BP up before CT.

338
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,018
Intraosseous is faster.

339
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,753
No, I can give more
fluids with a central line.

340
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,158
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hey.

341
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,601
Oh, and I am in before
you even gloved up.

342
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,433
All right, let's
get him up to CT.

343
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,640
Squeeze in another few liters,
and you should go with them.

344
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,801
Let's just follow them.

345
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,339
- I hate surgeons. ABBY:
Seems like it's mutual.

346
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,677
- How you feeling?
- Like hell.

347
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,845
Morris, have you ever heard of
a genetic disorder called LCA?

348
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,153
- No, but it's just food poisoning...
- Not you. The little girl from the fire.

349
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:58,320
Leber's congenital amaurosis. It
causes center-field vision loss in kids.

350
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:02,696
And she had a normal fundoscopic
exam and nystagmus, which are indicators.

351
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,963
I've never heard of it. Send
her to Optho, let them sort it out.

352
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,698
Can somebody please give
me a shot? I'm dying here.

353
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,140
- What is it, Compazine?
- Yeah, I've been puking my brains out.

354
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,679
What are you doing?
I'll do the arm, no butts.

355
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,579
- Well, it hurts way more in the arm.
- No. Here.

356
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:24,088
Come on, be a professional.
All right, Abby, make it quick.

357
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,856
Right cheek or left?

358
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,230
Okay, exaggerate the
deformity slightly, and then pull.

359
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,769
- Ow! What the...?
- Not bad. Splint.

360
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,600
Want a sugar tong extended
to the ends of the phalanges?

361
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,834
- Thanks, hon.
- Or Sam.

362
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,376
Post-reduction films,
get her on the surgery list.

363
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,104
Stabilize the wrist.

364
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,181
You think I can go home soon?

365
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,046
I wanna get a tetanus shot
for that head lac first, okay?

366
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,189
Hey, how long is that
gonna take? I should go.

367
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,018
Just hang out, we'll take
care of you soon, okay?

368
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,460
- Wow, what happened to that guy?
- Car accident.

369
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,893
- You did great.
- I did?

370
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,862
Hi, stranger, we
heard you were back.

371
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,398
Hi. SAM: Hi.

372
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,967
What's up? GATES: Nothing.

373
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,367
- Hi.
- Hi.

374
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,034
How are you? ABBY: Good.

375
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,737
Been gone long, we didn't
know if you were coming back.

376
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,403
- Where were you?
- I was taking some private time to...

377
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,812
- Personal time... Who are you?
- Barry Grossman, Orthopedics.

378
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,010
Hi, Abby Lockhart.
So you're up in Ortho?

379
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,917
- Yeah.
- That's great.

380
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,286
How was Croatia?
I hear it's gorgeous.

381
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,897
- Yeah, well... Yeah, I'm going tomorrow.
- Oh, you mean you didn't go?

382
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:42,592
No, Joe and Luka are there, but I
had some stuff I had to take care of, so...

383
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,594
Okay.

384
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,240
Sorry to break up the
little reunion, but we gotta...

385
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,171
- Hey, I'm gonna call you tonight, okay?
- Okay.

386
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:55,007
- I'm gonna go work on that splint.
- Cool, I'll meet you there.

387
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,672
- Good to see you.
- Welcome back.

388
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,317
Thanks.

389
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,281
Then the rabbi
says to the priest:

390
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,755
"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't
know you were sitting here."

391
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,760
That's hilarious. I've
never heard that one before.

392
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,832
- Hi, looks like you guys are having fun.
- Oh, she's delightful.

393
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,491
Well, your labs came
back normal, which is good.

394
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,662
There's gonna be another doctor
to come talk to you soon, okay?

395
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,298
Take your time. I
got nowhere to be.

396
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,943
- You mind if I borrow her for a sec?
- Go ahead.

397
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,103
I'll be right back.

398
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,176
Thanks for coming. I thought a
little God talk would do her good.

399
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,614
She's actually an atheist.

400
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,346
But did you know she was
a Rockette back in the '50s?

401
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,013
That's how she met her husband.

402
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,887
He came to the show and
hung out at the stage entrance...

403
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,493
just so he could meet her.

404
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:46,189
He said of the whole line of beautiful
girls, she was the only one he saw.

405
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,700
So no prayers, no meditation,
just shooting the breeze?

406
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,641
She's alone and grieving. And
no matter what you believe in...

407
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:59,040
even if it's nothing, grief
is something I'm good with.

408
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,476
Dinner's at
Gibson's, by the way.

409
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:06,312
- If that sweetens the deal.
- Doesn't hurt.

410
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,646
- See you later.
- Okay.

411
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,584
Could you page
Psych for me again?

412
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:15,159
- What you mean, she wasn't in Croatia?
- Luka and Joe went without her.

413
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,819
- Where's she been?
- Said she had some personal stuff.

414
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,694
Sounds like divorce talk to me.
- No, you think? Really?

415
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,358
I knew it all along.
Just a matter of time.

416
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,197
Guys.

417
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,566
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

418
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,733
- Yeah, it's all good.
- You bet.

419
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,506
- Optho returned your call.
- Thanks, Frank.

420
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,014
- Watch his IV.
- His IV's flowing.

421
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,584
Trauma 1 is ready.

422
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,058
- Hang packed cells now.
- What happened?

423
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,955
Crashed before
we could scan him.

424
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,254
- What's he mean?
- Rapid infuser's primed.

425
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,261
He's bleeding internally.

426
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,424
He needs an ex-lap. He
probably opened up his hematoma.

427
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,263
- We need more access.
- BP's 82/58.

428
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,268
Hold on, maybe
it's a pelvic fracture.

429
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,239
- You didn't see one.
- It's a tough call on kids.

430
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:05,708
The symphysis is wide, there's
a separation and S-I diastasis.

431
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:08,473
We don't have time to
argue a questionable finding.

432
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,981
- He could be bleeding in his pelvis.
- Liver's the most likely source.

433
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,653
Open his belly and it's
a fracture, he'll bleed out.

434
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,812
- So we just screw around?
- Keep looking.

435
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,254
Show me free fluid, and
you can do your ex-lap.

436
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,725
- T-pod him and fuse two units.
- We need to take him up now.

437
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:28,066
All right, just give her two minutes.
You know how this goes if you're wrong.

438
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,730
This should tamponade
any pelvic bleeders.

439
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,069
Liver hematoma's
enlarging. Kid needs the O.R.

440
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,541
- It's not that impressive.
- Two minutes are up.

441
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,840
- How much blood has he had?
- Twenty per kilo.

442
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,848
- Okay, let's get this show on the road.
- Wait, hold on.

443
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,042
Pressure's good, 100/60.

444
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,421
- Hemoglobin's up to 14.
- You see any free fluid in the belly?

445
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,592
- I suppose surgery can wait a bit.
- What's going on?

446
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,422
We stopped the bleeding.

447
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,860
Okay, stable. Take him up to CT.

448
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,899
- What are you doing out here?
- What's the deal with my tetanus shot?

449
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,404
No one's come for that yet? Man,
I'm sorry, we're really slammed.

450
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:12,409
Why don't you go lay down on one of
the beds. You'll be more comfortable.

451
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,877
She's been mumbling.

452
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,182
I thought she might wake up.

453
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,414
I'm definitely not the first
thing that she wants to see.

454
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:25,285
Oh, I'm guessing she won't
mind. You saved her life, man.

455
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:32,559
One night I found her in the
hall, passed out and drunk.

456
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:36,725
So I went in and I fished
the keys out of her purse.

457
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,195
I couldn't just leave her there.

458
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,069
But when I brought her inside,
she woke up and she freaked out.

459
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,742
Yeah. Good times.

460
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,986
I'll go check on your tetanus,
all right? Hang in there.

461
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,285
Hey, man, listen very
carefully, all right?

462
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,760
I don't care how backed
up you are, just fix it.

463
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,957
Thank you, I'm glad somebody
finally gave it to Radiology.

464
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,592
I was on the phone with my landlord.
My toilet's been running for weeks.

465
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,070
Dr. Gates, daughter of your
patient in 2 returned your call.

466
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,800
- Did Psych come down for her yet?
- Not that I know of.

467
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,945
- Check on my tetanus guy, please?
- Sure.

468
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,637
Thank you.

469
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,087
Oh, my God, pinch me, I'm dreaming.
Yes, gentlemen, may I help you?

470
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,521
- We're looking for Dr. Pratt.
- That's me.

471
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,092
- You must be here for Jake Gleason.
- He all right?

472
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,856
He's still in surgery
but I'll take you guys up.

473
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,468
- I can do that, Dr. Pratt.
- Yeah, thanks Javier, but I got this.

474
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,535
Come on, fellas.

475
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:51,106
We need to do a test
called an electroretinogram...

476
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,179
which tells us if the cells in
the retina respond to light.

477
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,545
If it is this LCA
thing, what then?

478
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,776
We'll know what we're
dealing with for one.

479
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,946
And there are some new
therapies that could help.

480
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,992
- You just need to sign here for consent.
- Okay.

481
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,959
And they can actually
take her today if you want.

482
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,796
Dexter's up in surgery.
Shouldn't I be up there?

483
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,829
Okay, how about this? On the
way up, we drop you off at the O.R...

484
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,803
and I go with
Kayla for her test.

485
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:23,840
You okay with that?

486
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,512
Yeah, she can come with me.

487
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,350
Where the hell is the rest of my stuff?
- Get back in bed.

488
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,320
- Who are you?
- Dr. Gates. You have a serious fracture.

489
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,049
- Whatever.
- You need surgery.

490
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,559
Shut up. Will you just take
this off, so I can go home?

491
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,563
- Who stole my shoe?
- If you don't keep this immobilized...

492
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,793
- it's not gonna heal right.
- Take it off.

493
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,397
- Wanna sign out against medical advice?
- Right, I'm not letting you touch me.

494
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,235
Fine by me, I'll
get the paperwork.

495
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,436
You walk out that door, you're gonna
lose the use of your hand. Want that?

496
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,706
- What?
- Just get back in bed, okay?

497
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,611
Let us do our job.

498
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,115
- Do you know what happened to you?
- I don't know.

499
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,118
You got beat up, and your
neighbor, Eddie, intervened.

500
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:13,087
You mean, the freak? He
should mind his own business.

501
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,693
Oh, yeah. Well, he
saved your ass, okay?

502
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,353
He's got a pretty nasty
cut on his head to prove it.

503
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,694
How long's this gonna
take anyways, huh?

504
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,869
Does the posterior
technique have a name?

505
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,198
- The Kocher approach.
- And who was Kocher?

506
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,637
A 19th century Swiss surgeon,
perhaps the most famous in his day.

507
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,310
Published <i>Kocher's
Operative Surgery,</i> 1892...

508
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,414
won the Nobel prize
in Medicine in 1909.

509
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,813
- She Nobel prized you, bro.
- It's not funny.

510
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:42,216
Oh come on, give it up. She's
money. You're money. Ignore him.

511
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,356
Dude, give her some.

512
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,392
- I need some too.
- Oh, no.

513
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,255
- What?
- Wendy can't play next week.

514
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,159
Out-of-town baby shower.

515
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,594
What position did you play?

516
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,633
- Sorry?
- Field hockey, what position?

517
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,966
Center forward.

518
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,905
We're squared away with your tetanus.
We'll get you signed out, you can split.

519
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,341
- Did she finally wake up?
- Yeah, just a bit ago.

520
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,811
And her CT was clear,
so she's gonna be fine.

521
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,411
She say anything
about what happened?

522
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,987
- No, but she was pretty out of it.
- Dr. Gates?

523
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:21,957
- Not now, Grady, I'm busy.
- It's important. Like, urgent important.

524
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,426
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

525
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,664
Stay.

526
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,858
- What?
- It's Mrs. Smalls in 2.

527
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:33,472
- Psych not come down yet?
- No, that's not really a problem now.

528
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,000
I found her pulseless and apneic.
She's got rigor mortis and lividity.

529
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:43,444
- She must have died like, an hour ago.
- Didn't anyone come and check on her?

530
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,716
We were waiting for Psych.

531
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,053
- You doing okay, kiddo?
- Yeah.

532
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,290
You know, if it is LCA, it
might be worth a write up.

533
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:01,322
- We could co-author.
- That's okay, it's all you.

534
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,366
- It doesn't hurt at all.
- See? Told you.

535
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:09,467
All right, now move your forehead
right up to the dome and touch it.

536
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,735
Good, right there.

537
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,250
It will just take a
minute to calibrate.

538
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,549
What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

539
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,747
- A doctor and a singer.
- Wow, both, huh?

540
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:28,592
Well, I can't help you with
the singing. I'm really bad.

541
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,696
- I'm pretty good.
- Why don't you sing me a song?

542
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:39,333
<i>I am beautiful No
matter what they say</i>

543
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,638
<i>Words can't bring me down</i>

544
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:51,046
<i>I am beautiful In
every single way</i>

545
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,918
<i>Yes, words can't bring me down</i>

546
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,246
<i>Oh, no</i>

547
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:03,219
<i>So don't you bring me down today</i>

548
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,199
Gates, heard you killed
another happy customer today.

549
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,269
That's nice, Frank, great.

550
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,565
Psych just came down to see
her. Said they'd meet you in Sutures.

551
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,175
Somebody's got a
lot of explaining to do.

552
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,540
- Can you sign off on our GI bleeder?
- I need one for my chemo lady.

553
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,912
All right. SAM: How are you?

554
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,675
I'm good.

555
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:28,582
I just wanted to say if you need
to talk or anything, I'm totally here.

556
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,223
I just wanna make sure
that everything's okay.

557
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,586
It's good, I'm good. Thanks.

558
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,422
The bone fragment was
removed from his spine.

559
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,359
Surgery was successful.

560
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,022
He's already started
moving his legs. It's all good.

561
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,135
- Thank you for everything, Ms. Dupree.
- My pleasure.

562
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:48,273
You know, I'll make sure the chapel
stays open for your guys all night.

563
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,706
Oh, hey, excuse me. Hi, I'm
Dr. Lockhart, I worked on Jake.

564
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,108
- That's really good news about him.
- Thank you.

565
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,942
- We appreciate everything you did.
- You're very welcome.

566
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,313
Listen, do you, by any chance,
know how that fire got started?

567
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,354
Ms. Rosemary Smalls,
what happened to her?

568
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:09,118
- We don't know.
- All right, then. Love the easy ones.

569
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,294
Have a good night.

570
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:20,064
Okay, great, thanks. Good news,
Dexter's surgery went very well.

571
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,503
- He's in Recovery right now.
- Thank God.

572
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,939
Malik can take you there
as soon as we're done.

573
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,172
So there's no treatment
for this LAC thing?

574
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,476
It's "LCA." Leber's
congenital amaurosis.

575
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,621
Sorry, this day has
just... It's been a lot.

576
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,085
I know.

577
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,986
Well, there may be some
gene-replacement therapies...

578
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,458
or clinical studies
we can enroll her in.

579
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,431
You know, this is
manageable. There is hope.

580
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:54,039
There's no reason why she can't
be a perfectly happy kid with a full life.

581
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,107
You can do all those
tests right here?

582
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,800
- No, there's an organization in Iowa...
- Iowa?

583
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,970
Yeah, but we just have to
send them a tube of her blood.

584
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,446
And all the tests
are free of charge.

585
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:07,051
Okay, baby girl, let's
go ahead and do this.

586
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,120
Oh, and...

587
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,555
I talked to the fireman
and he told me...

588
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,720
there was an electrical problem on
the second floor that started the fire.

589
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,660
It had nothing to
do with your oven.

590
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,559
So she didn't do it?

591
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,201
You got something to say?

592
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,473
Keisha.

593
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,843
- I'm sorry.
- But don't call me stupid anymore, okay?

594
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,578
Don't worry, baby, she won't.

595
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:47,156
Kayla, it was really
great to meet you.

596
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,227
- You take care, okay?
- Okay.

597
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,699
So how long will I
have to stay here, huh?

598
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,894
Surgeons will answer all your
questions when you get upstairs.

599
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,006
- A day? Two days? A week?
- We don't know, Sally.

600
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,870
- I got a life, you know.
- Could have fooled me.

601
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,844
- What did you say?
You... EDDIE: Excuse me.

602
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,574
How do I get out of this
place? This place is like a maze.

603
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,582
Just take those
doors back there if...

604
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,414
Hey, it's you.

605
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,883
Hi.

606
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,752
What, you can't look at me?

607
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,421
Take off your hood.

608
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:44,580
Thank you, for what you did.

609
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,448
You're welcome.

610
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:51,919
See you around.

611
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,123
You can just go out
through those doors.

612
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,326
Thank you. Take care.

613
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,400
Bye, Eddie.

614
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,314
- Poor guy.
- Yeah, it must be tough.

615
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,346
Hey, Alex is in town.
We're gonna go see a movie.

616
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,749
You and Sarah wanna come?

617
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,016
Can we go another
time? I have this thing...

618
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,591
- Yeah, anytime.
- Yeah?

619
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,319
- Okay. You sure?
- Okay. Mm-hm.

620
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,761
Go.

621
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,165
- Come on, go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.

622
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,136
Come on, here we go. - Come on.

623
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,333
Bring it, bring it, bring it.
- Go, go, go.

624
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,771
Whoa!

625
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,674
- Oh, yeah.
- Five seconds.

626
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:52,008
- What are you doing here?
- I came to say goodbye.

627
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,278
- What's with the skates?
- Oh, long story. Where are you going?

628
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,218
I'm gonna see Cousin
Maya in San Francisco.

629
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,949
My father's coming to Chicago.

630
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:04,654
- I need to skip town before he gets here.
- And what do you want me to tell him?

631
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:09,528
Tell him I've completely disappeared,
and you have no idea where I went.

632
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,732
Okay, I'll call him.

633
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,073
First, I need you to do
me a really big favor.

634
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:19,211
Rasgotra, practice is Wednesdays
at 6. Game is Thursday at 7.

635
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,836
We'll be at Ike's if you wanna
join us. Hey, congratulations.

636
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,038
Night.

637
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,682
Congratulations? Did
you win something?

638
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:32,017
No, I think I just got recruited.
So, what's this big favor?

639
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,489
Starting tomorrow, docs
will not be permitted...

640
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,219
to ask a nurse or a
clerk to call a consultant.

641
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,829
It has to be a written order.

642
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,932
- More work for Frank.
- Me too.

643
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,260
Why? What if we're in
the middle of a trauma?

644
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,494
It's just for a month.

645
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:49,164
We have to present real data to
Admin if we wanna eliminate delays.

646
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,201
Unless anybody has anything else
to say, come on, let's get back to work.

647
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:57,873
Oh, yeah, hey, can I have
a minute? With everybody?

648
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,949
Um, I know some of
you have been wondering.

649
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,251
And I appreciate the concern.

650
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,295
I wasn't in Croatia
for the last few weeks.

651
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:14,228
After Luka's father
died, they left without me.

652
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:19,861
And I was in a
residential detox facility.

653
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,530
I'm an alcoholic.

654
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,772
I just wanted to set the record
straight and tell the truth...

655
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,249
because I have way too much
respect for all of you to keep lying.

656
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:38,948
And I'm very, very sorry because I
know what I did didn't only affect me...

657
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,787
it affected all of you too.

658
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,727
And I just hope I haven't
done any irreparable damage...

659
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,093
to any of the
relationships here.

660
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,134
But I'm sober now, and
I'm going to stay that way.

661
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:58,267
- So you were in rehab the whole time?
- Yeah.

662
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,504
Were you ever drunk at work?

663
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,416
Let's get signed out and
get back out on the floor.

664
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,781
- We still got a lot of patients out there.
- Thanks.

665
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,490
<i>Thank you.</i>

666
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,767
I told her daughter
she was fine.

667
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,305
I worked her up,
everything seemed normal.

668
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,500
Did you do everything
you were supposed to?

669
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,645
Proper history, labs?

670
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:38,011
I could have done an EKG.
You know, cardiac monitor.

671
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:41,483
Maybe I missed
an MI, arrhythmia.

672
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,885
I'd be worried about you if you
weren't upset about Mrs. Smalls...

673
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:49,050
but I think it's pretty obvious
what the cause of death was.

674
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,560
She missed her husband,
and she wanted to be with him.

675
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:57,202
- You're kidding me, right?
- No, I think she was a pretty lucky lady.

676
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,996
Julia, she died.

677
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,801
She had a beautiful daughter. She
had a full life filled with happiness.

678
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,876
And she found true love.

679
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,639
Some people live their
whole lives and never get that.

680
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:12,272
How else do you explain her
husband calling her from the other side?

681
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,011
And you really believe that?

682
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,811
Yeah, I do.

683
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,155
That's because I have faith.

684
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,855
- Faith.
- Yes.

685
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,988
Look, we all end up
like Rosemary Smalls.

686
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,430
Who knows when? Who knows how?

687
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:36,735
But love, trust, truth, higher
power, the things that really matter...

688
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,844
you can't have any
of those without faith.

689
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,242
Especially love.

690
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,440
Now, we are losing precious
pre-dinner drink time...

691
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,713
and I need at least two
martinis to deal with my brother.

692
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:53,723
So come on. Come on, come on.

693
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,353
- Some meeting, huh?
- Yeah, some meeting.

694
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,296
Admit to Med-Surg for IV antibiotics.
Where are diverticula most likely to be?

695
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:06,131
Narrowest portion with the highest
intrasegmental pressures: sigmoid colon.

696
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,536
- Excellent work, Harold.
- All right, you, you, come here.

697
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,479
All right, so here's the deal.

698
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,973
Jaspreet's gone, and
she's not coming back.

699
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,584
- Where'd she go?
- Well, I could tell you that...

700
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,483
but then I'd have to kill you.

701
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:27,649
She asked me to relay the following:
Archie, thank you for a wonderful night.

702
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:31,626
It was great, but please stop
calling. And don't ever call again, ever.

703
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,824
Harold, thank you for a wonderful night.
It was great, but please stop calling.

704
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,993
And don't ever call again, ever.

705
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,934
So there you go.

706
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:46,507
And I'd very much appreciate it if
we never speak of this again, ever.

707
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,110
- You?
- You?

708
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,915
- Abby.
- Hi.

709
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,189
Hey, how was
your first day back?

710
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,028
- How's Ortho?
- Great.

711
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,366
I heard about the staff meeting.

712
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,695
Yeah, that was fun.

713
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,602
It's good you said all that.

714
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,474
- Listen, I owe you an apology.
- No, you don't.

715
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,307
I do.

716
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,013
You tried to help me and
I just pushed you away.

717
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,175
And you don't deserve that.

718
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,853
I'm still here if you
need help, you know.

719
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,218
Thank you.

720
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:37,689
- God, you had me so worried.
- I know, I'm sorry.

721
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:42,698
- It's so great to have you back.
- Yup, just in time to leave again.

722
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,534
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow morning.

723
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,298
I can't wait. I miss Joe
and Luka like crazy.

724
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:52,843
- Well, give them my best. Travel safe.
- Thanks.

725
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,172
- Okay.
- All right.

726
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,847
Bye. ABBY: See you.
